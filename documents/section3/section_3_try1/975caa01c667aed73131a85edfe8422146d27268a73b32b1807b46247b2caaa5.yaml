    Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized how we live and work by connecting
    everyday devices to the Internet. As the demand for IoT devices grows, a reliable
    and efficient communication infrastructure to support these devices has become
    crucial. Cellular IoT (CIoT) has emerged as a promising solution to this challenge,

    This paper presents a comprehensive overview of CIoT technology in response to
    the growing demand for IoT applications with low latency, high coverage, low power
    consumption, high device connection, and low cost. The four major CIoT technologies
    standardized by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) organization are
    investigated, including extended coverage global system for mobile communications
    IoT (EC-GSM-IoT), long-term evolution for machine-type communications (LTE-M),
    narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), and recently, new radio reduced capability (NR-RedCap).
    These technologies are analyzed regarding their fundamental focuses, features,
    use cases, requirements, and future work. In addition, we provide a comparative

    communicationsMobile networks 1. Introduction The cellular Internet of Things
    (CIoT) refers to using cellular networks, such as fourth and fifth-generation
    (4G and 5G) networks, to connect IoT devices to the Internet. These devices can
    range from simple to complex, from smart thermostats and surveillance cameras
    to agricultural monitoring systems. The concept of CIoT is derived from an interest
    in a wide coverage area, massive connectivity, security, trustworthiness, ultralow
    latency, throughput, and ultra-reliability. One of the main benefits of using
    cellular networks for the IoT is their wide coverage area and ability to connect
    to the Internet, even in remote or hard-to-reach locations. Compared to other
    types of wireless networks, cellular networks typically offer greater reliability
    and lower latency, making them ideal for applications that require real-time data
    transfers or remote control [1]. Moreover, because many IoT applications are mission
    critical and demand more than 99.99% reliability with less than 1 ms end-to-end
    latency, cellular connectivity is considered the most appropriate option because
    it has access to the licensed spectrum, ensuring the security and reliability
    of the communication service [2]. Due to their global and standardized nature,
    cellular technology is required for the connection of billions of devices in IoT
    applications. The cellular network offers a variety of attributes that makes it
    a good choice for various IoT applications, including good quality of service
    (QoS) and experience (QoE), the ability to support mobility and service-level
    agreements, fast data rates, and worldwide coverage [1]. To support massive connectivity,
    the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) organization has standardized
    three new types of technology: the extended coverage (EC) global system for mobile
    communications (GSM) IoT (EC-GSM-IoT), long-term evolution (LTE) for machine-type
    communications (LTE-M), and narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), known as the CIoT, since
    Release (Rel.) 13. Additionally, Rel. 17 introduced the fourth category of CIoT
    technology, called reduced capability (RedCap) new radio (NR), which is specifically
    designed to offer cellular services to a vast number of IoT devices planned for
    use in the 5G licensed spectrum [3]. The improvements made by 3GPP from Rel. 13
    [4] to 15 [5] are on their baseline deployment; however, since Rel. 16, LTE-M
    and the NB-IoT can share the 5G NR channels with 5G devices. 3GPP is working on
    a technology that assures better coverage for a large number of inexpensive, low-throughput
    devices with low power consumption in applications that can tolerate delays. The
    CIoT is being applied as a new approach to global connectivity and remote device
    management. Moreover, given the enhanced data rate and capacity, 5G networks are
    expected to drive numerous IoT connections. Thus, cellular networks should be
    optimized to support low-power and low-data-rate use cases to satisfy IoT demands
    [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Machine-type communication (MTC) applications can be
    delay-tolerant (tolerate low data rates and longer latencies, e.g., utility meters)
    or delay-sensitive (cannot tolerate low data rates and longer latencies, e.g.,
    remote robotics surgery), certain applications, such as smart cities, fall in
    the middle of these two opposite ends. Considering these categories, as per Ericsson’s
    mobility report [11], by 2023, 3.5 billion CIoT connections are expected to be
    deployed, and by 2026 [12], the NB-IoT and LTE-M are expected to comprise 45%
    of all CIoT connections. Consequently, research has been conducted to provide
    a review of the CIoT with various scopes and themes, as detailed in the subsequent
    section (Section 2). However, the existing studies have covered only a subset
    of the CIoT technology or were limited to a specific focus area. Table 1. Definitions

    Fig. 1. Paper organization. 2. Related work Since the introduction of the CIoT,
    various research has been conducted from different perspectives to provide an
    overview of the related use cases, key enablers, and challenges. A comparative
    study [13] evaluated the NB-IoT against other technology regarding latency, QoS,
    battery lifetime, capacity, and cost, applying some application scenarios. In
    other studies [14], [15], authors have analyzed the indoor coverage, low power
    consumption, latency insensitivity, and massive connection support of NB-IoT-targeted
    technical features, such as resource allocation, energy-efficiency techniques,
    and latency-energy performance evaluations. In addition, some applications, such
    as smart agriculture and smart health, have been analyzed with future research
    directions. In [16], the authors detailed and analyzed possible security attacks
    on NB-IoT-enabled devices and proposed various approaches and techniques for smart
    home and smart healthcare applications. Standardization efforts employed on the
    security aspects of the NB-IoT and security requirements of IoT applications with
    an extensible combination of the NB-IoT to the 5G are addressed in [17]. In [18],
    basic factors, such as the modulation scheme selection and channel coding that
    affect the energy consumption of the NB-IoT from the perspective of resource management,
    were analyzed and synthesized, and future work suggestions were offered. In [19],
    the physical layer, specifically the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE)
    of the NB-IoT system, was presented in detail, exploring the radio resource control
    (RRC) and medium access control (MAC) layers in the physical design of channels
    as well. In [20], the power consumption and communication range of self-powered
    NB-IoT in remote monitoring applications were evaluated. However, these studies
    [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20] considered only the NB-IoT technology
    in the CIoT. The authors of [21] focused on integrating low-power wide-area network
    (LPWA) technology to preserve an affordable low-battery device and a wide geographical
    area while enhancing power consumption and providing future research directions.
    In [22], channel control procedures and massive MTC (mMTC) standard guidelines
    with NB-IoT and LTE-M features, including wide coverage, low power consumption,
    and massive connectivity, were explored along with future challenges and innovative
    ideas. A comparative study on the performance of CIoT technology was conducted
    in [23], focusing primarily on the NB-IoT and LTE-M. Coverage (i.e., coverage
    enhancements (CEs)), power consumption, module cost, connection count (i.e., number
    of connections per cell), supported features (i.e., voice support), and service
    modes have been compared. In [24], the authors provided comprehensive guidance
    on the IoT localization methods of NB-IoT and LTE-M devices, which is vital for
    ultra-dense devices that result in IoT positioning problems. Power consumption
    is the primary concern in IoT applications. Hence, improving battery life and
    message latency is essential, especially in rare data transmission cases, because
    it has a large signaling overhead in LTE-M and the NB-IoT due to the process of
    establishing a connection. In [25], the authors clarified early data transmission
    (EDT) mechanisms introduced by 3GPP to transmit data during the random-access
    procedure (triggers the connection to a cell) to enhance the power efficiency
    of the device and minimize message delay, which is vital in a wide coverage scenario.
    The authors of [26] evaluated mMTC features and QoS provisioning issues with critical
    enablers for mMTC in cellular networks. A detailed overview is presented on the
    channel access mechanisms and radio access network (RAN) congestion problems in
    the NB-IoT and LTE-M with machine learning (Q-learning approach) solutions for
    congestion relief, including future research directions. However, these surveys
    [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26] reviewed only the NB-IoT and LTE-M. In [7],
    the authors investigated EC-GSM-IoT, NB-IoT, and LTE-M as licensed LPWA technologies,
    focusing on their low power consumption, low data rate, and broad coverage area
    features. Their study had a limited scope and aimed to facilitate LPWAN-5G integration
    to support a more extensive range of industrial applications, including process
    control and high data-rate multimedia applications. The authors of [27] compared
    the cost of EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT in urban and rural deployments and key
    cost factors from the perspective of profitability in employing the CIoT in firms.
    A broad survey on energy-saving solutions in EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT was
    conducted, including analyzing critical factors that affect power usage, such
    as data reporting frequency, discontinuous reception cycles (DRX), and RRC timers,
    [28], directing future energy consumption reduction techniques. However, these
    studies [7], [27], [28] investigated EC-GSM-IoT, NB-IoT, and LTE-M within limited
    key enablers. Table 2. Summary of recent surveys on the CIoT. Reference Year CIoT

    In [29], the authors provided the primary features of the RedCap device standardized
    by 3GPP to support mid-range IoT applications with complexity reduction, coverage

    assessment of coverage for RedCap UE in various settings, including rural, urban,
    and indoor scenarios. In [30], a comprehensive overview of 3GPP Rel. 17 RedCap
    regarding cost reduction, and power-saving results were presented with design
    guidelines with future expected 3GPP RedCap release specifications. These surveys
    [9], [29], [30] focused on RedCap with some feature components based on the 3GPP
    standard specifications. In [31], the authors analyzed EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT,
    and RedCap and verified that they are proven as 5G IoT standards employed in various
    real-time applications when integrated with artificial intelligence (AI). However,
    the research focuses on AI and IoT integration in the CIoT with future research
    directions. Hence, considering the various surveys conducted, the surveys and
    studies address various aspects with limited focus. However, this survey provides
    comprehensive all-in-one information on coverage, power consumption, cost, device
    complexity, and device connection analysis. Furthermore, this review covers the
    general architecture, applications, release enhancement, development analysis,
    focus area explorations, and future challenges based on previous studies and on-hand
    survey results. Table 2 summarizes related studies to illustrate the difference
    from this survey. 3. General network architecture of the CIoT This section discusses
    the general network architecture of the CIoT. The cellular network standards organizations,
    such as 3GPP and its member companies: Ericsson, Huawei, Qualcomm, and Vodafone
    endorse the cellular-network-based architecture of CIoT. Cellular-network-based
    architectures connect IoT devices to the cellular network’s IoT infrastructure
    and allow them to access the Internet through middleware provided by the operators.
    Various requirements, such as bandwidth, energy efficiency, coverage, mobility,
    and reliability, are considered when network architecture is developed and deployed.
    The network architecture of the CIoT is designed to be scalable and flexible to
    support a wide range of devices and applications. Its ultimate goal is to transition
    from inflexible network structures, where all devices communicate directly with
    a network access point, to a more flexible architecture. This new approach allows
    devices and the network to dynamically form interconnected sub-networks, resembling
    a mesh, as and when needed [32]. It can support low-power, low-bandwidth, and
    high-power, high-bandwidth devices and can be easily integrated with existing
    networks and systems. Integration with existing networks and systems allows organizations
    to leverage the advantages offered by IoT without having to completely overhaul
    the existing infrastructure. Fig. 2 presents the general network architecture
    of CIoT, facilitating communication between IoT devices and the Internet. A CIoT
    network architecture focuses on increasing network robustness against dynamic
    resource availability and providing ubiquitous connectivity. For instance, to
    meet the requirements of CIoT, existing legacy network architectures need to undergo
    substantial changes, such as enabling non-orthogonal access to increase the number
    of connected devices, implementing grant-free UL communication for fast and reliable
    communication, and adopting a multihop mesh network to support low-power devices
    in challenging locations [33]. As CIoT operates within existing cellular infrastructure,
    it facilitates interoperability between devices and harvests communication and
    computing resources across the network [34]. As depicted in the figure, the architecture
    comprises four main components: the IoT devices, BS, network stack (user plane
    and control plane), and Internet (CIoT applications). The first layer, the IoT
    devices include sensors, actuators, and other connected devices that collect and
    transmit data. Using these nodes, sensor data will be collected and transmitted
    to the access point, or they will receive data from it, to perform the response
    associated with the actuators. These devices communicate with the next layer,
    the BS, using CIoT technology (EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap), which connects
    the IoT devices to the network. Download : Download high-res image (761KB) Download

    layer is the network stack, comprising the user and control planes responsible
    for the efficient and effective data delivery between IoT devices and applications
    which are the two optimizations for the CIoT. The user and control planes form
    two distinct layers of the network stack and serve distinct functions, with the
    user plane carrying the data and the control plane managing the network resources
    [35]. Specifically, the user plane manages the data transmission and chooses the
    best path for control data packets for uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) [36], and
    the control plane manages the overall network. In addition, the user and control
    planes work together to ensure an efficient and reliable exchange of information
    among IoT devices and the Internet. Finally, CIoT applications are at the top
    layer, which includes the applications and services that use the data collected
    by IoT devices. These applications can include everything from smart home systems
    to industrial automation systems [37]. The CIoT network architecture allows for
    the seamless integration of IoT devices and applications, making it an essential
    part of the IoT and plays a significant role to enable massive CIoT applications.
    Some of the CIoT technology (e.g., LTE-M and the NB-IoT) operates over a shared
    spectrum of LTE architecture with certain optimization techniques [38]. Some features
    were removed to reduce the complexity, equipment cost, and battery consumption
    in the shared LTE architecture, including handover for fast connection, carrier
    aggregation, and channel quality measurements [39]. In the CIoT network, two dedicated
    machines are used for communication: the MTC device and the MTC gateway. An MTC
    device is an endpoint that can communicate directly with a BS or connect via two
    hops to MTC gateways, as illustrated in Fig. 2. In this way, MTC gateways help
    increase data transmission efficiency by relaying data to the BS [40]. In fact,
    gateway utilization is feasible in numerous instances, but certain regions and
    circumstances lack such infrastructure. Consequently, in such scenarios, it becomes
    imperative to establish direct communication. 4. CIoT application use-case classifications
    The development of CIoT results from collaboration and innovation from multiple
    companies and researchers [11], [41], [42]. It has emerged as a way to extend
    the capabilities of cellular networks to establish connectivity for a diverse
    range of devices to enable a broad range of new use cases and applications, such
    as smart cities, industrial automation, and remote monitoring, to mention a few,
    by offering low-cost, low-power, and reliable connectivity. Globally, the standards
    of the CIoT have been developed by 3GPP and Ericsson, among others, which have
    different methods of classifying CIoT application use cases, as presented in Fig.
    3. Accordingly, this section discusses the application use classification by 3GPP
    and Ericsson. 4.1. 3GPP classification 3GPP is a collaboration between telecommunications
    standard organizations to develop global standards for cellular communication
    technologies [43]. Specifically, 3GPP is working on the development of 5G technology
    and standardization of IoT technologies to improve connectivity and communication
    between devices [44]. They also work on developing new features and functionalities
    for cellular networks, such as network slicing, improved security, and reduced
    latency, to support the growing demands of IoT and other emerging technologies.
    This section focuses on their classifications from the application perspectives
    that 3GPP defines three usage scenarios of 5G: mMTC, ultra-reliable and low-latency
    communications (URLLC), and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) [45], [46]. 4.1.1.
    mMTC Specifically, mMTC is designed to enable numerous low-power, low-cost IoT
    devices to connect to cellular networks where many devices infrequently transmit
    small volumes of data. It is designed to connect numerous low-cost devices (e.g.,
    about 1,000,0000 devices/km ) with sporadic, low-throughput data transmissions
    within a 10-s latency [47]. The focus is on low power consumption with up to 10
    years of battery life and high reliability to efficiently use the network resources.
    It is intended for use cases requiring high device density, such as smart cities,
    industrial automation, smart homes, smart metering, and asset tracking, where
    many devices must connect to the network simultaneously. In Rel. 13, 3GPP proposed
    LPWA cellular technology that specified long-range coverage of 164 dB, inexpensive
    and extremely energy-efficient devices that necessitate intermittent and periodic
    connectivity, including EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT [45]. 4.1.2. URLLC Higher
    reliability and lower latency are the most important design standards in wireless
    communications. From Rel. 14 to the present, reliability and latency have been
    the focus requirements, such as new data center interconnect formats, enhanced
    physical DL control channel (PDCCH) monitoring capability, hybrid automatic repeat
    request acknowledgment (HARQ ACK) feedback based on sub slots, enhanced inter-UE
    transmitter (Tx) multiplexing, physical UL shared channel (PUSCH) enhancements,
    and a variety of active configuration grants [48]. It is intended for IoT applications
    that are mission-critical, such as emergency services, which demand high availability
    and coverage with a low response time of fewer than 1 ms. It is intended for use
    cases, such as factory automation, autonomous driving, and remote surgery [46]
    for which NR-RedCap is a complement. 4.1.3. eMBB The eMBB is designed to provide
    high-bandwidth and low-latency media streaming applications [49], such as virtual
    and augmented reality, smart offices, and 4k and 8k video streaming with ultra-high
    speed Internet access. The eMBB is intended for use cases, such as smart cities
    and entertainment. Although eMBB and CIoT differ, they can work together to offer
    more comprehensive and reliable connectivity solutions. The purpose of organizations
    in the CIoT regarding eMBB is to work to integrate them to share the capabilities
    of the trending wireless development in 5G. These categories are not mutually
    exclusive and can overlap. For example, an IoT application may require both mMTC
    and URLLC capabilities (e.g., autonomous vehicles, smart grids, industrial automation),
    or an IoT device may require mMTC and eMBB capabilities (smart cities, healthcare,
    and smart agriculture). 3GPP aims to establish a framework that can cater to the
    varied needs of IoT applications and devices and ensure seamless interoperability
    among devices and networks. 4.2. Ericsson classification Ericsson [50], a leading
    information communication technology network provider, working on developing solutions
    for connecting a large number of devices to the network, improving network coverage,
    and increasing the efficiency and security of IoT applications. Involved in the
    standardization and development of CIoT technology and refined the IoT applications
    incorporated into the CIoT into four divisions: massive IoT, broadband IoT, critical
    IoT, and industrial automation IoT [32], [51]. Download : Download high-res image
    (580KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. 3GPP and Ericsson’s CIoT use-case
    classifications. 4.2.1. Massive IoT Massive IoT is focused on low-cost devices,
    small data volumes, and extreme coverage. It is intended to enable increased network
    coverage, longer device lifespan, and high connection density, which is known
    as mMTC. Ericsson identified the massive IoT as LPWA technology, as classified
    by 3GPP, employed on licensed spectrum bands. Massive IoT is employed when low-complexity
    devices, long battery life, extensive coverage, and massive deployments are necessary.
    Massive IoT applications (i.e., smart building, retail, shopping, and manufacturing;
    smart home systems; personal IoT devices; etc.) tend to tolerate delays at various
    levels in operation [52], [53], [54]. Hence, LTE-M, EC-GSM-IoT, and NB-IoT were
    developed by 3GPP to support the massive IoT [55] in which according to Ericsson’s
    projection massive IoT will make up 51 percent of CIoT connections by 2027 [56].
    4.2.2. Broadband IoT The broadband IoT provides significantly faster data transfer
    speeds and reduced latency compared to the massive IoT, which was released based
    on mobile broadband [50]. The broadband IoT is evolving due to the requirements
    of accessing multimedia information with high throughput, low latency, and large
    data volumes for communication purposes. The broadband IoT is designed for high-bandwidth
    applications, such as video surveillance and remote health monitoring. Due to
    its capability of supporting high-speed data transfer, it enables devices to transmit
    numerous data quickly and efficiently, which is relevant in healthcare applications
    (e.g., where high-resolution images and data-intensive information is transmitted
    in real-time). 4.2.3. Critical IoT The critical IoT is necessary when the industrial
    IoT (IIoT) and mission-critical applications that require ultrahigh performance,
    very high availability (99.999%), ultra-reliability, and ultralow latency are
    in demand [57]. Unlike the massive IoT, applications of the critical IoT that
    require a minimal delay, such as smart healthcare (e.g., remote surgery), industrial
    automation in smart manufacturing [22], autonomous driving, asset tracking, traffic
    safety and control, and remote control of the sensitive components of a smart
    grid automation [58], are particularly sensitive to delays. Critical IoT applications
    are technically known as URLLC, comprising industrial control, robotic machines,
    and autonomous vehicles [32] that require real-time data transmission. Ultra-reliable,
    very low latency, and very high availability are the key performance indicators
    of the critical IoT [54]. 4.2.4. Industrial automation IoT The IIoT targets improving
    the operational efficiency, safety, and sustainability of industrial processes
    and systems that require unique network deployments. The IIoT is designed for
    applications in manufacturing and industrial process automation [46], achieving
    increased reliability, reduced latency, higher data transfer rates, greater flexibility,
    and secure communication. The IIoT is the focus and enabler of Industry 4.0 [32],
    [59], [60], enhancing the controlling capability with remote monitoring applications,
    such as smart factories, agricultural monitoring, and industrial assets [61].
    The IIoT is primarily applied in IoT applications that demand Ethernet protocol
    integration, time-sensitive networking, clock synchronization services, and other
    requirements. Furthermore, in these industrial real time applications proper implementation
    and effective design of deep learning algorithms are necessary aiming for high
    performance in terms of reliability, speed, and security. Deep learning provides
    a dynamic optimization of the warehouse facilities, enhances assembly line performance,
    improves the generative design, predicts future demands, and reduces errors [62].
    Moreover, low cost and complexity are the most important factors in the IIoT [63].
    5. CIoT technologies This section discusses CIoT technology from various perspectives.
    Initially, 3GPP collated cellular network technology for the IoT in Rel. 13 included
    EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and in Rel. 17 the NR-RedCap. As illustrated in Table
    3, we summarize the fundamental parameters of the first Rel. 13 for the three
    types of CIoT technology and the first NR-RedCap Rel. 17 technology. 3GPP worked
    on the EC-GSM-IoT (a complete backward-compatible solution for CIoT that builds
    upon the existing GSM or enhanced-GPRS (eGPRS) deployments) under the 850–900
    MHz and 1800–1900 MHz frequency bandwidth with the aim of achieving extended battery
    life and lower device costs compared to general packet radio service (GPRS) or
    GSM devices. It also has extended coverage of up to 164 dB maximum coupling loss
    (MCL) for 33 dBm UE and 154 dB MCL for 23 dBm UE, with variable rates using Gaussian
    minimum shift keying (GMSK) ranging from approximately 350 bps to 70 kbps, and
    eight-phase shift keying (8PSK) up to 240 kbps. The technology can handle a large
    number of devices, with around 50,000 per cell, and provides enhanced security
    compared to GSM orEDGE. It can be installed through a software update to the GSM
    infrastructure [66]. Table 3. First release parameter values of the CIoT (LTE-M,

    Moreover, as shown in the table, the first release of LTE-M, Cat-0, was out on
    Rel. 12 in March 2015 to be configured as a UE Cat-0 (Cat-0 MTC) IoT version.
    In Rel. 13 in March 2016, LTE enhanced MTC or Cat-M1 (Cat-1 MTC) IoT, and the
    NB-IoT was released to afford IoT applications. In the combined Cat-0 and Cat-M1,
    LTE-M was introduced to contribute a 1 Mbps data-rate capacity, supporting full
    mobility features with a battery life exceeding a duration of 10 years, which
    can be configured easily with a software update to the LTE infrastructure. In
    the multiple access techniques, both Cat-0 and Cat-M1 in the UL transmission scenario
    support the single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) methods,
    and in the downlink scenario, they both employ orthogonal frequency-division multiple
    access (OFDMA). However, Cat-0 and Cat-M1 have differences in terms of the UL
    and DL bandwidth coverage. The former has a 20 MHz bandwidth, and the latter has
    a 1.4 MHz bandwidth derived from the legacy LTE. The coverage or link budget of
    Cat-0 is around 141 and is 156 dB for Cat-M1 [43]. In contrast, the NB-IoT was
    developed from an LTE or GSM network with 200 kHz of physical resource blocks
    (PRBs) and a clean sheet format of 180 kHz that can be compatible with a software
    update to the existing legacy LTE or GSM systems under the 700, 800 and 900 MHz
    frequency bandwidth. Because the NB-IoT utilizes many of the same design aspects
    as LTE, including channel modulation, coding schemes, and higher-layer protocols,
    it provides deployment flexibility and is primarily designed to address ultralow-end
    IoT applications [65], [68]. The NB-IoT introduces two modes of operation types,
    different from the LTE, where the whole PRB is assigned to a single piece of UE
    in the UL and DL. In the single-tone mode, the NB-IoT utilizes one PRB that has
    a bandwidth of 180 kHz in both the DL and UL of the LTE spectrum. However, in
    the multitone mode, the resource units are allocated to multiple pieces of UE
    to attain the massive device deployment objective of the CIoT, specifically for
    the NB-IoT. The NB-IoT system assigns each tone a transmission bandwidth of either
    3.75 or 15 kHz for UL transmission using the SC-FDMA scheme. For DL transmission,
    15 kHz transmission bandwidth is used with the OFDMA scheme similar to LTE. Using
    15 kHz spacing, NB-IoT can allocate either one or multiple tones (three, six,
    or twelve) to different UE with durations of 4, 2, and 1 ms, respectively. However,
    with 3.75 kHz spacing, only a single-tone allocation is supported for various
    users, with 48 sub-carriers of 32 ms duration [69], which allows the NB-IoT for
    increased deployment flexibility and higher system capacity. From the Rel. 13
    specifications, the data rate in the single-tone allocation is 48 kbps for the
    UL, 64 kbps for the multitone mode, and 128 kbps in the single- and multitone
    modes in the DL, with a 20 dB link budget from the legacy LTE of 144 dB supporting
    more than 10 years of battery life but without mobility support [70]. In addition,
    3GPP introduced RedCap on 5G device specifications with reduced features in Rel.
    17, designed objectively to simplify the standard NR technology. In the 5G technology,
    it is insufficient to reuse traditional existing frequency bands for high-end
    5G requirements, so another new and varied frequency band is needed. For 5G NR,
    frequency band 1 (FR1) is below 6 GHz or 4.10 to 7.125 GHz, and frequency band
    2 (FR2) is above 6 GHz or 24.250 to 52.600 GHz [71]. Hence, RedCap is supposed
    to use 20 MHz for FR1 and 50 and 100 MHz for FR2 in the UL and DL bandwidths,
    respectively [67]. The multiple access method is FDMA or time division multiple
    access (TDMA), where frequency or time slot is employed. The peak data rate varies
    based on the use cases (e.g., 2 Mbps is expected for wireless industry sensors,
    25 Mbps for wearables, and 150 Mbps (DL and UL) for surveillance applications).
    Moreover, after Rel. 13, 3GPP added subsequent enhancements to the current releases.
    The subsequent sections discuss these CIoT technologies in detail, considering
    their focuses, features, and applications. Following is a detailed explanation
    of each CIoT technology, including their unique features, applications, focuses,
    and review state of the art. In this section, we will explore the different CIoT
    technologies available, including EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap, and discuss
    how they are being used in various industries and sectors. Download : Download

    5.1. EC-GSM-IoT 3GPP standardized it to support IoT applications in Rel. 13 using
    the Technical Specifications Group GSM RAN using LTE-advanced pro [7], [75], [76].
    Its development can be considered a great success because it only requires design
    reuse and software upgrades to deploy EC-GSM-IoT in the existing 2G GSM or eGPRS
    network without needing new network infrastructure. It plays a pivotal service
    in M2M or IoT communications in the form of voice, data, and SMS. Moreover, most
    sub-Saharan African subscriptions are still GSM or EDGE, which is vital for MTC
    and global IoT deployment [77]. In particular, the EC-GSM-IoT technology is intended
    to facilitate the use of IoT devices in areas with difficult radio coverage and
    can operate in frequency deployments as narrow as 600 kHz. Operators and companies,
    such as Broadcom Corporation, Cisco Systems, Ericsson, Gemalto NV, Intel Corporation,
    KDDI Corporation, LG Electronics, MediaTek, Nokia, Oberthur Technologies, Ooredoo,
    Orange, Samsung Electronics, Saudi Telecom Company, Sierra Wireless, Telit Communications,
    and VimpelCom, are also trying to use it with 3G and 4G mobile networks [78].
    As shown in Table 4, the maximum UL-DL instantaneous peak data rates from the
    Rel. 14 to Rel. 17, in the 8PSK modulation, is 489.6 kbps both in DL and UL, 153.6
    kbps in GMSK modulation in the UL [45], [72]. The channel bandwidth is 200 kHz,
    and the device capacity (i.e., devices/km ) is around 60,000. Additionally, the
    technology uses CE through message repetitions [31], [73]. Indeed, the GSM technology
    is well-established, and it still plays an important role in the deployment of
    IoT. With the upgrades implemented by 3GPP in Rel. 13, GSM offers advantages in
    terms of time, coverage footprint, and cost that are crucial for IoT development.
    In addition, spectrum availability is an essential controlling factor of the CIoT
    and its innovation capability, growth rate, and development paths. Backward compatibility
    has been applied to use the existing devices and network in the EC-GSM-IoT deployment.
    As illustrated in [79], only new synchronization, the broadcast control channel,
    and common control channels on time slot 1 of the broadcast control channel carrier
    are required for EC-GSM-IoT functioning. The extended Discontinuous Reception
    (eDRX) with radio control level enhancements provides several advantages, including
    extended battery life, lower device cost in comparison to GPRS or GSM devices,
    improved coverage, and variable rates. The technology can accommodate a large
    number of devices while offering improved security features. As shown in Fig.
    4, the 3GPP did efforts to enhance the EC-GSM-IoT service levels to cope with
    the requirements of IoT application requirements. Enhancements on EC-GSM-IoT have
    been done including achieving reduced complexity, low device power consumption,
    ensuring support of a massive number of CIoT devices and backward compatibility
    with GSM, securing low-device cost, improving end-user security, and so on. In
    the consequent release, Rel.14, fundamentally, they developed three enhancement
    requirement objectives including improving the positioning of devices, coverage
    for 23 dBm devices, and new time slots (TSs) mapping in extended coverage for
    improved resource handling [45]. In EC-GSM-IoT, there are four coverage classes,
    namely CC1, CC2, CC3, and CC4, that are assigned to different channels. Each coverage
    class determines the number of blind repetitions in the DL channel, which are
    1, 8, 16, and 32 respectively. Similarly, in the UL channel, the coverage classes
    determine the number of blind repetitions as 1, 4, 16, and 48 respectively that
    can help to attain the MCL [28]. In Rel.15, feature enhancements such as supporting
    multicast to operate in extended coverage in both UL and DL, incorporating coverage
    class CC5 and CC6 to attain 33 dBm, mobility support, and power consumption reduction
    techniques (e.g., eDRX, paging) were employed. In Rel.16, enhancements in localization,
    power consumption reduction (eDRX, WUS, paging, Preconfigured UL Resources (PUR)),
    and improved multicarrier operation. The PUR is employed to allocate radio resources
    to a UE in advance, enabling the transmission of UL data without requiring a connection
    setup process. In Rel.17, enhancements have been incorporated into EC-GSM-IoT
    to better meet the requirements of application scenarios. These enhancements focus
    on improving the battery lifecycle, device density, and link budget. Download

    countries, after Rel.15, since the 2G-GSM and 3G-Universal Mobile Telecommunications
    System (UMTS) wireless networks are winding down, and some mobile network operators
    plan to phase out their GSM and UMTS networks soon [83]. They are shifting to
    5G and confirmed the LTE-M and NB-IoT are a candidate for CIoT technology in addition
    to RedCap. Instead of EC-GSM-IoT, they are focused on LTE improvements and 5G
    NR so that no further EC-GSM-IoT feature enhancement is applied. However, in the
    Middle East, South-East Asia, and Africa, 2G, 3G, and 4G mobile networks are still
    applicable, know that it can co-exist with 3G, and 4G mobile networks, EC-GSM-IoT
    is serving well even though demand for 5G is getting high. In spite of the relatively
    lesser attention the EC-GSM-IoT network receives than the LTE-M and NB-IoT networks,
    EC-GSM-IoT still offers some promising applications. In fact, it is a good solution
    for IoT deployment in developing countries, where cellular networks are primarily
    used for voice and other locations where GSM coverage exceeds LTE coverage. 5.2.
    LTE-M Under the 3GPP feasibility study titled “Study on Provision of Low-Cost
    MTC UEs Based on LTE”, LTE-M started in September 2011, earlier than the EC-GSM-IoT
    and NB-IoT [84]. The main objective was to enhance the LTE device capabilities
    in the low-end MTC domain, present an option for the GPRS and EGPRS devices, and
    roam GSM networks to LTE. At the time, eGPRS was incompatible with supporting
    more devices and was not cost-effective for MTC devices. They aimed to provide
    a solution with device complexity and cost to facilitate better requirement satisfaction
    regarding data rates, spectrum efficiency, and power consumption than the eGPRS.
    In 2012, in addition to the mentioned requirements, the group extended coverage
    improvement over the normal LTE coverage capacity by at least 20 dB to support
    deep indoor coverage, as summarized in as shown in Table 5. Furthermore, LTE devices
    were more expensive than GSM or eGPRS, so it was worth reducing the device cost
    to address the low-end mMTC use cases. The LTE-M release feature enhancements
    increased the number of supported devices per cell, from 361,000 to 1,000,000
    devices/km allowing for more IoT devices to connect to a single BS, enabling better
    use of the available spectrum and improved scalability. New CE techniques (i.e.,
    Mode A, a moderate number of retransmissions with 32 repetitions, and Mode B,
    a high number of repetitions with 2,048 repetitions, from Rel. 14 forward) are
    introduced to improve the QoS for IoT devices operating in remote or challenging
    environments [85]. Through shorter transmission time intervals, the latency is
    reduced from 50 to 100 ms in Rel. 12 to 10 to 15 ms in recent releases [82]. The
    LTE-M release enhancements increased the maximum number of HARQ processes from
    eight to 10 to improve the reliability of data transmissions, reducing the number
    of retransmissions needed to deliver data to IoT devices, improving overall system
    efficiency and reliability, and reducing latency. The HARQ allows for more flexibility
    in determining the type and amount of retransmitted data, as explained by [86].
    Compared with other CIoT components, LTE-M has important features (see Fig. 5).
    LTE-M is considered the most suitable LPWA technology for IoT applications that
    need high data rates, low latency, and full mobility, including voice, under standard
    coverage conditions. It is also an ideal choice for IoT applications that require
    deep coverage, where the demands for latency, mobility, and data speed are less
    rigorous. Indeed, LTE-M is a highly adaptable LPWA technology that can cater to
    both lower and higher data rates, with its system bandwidth being flexible and
    capable of accommodating 1.4 MHz or more. It can handle real-time traffic, full
    mobility, and voice features. In general, in the form of low-cost devices and
    coverage improvements, Rel. 14 and Rel. 15 further developed the standard, as
    shown in Table 5. In addition, MTC was further enhanced for LTE [82], commonly
    referred to as the “feMTC” work item in Rel. 14, which brought further enhanced
    improvements for supporting higher data speeds, improved voice over long-term
    evolution (VoLTE) support, improved positioning, multicast support, and the new
    LTE device, Cat-M2. In Rel. 14, a new UE Cat-M2, unlike the normal LTE UE for
    IoT applications that require a higher data rate (e.g., wearables, such as smartwatches)
    but lower device cost. The UE Cat-M2 has a UE bandwidth of 5 MHz and can achieve
    peak rates of around 4 Mbps for the DL and 7 Mbps for the UL, assuming it supports
    FD-FDD operations [87]. For UE that supports HD-FDD, these peak rates are roughly
    half of the aforementioned figures, and for UE that supports time division duplex,
    the peak rates depend on the DL/UL subframe configuration, as stated in [82].
    The Cat-M2 UE supports larger maximum TBSs for unicast transmission than Cat-M1
    UE. Valuable enhancements have been provided in each release, as illustrated in
    Fig. 4. Rel. 13 enhanced by employing coverage enhancement modes (CE mode A and
    B), improved device type having lower complexity and cost, enabled VoLTE in HD
    mode and introduced additional power saving features (eDRX) than Rel. 12 that
    was featured as lower complexity (a single receive antenna) and low-cost devices
    (Cat-0), HD operation, supports a lower data rate requirement (Max: 1 Mbps) and
    PSM enhancements for the UE. Rel. 14 further enhanced LTE-M, offering further
    developments than Rel. 13 regarding mobility, data rate, HARQ processing, new
    Cat-2 specifications, supporting positioning features, and additional power consumption
    management techniques [82]. The other power-saving mechanism developed in Rel.
    14, the Release Assistance Indication (RAI) feature is employed to conserve power
    by permitting the network to terminate a connection that is no longer required.
    By turning off the device radio and freeing network resources sooner, RAI can
    help to minimize battery consumption. A Rel. 15 work item that added use cases,
    increased spectrum efficiency, and additional benefits even further enhanced MTC
    (efeMTC) for LTE [88] while reducing latency and power consumption. Particularly,
    LTE-M is suited for industry operations with mobility features that must be tracked
    and monitored while moving. In Rel. 15, the central objective was to improve latency,
    spectral efficiency, and power consumption further. Potential enhancements to
    enhance latency include reducing the system acquisition time (e.g., improving
    the BS search or system information acquisition performance) and supporting EDT.
    To increase system capacity, spectral efficiency was improved in the DL by introducing
    higher-order modulation (64 QAM), and in the UL by enabling more precise resource
    allocation using sub-PRB granularity, as stated in [89]. To reduce power consumption,
    several possible enhancements could help including the implementation of EDT,
    sub-PRB resource allocation, WUSs, novel synchronization signals, improved HARQ
    feedback, and less stringent measurements for cell reselection [81], [88], [90].
    Rel. 15 offered even further enhancements of increased spectral efficiency, latency
    improvement, and lower power class. In Rel. 16, 5G integration has been realized
    to share 5G capabilities, CE for non-bandwidth reduced low complexity, standalone
    development, and mobility improvements. Rel. 17 [91], [92] introduced a maximum
    DL TBS of 1736 bits, 14 HARQ processes, and traffic management capabilities. In
    each release, enhancements in data rates, device capacities, and energy-efficient
    solutions have been integrated. Download : Download high-res image (465KB) Download

    [44] 5.3. NB-IoT The NB-IoT is a promising technology for the massive IoT specifically
    designed for low data-rate applications [14]. Improving the design of the UL/DL
    Rx to function effectively in situations where the signal-to-noise ratio is extremely
    low is pivotal [96]. The latency is enhanced between 1.6 and 10 s [97] with a
    maximum of one or two HARQ techniques. The maximum TBS in Rel. 14 was enhanced
    to 2536 b in the DL and UL by applying the HARQ process [65]. The NB-IoT has three
    deployment options and can be deployed inside an LTE carrier (in-band in 3, 5,
    10, 15, and 20 MHz LTE bandwidths), in its guard-band (in 10 MHz LTE carriers),
    or its own designated spectrum (standalone, 200 kHz in the GSM band) [65], [98],
    [99], [100]. When a guardband is applied, NB-IoT devices transmit data with great
    performance and efficiency while avoiding interfering with regular voice or data
    traffic on cellular networks. It can be considered a new radio access technology
    that is different from EC-GSM-IoT and LTE-M with no backward compatibility [101].
    In Rel. 14, it was intended to optimize the battery efficiency for up to 35 years
    with extended coverage of 164 dB [27] with transmission repetitions, power boosting,
    software modifications enhancing transport layer protocols [102], low complexity,
    support for a massive number of devices, improved power efficiency, and 10 s or
    less latency with positioning and multicast features [103]. The ITU and 3GPP’s
    mMTC performance criteria are further met by NB-IoT Rel. 15 (2018), which can
    fulfill 5G IoT requirements. It provides IoT connectivity with high data rates
    and reliable communication, boosting the 5G capacity while increasing IoT connectivity
    [104]. These requirements comprise high-performance and low-complexity features
    with an improved spectral efficiency and data rate [8]. Recently, 6G IoT has been
    studied extensively regarding the convergence of the 6G and IoT on five key domains:
    healthcare IoT, vehicular IoT and autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAVs), satellite IoT, and IIoT [105] in which 3GPP must work on the CIoT to support
    these stringent requirements. CIoT is also envisioned to support monitoring real-time
    applications in UAVs under the circumstances of Age of Information (AoI) handling
    status. As shown in Table 6, the same way as LTE-M, in each release; enhancements
    in data rates, device capacities, and energy-efficient solutions are recorded.
    As shown in Fig. 6, enhancements made available in each release including low
    device power consumption, higher density, improved indoor coverage, reduced complexity,
    ultra-low device cost, optimized network architecture, cell reselection in the
    idle state, and Cat-NB1; power consumption and latency reduction (DL and UL for
    2 HARQ processes and larger maximum TBS), new power class of 14 dBm, Cat-NB2,
    multicast, higher data rate, location and positioning protocol OTDOA, non-anchor
    PRB enhancements, mobility, and service continuity enhancements; improved latency,
    improved power consumption(WUS, EDT), improved cell range, support TDD, higher
    spectral efficiency, improved load control, enhance cell acquisition, D2D communication;
    reduced control-signaling overhead, coexistence with NR, better UE energy efficiency,
    scheduling enhancement, better UL or DL transmission efficiency, improved multi-carrier
    operation, 2-step PRACH; enabling data transmission in RRC inactive mode, intra-UE
    multiplexing, positioning enhancement targeting factory automation, extend peak
    data rate, time synchronization enhancements, 2-HARQ process enhancement, CSI
    enhancements in the subsequent releases. In Rel. 14, a new UE Cat. NB2 has developed
    with lower device cost and supports a massive number of IoT devices 8̃0,000 in
    an urban environment. In resolving energy-consumption problems, they employed
    solutions including PSM, I-eDRX, C-DRX, and cell reselection in addition to the
    eDRX. In Rel. 15 [95], 3GPP introduced the RRC-connected inactive state, which
    can benefit low data transmission optimization for devices operating for a short
    period. It is because of the substantial battery consumption, high demand for
    specialized resources, and high measurement reports and handovers, keeping the
    device in the RRC-connected state without active data transfer is not financially
    advantageous. The NB-IoT shortens the network monitoring duration for UE in idle
    mode, reduces the unnecessary startup of receiving cells, and reduces power consumption.
    Furthermore, Rel. 15 introduced the following energy efficiency solutions, as
    illustrated in Table 6. Wake-up signaling for IDLE mode (FDD) is served in an
    energy efficiency solution, reducing energy consumption. In communications, UE
    must frequently determine whether a paging message is from the core network when
    in DRX or eDRX. When paging is available, the UE mostly does not receive a message,
    and power is saved. With this capability, the BS can advise the UE to watch the
    narrowband physical DL control channel for paging by sending it an NB-IoT WUS
    (NWUS) introduced in Rel. 15 [106] to enhance the device energy efficiency, but
    otherwise, the UE is free to ignore the paging operations. NWUS enables the UE
    to potentially keep some of its hardware off for longer periods while saving the
    energy required to decode the narrowband physical DL control channel and shared
    channel for paging. The time the network allows the UE to “wake up” after receiving
    an NWUS determines whether the UE can maintain only one Rx switched on for WUS
    detection, leaving most of the UE conventional hardware in a very low-power state.
    The other viable solution is scheduling requests, included in the Rel. 13 and
    Rel. 14 NB-IoT as a higher-layer procedure that causes a random-access process
    to request enough UL resources to send a buffer status report. In addition, Rel.
    15 has provided new, more resource and power-effective methods to accomplish this
    goal that the BS can configure, the EDT. The EDT is an idle mode with a bitrate
    of 328 to 1000 bits. For example, UE can send data in msg 3 of the random-access
    procedure [107]. The random-access operation ends if a BS successfully receives
    a signal and the UE does not switch to connected mode. If the UE waiting data
    are less than the maximum permissible size established by the BS, the UE requests
    a grant for EDT by transmitting its preamble using a preconfigured set of narrowband
    physical random-access channel resources. To save energy on transmitting padding
    bits, the BS can authorize the UE to transmit fewer data than the maximum allowed
    size [106]. Due to minimizing the signaling overhead and message latency, the
    battery life is prolonged [19]. 5.4. RedCap The RedCap approach was created to
    address use cases (IIoT, video surveillance, and wearables) in IoT requirements
    that cannot be met using the EC-GSM-IoT, NB-IoT, or LTE-M [44], [108] operating
    at a higher data rate and reliability with lower latency than LTE-M and the NB-IoT.
    It offers a lower cost, lower complexity, and longer battery life than NR eMBB
    and wider coverage than URLLC. Some requirements often necessitate higher reliability
    and quicker response time than those offered by LTE-M and the NB-IoT, while still
    maintaining lower complexity and expenses, as well as longer battery life compared
    to eMBB and URLLC services. The RedCap interface is designed to bridge the gap
    between the intricate and expensive 5G-NR interface that caters to eMBB and URLLC
    services and the lower data rates and increased latency of NB-IoT and LTE-M interfaces
    that support mMTC services. Under the study item “Low complexity NR devices” [67],
    in June 2019, 3GPP introduced RedCap NR devices in Rel. 17 with lower cost, lower
    complexity, and longer battery life compared to regular NR devices. In addition,
    RedCap was introduced to meet the low-cost, large-bandwidth, medium data rate,
    and no latency no delay tolerance IoT service requirements [31]. Hence, RedCap
    inherits the majority of the key advantages of NR. These include the ability to
    connect to the 5G core network, which is a cloud-based platform with a service-based
    architecture, support for a very broad range of frequency bands (FR1 and FR2 and
    millimeter-wave bands), network energy efficiency due to the ultra-flexible design,
    forward-compatible and beam-based air interfaces, and support for millimeter-wave
    bands [30]. As depicted in Fig. 7, enhancements have been incorporated in each
    release of RedCap. The applications use cases that are targeted include wearables,
    medical sensors, remote surgery, industrial sensors, surveillance cameras, and
    others. Rel. 17 of RedCap offers a multitude of enhancements that make it a cutting-edge
    solution for IoT applications. One of the most notable features is its ability
    to provide slicing capabilities, creating virtual networks within a single physical
    network, increasing network efficiency, and ensuring optimal resource utilization
    [67]. The positioning component of Rel. 17 has also been improved, providing more
    accurate location-based services and enabling new location-based applications.
    Furthermore, this release boasts a large capacity for storing and processing data,
    making it ideal for handling large volumes of IoT data. The UE energy-efficient
    operation component ensures that the end-user experience is optimized for energy
    efficiency, reducing the overall carbon footprint of IoT devices [30]. In addition,
    Rel. 17 is highly cost-effective and offers low latency, making it an attractive
    solution for a wide range of IoT applications and budgets [109]. In Fig. 7, one
    of the key advancements in Rel. 18 is supporting higher transmission rates, providing
    faster data transfer, and enabling new applications that require higher bandwidth.
    Another major improvement is the support for the unlicensed spectrum, which expands
    the available spectrum for IoT devices and enables new use cases. Advanced positioning
    technology has also been incorporated, further improving location-based services
    and enabling new location-based applications [29]. Integrating side-link near-field
    communications allows for direct communication between devices, providing a new
    level of convenience and enabling new use cases. In addition, it takes steps to
    reduce the complexity of RedCap UE further, making it even more user-friendly
    and accessible. Finally, the addition of device-to-device (D2D) communication
    expands the communication options for IoT devices, making it easier to connect
    and communicate with other devices in a local network. These enhancements and
    new features make Rel. 18 of RedCap CIoT necessary for anyone aiming to remain
    at the forefront of IoT technology. RedCap has unique features incorporated with
    5G NR services and was objectively designed to maintain lower complexity devices
    with 20 or 100 MHz maximum bandwidth in sub-7 or millimeter-wave with one or two
    Rx antennae. Additionally, 3GPP introduced this standard [61] due to RedCap’s
    ability to coexist with URLLC features, use higher frequency bands, and apply
    other 5G features, such as network slicing. For instance, RedCap is designed to
    provide significantly faster data rates than previous CIoT technology compared
    to the data rate specified in Rel. 17 using a higher frequency band, multiple-input
    multiple-output technology, advanced modulation techniques, advanced beamforming
    features, and network slicing. Use cases for RedCap are less battery-life-intensive
    than mMTC use cases, but they are more demanding for throughput and latency. However,
    a higher data rate of up to 100 Mbps is required to accommodate live video feed,
    visual production, and process automation [30]. This approach enables new use
    cases and applications that were previously impossible [9]. In addition to the
    transmission rate, in machine-to-machine collaboration and real-time remote control,
    ultra-low communication latency is expected at around 1 ms. Communication latency
    can be raised from the physical layer latency and scheduling latency problems
    [112]. However, for the time being, in the higher requirement scenario, it is
    possible to achieve a latency of 10 to 30 ms to support applications like remote
    drone operation, cooperative farm machinery, time-critical sensing and feedback,
    and remote vehicle operations. Higher communication reliability in mission and
    time-critical applications, for example, autonomous vehicles, remote surgery,
    and smart factories, is not an option to compromise but should be kept stable
    [9]. In IIoT, data transmission security is the top demand to make sensitive information
    extremely secure and highly available on demand. For Rel. 17 RedCap features [111],
    3GPP also added extra features in future Rel. 18 work, depicted in Fig. 7. Download

    [31], [109], [110], [111] Furthermore, localization or positioning increases network
    complexity, potential overhead, and accuracy degradation and can include power,
    time, and space domain localization [66]. Positioning or localization in the MTC
    has become difficult due to the complication of environments, sensor errors, and
    device motions, as Le et al. [24] investigated. Supporting location-based service
    applications is crucial for some IoT applications, such as tracking items. Although
    a smaller BS density has an advantage in the IoT scenario, a higher BS density
    is an important factor in localization with small BSs. In addition to environment
    complexity, other problems in positioning are end device-related errors, environment-related
    errors, BS-related errors, and data-related errors [24]. Hence, positioning accuracy
    can be supported by different mechanisms, including received signal strength (RSS),
    time difference of arrival [24], and channel-state information [113]. Regarding
    the D2D Protocol, communication between devices, such as wearables, that can directly
    communicate with nearby smartphones or connected vehicles is supported by RedCap
    [114]. It is enabled via sideline communication over a shared RF channel in which
    the cellular BS provides a synchronization signal that enables direct D2D communication,
    which can also improve communication efficiency, reduce latency, and extend network
    coverage and capacity. Most importantly, RedCap supports the Unlicensed Spectrum.
    In 3GPP’s EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT, there is no support for sub-GHz license-free
    frequency bands (unlicensed spectrum). There have been efforts, such as MulteFire
    Alliance [115] that have been working on expanding IoT services with LPWAN support
    in the 800/900 MHz band (902 to 928 MHz band in the United States and 863 to 870
    MHz band in the European Union) with NB-IoT unlicensed and 2.4 GHz with extended
    MTC unlicensed. RedCap uses unlicensed spectrum bands under both licensed and
    unlicensed standards and regulatory requirements to address spectrum scarcity
    issues. Due to its lower cost and low-complexity features, RedCap is further becoming
    manifested in IoT applications that target mission-critical aspects (that require
    low latency, ultra-reliability, high security, and high data rates) [57] and time-sensitive
    IoT connectivity like emergency response, health-care services, disaster mitigation,
    and related cases in which these applications require faster and more reliable
    performance than other applications, and their connectivity must be guaranteed
    to be safe and resilient. Industrial wireless sensor networks, video surveillance
    cameras, and wearables (e.g., smartwatches, rings, eHealth-related devices, and
    medical monitoring devices) are some use cases for RedCap [67], [108]. RedCap
    contributes to services that require more capabilities than the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M,
    and NB-IoT but are lower than URLLC and eMBB machines including process monitoring
    (pressure sensors, humidity sensors, and thermometers), self-diagnosis and maintenance
    (motion sensors, accelerometers, and actuators), and video-assisted applications
    (asset monitoring and augmented reality) [108]. According to TR 22.832, TS 22.104,
    and TR 22.804, [110] as summarized in Table 7, reference use cases and requirements
    are as follows. End-to-end latency is less than 100 ms, and communication services
    are 99.99% available. For all usage situations, the reference bit rate is less
    than 2 Mbps, and the device is immobile. This reference bit rate may be asymmetric,
    such as in high UL traffic [111]. At least a couple of years should pass between
    charges. Safety-related sensors, such as smart factories, require less delay (5
    to 10 ms). Generally, time-critical sensing and feedback, augmented reality, safety-related
    sensors, and remote drone operations are applications in industrial sensors. For
    instance, the goal of the smart grid is to create a more sustainable and efficient-energy
    infrastructure that can meet the needs of an increasingly connected and energy-intensive
    world. In IIoT, a specific application known as the power IoT focuses on smart
    grids to attain automatic optimized data collection and exchange of information,
    as well as smart energy management [116]. 6. Focuses of CIoT technologies One
    of the focuses of the CIoT is to provide extended coverage in areas where traditional
    cellular networks may not reach, including indoor and underground locations and
    remote or rural areas. This reach is achieved using a narrowband frequency for
    better signal penetration and greater range. Another key role of the CIoT is to
    offer efficient and cost-effective connectivity for a broad scope of IoT applications,
    from smart cities and homes to agriculture, transportation, and healthcare. With
    its low-power consumption and ability to facilitate numerous connected devices,
    the CIoT enables a broad range of use cases, including asset tracking, remote
    monitoring, and sensor networks [38]. For instance, international roaming can
    be considered one important focus of the EC-GSM-IoT, minimizing device complexity
    and cost. Because the EC-GSM-IoT has coexisted with 2G mobile networks, it has
    benefited significantly from all the security and privacy features provided by
    mobile networks including various measures to ensure user confidentiality and
    privacy, such as the protection of user identity, authentication protocols, data
    encryption to ensure confidentiality, measures to maintain data integrity, and
    identification of mobile equipment [73]. LTE-M, on the other hand, targets medium-sized
    IoT applications supporting voice and video services. Therefore, it is a better
    candidate technology for over-the-air firmware updates during the life span of
    IoT devices [26]. Unlike the NB-IoT, LTE-M is better suited for mobile devices
    to avoid connection and data loss and provides higher data rates that would enable
    more use cases, such as VoLTE vehicles, fleet management, tracking devices, and
    related use cases [117]. Moreover, LTE-M can be used in video surveillance systems
    because it supports higher data rates and can transmit real-time video data. In
    addition, the NB-IoT is primarily designed for ultralow-end and latency insensitive
    or delay tolerant IoT applications [68]. It focuses on fixed indoor coverage in
    areas where signal loss and multitiered layers have posed problems. NB1 UE, for
    example, operates only in the 200 kHz bandwidth with IoT devices imposing ultralow
    complexity for services without strict data rate, latency, or mobility requirements
    but that requires a massive deployment of low-cost devices [65]. Lastly, according
    to 3GPP and Ericsson [44], [51], RedCap has many use cases and is highly necessary
    to work in extremely harsh environments. RedCap was introduced with lower hardware
    complexity at more affordable prices. It aims for terrestrial coverage and targets
    exchanging data over the satellite with the aim of ubiquitous coverage area (referred
    to as NTN communication) [109]. It is possible to run a RedCap device on an NR
    carrier optimized for eMBB or time-critical communications. The objective of the
    study group on the NR-RedCap has been emphasizing reduced UE complexity, such
    as a reduced number of antennae, reduced UE bandwidth, HD-FDD, and other aspects.
    Compared to high-end eMBB and URLLC devices of Rel. 15/16, the primary driving
    force of the new device type is to reduce device cost and complexity, which is
    true for industrial sensors [109]. The standard must allow for a device design
    with a compact form factor to support most use cases, and all FR1/FR2 bands for
    FDD and time division duplex should be supported by the system [110]. As shown
    in Table 7, video cameras, for instance, lead to higher data-rate requirements
    than can be satisfied by the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT. Smart cities, smart
    farming, smart factories, and other industrial locations have increasingly installed
    surveillance cameras. According to TR 22.804, a reference economic video bitrate
    would be 2 to 4 Mbps with a latency of 500 ms or less and a reliability of 99%
    to 99.9% [110]. High-quality video, for example, for farming, would require 7.5
    to 25 Mbps [30]. As explained in [3], reference bitrates for smart wearable applications
    can range from 5 to 50 Mbps in the DL and 2 to 5 Mbps in the UL. The device’s
    peak bit rates can reach 150 Mbps in the DL and 50 Mbps in the UL [30]. The battery
    should last one to two weeks for wearables, as reviewed in Fig. 7. Rel. 17 for
    RedCap devices introduced power-saving techniques to extend battery life and enable
    longer usage times. These are; eDRX for RRC idle and inactive states and RRM relaxation
    for stationary devices. In eDRX, when DRX cycles are utilized, it can achieve
    up to 10 485.76 s, almost 3 h when the RRC is idle, and up to 10.24 s when the
    RRC is inactive. In demanding RedCap use cases, such as industrial wireless sensors,
    eDRX proves to be a valuable solution in meeting the battery lifetime requirements.
    Regarding the RRM relaxation, in RRC idle and inactive states, the device is required
    to regularly conduct RRM measurements. These measurements are necessary to determine
    and select the best available cell for the device to establish a connection. In
    spite of this, the battery will be depleted even if there is no active data transmission.
    Thus, skip performing RRM measurements under certain thresholds of reference signal
    received power (RSRP) and reference signal received quality (RSRQ) values are
    employed [30]. In addition, the other optional power-saving features, standardized
    in Rel 15 and Rel. 16, are also made available for RedCap devices which offer
    power-saving capabilities to enhance the battery performance. Because of the fast-growing
    need for personal care devices and diagnostics, such as sports, healthcare, and
    fitness devices, wearables have garnered more attention. Devices that are too
    small in size, such as smartwatches, rings, e-health-related devices, and medical
    monitoring devices, are supported by RedCap, which can collect and relay health
    information. The CIoT plays an immense role in healthcare, and healthcare IoT
    (HIoT) is developed and supported by AI, big data, software-defined networks,
    and blockchains [118] with the driving technology; the Internet of Nano Things
    and tactile Internet. The HIoT is implemented in the form of wrist-worn smart
    wearables [119]. As with other IoT application requirements, HIoT prompts low
    latency that can be obtained through edge computing implementation using a large
    volume of data through cloud and edge computing. As most medical applications
    are private, the blockchain has been a solution to secure patient data from third-party
    access risks [120]. In healthcare-based medical operations, it is highly recommended
    to securely transmit sensitive healthcare data to the fog and cloud for processing.
    Ullah et al. [121] recommended fog and cloud-assisted computing as the appropriate
    candidate solutions for these issues. RedCap has an immense role in remote surgery
    applications by integrating wearables, medical sensors, industrial sensors incorporating
    surveillance cameras, and more. For more, we briefly present their detailed features
    in the following sections. 7. Features of CIoT technologies To guarantee that
    CIoT technologies can efficiently provide connectivity solutions for various use
    cases ranging from Massive IoT to Critical IoT, this section outlines essential
    requirements that must be met for the large-scale deployment of these services.
    These include extended coverage areas, low deployment costs, extended battery
    life, affordable device costs, support for a vast number of connected devices
    (scalability), and robust security and privacy measures, we discuss in detail
    as follows. Wide Coverage: Delivering a wider and more extended coverage area
    is one of the main aims of the CIoT. In a wide coverage area, the path range is
    an important parameter that varies inversely with frequency, offering tens of
    kilometers of coverage. Carrier frequency has a significant effect on CE. Although
    the path loss is directly dependent on the size of the carrier frequency, if the
    carrier frequency is high, the propagation loss becomes high. Maintaining a lower
    carrier frequency is important to maximize the coverage in the CIoT to lessen
    propagation loss. For instance, the EC-GSM-IoT is based on the GSM; thus, the
    frequency band of the GSM is highly globally deployed with the four known global
    frequency bands 850, 900, 1800, and 1900 MHz, where coverage is ultimately enhanced
    [73]. Ericsson, Orange, and Intel have tried extending coverage on smart agriculture
    use cases using the EC-GSM-IoT, confirming that it is possible to enhance indoor
    coverage by deploying new software on the existing cellular networks [122]. Moreover,
    CE techniques should be implemented to achieve a wide or deep coverage area (it
    is primarily accomplished by sacrificing the data rate for coverage), which is
    required for two reasons. Implementing reduction techniques in device complexity
    (e.g., minimizing to a single-antenna Rx and lower maximum transmission power)
    may result in performance degradation that directly produces coverage loss. The
    loss of coverage can be maintained by scaling transport block size (TBS), HARQ
    re-transmissions for the physical DL shared channel (PDSCH), PUSCH, physical UL
    control channel (PUCCH), and PDCCH [9], [67]. Second, some CIoT devices could
    encounter extremely difficult coverage circumstances. Hence, transmission time
    interval bundling, sending a limited, predefined number of transmissions without
    feedback instead of sending a block of transmissions once, and narrowband retuning
    are key feature techniques to achieve higher and more extensive coverage. In widening
    the coverage, the objective is to attain a CE of 15 dB compared to GSM and LTE
    [123]. The 3GPP measures CE using the MCL standard, which is the discrepancy between
    the power levels transmitted and received before the signal is lost. Coverage
    can be measured as “kilometers of coverage” but according to the analysis presented
    in [124], it is not adequate since it heavily relies on the carrier frequency
    and environmental factors such as the type of location, whether it is indoors,
    outdoors, urban, suburban, or rural. In contrast, MCL is an appropriate measure
    because it is not influenced by the frequency and environmental aspects. At extreme
    coverage, it is expected to attain 20 dB from the normal LTE or GSM coverage,
    and it is very important to determine exactly how much coverage the CIoTs can
    provide. Apparently, for evaluation, Ericsson, AT and T, KT, SK Telecom by Korea,
    Nokia, Verizon, Altair, Docomo, Sony, SoftBank, TELKOMSEL by Telecom Indonesia,
    Virtuosys, Sequans Communications, KDDI, and Orange conducted a thorough link-level
    simulation inspection to assess the actual coverage performance of 3GPP’s LTE-M
    technology. Their findings discovered that LTE-M is capable of achieving a coverage
    gain of 21 dB compared to older LTE devices, which is higher than the 3GPP target
    of 18 dB. This increase of 21 dB corresponds to a data rate of 1400 bps in the
    DL and 250 bps in the UL. If IoT applications can tolerate slower data rates and
    longer acquisition times, it is possible to achieve a coverage gain beyond 21
    dB without using the BS power spectral density (PSD) boosting [124]. With a 21-dB
    gain with 23 dBm UE (the maximum coverage) and less conservative noise figures,
    LTE-M is a strong competitor for IoT applications that require extensive coverage,
    with a maximum MCL of 164 dB, and where the demands for low latency, high mobility,
    and fast data transfer are less stringent. Moreover, LTE-M has two specifications
    in its CE strategy: Modes A and B. The former mode is mandatory and supports only
    moderate CE, whereas the latter mode, B, supports deep and extended coverage that
    can be considered optional. Common coverage techniques are employed to provide
    CE for the LTE-M specification. The Tx power (e.g., Class 3 power amplifier 23
    dBm and Class 5 power amplifier 20 dBm) is increased by considering the increasing
    cost management, repetition by optimizing accurate channel estimations, and frequency
    tracking to manage the downside of repetition in linearly increasing the latency.
    In addition, PSD boosting improves the DL coverage and reduces the power by employing
    a maximum amount of PSD boosting to 4 dB. These methods are the most feasible
    in CE, as illustrated in [124]. In B5G CIoT [125], a programmable metasurface
    can significantly improve coverage with an intelligent reflecting surface. Through
    the IoT non terrestrial network (NTN) work item in Rel. 17 [91], 3GPP has already
    addressed NTN support for LTE-M and the NB-IoT [114]. Overall, LTE-M can support
    extensive IoT deployments, covering the maximum distance and beyond with the approved
    QoS and minimum maintenance provisions. From the 3GPP standard specification,
    the range of the NB-IoT covers urban and rural areas, outlined as 1 to 2 and 10
    to 15 km, respectively [126], enabling better signal propagation in basements
    (aiming for 20 dB improvement over legacy cellular systems) [127]. A transmission
    time interval bundling, repetition (retransmission, such as 128 and 2,048 times
    in the UL and DL, respectively [89]), and narrowband retuning are employed as
    key features to achieve higher and more extensive coverage. The number of repetitions
    of a transmission is determined by the desired CE level (CEL) for a given set
    of devices. The CEL is the signal strength at a particular location and can be
    influenced by the distance between the Tx and Rx, the transmit power, the Rx sensitivity,
    and interference. The number of tones and sub-carrier spacing, which are the number
    of different frequency components used to transmit data and the distance in frequency
    between adjacent sub-carriers, respectively, also affect the CEL and spectral
    efficiency of a wireless communication system [22]. The increased number of retransmissions
    lowers the spectral efficiency [128], which requires reducing the number of retransmissions.
    However, three CELs are supported by NB-IoT devices: CEL-0 for 0 dB with an MCL
    of 144 dB with a subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz, CEL-1 for 10 dB with an MCL of
    154 dB with 15 kHz spacing, and CEL-2 for 20 dB with an MCL of 164 dB with 3.75
    kHz carrier spacing [79]. In the CE of the NB-IoT, the objective is to attain
    a coverage capacity of 164 dB [123], [129] and guarantee that it can enhance the
    164-dB coverage achieved through repetitions in time, with power amplification
    in in-band and guard-band operation modes [65]. In general, this is preserved
    by implementing repetition, boosting the PSD, reducing the system acquisition
    time, and random-access range enhancement. Based on the findings in [21], the
    coverage of NB-IoT [882 MHz] can be boosted by up to 398% with a mere 10% enhancement
    in Rx sensitivity. Enhancing the coverage by implementing machine learning methods
    using reinforcement learning-based dynamic spectrum access [130] is also feasible.
    The NB-IoT increases the link budget by over 20 dB, significantly enhancing penetration.
    Although reducing the device capabilities can lower the device cost and reduce
    the device size, it has an adverse influence on coverage. For instance, in RedCap,
    reducing the number of antennae and limiting the number of spectrum bands can
    affect device coverage. It is vital to secure the device cost and lower complexity
    simultaneously to enhance the coverage. In RedCap, it is expected to extend 10
    to 15 dB compared to URLLC. Low Power Consumption: Most IoT devices are powered
    by batteries. Therefore, conserving energy to extend their lifespan is vital.
    It is exceptionally demanding to reserve the main power supply by implementing
    longevity in the battery life of the device before recharging is mandated. Devices
    that support lower power consumption have a longer device battery life. In many
    use cases, the CIoTs are supposed to achieve a battery life of up to 10 years.
    The battery usage directly relates to how long the device spends sending and receiving
    data. As research [58] has noted, to maintain a battery life of 5 years, for example,
    a device with a 5000 mAh battery capacity should use no more than 2.74 mAh per
    day. This limit can be achieved by restricting daily battery consumption to below
    5000 mAh/5/365 [58]. Achieving long battery life and reducing maintenance costs
    are critical in applications and equipment with limited battery capacity, which
    makes low energy consumption essential. However, the battery life depends on coverage
    [131]. The objective of 3GPP standards for battery life in the CIoT is to achieve
    10 years of service life in most extreme coverage situations at 164 dB MCL [47]
    (11.9 years is achievable) and 35.7 years at normal coverage (144 dB MCL) [84].
    This feature can also save costs in areas where replacing batteries can be a challenging
    task, such as basements or subterranean tunnels. In minimizing power consumption,
    EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, and NB-IoT utilize techniques including the power-saving mode
    (PSM) [132], [133], [134], long periodic tracking area updates (TAU), and eDRX
    which are developed by the 3GPP standards to reduce energy consumption and enable
    an extended life for these devices [80]. The PSM allows modules to enter a sleep
    mode that consumes very little energy (only a few microamps) while sending TAU
    messages at long intervals to remain registered on the network. This approach
    eliminates the need for reregistration when the module wakes. The eDRX feature
    allows devices to enter a low-power paging mode for an extended period of time,
    during which they can receive data from the server but do not need to send data,
    saving power when the device does not need to transmit. In eDRX, an extension
    of 52 min is possible. The PSM can use paging in the DRX or jointly use paging
    and routing area updates (via incoming SMS, voice call, or data) to reach the
    CIoT devices on the network. For devices that prefer a lower periodicity of reachability,
    using eDRX is more advantageous; however, for devices that can tolerate longer
    intervals of inaccessibility, the PSM emerges as an appealing alternative. Furthermore,
    implementing GMSK modulation in the EC-GSM-IoT, for instance, influences power
    and energy efficiency. The enhanced coverage common control channel (eCCCH)can
    also contribute to energy efficiency, providing long battery life. Other energy-saving
    techniques besides PSM and eDRX have been developed and employed, such as energy-efficient
    TAU, user and control plane optimizations, energy-efficient paging reception,
    wake-up signal (WUS) calls, and techniques for monitoring cells less frequently.
    Furthermore, RedCap power consumption is anticipated to be significantly (2 to
    4 times) lower than that of Rel. 16 eMBB, resulting in minimized power usage.
    The battery life is expected to span 1 to 3 years. In Rel. 17, 3GPP suggested
    improvements for UE power conservation in the idle or inactive mode while considering
    system performance factors to address the power consumption problem. They studied
    and specified improvements to power-saving methods for connected UE, with the
    least possible influence on system performance [3]. Based on power-saving techniques
    proposed in Rel. 17 for RedCap devices, in the idle and inactive state, eDRX cycles
    are almost 3 h and 10.24 s, respectively. This approach better extends the battery
    life [67] in the stringent use case of industrial wireless sensors, for example.
    In addition to eDRX, the relaxation of frequent radio resource management (RRM)
    to secure the exact camping in its idle and inactive state can avoid the drainage
    of batteries, primarily in stationary devices. In general, potential power consumption-saving
    techniques include reducing the duration the device spends checking the control
    channel for scheduling, lengthening the device sleep time by extending the DRX
    period, and allowing for less frequent measurements for stationary devices. In
    the long run, a very high energy-efficiency technology is expected, supporting
    battery-free IoT devices, such as self-driving cars, drones, and auto-robots [135].
    The most important area of research in the IoT is energy efficiency, especially
    in IIoT, to preserve moderate power consumption [136]. According to [28], energy-saving
    methods can be maintained in three ways: configurations (including traffic models,
    connectivity periods, and DRX cycles), software modification (comprising improved
    radio layer protocols, changes have been made to the scheduling request procedures
    for accessing radio channel resources, as well as the introduction of new software
    entities in the core network to improve communication in both the UL and DL directions),
    and hardware integration (embedding a low-power Rx by deactivating the main Rx).
    In [137], energy efficiency or low power consumption can be achieved by eliminating
    transmission between nodes using the star topology, maintaining a straightforward
    node design, and using narrowband channels for reduced noise and an extended transmission
    range. Based on [138], the joint optimization of user selection, power allocation,
    and antenna selection while fulfilling the QoS requirements has a prior role in
    maximizing energy efficiency under imperfect channel state information. In most
    IoT devices, the channel state information is imperfect due to the functional
    limitations and mobility, as stated in [139]. In addition, an advanced energy-harvesting
    technique called simultaneous wireless information and power transfer is another
    promising solution to achieve energy-efficient green communication. Chen et al.
    developed a two-layer iterative algorithm to manage inter- and intra-beam interferences
    by leveraging the Dinkelbach method [140] for energy maximizing by allocating
    power at the base station and splitting power at each IoT node. The other promising
    solution is HARQ feedback. Transmitting a positive HARQ-ACK over MPDCCH in a UL
    data center interconnect is now possible [141]. This approach enables early termination
    of the UL (PUSCH) transmission or early termination of the DL (MPDCCH) monitoring
    (for FD-FDD or time division duplex but not HD-FDD). It allows the BS to notify
    the UE that UL data have been successfully received using two HARQ processes and
    10 HARQ processes with a beneficial effect. In addition, cell reselection with
    relaxed monitoring is a good option. When enabled, the UE can reduce neighbor
    cell measurements to once every 24 h [25]. This approach can significantly lower
    power usage, especially for fixed UE in difficult coverage situations. Moreover,
    resynchronization signal (RSS) better improves energy economy when a device needs
    to regain synchronization with a cell’s time and frequency [5]. Researchers from
    academics and industry have been studying solutions and techniques to address
    power consumption issues, including energy harvesting [142], [143], [144], sporadic
    transmission, resource allocation, clustering, zonal thermal pattern analysis
    for smart agriculture, and energy-efficient adaptive health monitoring system
    for smart health applications [14]. In [145], RF energy harvesting on the strength
    of RF signals was cheaper to implement and available in difficult-to-reach places
    where other popular sources, such as solar or wind, may not be accessible. Moreover,
    accurate computation and efficient communication are critical for numerous devices
    to reduce power usage. Developing communication systems that are energy-efficient,
    both in terms of system design and hardware is vital to mitigate power problems
    [146]. Over-the-air computation was proposed as a promising solution [147]. In
    [148], energy-harvesting strategies for operating low-power network devices using
    long-lasting IoT devices and sensors were studied, enabling them to be self-powered
    and providing devices with long standby intervals. Network parameter settings
    affect energy consumption and network performance, and [149] found that the paging
    interval set by the BS has the greatest effect on energy consumption when the
    device is connected. Low Cost: In the CIoT, installing or maintaining local networks
    or gateways is unnecessary. The sensor can connect directly to the desired system
    or network, which maintains the cost [27]. Maintaining low power consumption facilitates
    low device costs, which can be achieved by reducing Tx and Rx bandwidths. Current
    costs run between $10 and $15 per module, with a long-term goal of reaching $5.
    The GSM, for instance, is the main player in machine-to-machine communications
    because of its reduced cost compared to other technology. As a result of the expiration
    of the device module patents in GSM networks, compared to other 3GPP-defined technology,
    the cost of the EC-GSM-IoT module is the most economical in developing countries
    [27], [52], less than $10, where 2G, 3G are deployed. The EC-GSM-IoT module cost
    is $5.5 and $2.9 in 2016 and 2020 [150], [151], respectively. It is because of
    the overall cost of deployment, network coverage (which can balance the economy
    of vendors, particularly in the Asian and African continents), maturity (the presence
    of a more mature ecosystem comprising a wide range of compatible devices, and
    applications), lower complexity, and lower frequency band specificity. The other
    player in achieving ultralow-cost devices is the implementation of a GMSK-only
    modulation. Moreover, for cost reduction, according to the analysis of [152],
    the trend reveals a 10-times reduction in 1G and 2G, respectively, and a 1000-times
    reduction from 3G to 6G. In contrast, the NB-IoT has many design trade-offs to
    achieve low-cost goals, resulting in a simplified, low-complexity system with
    a lower data rate. One of these trade-offs is the lack of carrier aggregation,
    a technique that combines multiple carriers (or frequency bands) to increase the
    available data rate. Carrier aggregation requires additional hardware and processing
    resources, increasing the cost and complexity of NB-IoT devices. Similarly, NB-IoT
    does not support voice services or multi-stream transmissions in the DL/UL direction.
    These features would also require additional hardware and processing resources,
    which would be incompatible with the low-power and low-cost requirements of the
    NB-IoT. Instead, the NB-IoT provides simple, low-data-rate communication for IoT
    applications that do not require high-bandwidth or real-time services [80]. However,
    the NB-IoT can operate alongside the existing GSM and LTE networks, which can
    help lower deployment costs. The device cost is related to the complexity of baseband
    processing, memory consumption, and RF requirements. Valuable cost reductions
    can be achieved from various modifications associated with narrowband operations,
    power reduction mechanisms, and the simplification of a physical layer [14]. The
    NB-IoT module cost is achieved $4 and $2-3 in 2016 and 2020 [150], [151] per module,
    respectively which is more effective in urban environments where 5G requirements
    are in hand. Regarding LTE-M devices, they could achieve a similar cost to GSM
    devices by simplifying the design of the end devices. Due to its compatibility
    with existing LTE radio systems, LTE-M can be easily deployed through a simple
    software upgrade to meet the cost optimization needs of IoT applications, building
    upon the foundation of LTE technology. Taking into consideration the market scale,
    the module cost for LTE-M is less than $10, making it an affordable option [153]
    by incorporating various optimizations to enhance efficiency and reduce complexity.
    These optimizations include incorporating half-duplex operations (i.e., less complex
    and less costly), reduced transmission mode (TM) support, minimizing the number
    of blind decodings required for control channel reception, and eliminating simultaneous
    reception. As elaborated in [150], [151], the LTE-M module cost achieved $5 in
    2016 and $3.3 in 2020. On the other hand, compared to standard NR UE, RedCap UE
    is substantially simpler due to the half-duplex operation, which means that the
    UE is not required to transmit and receive simultaneously, a smaller number of
    radio RX antenna branches (reducing the antenna configuration, can reduce the
    device size), and a smaller radio Tx bandwidth. As a result of the projected decreased
    complexity, devices are expected to be more affordable, enabling the use of NR
    in novel applications, such as industrial sensor networks [44]. In conclusion,
    these requirements are achieved through careful configurations, properly adjusting
    the traffic profile (the frequency and number of data transmitted and received
    by the UE), coverage situation (under normal, robust, and extreme coverage scenarios),
    and network settings [154]. Low Complexity: Simplified network topology and deployment
    is one component of the CIoT that the EC-GSM-IoT, for instance, highly fulfills.
    It only requires software upgrades in the existing GSM networks [122]. In addition,
    by simplifying the modulation scheme used for transmitting data over the air instead
    of using more complex modulation schemes, such as 16 quadrature amplitude modulation
    (QAM) or 64 QAM used in traditional GSM networks, the low-complexity mode of EC-GSM-IoT
    employs a simpler modulation scheme called GMSK. This approach reduces the complexity
    of the transceiver hardware required to implement the technology. Keeping the
    device complexity ultralow to secure a low-cost device is expected to support
    the large-scale deployment of millions of devices. Indeed, the EC-GSM-IoT technology,
    for example, is an advanced version of the EGPRS technology, which already satisfies
    the necessary requirements without any need for further complexity reduction [73].
    The goal of LTE-M, for example, was to drastically reduce the complexity and cost
    compared to the preceding LTE device categories. In addition to reducing complexity,
    LTE-M aims to handle a broad range of mMTC use cases, including demanding high-throughput
    and low-latency applications. Under the 3GPP cost reduction analysis and techniques
    [155], employing the following methods can provide remarkable complexity reductions
    in LTE-M: reduction of the maximum bandwidth (from 20 to 1.4 MHz), a single-receive
    radio frequency (RF) chain (from 2 to 1), a reduction of the peak rate (from 10
    to 1 Mbps), a reduction of transmit power (from 23 to 20, or 14 dBm), half-duplex
    instead of a full-duplex operation, and a reduction of supported DL transmission
    modes. Furthermore, securing low device complexity is required to boost the QoE
    and QoS in IoT applications. The device complexity is related to the complexity
    of baseband processing, memory consumption, and transmit-and-receive antenna (RF
    requirements). In NB-IoT, for instance, low complexity can be secured by reducing
    the TBS, accommodating only single-stream transmissions, supporting only a single
    HARQ process for both the DL and UL, adapting only one redundancy version in the
    DL, applying a low sampling rate due to lower UE bandwidth NB-IoT support, and
    allowing only HD-FDD operation [68]. Additionally, synchronization in the modulation
    and demodulation process requires higher computation. However, the NB-IoT has
    been specifically designed to facilitate low-complexity Rx processing in such
    operations. The RedCap, in addition, is also developed to be lower in complexity
    compared to the standard NR via narrowing the bandwidth, reducing the number of
    DL MIMO layers, the transmit antennas, the receive antennas, and so on. Mass Device
    Connection and Global Deployment: Massive connectivity is the key component in
    IoT applications to provide and offer the intended services to society. Mass device
    connectivity pertains to the number of devices that meet a specific QoS within
    a given area, typically measured in terms of square kilometers. As a result of
    the CIoT’s low complexity features and high demands and expectations, deploying
    a massive number of IoT devices is demanded. As concluded in [147], the present
    CIoT technology is efficient, and developing 6G CIoT is essential. Massive numbers
    of device connections are vital when expanding coverage is needed. According to
    [101], low-orbit satellites have been identified as an efficient option for delivering
    long-range IoT services with good coverage and latency by supporting numerous
    connections. Furthermore, the International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication
    Sector (ITU-R) [41] has established a firm requirement for International Mobile
    Telecommunications (IMT) 2020 systems that mandates a connection density of one
    million devices per square kilometer. For instance, the GSM has been deployed
    for over 30 years. A round 50% and 25% of subscriptions are made in developing
    countries in Africa and the Middle East, respectively, according to Ericsson’s
    November 2022 report [156]. The GSM networks are widely covered and deployed worldwide,
    making connecting devices feasible, which means that the EC-GSM-IoT can be deployed
    in most regions without significant additional infrastructure. Hence, the deployment
    of the EC-GSM-IoT is feasible worldwide. It can also accommodate massive device
    connections with at least 50,000 nodes per cell [66]. 3GPP has been developed
    enhancements to support more devices per cell. For instance, optimizing resource
    allocation in IoT communication systems is critical in supporting many IoT devices.
    In [157], the authors devised a two-step optimization technique for UL transmission
    using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on deep learning. This approach
    is capable of optimizing the assignment of sub-bands and controlling transmit
    power with outcomes of low complexity, and it can accommodate a large number of
    devices. Moreover, regarding enabling numerous IoT device connections, [158] introduced
    leveraging the unlicensed spectrum in addition to exploiting the licensed spectrum.
    From the Technical Specifications Group RAN work group of TR-45.820 [32], [43],
    [159], for only one PRB (12 × 15 kHz), the NB-IoT, for example, can hold more
    than 52,500 pieces of UE per cell, in some scenarios, it also supports 72,000
    devices [160]. NB-IoT enables the connection of up to 100,000 end devices at the
    expense of complexity and cost [28], [75], [134] within single-cell, and its capacity
    can be obtained by incorporating multiple NB-IoT carriers of 200 kHz. In this
    configuration, one anchor carrier is dedicated to carrying the always-on broadcast
    signaling, while additional carriers (non-anchor carriers) are utilized for offloading
    data traffic and enhancing capacity. Moreover, enhancement objectives include
    designing positioning support (horizontal) targeting at least 50-m accuracy; extending
    the single cell point to multi-point network to support the CIoT for multicast
    DL transmissions (namely firmware or software updates and group message delivery);
    specifying new UE power classes (e.g., 14 dBm) to enable lower maximum transmit
    power suitable for small form-factor batteries, mobility, and service continuity
    enhancements; UL enhancements to reduce device power consumption further; and
    enhancements to support voice [93]. Improved Security: Given the growing importance
    of IoT devices in various industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation,
    ensuring the security of things is critical to protecting sensitive data and ensuring
    the safe operation of these devices. Every CIoT technology option necessitates
    that both the network and the mobile station employ an enhanced and strong security
    framework. They have got a significant benefit from all the security and privacy
    mobile network features comprising user identity confidentiality, authentication,
    confidentiality, data integrity, and mobile equipment identification since it
    is operating in the licensed spectrum sharing all the advantages of standards-based
    technologies. For instance, EC-GSM-IoT has an LTE-grade security to improve end
    user security for the sake of removing any security concerns. The security measures
    currently in place for GSM technology have significantly contributed to enhancing
    security in EC-GSM-IoT. These procedures involve mutual authentication of both
    the device and the network during connection establishment, employment of 64-bit
    long encryption and 128-bit ciphering algorithms for better encryption, rejection
    of incompatible networks, and protection of control plane integrity [75]. Most
    importantly, the integration of existing CIoT technologies with 5G is done. This
    integration allows for enhanced security mechanisms across the network, addressing
    issues of authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) for a wide range
    of interconnected IoT devices. In general, in CIoT, extending coverage, reducing
    power consumption, lowering device complexity, reducing device cost, enhancing
    massive connectivity, and enhancing positioning are the foremost required features
    to maintain during CIoT communication by all mobile network operators, organizations,
    and companies. As shown in Fig. 8, coverage extension techniques can be incorporated,
    such as repetition and bundling, direct interface side-links or relays, and reducing
    the subcarrier spacing. For example, asset tracking, fleet management, and smart
    cities all rely on accurate positioning data to function effectively and maintain
    position enhancement. Hence, observed time-difference-of-arrival positioning,
    enhanced cell-ID positioning, UL time difference of arrival positioning, location
    positioning protocol, assisted global navigation satellite systems, and centimeter-level
    positioning techniques have been integrated. Solutions for reducing power consumption
    include lowering the transmit power by introducing new classes of UE, enhancing
    power-saving modes (PSM, eDRX, and WUS), and limiting mobility and handovers.
    Narrowing the bandwidth and reducing the number of DLs, multiple-input multiple-output
    layers, and Tx or Rx antennae minimize device complexity. Moreover, reducing signaling
    overhead, simplifying the core network architecture (network elements, interfaces,
    and protocols), and employing better resource management techniques can enhance
    network efficiency. Further, reducing device costs and Tx and Rx bandwidths, minimizing
    the device complexity, reusing the available spectrum and technology, and lowering
    order modulations can play a vital role in using the devices and removing marketing
    barriers. Download : Download high-res image (678KB) Download : Download full-size

    CIoT technologies CIoT technologies have a wide range of applications and can
    be used to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the quality of life in
    various industries and sectors. Table 8 presents applications better suited for
    the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap. The EC-GSM-IoT is fundamentally designed
    to offer coverage for machine-to-machine communications (direct communication
    with each other without the need for human involvement) in areas with challenging
    radio coverage conditions. However, the 2G-GSM and 3G-Universal Mobile Telecommunications
    System (UMTS) wireless networks are winding down, and some mobile network operators
    plan to phase out their GSM and UMTS networks soon [83]. The EC-GSM, LTE-M, NB-IoT,
    and RedCap can be employed in areas of applications including; smart cities (waste
    and traffic management), smart environments (building automation; urban safety;
    and intelligent environment monitoring), smart metering (electricity, water, gas,
    and parking spot meters), asset tracking and smart logistics [154], localization,
    farming (monitoring livestock), forestry, industry pallets and pipelines [18],
    [161], and intelligent transportation (e.g., logistics services, and traveling
    time estimation) [23]. Moreover, the LTE and NB-IoT can work with the low and
    geostationary earth orbit satellites to support NTN, studied in Rel. 17 on the
    NB-IoT and LTE-M for NTN [31]. Under the IoT over NTN projects [91], for instance,
    UAVs [162] can use LTE-M to develop low-latency energy-efficient communication
    techniques and power-efficient computing modules [163] in military applications
    to track enemy locations. The feasibility of integrating the NB-IoT into the NTN
    [70] was investigated to extend the coverage in challenging environments like
    mountains, deserts, and oceans [164]. In the same objective, NR-RedCap is designed
    based on the 5G NR requirements, so its application is vital. The 5G is becoming
    prominent in the healthcare industry, automotive industry, smart cars, manufacturing
    sector, smart factories, smart grids, and smart cities [53], which substantially
    affects the IoT but has high costs and complexity issues compared to RedCap. Due
    to its lower cost and low-complexity features, RedCap is further becoming manifested
    in IoT applications that target mission-critical aspects (that require low latency,
    ultra-reliability, high security, and high data rates) [57] and time-sensitive
    IoT connectivity like emergency response, health-care services, disaster mitigation,
    and related cases in which these applications require faster and more reliable
    performance than other applications, and their connectivity must be guaranteed
    to be safe and resilient. Industrial wireless sensor networks, video surveillance
    cameras, and wearables (e.g., smartwatches, rings, eHealth-related devices, and
    medical monitoring devices) are some use cases for RedCap [67], [108]. Hence,
    these envisioned use cases have specific requirements regarding data rate, latency,
    battery life, reliability, and other factors. As of today, CIoTs are being applied
    in the following application areas. Smart Agriculture: Smart agriculture is one
    of the key application scenarios in the IoT industry [165]. Via CIoTs connectivity,
    farmers and cities can capture data from environmental sensors for management.
    The reason is that they can access places that are hard to reach, such as remote
    areas where agriculture or infrastructure sensors are installed. Due to this,
    monitoring the soil temperature and humidity and tracking the existing land features,
    rain, and pollution are some of the activities farmers can perform using EC-GSM-IoT,
    LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap [24], [166]. In Africa, specifically, farmers are utilizing
    multiple interconnected sensors in their fields to identify the optimal planting
    and harvesting periods for specific crops by leveraging EC-GSM-IoT technology
    [76], [167]. LTE-M and NB-IoT have a role in smart agriculture. Moreover, RedCap
    is expected to be used in cooperative farm machinery in the near future. Minimizing
    water waste will be vital to advancing agricultural processes based on real-time
    monitoring and predictive data analytics via remote sensing [13]. Smart Grid and
    Meter: CIoT technologies play a significant role in application areas, such as
    smart metering, smart grid management with strong coverage requirements, and low
    power use scenarios (e.g., water and gas) since they can access places that are
    hard to reach, such as deep basements where smart meters are installed. They are
    well-suited for connecting many remote smart meters to a central data collection
    point, allowing utility companies to remotely monitor energy consumption and manage
    their networks more efficiently, leading to cost savings and improved customer
    service [168]. Through the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap, in smart grid
    applications; electricity is efficiently transmitted and distributed, power is
    recovered rapidly after a fault occurs, maintenance costs are reduced, and security
    and protection. They can remotely control and monitor energy-consuming devices,
    such as air-conditioning and heating systems, to reduce energy consumption during
    peak demand periods [37], [169], [170], [171] with the support of numerous (more
    than 10,000 devices in a cell) smart grid devices. Indeed, a smart grid management
    system is the main operational demand for power control, enabling two-way communication
    between providers and consumers. For instance, according to the investigation
    in [171], demand–response techniques are pivotal to addressing power outage problems,
    reducing cost, and increasing reliability. Intelligent Transportation: Tracking
    and monitoring vehicles intelligently is crucial for transportation companies
    and vehicle owners. Hence, 3GPP identified the vehicle-to-everything communication
    types [33]: vehicle to vehicle, vehicle to infrastructure, vehicle to pedestrian,
    and vehicle to network. In intelligent transportation, vehicle-to-vehicle communication,
    vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, autonomous/semi autonomous driving, and
    in-car infotainment systems emerged [57]. The CIoT technologies can also assist
    drivers in various ways, such as providing real-time traffic and weather information,
    route planning, and parking assistance; improving the driving experience; and
    reducing the risk of accidents. In intelligent transportation, fleet management
    applications are most in demand [172] including; monitoring fuel consumption and
    scheduling maintenance and repairs. Moreover, LTE-M is well-suited for applications
    requiring voice and data communications, such as telemetry and remote control
    systems. Hence, LTE-M is well-suited for fleet management applications because
    it supports voice and data communication and can track the location and status
    of vehicles in real-time. For transportation systems to be effective, they need
    to be quick, dependable, and adaptable. By implementing the CIoT-based Internet
    of Vehicles, drivers can receive real-time traffic updates, monitor speed limits,
    and subsequently reduce traffic congestion and accidents. In smart parking, for
    instance, data can be transmitted and received in real-time, enabling immediate
    updates to park availability and other information. The available CIoTs can improve
    efficiency, reduce parking costs, and improve the overall user experience [173].
    For some IoT use cases with stationary mobility in intelligent transportation,
    for instance, all CIoT technologies are applicable. NB-IoT, despite its limited
    mobility characteristics, can be considered applicable for smart transportation.
    The devices are often deployed in fixed locations, such as road sensors, infrastructure
    components, or stationary objects along roadways. These devices collect and transmit
    various transportation-related data including real-time tracking, traffic analysis
    (traffic conditions, environmental factors), parking space reservation (often
    involves parking in the basement), location navigation, vehicle management, and
    enable communication between vehicles [174]. Overall, using EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M,
    NB-IoT, and RedCap for intelligent transportation systems helps reduce travel
    time, fuel consumption, and environmental effects and can improve the overall
    travel experience for passengers and drivers. Smart City: Smart cities have a
    high level of technology integration and are distinguished by the extensive use
    of information and communication methods [175]. Due to the current urbanization
    demands worldwide, the smart city concept has been extended from smart offices
    and smart homes to smart buildings. In the framework of smart cities, applications,
    such as environmental sensors, smart grids, predictive maintenance, utility meters,
    high-definition security cameras, smart parking, smart traffic management, smart
    city sensors system for irrigation, and smart street lighting are included, and
    supported by CIoT systems [153], [176], [177]. A smart city cuts costs, increases
    resource consumption efficiency, engages with inhabitants more actively during
    emergencies, and greatly reduces labor costs. Controlling street lights, assessing
    free parking spaces, monitoring environmental conditions, and inspecting road
    conditions are some of the daily administrative tasks performed by city bodies.
    Furthermore, in each layer of IoT applications (i.e., in smart cities), security
    and privacy are daily concerns for safety [178]. Noteworthy to know a smart city
    can be considered a package comprising applications, including intelligent environmental
    monitoring, intelligent transportation, smart street lighting, smart grid, smart
    metering, smart homes, and the like. These applications are demanding the use
    of deep learning-based techniques, for example, in smart lighting [24], [179]
    of smart garbage detection systems that can recognize garbage more accurately,
    reducing the necessary deployment costs and material resources. Smart Homes and
    Buildings: One of CIoT’s rapidly expanding markets is smart homes. The primary
    focus behind the smart home philosophy is preserving energy [79]. Recently, the
    CIoT has offered a powerful and flexible way to control and monitor various aspects
    of the home, providing convenience, energy reduction, and enhanced security [180].
    Various ECG-SM-IoT, LTE-m, NB-IoT, and RedCap devices can be deployed in the living
    room, kitchen, bathrooms, and other rooms. In addition, the devices can be used
    for video surveillance monitoring [177]. For example, homeowners can access remote
    lighting controls, monitor their children, and turn devices on and off while commuting
    to and from work. In emergencies, such as smoke and hazard incidents, installing
    CIoT devices in a smart home is beneficial. Examples of applications that can
    utilize these CIoT’s building penetration capability include monitoring utility
    usage (e.g., smart heat), enhancing security in residential properties, smoke
    detectors, and managing energy consumption in household appliances [24]. Smart
    Environmental Monitoring: Environmental monitoring is a wider concept comprising
    both natural and human environmental phenomena involving rural-agricultural and
    urban-city-oriented monitoring. It includes monitoring air, soil, water, traffic
    volumes, city infrastructure, and other aspects. The existing CIoT cellular network
    can provide intelligent services [181] by incorporating a wireless sensor network
    to automate data acquisition for easy data analysis. These intelligent services
    optimize resource usage, reduce waste, and increase energy efficiency by providing
    real-time data on environmental conditions [182], [183]. It can also be used for
    monitoring the location of wild animals, observing their habitats, and recognizing
    their behaviors. Furthermore, the role of the EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap
    in intelligent environment monitoring involves public health and safety in identifying
    and mitigating possible environmental hazards and extreme weather conditions.
    Smart Tracking: Vertical industries, including transportation, logistics, and
    manufacturing, have a high demand for tracking and monitoring the location and
    movement of physical assets, such as vehicles, equipment, and inventory. Installing
    or attaching global positioning system trackers or RF identification tags onto
    assets and communicating their location and status to the central system optimizes
    operations (e.g., routes in logistics companies) by delivering real-time updates
    on the location, movement, and condition of the assets (e.g., temperature). Hence,
    EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap are useful in tracking shipping, monitoring
    drivers and goods, and obtaining diagnostics and reports across moving operations
    in industry [153], [184], contributing to efficiency improvement, cost reduction,
    and customer service enhancement. Note that when continuous tracking is not required
    NB-IoT can be taken as a good method. In addition to enabling real-time tracking
    and monitoring, they can also provide other benefits in asset tracking systems,
    such as the ability to monitor the condition of the assets and alert maintenance
    personnel when repairs are needed, reducing downtime and improving the overall
    efficiency of the tracking system. Smart Hospitals: Healthcare is the most important
    concern in the era of smart life projects, with a high priority [177]. Wearable
    devices, such as fitness trackers or sports wearables, smartwatches, and smart
    clothing, can track and monitor location and movements and provide identification,
    authentication, data collection, and sensing, including patient vital signs, such
    as heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. Moreover, implantable devices,
    such as pacemakers and defibrillators, can monitor the heart, or sensors can monitor
    a segment of an organ (i.e., the lungs or kidneys). A periodic update of training
    data and message reception is possible with the NB-IoT and LTE-M in normal conditions
    [190]. Similar to LTE-M and NB-IoT, EC-GSM-IoT is also suitable for low data rate
    healthcare applications. To enhance patient outcomes and lower healthcare expenses
    through the implementation of telemedicine and remote patient monitoring systems,
    EC-GSM-IoT, NB-IoT, LTE-M, and RedCap are suggested for healthcare applications.
    These technologies offer swift data transfer, energy efficiency, broad communication
    coverage, dependable performance, the ability to handle large data volumes, and
    human tissue safety. Their accurate localization capabilities enable them to address
    clinical care in the hospital and remote patient care. Furthermore, they can be
    utilized to acquire medical reports at regular intervals and receive alerts triggered
    by specific events. Additionally, it enables real-time, two-way medical control
    and monitoring of health conditions through live video feeds. General applications
    in health care systems, including remote patient monitoring, medical asset tracking,
    wellness-tracking wearables, and secure data collection protecting patient data
    privacy [16], can be supported by the current CIoT technologies. Table 8. CIoT

    as well. Smart city [24], [76], [117], [167], [168], [175] ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ The EC-GSM-IoT,
    LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap can be utilized for broad smart city applications including

    play a pivotal role in tracking and monitoring assets and their states in industries
    (transportation, logistics, and manufacturing). Smart hospitals [61], [66], [167],
    [188] ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Because of their fast data transfer, optimized energy consumption,
    rapid data transfer, wide-ranging communication reach, high reliability, capacity
    to handle significant data loads, and safety for human tissue, the EC-GSM-IoT,
    NB-IoT, LTE-M, and RedCap are recommended for healthcare applications to improve
    patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs by implementing telemedicine and
    remote patient monitoring systems. Video surveillance cameras [110], [153] ✓ ✓
    LTE-M and RedCap are used for remote monitoring and surveillance applications
    in various industries, in cooperative farm machinery for example, to assist in
    monitoring crops, livestock, and so on. Industry IoT [8], [66], [111] ✓ ✓ ✓ NB-IoT,
    LTE-M, and RedCap are used in monitoring equipment status, controlling processes,
    and ensuring factory safety. Wearables [1], [189] ✓ ✓ ✓ LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap
    have the ability to provide assistance for wearable devices, such as smartwatches,
    which typically necessitate voice functionality, portability, and fast data transfer
    rates for connectivity to the Internet. Wearables: Devices equipped with NB-IoT
    technology enable real-time monitoring of energy consumption, enabling utilities
    to enhance energy management and improve the efficiency of health monitoring.
    Moreover, in the context of wearables, the ability to support mobility and high
    data rates is critical, as is the ability to support VoLTE. For this reason, LTE-M
    and RedCap are emerging as strong candidates for powering the next generation
    of wearable devices. In applications such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, and
    medical wearables, crucial data can be extracted based on various metrics, including
    heart rate, sleep patterns, and activity levels. These real-time data are sent
    over LTE-M and RedCap networks to be analyzed by the responsible authorized individuals
    (e.g., doctors and caregivers) or organizations [118]. Importantly, LTE-M and
    RedCap support movement so that it is possible to monitor users anywhere in motion,
    such as runners, to track their well-being [189]. The utilization of wearable
    devices potentially simplifies self-care for elderly individuals, for instance.
    Hence, wearable devices equipped with NB-IoT, LTE-M, and RedCap technology have
    the capability to track and record an individual’s physical activity, heart rate,
    body temperature, and other health-related data. Video Surveillance Cameras: Due
    to their support of high data rate and video capturing, LTE-M and RedCap are the
    candidate CIoT technologies in video surveillance camera services. Smart cities,
    smart farming, smart factories, and other industrial locations have increasingly
    installed surveillance cameras. In LTE-M, for example, the Cat-M2 UE category
    supports multimedia IoT applications such as voice and video which have a maximum
    TBS of 4008 bits in the DL and 6968 bits in the UL good for video surveillance
    applications. Moreover, for high-quality video, RedCap plays a significant role.
    Industry IoT: The LTE-M, NB-IoT, and RedCap sensors can be used in the prediction
    of machine failure in the factory. Note that the NB-IoT is not suitable for moving
    objects, so the device is assumed to be battery-powered in a fixed location in
    the factory, requiring two-way communication to upgrade the firmware and software
    [191]. It has a significant role in real-time applications and is more suitable
    for industrial systems that require real-time communication without mobility requirements.
    Even though the NB-IoT supports only up to QPSK modulation that limits its data
    rate, spectral efficient frequency division multiplexing has been proposed, which
    uses higher modulation formats; however, it has drawbacks in energy consumption.
    The authors of [192] developed a two-dimensional channel-aware adaptive modulation
    scheme that improves network performance while maintaining energy efficiency to
    solve this problem. On the other hand, LTE-M and RedCap are the prominent technologies
    for IIoTs since they support mobility and high data rates. Moreover, RedCap is
    objectively developed for such use cases including wearables and video surveillance
    cameras, which we discuss under the RedCap section in detail. 9. Future challenges
    The proposed solutions are explicitly explored as part of the CIoT use-case specifications
    by the 3GPP working group. Most requirements set by the study groups in various
    release versions have been met as promised and planned. Indeed, CIoT has gained
    attention globally due to its cost-effective, ubiquitous coverage with ease of
    deployment of massive MTC and URLLC and several feasible reasons. However, there
    are further challenges that need to be resolved. Congestion Problems: Overcrowding
    or congestion is a significant challenge in the CIoT with a very high concentration
    of devices, as there are limited resources available to handle the numerous sporadic
    access attempts made by a diverse range of MTC devices [26]. With a massive number
    of devices, an enormous number of simultaneous access requests occurs, causing
    congestion in the physical random-access channel, resulting in network access
    delays [193]. For instance, if multiple machine-type devices transmit the same
    preamble simultaneously, they cause the access requests to fail so that access
    efficiency decreases and the number of supported devices reduces. Hence, optimized
    node clustering and data aggregation have been employed as candidate solutions
    to address congestion [194]. Kim and Bang [195] proposed a random-access parallelization
    technique to support multiple preambles, enabling each IoT device to attempt multiple
    instances of random access in parallel to mitigate collisions. In addition, the
    preamble (re)transmission limit [196] is adopted in the UE MAC layer. In contrast,
    network slicing is another promising method to improve the efficiency of resource
    utilization [57], [197] by allocating resources dynamically between slices, providing
    QoS in congestion situations and end-to-end communication. Furthermore, a study
    [198] introduced a recursive access class barring technique to use the available
    resources optimally, obtaining an optimized service time and average access delay
    compared to the conventional access class barring schemes. Despite these solutions,
    as the massive number of devices expands, the reliability of access, data transmission,
    and energy consumption are inevitably questioned. Very High Signaling Overhead
    per Data Packet: In the CIoT, signaling overhead becomes a significant issue when
    considerable signaling is required for each data packet a device sends. Very high
    signaling overhead per data packet can occur when frequent updates or small amounts
    of data are sent from the device. Cellular networks are optimized for larger data
    packets, and when small data packets are sent frequently, the overhead required
    to establish and maintain the connection becomes a significant proportion of the
    overall communication. However, it is particularly problematic in scenarios where
    devices are battery-powered and have limited energy resources, such as IoT devices
    where a device sends small data packets infrequently. The signaling required to
    establish and maintain the connection can become a bottleneck. It can significantly
    increase network traffic, causing issues, such as network congestion, increased
    latency, and energy consumption [52] on the device and network sides, and reduced
    overall performance. Although data packets transmitted by IoT devices are typically
    small, the high signaling overhead required per packet can always become a significant
    issue for IoT devices [199]. Various signaling reduction techniques can address
    these issues, such as message queuing, efficient protocols, and optimized network
    coverage [200]. Studying more appropriate methods is crucial for scheduling transmissions
    and reducing signaling overhead in extremely dense environments using advanced
    techniques, such as machine learning to overcome these challenges in the ultra-dense
    CIoT to meet service requirements, such as latency, battery life, and accuracy.
    Scalability/Massive Connection: There has been a surge in demand for CIoT connectivity,
    especially in the healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing industries, according
    to the future market insight projections [201]. Hence, numerous connected devices,
    sensors, and machines must be handled simultaneously. The main challenge facing
    the CIoT is the need to support numerous devices with a broad range of capabilities
    and requirements to mitigate problems, such as network congestion, power consumption,
    security, and cost. This challenge requires significant investments in network
    infrastructure and management systems to ensure that the network can scale to
    meet the demands of the IoT. Providing connectivity for many devices can be a
    challenge for CIoT networks, where the system scalability [112] comprises the
    network capacity, processing power, data storage, and security. In [202], mobile
    edge computing (MEC) based CIoT (MECIoT) is taken as one of the promising solutions
    for scalability. Thus, techniques including developing low-power devices, designing
    and implementing smart system architecture involving leveraging distributed computing,
    cloud-based infrastructure, and other advanced technology, such as edge computing
    and AI might help and should be further investigated. Privacy and Security: Security
    cameras, biometric sensors, and authentication devices, electronic door locks
    and access control systems, fire alarm and detection systems, intrusion detection
    and prevention systems, industrial control systems used in critical infrastructure
    such as energy, water, and transportation systems, medical devices such as pacemakers
    and insulin pumps are security-sensitive devices that could harm owners if their
    security is threatened by intruders [118]. It is because, the limited resources
    of CIoT devices can make it challenging to implement robust security measures,
    leaving them vulnerable to attacks [203]. CIoT devices are often deployed in physically
    vulnerable locations, making them susceptible to tampering. In addition, the low
    power and low data rates of CIoT devices can make it difficult to implement strong
    security protocols, leaving them open to network-based attacks. Moreover, the
    lack of uniform standards for security in CIoT can lead to inconsistencies in
    security measures across different devices and networks, potentially exposing
    vulnerabilities. To address these risks, it is essential to implement strong security
    measures such as encryption, secure authentication, and access control, while
    also establishing industry standards for securing the devices [204]. Moreover,
    Ni et al. [205] proposed a security authentication system to protect device security
    during network slicing by isolating IoT applications. Savic et al. [206] proposed
    a deep learning-based anomaly detection, the anomaly detection module (ADM) for
    IoT devices (ADM-EDGE) and the ADM at the mobile core network (ADM-FOG), to enhance
    the CIoT security and the mobile core network, respectively, by demonstrating
    it on smart logistics use cases. However, the trial is on small-scale real-world
    use cases that should be examined on a large scale. In [161], quantum resistance
    access authentication is developed to achieve privacy protection and anti-quantum
    attacks. However, numerous IoT devices with high-speed mobility still have security
    issues relating to moving from one cell to another. Interoperability and Integration
    Issues: Enabling different IoT devices and applications to communicate with each
    other and with the CIoT networks seamlessly is another barrier facing the CIoT.
    Due to the requirements for the device, network, standardization, and security
    and the heterogeneity of the protocols, there are a variety of interoperability
    types, including infrastructure (device interoperability), architecture (network
    interoperability), design (syntactical and semantic interoperability), and platform
    interoperability [207], in which intelligent algorithms should be implemented.
    However, ensuring seamless and interoperable communication among numerous devices
    is challenging because of its various data formats, protocol interfaces and application,
    and the complexity increases if two or more devices communicate simultaneously
    [208]. It is necessary to create a multifaceted technology approach to handle
    the interoperability concerns. This approach requires the development of standards,
    protocols, software tools and interfaces, data formats, and more that can be used
    across networks and devices. Energy Efficiency/Power Consumption: One of the most
    critical constraints for CIoT devices is battery life. Most CIoT devices are battery-powered
    require constant sources of power and need low power consumption with many years
    of deployment lifecycle in remote locations where supplying power is spectacularly
    difficult. The reason why many years of deployment are employed is that activities
    include charging batteries regularly, devices that are hard-wired to maintain
    electricity, and a complete device replacement which causes human interaction
    too costly for the business case. For battery-powered IoT devices, energy efficiency
    is a highly critical factor [154]. Often, IoT devices are designed to be low-power
    and energy-efficient, but this is not easy to achieve with cellular networks,
    which requires new approaches to network design and management to ensure the network
    can support low-power devices while providing the necessary performance and coverage.
    However, there are still compromising power consumption issues in the CIoT. One
    method of saving energy in the age of AI is applying the recommended deep neural
    network techniques. However, due to frequent memory access, executing power-intensive
    deep neural networks on low-resource IoT devices increases power consumption.
    To address these problems, a study [209] suggested that reducing the number of
    MAC operations and data precision saves energy. In addition, the recursive access
    class barring technique provides resource-efficiency and energy-efficiency solutions
    [198]. However, a trade-off occurs between energy efficiency and other performance
    factors, such as high data transfer rates, poor network coverage, and complex
    data processing (to mention a few that could be balanced), and further investigation
    is required. Cost: As the deployment of numerous IoT devices increases exponentially,
    it can result in high costs for network providers and end users. Network providers
    and IoT device manufacturers explore partnerships and collaborations to reduce
    costs, share resources, and leverage each other’s expertise and capabilities.
    Among other solutions, significant factors of the CIoT to make IoT devices more
    accessible and affordable for a wider range of applications and use cases are
    using low-cost devices and employing technology that stabilizes the costs for
    the device, network, maintenance, data management, and others [27], [30], [155].
    Often, IoT devices are designed to be low cost, which requires new approaches
    to network design and management to ensure that the network can be deployed and
    maintained at a low cost. However, a low-cost design negatively affects CIoT performance,
    spectral efficiency, and energy consumption. In [210], the authors proposed a
    time allocation algorithm to avoid the problem. Nonetheless, the support for a
    massive number of devices can become limited. Spectrum Efficiency: As IoT devices
    use a small amount of bandwidth, the spectrum is a limited resource that must
    be shared among a massive number of connecting devices. Efficient spectrum allocation
    is vital for connecting many IoT devices and preventing network disruptions. The
    author [211] investigated power-domain nonorthogonal multiple access as the best
    multiple access technique for efficiently utilizing the existing spectrum resources
    in IoT networks from the multiple-user scenario by assigning different power levels.
    However, the number of frequency blocks in the IoT network in the framework is
    limited. Al-Dweik et al. [212] mentioned that power-domain nonorthogonal multiple
    access could be a prominent solution for spectral efficiency from the same user
    perspective in which nonidentical power values can be assigned. However, in large-scale
    IoT networks, spectral efficiency requires new robust approaches to spectrum management
    to ensure that the network can support numerous low-power devices. Quality of
    Service: The level of services and performance of a network provider guarantees
    its customers to make the IoT devices reliable is a highly important factor in
    the CIoT. The technical challenges in the CIoT regarding the bandwidth, power,
    delay, and error rate should be optimized to attain the various QoS requirements,
    including reliability, low latency, high throughput, low power consumption, security,
    scalability, cost-effectiveness, and more. Indeed, IoT devices require low-latency
    and high reliability communication, which is challenging to provide in cellular
    networks. Network optimization, traffic management, and service-level agreement
    strategies are good for preserving QoS [199]. Furthermore, deploying fixed and
    mobile small cells due to the reduced Tx-to-Rx distance is expected to improve
    the QoS with the ever-increasing data demands [213]. However, challenges still
    exist, such as interference and resource management. Hence, new and robust approaches
    to network design and management are required to ensure the network can support
    low-latency, high-reliability communication to achieve QoS. 10. Conclusion In
    recent years, the CIoT has emerged as a promising solution for providing a scalable,
    reliable, and secure infrastructure connecting a broad range of devices and applications.
    The CIoT enables billions of devices to connect and share information, creating
    new services and applications. With the ongoing full deployment and integration
    of 5G networks, CIoT is poised to gain further significance. The fact that 5G
    offers higher data rates, lower latency, and massive device connectivity, which
    unlock new possibilities for CIoT applications, 3GPP and Ericsson have been working
    on standardization of CIoT technologies to improve connectivity and communication
    between devices. The LTE-M and NB-IoT have confirmed that they can efficiently
    be integrated into the 5G and share its ultimate benefits. The URLLC capabilities
    of 5G enable mission-critical CIoT use cases, such as autonomous vehicles, remote
    surgery, and industrial automation, that require real-time, reliable connectivity
    is now achieved. Moreover, the CIoT is valuable because it reduces the cost and
    complexity of deploying and maintaining IoT networks, provides a global and standardized
    solution for connecting IoT devices, and enables interoperability while ensuring
    the security and privacy of data transmitted over the CIoT network. To this end,
    in this paper, we have compared the existing literature on CIoT technologies and
    discussed their general network architecture. Moreover, we have elaborated on
    the existing CIoT technologies with a complete overview from the perspectives
    of their features and current state-of-the-art including release enhancements,
    focuses, and applications. Finally, we have identified the major challenges in
    CIoT technology that researchers, academics, and industry operators might find
    interesting for further studies and efforts. Declaration of competing interest

    farmingInternet of thingsMechanizationControl systemsPRISMA 1. Introduction In
    the fourth era (Agriculture-4.0), the agriculture sector is integrating information
    and communication technologies (ICT) into conventional farming methods [1]. Technologies
    to enhance smart farming, like the Internet of Things (IoT), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAVs), Big Data Analytics (BDA), Remote Sensing (RS), and Machine Learning (ML),
    are explicitly ensuring the new revolution in agriculture practices [3], [2].
    Globally, the use of IoT has been increasing daily, pointing toward new smart
    directions and device information to enhance productivity [5], [4]. The fundamental
    principle of IoT introduced the connectivity between machine-to-machine and man-to-machine
    is formerly achievable on a larger scale [6]. The IoT combines three visions:
    internet-oriented, things-oriented, and semantic-oriented [7]. The IoT is a worldwide
    network of devices that can operate, identify, and monitor any object on the planet
    through the internet and the connectivity of virtual and physical things using
    integrated information and communication technologies [9], [8]. The fundamental
    objective was to enable the sharing of real-time information or data over autonomous
    networks. Smart computational sensors, which contain real-time data, will also
    communicate with anyone, anywhere, and anytime through an internet network [10].
    Numerous communication solutions in the market allow interconnection between networks
    and devices, including wireless sensors and radio frequency identification through
    WIFI, ZigBee, Bluetooth, and GSM [12], [11]. In smart farming, numerous parameters
    are monitored to improve yield and optimize the environmental conditions, irrigation
    process, pest and fertilizers, unwanted plant management, soil status, greenhouse
    production environment, and reduce costs of the process inputs [13]. Besides this,
    smart farming technologies are essential in the IoT system. These technologies
    are differentiated into data acquisition, investigation, and evaluation of smart
    farming technologies [14]. Many developed countries like Europe have adopted smart
    farming: Australia and the United States of America [16], [15], furthermore other
    individual countries like Italy [17], Brazil [18], Ireland [19], and India [20].

    smart farming to enhance agriculture production with the aspects of Agriculture

    and further implemented in smart farming IoT in smart farming, sensors, hardware,
    software, wireless technologies, IoT modules, and future crop, human, and machine
    health directions have been discussed. 1.1. Motivation and contribution Though
    smart agriculture is a new phase, many commercial products and platforms exist,
    highlighting that the market is ready to adopt [33]. Most of the collection, integration,
    and data analysis acquired by IoT sensors are focused on commercial solutions,
    and only a few offer predictive analytics [22]. Current concerns provide significant
    challenges in determining an appropriate deployment strategy, energy-efficient
    media access, measurement intervals, and routing protocols. Yet, emerging challenges
    may occur during real-time operations. For example, suppose there is sudden contact
    with obstacles on the moving machinery in the actual working environment. In that
    case, the signal will be compromised which may lead to damage to the inter-communication
    system. In the current Indian scenario, the demand for food-grain is increasing
    with increasing population. The requirement of food grains to fulfill the demand
    of the population is estimated at 300 million tons by 2025, and 345 million tons
    by 2030 [34]. To meet the ever-increasing demand of food grains, there is a serious
    need to manage the crop productivity with an optimized way. Therefore, low-cost
    IoT that enabled with more accurate data analysis can be implemented in the tradition
    farming methods to enhance the farm productivity for end-users. This study examines
    the existing literature on using IoT systems, wireless communication technologies,
    and sensors for different purposes in agriculture activities. Our main goal is
    to study the adoption of new Agro 4.0 emerging technologies that enhance the safe
    and productive environment, explain how these technologies can lead towards new
    visions for smart farming applications, and gain insight into future research
    opportunities. The contribution of this study is divided into three axes. The
    first axis defines the in-sight literature on the role of IoT in agriculture activities.
    The second point elaborates on wireless technologies, sensors, and hardware in
    agriculture IoT systems. The third axis concerns facing challenges when implementing
    IoT systems in actual farm conditions. The primary objective of this systematic
    review is to assist researchers in better understanding the Internet of Things
    (IoT) system in smart farming. The published literature, e.g., systematic literature
    review [23], [35], [36], [3] systematic road mapping of study [37] concept IoT
    [38], [39], IoT sensors and IoT networks used in smart farming [40], [41] along
    with published articles with the concept of smart farming has been followed in
    the present study. 2. VOSviewer analysis In the first stage, 974 articles are
    extracted from the Scopus database with the two keywords (i.e., smart farming
    and precision farming) in the CSV format. Extracted articles contain all the bibliometric
    information, further utilized as input for the VOSviewer analysis. This analysis
    measures how frequently keywords and citation information has been used in the
    selected articles. This information gives an effective way to measure the influence
    of articles in the scientific community. Further, the co-occurrence of the keywords
    and co-citation of the reference has been visualized. For creating the map, some
    criteria have been selected as a threshold with a minimum number of co-occurrences
    of the keywords is 5. From a total of 2351 keywords, only 106 keywords meet with
    selected threshold criteria. As a result, 9 clusters have been drawn with the
    1020 common links, and the total strength is 2882, as shown in Fig. 1. Download

    Keywords co-occurrence network visualization The node''s size symbolizes the co-occurrence
    of terms (i.e., co-occurring keywords). The thickness of the relationship shows
    the frequency of co-occurrence of keywords (i.e., frequently appears to occur
    and co-occur keywords). The connection defines the interconnection between two
    items, and the node is the strength of that particular item. Similarly, the co-citation
    analysis is analyzed to measure how usually the article has been cited in the
    selected documents. The map visualization has classified the data into 9 clusters,
    218 co-occurrence items, with 2546 links and 3572 node strength. The network visualization
    co-occurrence of citation has been illustrated in Fig. 2. Download : Download

    co-occurrence of citation. In the results of this analysis, a total of 106 keywords
    are found as important from the 2351 keywords. Moreover, analyzing the 106 keywords
    in a single study is impossible. So therefore, some important keywords have been
    selected from these keywords, such as \"Agriculture 4.0, Big data analysis, Cloud
    computing, Agriculture automation, Robotics, Smart sensors, Internet of Things
    (IoT), Unmanned aerial vehicle, Raspberry Pi module, Zigbee technology, Crop monitoring,
    Health monitoring, Image processing, Digitization, Data analysis, Edge Computing,
    etc.\". Maximum keywords have been selected based on occurrence and link strength
    of keyword used in the literature. For example, the \"internet of things\" keywords
    co-occurrence links was 172 with the strength of 466. Only the highest strength
    of keywords is discussed in the current study. Furthermore, it is analyzed that
    the maximum citations are related to the internet of things (IoT) based studies,
    as mentioned in Fig. 2. This graph provides an excellent overview and highlights
    items in that particular publication. The strength of each node represented the
    number of published citations. This analysis is limited to at least 5 or more
    5 citations, as shown in Fig. 2. 3. Material and methods A comprehensive search
    term was built by taking the published articles based on some keywords. Further,
    the inclusion and exclusion criteria have been developed to make the literature
    in funnel structure. The inclusion criteria were that all the articles should
    be published in the English language, and the objective of the current paper should
    be covered in the particular literature. Keywords such as \"smart farming,” \"precision
    farming,” \"IoT in agriculture,” \"human health assessment in agriculture,\" and
    \"machine health in agriculture\" were included in the search engine, and these
    keywords should be mentioned in the title, abstract, or anywhere in the entire
    document. The articles should be published after 2010, contain the Scopus indexing,
    and be published in full length. The exclusion criteria were only the published
    articles were considered, and other published content such as a report and conference
    papers were not considered for the present study. This section portrays the literature
    status of IoT in different field operations. A review has been conducted with
    full-length published articles in various reputed journals from 2010 to August
    2022 under the Scopus database. The selected papers were classified into different
    domains such as objective of the study, category of the article, wireless technologies,
    different sensors, and whether this work was implemented in the real field or
    laboratory conditions or otherwise, and identify the existing gaps and their future
    scope as laid by the respective authors. IoT extends the ability of a human to
    monitor and react according to the environment. The PRISMA 2020 [42] was used
    to systematically organize and employ a step-by-step method for selecting the
    appropriate literature for this study from the searched literature, as shown in

    It is analyzed that IoT has a wide scope in agriculture for bought human benefits
    and commercialization worldwide. The shorting literature has been structured into
    Table 2. In Table 2, different types of technologies have been categorized into
    four types, i.e., UAVs- Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), IoT-P- Internet of Things Platform,
    DSS- Decision Support System, STMS-Sensing Technique and Management System, and
    sub-technologies (wireless communication system) are mentioned with the different
    types of sensors used in the actual or laboratory conditions. IoT systems extend
    the ability of a human to monitor and collect data during real-time operation.

    make appropriate decisions [42]; IoT sensors are feasible to evaluate the number
    of parameter values like soil properties, temperature, wind flow rate, humidity,

    Some studies represent the web-based framework to the extent of the advancement
    in the agriculture system [3], [104]. A study suggests that in the early 2000 s,
    mobile-based technological farming solutions were offered, allowing the farming
    community to develop realistic methods for increasing agriculture efficiency.
    This study needs to identify the purpose of the study, latest technologies, wireless
    communication system, various sensors used in agriculture with some open challenges.
    Because in-depth literature on smart farming is helpful to developing countries
    like India [105]. The geographic relevance of smart agricultural improvements
    is reinforced by one categorization of the situation. It is essential to focus
    on changes in regional components of the sector since the digital divide may affect
    how smart farming is used and how successfully new solutions are accepted. Some
    Asian countries, such as Bangladesh [106], China [107], Pakistan [108], India
    [109], [110], [111], and others [112], [113], are embracing advanced technology.
    Numerous types of research have been conducted on specific agricultural concerns
    such as soil properties, climate conditions, and smart irrigation systems are
    elaborate in Table 2. It was important to research precise agricultural solutions
    for yield improvement [114]. Smart farming is essential to help create and deploy
    technologies that can help enhance optimal yield conditions [114]. Optical sensing,
    soil analysis, and analysis in imaging processing are the major areas. The large
    variety of solutions on the market and machine learning models can assist with
    an effective prediction. The previous research addressed profitability contributions,
    reducing the danger of crop failures, protecting farmer interests with excellent
    farming conditions, and agricultural technologies in various aspects [115]. Keywords
    offered in the process are vast in scope and comprehensive and demonstrate substantial
    improvements due to changes in the many technologies employed, issues to be resolved,
    and crucial elements that must be addressed [116]. Most of the research has concentrated
    on certain agricultural practices, suggesting that the volume of studies carried
    out in the domain was substantial. Sankpal & Warhade [117] elaborates that the
    Monitoring, sensing, and decision-making integral based on big data-based are
    three important areas in which the making fundamental to smart farming was carried
    out: one of the main aspects of systems installation is to measure the major performance
    of the farm activities. Although the monitoring processes of the farm are possible
    with human involvement, the smart and effective elements in these circumstances
    would be quite lacking, and thus more emphatic solutions are needed. The existing
    monitoring and sensor-based solutions are required for the farmers to monitor
    critical levels accurately [118]. The detection of weeds and the water level of
    soil by sensors as well as picture processing issues result in extensive monitoring
    of agricultural activities [119]. Some of the main advantages of these monitoring
    systems include fast reaction warnings to farmers, and safety surveillance, even
    in the absence of farmers in the field. Many options were available based on wired
    networks or wireless networking technologies. Given the circumstances that cause
    developments, the teams must be able to take the required response measures to
    manage crop-level skills [43]. 4.1. Country-wise contribution of technology in
    agriculture The smart IoT system promises a new agricultural sector revolution
    to increase productivity with emerging technologies such as IoT platforms, UAVs,
    STMS, and DSS [2]. Fig. 4 depicts the technologies used by different nations across
    the world. The chord diagram (Fig. 4) shows the graphical relationship among the
    countries and technologies used. Download : Download high-res image (369KB) Download

    in chord diagram. The thickness of the string shows the volume of research done
    by a country using a specific technology. About the first instance, the diagram
    shows that almost all the mentioned countries used STMS technology. It is worth
    noting that India and Spain are the biggest users of this technology among all
    the countries. As previously mentioned, the IoT-P is another prominent technology
    in the IoT system in which certain nations work. Among all nations, India and
    Spain are the most reliant on this technology. Furthermore, a contributor to this
    technology also includes Spain, Australia, and Egypt countries. DSS is another
    technology in the smart IoT agriculture system in which some countries are interested,
    such as India, Turkey, Greece, Brazil, and Slovenia. At last, UAVs are advanced
    technology using which the involvement of humans can be eliminated or reduced
    to a bare minimum. It has been observed that this technology is less utilized
    than other popular technologies across various areas. Technology drives system
    progress, but wireless technologies also play a significant part in IoT systems
    due to their applicability. The selection of these wireless technologies completely
    depends on the agriculture activity application. The purpose is to represent the
    adoption of different technologies among the various countries in Fig. 4. At the
    same time, the different advanced technologies of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles)
    are enabled with different wireless technologies such as RS (Remote Sensing),
    RTK (Real-Time Kinetic), and Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity). Although RS, CC (Cloud
    Computing), Zigbee, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), Wi-Fi, WiLD (Wi-Fi-based
    Long Distance), and WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks), wireless technology is followed
    by IoT-P (Internet of Things Platform). Likewise, DSS (Decision Support System)
    follows wireless technology such as LoRA (Long Range), AgroDSS (Agriculture Decision
    Support System), WSNs, and AgriLoRA (Agriculture Long Range). In the end, STMS
    following the RS, WSNs, 6LoWPAN (6-Long Range Wide Area Network), WSNs, Wi-Fi,
    Zigbee, WUSNs (Wireless Underground Sensor Networks), LoRAWAN (Long Range Wide
    Area Network), LoRA wireless technology. The most used wireless technology is
    RS, WSNs, and Wi-Fi in the different agriculture aspects during farming, as demonstrated
    in Fig. 5. Q 1 : What is the distribution of published articles (year, top 10

    SWOT analysis The SWOT analysis helps to evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities,
    and threats. SWOT analysis helps gain perspective on the past and brainstorm potential
    solutions to current or future issues (Nouri et al., 2008). SWOT analysis is a
    technique that divides data from an environmental study into internal (strengths
    and weaknesses) and external problems (opportunities and threats). SWOT analysis
    is done for India to gauge the possibility of leading the revolution of IoT applications,
    and the outcome is shown in Table 3. Table 3. SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities,
    and threats) analysis Indian scenario. S. No. Strength Weaknesses Opportunities

    8.2% to the agriculture field. Recent studies show the significant result of adopting
    IoT technology, which is necessary for the agro-industry because food demand is
    increasing continuously. It must be taken seriously to overcome the public demand
    and to serve the population. Q 2 : What are the most popular Wireless Communication
    Technologies, Sensors, Hardware, Modern Analytical Tools, and Secure Internal
    Systems related to IoT in smart farming applications? 4.6. Wireless communication
    technologies Connectivity is the basic and most important requirement for the
    IoT system. The connections must be reliable and strong enough in the worst climate
    conditions. The following sections discuss the overview of different hardware,
    software, and gateways used in the IoT system. Communication protocols allow network
    connection and act as the IoT system''s backbone. Protocols define data encoding,
    interchange formats, device addressing, and packet routing. There are some common
    wireless technologies adopted for the IoT system as given below: a) Wi-Fi IEEE
    802.11 is based on Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) communication standards,
    enabling data rates from 1 Mb/s to 6.75 Gb/s and Wi-Fi ranges of 20 m indoors
    and 100 m outdoors. Some other IEEE wireless technologies with data rates are
    mentioned in Table 6. a) WiMax The IEEE 802.16 Widely used WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability
    for Microwave Access) standard is a built-in set of wireless broadband standards.
    The latest upgrade delivers 100 Mb/s mobile and 1 Gb/s fixed data rates. b) 802.15.4-LR-WPAN
    IEEE 802.15.4 is based on Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (LR-WPAN) standards.
    These standards offer the fundamental definition for high-level communications
    protocols like ZigBee, ranging from 40 Kb/s to 250 Kb/s. In limited devices, standards
    operate at 868/915 MHz at low and 2.4 GHz at high data rates. c) 2 G/3 G/4 G/5 G-Mobile
    Communication Second-generation mobile communication includes GSM and CDMA, third-generation
    includes UMTS and CDMA2000, and fourth-generation includes LTE. These three generations''
    standards interconnect over the cellular networks in the IoT devices. And provides
    data ranges of 9.6 Kb/s for 2 G; 100 Mb/s for 4 G on the 3GPP websites. d) 802.15.1
    – Bluetooth Bluetooth is a device that transmits data over a short range (8–10 m);
    it is the basis of the IEEE 802.15.1 standard, low energy consumption, and cost-favorable
    wireless communication technology. The Bluetooth standard communication device
    was the personal area network (PAN) with an operating band of 2.4 GHz. Bluetooth
    Low Energy is known for its range of data rates from 1 mb/s to 24 mb/s, and all
    are made possible due to Bluetooth Low Energy''s ultra-low-power and low-cost
    standards (BLE or Bluetooth Smart). e) LoRaWAN R1.0 – LoRa The LoRaTM Alliance
    created a recently established long-range communication that outlines a wide area
    network (WAN) standard for Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN). It defines the
    Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) standard to ensure interoperability between
    diverse operations. LoRaWAN data rates range are 0.3 kilobits per second (kbps)
    to 50 kilobits per second (kbps) and operated on 868-to-900-megahertz (MHz) ISM
    bands. LoRa can communicate with nodes under a distance of 20 miles in different
    situations. The working battery life is up to 10 years. f) Zigbee Table 6. IEEE
    wireless technology and its data rates. 802.11a 5 GHz 802.11b 2.4 GHz 802.11g
    2.4 GHz 802.11n 2.4/5 GHz 802.11ac 5 GHz 802.11ad 60 GHz Zigbee is one of the
    most prominent technologies for accurate detection. IEEE 802.15.4 is a low-power,
    low-data-rate, and wireless network within a 10–100 m range in different environmental
    conditions. The data transfer rate is 250 kbps, and Zigbee is suitable for intermittent
    data transmission into the various IoT sensors. The low-duty cycle provided low
    latency with low battery power. Moreover, various wireless technologies used in
    IoT systems are illustrated in Table 7. Table 7. Other wireless communication

    the transmission of electromagnetic signals, these technologies enable mobile
    communication, remote sensing, and other applications. At the same time, massive
    Machine Type Communications\" (mMTC) is specifically designed for the intercommunication
    between several IoT devices. Because it has unique characteristics such as it
    handles several massive devices easily, the transmission of data with minimum
    power consumption, optimizing the signal resources and reducing the overall network
    load, narrow frequency transmission data, and efficient communication delay. In
    addition, (mMTC) emerges as a crucial enabler, boasting unique characteristics
    facilitating efficient intercommunication among many IoT devices with minimal
    power consumption and optimized network resources. 4.7. Types of sensors The IoT
    is a huge network in which things are connected that gather data within storage
    memory about the surrounding environment and make a system smart. Apart from this,
    one thing is essential to make the entire IoT system smarter. IoT is a smart ecosystem
    in which machines and devices are interconnected. This technology can be widely
    used to increase crop quality and quantity by monitoring and optimizing farm conditions.
    In an IoT system, sensors play an important role in monitoring the temperature
    [72], humidity [50], wind flow rate/direction [121], plant health [123], [122],
    NPK [38], [124], smart irrigation system [76], PTO dynamometer [125], fuel flow
    rate [126], gas analyzer [127], light intensity [81], soil moisture [82], pH level
    [128], weather detection [78], etc. Various types of IoT sensors in agriculture
    are mentioned in Fig. 10. Also, different types of agriculture sensors and their
    properties are mentioned in Table 8. Download : Download high-res image (254KB)

    suitable manual before utilizing the experimentation purposes. Below are some
    suitable sensors for agriculture practices that make the system smarter. These
    sensors acquire live data in required forms during different field operations.
    Sensor data can be analyzed with a smartphone and web-based application, which
    were generally developed for this purpose. The major goal of these sensors is
    to determine the environmental conditions, plant health, and soil conditions in
    the agriculture sector. Moreover, the function of the sensor is to monitor, control,
    secure, warn, and analyze realistic and non-realistic data [130]. Sensors make
    agriculture operations simple, smarter, and efficient due to self-dependent monitoring
    systems with less human involvement. The smart irrigation system is one example
    of a smart agriculture system that contains several water sensors in the field.
    Then the system optimizes the exact amount of water for particular crop production
    [131]. This section focuses on the various sensors for smart farming. In this
    direction, the sensor''s quality must be checked or verified regularly before
    collecting the data in field operations. Types of agriculture sensors: a) Optical
    Sensors: In recent years, optical sensors have been used for capturing images
    and distances. In agriculture, these sensors monitor soil properties such as organic
    matter, clay, and moisture content. Moreover, there are other optical sensor applications
    in automated manufacturing, transportation, holography, and health application.
    Besides this, these sensors have several uses due to their intensive properties
    such as small size, ease of use, reliability in the actual field, lightweight,
    immunity to electromagnetic interference, short wavelength, and remote and multi-position
    measurement functioning. There are some other examples of optical sensor applications
    (i) Physical quantities measurement such as acceleration, velocity, strain, pressure,
    temperature, and shape of the object; (ii) Health-related composite material monitoring
    in the form of positioning, deformation, crack detection, and measuring vibration;
    (iii) various chemical properties; (iv) Biomedical measurement, i.e., blood flow
    rate, monitoring skin irritants, testing of stomach and duodenum blood perfusion,
    health assessment and fingerprint image; (v) Industrial applications such as characterization
    of product, real-time image monitoring, surface inspection, crack detection, etc.
    Several commercially available sensors vary slightly in construction and properties
    [132]. b) Electromagnetic Sensors: These types of sensors are required for the
    data recording on the various components such as water level, drainage, level
    of organic matter, soil pH and cation exchange capacity, etc. An important advantage
    is that electromagnetic sensors can be easily used with antennas and wireless
    devices [133]. The radiofrequency identification (RFID) approach has been used
    in electromagnetic sensors, consisting of the reader and tags [134]. Each tag
    contains a unique identification code, and the reader''s function is to interrogate
    the tags located within the range, and tags reply to the reader with some identification
    codes. And most of the tags contain two types of elements: an antenna and an RFID
    chip. Over the last decade, RFID chips have been used to increase their monitoring
    success [136], [135]. As a result, chipless sensors are cheaper and simple to
    use and the best alternate solution for single-use sensors. These sensors can
    be easily implemented in direct contact and non-contact with the soil. Also used
    for the tractor and other mounted machinery for tracking the GPS. The principle
    of these sensors is based on electromagnetic properties, they do not directly
    contact objects, but the data helps to determine the essential detail of soil
    properties. c) Electrochemical Sensors: An electrochemical sensor comprises an
    ion-selective membrane that responds to a target ion and a transducer that detects
    electric impulses. For the soil nutrients detections, ion-selective field-effect
    transistor (ISFET) [137] and ion-selective electrode (ISE) [139], [138] are two
    types of an electrochemical sensor. But most ISE-based sensors are used in the
    actual conditions due to flow injection systems and vehicle-based soil sensing.
    However, under real-world settings, this is not an adequate period since, most
    of the time, a response is delayed. On the other hand, ISFET-based sensors have
    several advantages over ISE-based sensors, such as low dimensions, high signal
    speed, low output impedance, fast response, and integration of multi-function
    on the single chip. Among these sensors, concentration level calculation of the
    ions, i.e., H+ , K+ , NO3- etc. It was necessary to have electrodes closely touching
    the soil while measuring the voltage. These sensors can analyze important soil
    properties such as nutrients, pH levels, nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus values.
    d) Location Sensors: These types of sensors are accurately used for the farm map
    using GPS. Farmers estimate how and where fertilizers and pesticides can be used
    with optimum quantity from these tracking devices. This can detect the farm level,
    uneven land, and any other object that traveled from one place to another. e)
    Airflow sensors: To monitor air permeability in the soil and the surrounding environment
    in the field. These sensors have integrated with the silicon chip for sensing
    the humidity, temperature, and other gases in real farm conditions. These types
    of sensors help to reduce the micro-climate heterogeneity in the greenhouse environment,
    which is one of the important factors of uniform production. f) Acoustic sensors:
    Advancements in acoustic sensing offer vast opportunities to explore agriculture
    activities in different farm applications. In which sensors detect sound and are
    used for pest detection in agriculture. Whenever the pests pass through the sensors,
    their sound is detected, and after that, the sensor report to the connected IoT
    device. The design is crucial for linking agriculture to the IoT, and sensor networks
    built the gap between cyberspace and the real world. During the design of the
    agriculture IoT network, some requirements must be considered: 1) Sensor network''s
    function must be reliable in a realistic environment for a long time without changing
    a battery. 2) Also, the sensor network must be managed remotely so that actions
    like up-gradation in software, diagnosis, and reconfiguration can proceed easily.
    3) Moreover, there is a need that allows universal sensor networks required to
    enable future integration. 4) The design should be cost-effective and commercialized
    for future users. 4.8. Types of hardware The main components of the IoT system
    are wireless devices, sensors, machine language, programs, protocols, processors,
    etc. In the IoT, system Hardware plays an important role in running certain software.
    In hardware, the processor determines how fast the system will work. There are
    various hardware platforms to design convinced with new methodology are mentioned
    below: • RASPBERRY PI Raspberry Pi is a line of single-board computers created
    by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in the United Kingdom. There are various families
    in the Raspberry with different models, i.e., Pi 4, Pi Zero, Pi 3, Pi 2, and Pi
    1. Mostly the boards have a Broadcom processor. It performs like a computer system,
    generally called a microcomputer and multitasking microcomputer [140]. • ARDUINO
    UNO This is a microcontroller board based on the ATMega32 processor developed
    by Arduino. cc. Adding a USB connector to the Arduino Uno microcontrollers is
    a very helpful improvement to the microcontroller family. The Arduino Uno, Arduino
    Due, Arduino Leonardo, and Arduino Mega are just a few variants in the market.
    Regarding Arduino boards, Uno and Mega are the most often used models [141]. •
    ESPRESSIF SYSTEMS The ESP is a flexible and widely-used IoT module that is enabled
    with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, supports multiple communication protocols,
    and consumes minimum power. The various purposes in agriculture practices adopt
    this module. It provides better scalability, is easy to implement in actual field
    conditions, reduces resource waste, and is a better decision-making module with
    cost-effective solutions (L. [142]). • NODE MCU It is an open-source platform
    mostly used to develop firmware rather than IoT systems. The ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip
    was used in this open-source kit/module. Created with the Arduino Software Development
    Kit (IDE)[143]. • BEAGLEBONE This single-board computer was developed in Texas
    Instruments, which was low in cost and open source. The measurement size was 75 × 75 mm,
    and processed as the basic computer. The power requirement was a 2 W and 5 V separate
    power supply and ran without any cooling and sinks [145], [144]. • BANANA PI This
    single-board computer, the size of a credit card produced by the Chinese business
    Shenzhen SINOVOIP Co. Ltd. Raspberry Pi, greatly impacts hardware design. It also
    works with Raspberry Pi boards and is compatible with Android and Linux [8]. Table
    9 presents lists of various IoT hardware platforms and their functional specifications,
    which are commonly used for different agricultural activities. Table 9. Hardware

    Sensors are required tools to evaluate data by using machine learning algorithms
    to get predictive insights. Young farmers are likelier to adopt modern equipment
    because they use new smart tools to back up their limited on-the-field expertise.
    This contains computer-based tools (or data platforms) enables storage, analysis,
    manipulation, and mapping, including almost every georeferenced data. The most
    advanced technologies assist in monitoring finances and equipment, provide alerts,
    and even offer management advice. These software programmers frequently target
    additional agricultural stakeholders such as input suppliers, service providers,
    food distributors, and farmers for smart farming. Some management systems have
    patented Climate Corp.''s software to produce agriculture prescriptions which
    partnered with AGCO Corporation in 2017 [146]. Decisive Farming Corp or AgVerdict
    Inc patents these commercial solutions. In a nutshell, it is stated that new advanced
    technologies are the backbone of smart agriculture. 4.10. Secure internal systems
    The entire system should be secure enough to avoid data theft. The program should
    be simple to use and accessible to farmers. The adoption of sensor-based technology
    and cloud-based smart agriculture application has opened the door for cyber-attacks
    before addressing particular cyber-attacks to keep fundamental security and privacy
    concerns in smart farming. Various sensors, gadgets, and equipment produce sophisticated,
    dynamic, and geographical data in a smart farm. It is possible to have risks created
    by the leakage of such information, either via illegal access or by an insider.
    Data security and privacy are critical requirements in a smart agricultural environment.
    Autonomous tractors, drones, and on-field sensors provide automated and efficient
    commands and control operations. For further communication, messages can be sent
    between machines either via a cloud-based network or via machine-to-machine communications
    enabled by an edge or edge-enabled network that supports Message Queue Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT21), Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP22) or other IoT communication
    protocols. Connected to a smart farming system, devices must first be verified.
    Because they often have minimal processing power, memory, and storage, traditional
    public-key infrastructure (PKI) authentication methods are not good alternatives.
    Secure communication devices in a smart farming environment necessitate protecting
    specific layers and inter-layer communication [147]. For secure investigation,
    quantum-based cryptography was investigated [148]. But, its practicality in real-world
    situations has not been tested yet. Farmers who invest in smart systems worry
    that their data may be stolen or leaked. So, data security is critical, and contracts
    with technology providers contain particular provisions. A critical compliance
    issue is to acquiring data in smart farming activities. This is particularly critical
    given that data privacy regulations cannot resolve this problem. However, copyright
    laws may provide high-level protections within the present regulatory framework.
    Most farmers include IP protection provisions in contracts with smart agricultural
    technology suppliers [149]. Several nations worldwide have numerous laws, rules,
    and regulatory agencies. These revolve around the criteria associated with the
    selling and manufacturing of goods. Smart farming technology may facilitate compliance,
    enabling farmers and regulators to monitor, audit, and inspect each stage of the
    production process. Q 3 : Major Challenges and Components of IoT Systems during
    Farming? The application of IoT in farming has various advantages for the farmers
    and ecosystem, but still, such technologies in conventional farming methods have
    some challenges during farming, as below: 1. Connectivity: The realistic mechanism
    is required some strong connectivity throughout the real farming conditions. The
    primary challenge is that the IoT-based system contains various connectivity and
    communication modes. 2. Durability: Along with the connectivity challenges, the
    durability of the IoT system should be able to deal with real-time farming conditions.
    3. Reliability: Reliability is another problem for real-time farm monitoring because
    there is no provision to recover the data in the field of nodes and sensors after
    they stop working. There can be several problems in a real-time working environment,
    such as extreme weather change conditions, bird or insect attacks, and other technical
    problems. So, the IoT system should be more reliable in the upgraded versions.
    4. Scalability: In the real-time farm monitoring using WSNs, gateways, web portals,
    and actuators are used for the current solution. But these are designed and implemented
    only for the short area, such as 100 m x 100 m or 200 m x 200 m with limited nodes.
    Moreover, the actual need can be fulfilled by adding many sensors and nodes, or
    higher network range nodes can also be proposed for monitoring the large farm
    area. Various IoT platform architecture decisions have been shown to impact system
    scalability [150]. Because there are several errors occurred while monitoring
    the same data from multiple sensors. The sensors'' results still have a higher
    error rate, which varies from sensor to sensor. Standardizing the results output
    from the multiple sensors into one database should be required. It helps minimize
    the barrier between the manufacturer and active uses and can be easily implemented
    into farming conditions. 5. Energy Consumption: Basically, an IoT system containing
    three units that are sensing unit, processing unit, and communication unit. The
    sensors detect the input differently: weather conditions, heat, pressure, water
    level, etc., and respond to the optimum results. This process takes lots of calculation
    time and power consumption [151], which consumes lots of energy. A full energy
    model based on LoRa/LoRaWAN technologies can be proposed to estimate and optimize
    the consumed energy by the sensor node because it contains higher receiver sensitivity
    and working transmission distance (up to 20 km). 6. Context Awareness: By enabling
    precise insights, context awareness in an IoAT ecosystem offers increased food
    production and reduced waste. This aid in increasing agricultural output by identifying
    early disease and recommending appropriate steps to farmers based on historical
    data. Sometimes, appropriate action cannot be taken because of the low sample
    rate. From this perspective, Artificial intelligence (AI), Machine learning (ML),
    and Data analytics (DA) can be integrated into the upgraded IoT system so that
    accurate and precise decisions can be made at the right time. 7. Lack of Security:
    IoT devices interact with internet connections and are open communication systems.
    IoT agriculture equipment captures a huge quantity of data that is challenging
    to secure. Someone unauthorized might steal or modify the data. 8. Maintenance:
    There are still certain fundamental problems, even though hardware, software,
    and support choices vary depending on the agriculture application. Usability,
    maintenance, and security over the long term are essential to success and must
    be carefully considered. Maintenance will involve physical access to all devices
    in the field, whether to execute software upgrades, gather data, or remount hardware.
    Advanced software can help you automate procedures and do tasks remotely, minimizing
    time spent in the field. 9. User knowledge: IoT systems are capable of monitoring
    different agriculture conditions. But user knowledge plays an important role during
    implemented the smart system into agriculture activities. Young farmers are adopting
    these technologies easily, but the existing old farmers hesitate to adopt these
    smart technologies due to a lack of knowledge. In this context, there is a serious
    need for the system in the future to exclude the flaws mentioned above, but the
    system should also be working in real-time or uncontrolled conditions. So, the
    system can be implemented in actual farm conditions. 4.11. Various components
    for smart farming In smart farming, IoT promises farming productivity, crop monitoring
    with data, lowering the cost with minimum resources, and data-driven methods.
    Such advantages do not ensure improvements in agriculture but promise solutions
    to current industries-related problems in current days. The basic advantages of
    the IoT in smart farming are as follows: 1. Farming Efficiency: Nowadays, farmers
    are pressurizing to increase the productivity of crops with the decreasing availability
    of agricultural land, weather condition variation, extreme uses of fertilizers,
    and deteriorating soil properties. The application of the IoT domain is led toward
    enabling monitor and collecting real-time data and warning the farmer of any harmful
    effect on the crop. In addition, the IoT enables automatic decision-making and
    subsequent operations such as irrigation, fertilizer, and harvesting. 2. Optimization
    of Resources: There is another advantage of resource optimization, such as optimum
    uses of water, power, fertilizers, and a very important task, island preparation,
    before crop production, which is necessary for higher productivity. In these tasks,
    IoT enables the optimum uses and requirement of the resources as needed. 3. Product
    Quality Improvement: Enable the IoT system in farming helps to enhance product
    quality and quantity. Using the different sensor''s optimum moisture and temperature
    levels during the land preparation and irrigation system during the plant''s growth,
    the product''s nutrition value can be analyzed, and proper nutrient products can
    be grown. 4. Controlled use of Fertilizers and Pesticides: The IoT significantly
    reduces pesticides and fertilizers. An automated fertilizer system can also reduce
    the farmer''s energy, time, and money and prevent the wastage of resources [152].
    Besides, the control over the pesticide alert and assistance the preventing the
    pants remotely is promoted to increase the productivity and quality of the crop
    [153]. IoT in farming allows for delivering a cleaner and more organic product
    than the conventional method. 5. Agility: Due to the uncontrol weather condition
    and real-time data monitoring, farmers can easily predict the weather circumstances
    that will help protect the crops. 5. Key discussion The smart systems monitor
    the agriculture parameters and collect crop information data. A smart farming
    system consists primarily of the sensing of agricultural parameters, the identification
    of sensing location and data collection, the routing of data from crop field to
    control station for decision-making based on sensed data, and the visualization
    of results in an application for the farmer. These techniques define the agriculture
    smart model in four fundamental agricultural layers, as shown in Fig. 11. Download
    : Download high-res image (878KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11.
    Illustrates the overview of smart farming [48]. The first layer is the sensing
    layer, including different types of smart sensors to collect ground data. Some
    smart sensors are mounted on the ground surface to monitor and control different
    parameters related to the environment, soil, and crop properties directly or indirectly
    dependent on smart farming. Furthermore, most developed countries use special
    types of UAV thermal cameras in the field to detect the heat level and disease
    on the object and represent the same in image form. Different types of sensors
    can be used for measuring the field data, such as., soil moisture and temperature
    (10-HS, FC-28, SY-HS-220, MP101A), soil NPK nitrogen-phosphorous-potassium (JXBX-3001),
    (Environment humidity and temperature (LM35, SHT15, DHT22, DHT11), leaf wetness
    (RS185), electrical conductivity (DFR0300), thermal conductivity, wind speed &
    direction (SEN0170, BMP388), gases (CDM4162A, MHZ16, MQ135), pH level (MCP1525),
    solar radiation (6450 TSR). However, most thermal sensors are placed on the UAVs
    to visualize with imaging cameras. The Second is the network layer referring to
    the connection between sensors and routing technologies. To make efficient systems,
    WSNs are used for crop and field management. Applying WSN in intelligent agricultural
    systems allows for the simultaneous monitoring and optimization of crop quality
    and the possibility of large-scale surveillance with high sample density. The
    continuous monitoring of many environmental factors via sensor nodes scattered
    over the field enables the producer to supervise and maintain ideal conditions
    for maximum yield and energy savings. In the smart agriculture scenario, various
    types of networks technologies are utilized, such as Zigbee [53] [63]; IEEE 802.11b
    [62]; GPS(A. [44]) [54], LoRA (S.-C. [154]) [58], [73]; LoRAWAN [48], [58]; Wifi
    [49], [56]; LTE [51], [60], [76]; and Bluetooth [102], [155]. Wireless technologies
    are essential to contemporary communication and networking due to their several
    features. Wireless solutions enable seamless data transmission without the need
    for physical cables by their portability, scalability, simplicity of deployment,
    and ubiquitous connectivity. Interoperability and power efficiency guarantee seamless
    integration and optimized device performance, whereas real-time communication
    and dependable connectivity facilitate instant data transfer and responsive interactions.
    In addition, wireless technologies offer a broad spectrum of coverage, from short-range
    PANs to long-range WANs, cost-effectiveness, simplicity of integration, and simultaneous
    support for multiple devices. Wireless technologies are indispensable enablers
    in numerous domains, such as telecommunications, the Internet of Things (IoT),
    smart residences, industrial automation, healthcare, and agriculture. Their flexibility
    drives innovation, changing communication, and engagement with our linked environment.
    Third is the service layer involved in collecting data and predicting accurate
    responses regarding the field operation. Decision Support Systems (DSS) assist
    with data processing by managing accessible field-collected data to improve agricultural
    output, preserve quality, and save resources. Farmers suffer large economic losses
    due to inaccurate weather forecasts and improper irrigation techniques. Data analysis
    is the most crucial aspect of IoT agricultural systems, resulting in effective
    pesticide application and disease prevention by utilizing the microcomputer, i.e.,
    Arduino Uno [45], [58], [47], [73], [76], [49], [48]; Arduino Mega 2560 [70],
    [44]; Raspberry pi [54], [56], [89], [51], [61]; Microcontroller Unit (MCU) [53];
    ESP8266 [89], [43], [46] [89]. Microcontrollers (MCUs) are the core of Internet
    of Things (IoT) systems and are adorned with several attractive characteristics.
    Their low power consumption, analogous to a magician''s enchantment, prolongs
    the life of IoT devices, allowing them to endure like timeless treasures. With
    the processing prowess of a savant, they manage data acquisition and sensor fusion
    seamlessly, transforming data into valuable insights. Integrated peripherals orchestrate
    seamless connection, and Real-time operating system (RTOS) support constructs
    multitasking enchantment. Like an enchanted portal, the memory contains firmware
    and data with powers of enchantment. Security features protect against theft and
    keep data safe and private. A fairy tale of connectivity options, from Wi-Fi and
    Bluetooth to LoRa and NB-IoT, unfolds, bridging the gaps between realms. The ability
    to get software updates wirelessly is a stroke of genius that ensures devices
    are always improving. Their small size and low cost entice both intrepid tinkerers
    and large-scale creators, beckoning them to bring their visions to life. MCUs
    lead the route to IoT success like a guide through an enchanted forest, flawlessly
    interweaving with different IoT platforms and cloud services. MCUs can weave the
    magical tapestry, bringing IoT to life and opening the door to a world of limitless
    possibilities. The Application Layer provides the sensor network''s data visualization.
    The farmer can take the appropriate action after reviewing the generated response
    by the system''s services. The application software delivers information in a
    user-friendly manner. It may relate to various field optimization deployments,
    including irrigation, pesticide drift control, cultivation process, crop disease
    prediction, mushroom production [43], and crop protection. In this study, the
    IoT system is used for different fields of applications is soil properties monitoring
    [58], [64], [64]; environment conditions monitoring [45], [46], greenhouse farming
    [53], [50], aquaponic system (S.-C. [55]), floriculture [48], hydroponic [49],
    disease detection [58], dairy farming [63], fishery system [89], crop health monitoring,
    crop disease detection [64]; smart irrigation system [64], and other smart agriculture
    applications [62], [69]. Energy consumption must be addressed to support the efficiency
    and effectiveness of a smart agricultural monitoring system. Due to the short
    battery life and restricted resources of sensor nodes, energy-saving strategies
    must be implemented throughout the sensor and network layers. Active and inactive
    operating time in each sensor node, the scheduling of information transmission,
    and the routing of data packets are addressed via energy-saving approaches. For
    immediate response and crop optimization, the system needs large sample nodes
    for the large area to detect the optimum conditions. Table 10 mentions various
    sensors and their utilization in the smart farming purpose with the respective
    model number. Table 10. Various models of sensors and their application in smart

    service (AWS), and Microsoft Azure, can visualize and analyze live data in the
    cloud. These applications integrate wireless products and solutions, antennas,
    modules, and RF lab services. 6. Future scopes Advanced emerging technologies,
    smart sensor clouds, big data analysis, and ubiquitous computing are new ground-breaking
    applications anticipated in recent years. The IoT applications enabled by cloud
    computing are referred to as a new concept in the advancement of the system to
    make agriculture tasks smart nature [156](X. [157]). There are some open future
    directions have been given below from the present study: 6.1. Crop health-based
    • A cloud computing-based monitoring and storage system can be adopted for measuring
    soil characteristics, crop, environmental and other parameters during in-field
    operations (A. [44]). • A system can be developed to predict the futuristic yield
    of crops and weather variations [43], [45]. • The system can also be used for
    crop health monitoring and prevention from insects [158]. • A smart irrigation
    system can be developed, which will be controlled by the autonomous cloud-sensor
    system for the large field size [56], [57]. • For Greenhouses, A cloud-controlled
    IoT-based system can be developed for monitoring and enhancing the yield of off-season
    production of vegetables and fruits under a controlled environment [53]. • An
    autonomous farming system that uses remote-controlled field crop planting machines
    must be developed to eliminate or deplete the need for humans during farming [58].
    • A cloud-based horticulture management system can help produce fruits throughout
    the year in different seasons [58]. • Smart farming actuators, drones, unmanned
    vehicles, and autonomous robots can be employed for smart farming [145]. • The
    data processing system that includes data management, visualization, and analysis
    can be implemented in IoT systems [159]. • A cloud-based IoT system should be
    developed for floriculture to keep flowers fresh and fragrant for longer [68].
    • Cloud services may enable farmers to use a real-time livestock monitoring system
    that automatically increases their economic status [48]. • A cloud-enabled agrological
    system to monitor and control the quality of Agri products during shipment is
    required. • Key insights may be uncovered through big data analytics, like the
    likelihood of certain catastrophes that can be averted by taking timely actions.
    • Big data analysis can be used for disease management in different crops [65].
    • A cloud-based web-enabled information system backed by big data may be developed
    to enlighten farmers about agriculture. • An advanced centralized agricultural
    equipment control system may be developed using big data analytics, which can
    be utilized for large-scale agriculture. • A Decision support system based on
    big data analysis can help farmers make many crop-related decisions to improve
    crop yield [47], [54]. • An automatic prediction system can be developed for deciding
    the appropriate fertilization period [89]. • It is possible to develop cost optimization
    methods basis on big data analytics that may be used in the agriculture industry
    on a broad scale. • For farmers, a user-friendly climatic information analysis
    service must be developed for their benefit (R. [52]). • Big data analytics may
    be integrated into a supply chain management system to evaluate Agri-products''
    profit margins. The analytics may provide the farmer with the previous information
    on the likely rotten period of the Agri-products, which will minimize the loss
    and improve the value gain. • There is a need to develop cost-effective RFID-based
    identification modules for the early detection of crop health issues [62]. • Real-time
    data on agriculture can be made available on smart mobile phones using Apps [62].
    • There is a need to develop further a remote-control farm monitoring system for
    automated agriculture [25]. • An integrated approach to detecting appropriate
    irrigation purposes for the different crops could be produced [159]. • Internet-based
    system design can be fabricated for pesticide spraying schedules depending on
    crop type, rate, and time. • The design of ubiquitous water flows control system
    is required [71]. So that water wastage can be minimized during smart farming.
    • ZigBee wireless network communication technology and ESP8266 module can be used
    for IoT systems because its advantage is low power consumption, cost-effectiveness,
    and high reliability [160]. • Such systems built around ubiquitous computing are
    always linked and informed, regardless of whether they are operating. Computers
    of ubiquitous computing can carry out activities such as device identification,
    communication, and interaction with the environment. This gives the ability to
    ensure consistency in any conceivable situation for control settings on the field.
    It is possible that ubiquitous computing may provide a solution for many agricultural
    applications, as is evident from these quoted remarks. Different tasks have been
    performed in the smart farming system, such as data collection, data transmission,
    data analysis, and management automatically to enhance crop productivity with
    better farming efficiency. Besides this, there are several hidden areas in which
    there is a serious need to implement the IoT system, such as human health assessment
    parameters, as illustrated in Fig. 12, and machine health assessment parameters.

    Fig. 12. Human health assessment parameters to be monitored via IoT system. 6.2.
    Human health-based There is a need to design a smart respiratory system because
    many farmers suffer from severe respiratory problems due to dusty fields, dangerous
    hydrogen sulfide accumulation, pesticide vapors, inhale gases from the tractor
    exhaust system that leads to many health-related problems, i.e., Lungs problem;
    organic dust toxicity problems, and other diseases related to silo fillers [161].
    • Designing a smart wearable system for monitoring air humidity, temperature,
    wind speed, etc., as these are important determinants of heat stress [162]. •
    A smart noise monitor should be developed with the smart indication because If
    noise exceeds 4000 Hz frequencies, it often causes hearing losses on an audiogram
    [12]. • A smart indicator with the IoT system could be developed to monitor difficult
    working conditions (e.g., inappropriate seats, uncomfortable postures, frequent
    handling operations, etc.), which can lead to spinal disorders [163]. • A smart
    gas detector should be developed for monitoring the produced hazardous fumes from
    agriculture machinery such as tailpipes of engines and other motorized agriculture
    machinery. • Development of the remote-control monitoring system for monitoring
    energy consumption and other natural resources in the different farm activities.
    6.3. Machine health-based Some of the future work can also be done on the machine
    health assessment parameters as mentioned below: • A smart fuel consumption rate
    monitor can be developed for different farming conditions [126]. • A real-time
    temperature measurer for the engine and gearbox can be developed. So that wear-and-tear-related
    action can be taken by monitoring the live status of the gearbox. • A live gas
    analyzer can monitor the exhaust gasses from the tractor tailpipe [127]. • A smart
    and live detector must be developed in the future due to high amplitude noise
    and vibrations from the tractor and toeing machinery during different field operations
    [164]. • A smart hydraulic system detector must be developed so that failure in
    the hydraulic system of tractors and agricultural machinery will be overcome in
    the future [53]. The agriculture sector has several future scopes to monitor the
    farm operator and notify the farmer via the IoT system. Moreover, there is always
    a need for the farmers to maintain the land for crop production. Furthermore,
    the government should develop financial policies to make agriculture smarter.
    7. Conclusions The agriculture industry has experienced a significant turning
    point in recent years. Traditional agricultural practices give way to a new \"intelligent\"
    perspective in the cultivation process. The so-called \"Agri-Food 4.0\" signifies
    a paradigm shift in agriculture by adding information and communication technology.
    Using WSNs, IoT sensors, UAS, optimization techniques, and machine learning algorithms
    can introduce a novel approach to smart farming by maximizing the potential of
    agricultural productivity. These emerging technologies can further enhance crop
    productivity and quality, reduce costs, and reduce the ecological footprint of
    conventional farming. Monitoring crops on a plant-by-plant basis has unquestionably
    led farmers to adopt innovative and cutting-edge techniques enabled by intelligent
    agricultural technology. The primary concern is maximizing crop productivity with
    minimum human involvement. In this context, IoT based system is the best solution
    for the global population and farmers due to its several advantages. IoT systems
    enable the different wireless technologies, modules, sensors, and gateways that
    collect massive live data for optimization and in-depth purpose. This article
    details the most recent advancements in IoT-based farming methods and technologies
    to help researchers develop a worldwide solution for IoT-based smart farming.
    With the growing global population and agricultural land diminishing, a serious
    need for smarter, healthier, and more efficient methods and procedures to perform
    agricultural activities. Research shows that advanced farming practices have evolved
    through time, and even more impressive developments are in the works. In adopting
    big data solutions, machine learning models in predictive analytic processes for
    smart farming play a more important role. The problem of inequity may sometimes
    have a major effect on how smart agricultural technologies are utilized, the scope
    for implementing new solutions, and infrastructural feasibility and cost. More
    comprehensive approaches to adopting machine learning models are required. However,
    a comprehensive machine learning model may assist the teams in effective and accurate
    analysis of the systems, solutions, and agricultural life cycle circumstances
    that are utilized as essential to smart farming conditions. Recent research has
    revealed numerous advancements in the agriculture scenario. It is noticed that
    data mining through IoT in a smart farming growing field allows the farmers to
    make the exact decision for the difficult farming conditions. It provides valuable
    insight, such as predicting yield, determining the best harvest time, and identifying
    the most suitable crop variety for the particular season. In conclusion, data
    mining through IoT systems enables smart farming to empower farmers with actionable
    insight, enhance productivity, and promote sustainable farming. Ultimately, it
    drives the transformation toward modern agriculture. Future research in the field
    of IoT-based smart farming could focus on optimizing the integration of IoT technologies
    in various farming aspects, leveraging data analytics and AI for informed decision-making,
    enhancing security and privacy measures, ensuring scalability for small-scale
    farmers, and exploring IoT-based supply chain management to streamline agricultural
    processes and improve overall efficiency. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    stages 1. Introduction Agriculture holds a cornerstone position in safeguarding
    global population survival, effectively mitigating hunger crises through its accelerated
    evolution [1]. The 2018 report by the World Resources Institute underscores a
    key goal of sustainable agriculture: a significant augmentation of agricultural
    productivity by 2050 to accommodate the dietary needs of an expected global populace
    of 10 billion [2]. Unmanned farms, a fusion of biotechnology, intelligent agricultural
    machinery, and information technology, offer a potent solution to fulfill these
    goals [3]. Serving as the backbone of Farm 4.0, unmanned farms epitomize advanced
    agricultural development, embodying the amalgamation of next-generation information
    technology, smart machinery, and progressive planting and farming techniques [4,5].
    Distinct from traditional farms, unmanned farms harness a gamut of sensors, automated
    systems, and data analytics to realize fully automated and intelligent management,
    consequently slashing labor costs significantly [6,7]. The overarching objective
    in the development of unmanned farms is to foster deep engagement with the entirety
    of the agricultural production process via robot-based intelligent agricultural
    machinery. In this approach three types of unmanned farms can be recognized: remote-control-based,
    remote-guarded, and those operating autonomously. Intelligent agricultural machinery,
    serving as the tangible backbone of unmanned farms, incorporates significant advances
    on traditional agricultural machinery in four distinct areas: intelligent perception,
    automated navigation, precision operation, and intelligent management. Appropriate
    utilization of this advanced agricultural machinery can effectively mitigate labor
    shortages while optimizing long-term costs [8,9]. The agricultural Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicle (UAV), a significant component of intelligent farming machinery, is distinguished
    by precise operation, high efficiency, environmental sustainability, simple operation,
    and a high degree of automation and intelligence [10]. At their current stage
    of development, UAVs have found extensive applications in various operational
    facets of unmanned farms. These applications include crop monitoring and management
    [11,12], precision spraying [13,14], automatic crop detection [15,16], as well
    as crop mapping and yield estimation [17,18]. However, the existing level of technological
    advancement, coupled with relevant policy regulations, imposes substantial limitations
    on UAVs in terms of payload and range [19]. Specifically, when UAVs are utilized
    in large-scale unmanned farms, challenges arise such as the frequent need to replace
    batteries and fluid refills during single UAV operations, thereby leading to reduced
    operational efficiency and increased labor intensity. Consequently, to enhance
    operational efficiency, strategies beyond simply increasing the payload capacity
    and endurance of single UAVs are required. A viable solution involves deploying
    UAV swarms to conduct cluster operations collaboratively, thereby expanding the
    operational area and consequently enhancing the operational efficiency of the
    UAV [20]. Recently, UAV swarm cooperative operation systems have emerged as a
    potential means to augment mission efficiency, warranting further investigation
    [21,22]. A UAV swarm employs predefined modes of operation to facilitate simultaneous
    execution of specific tasks. This strategy curtails individual UAV operation times,
    accelerates the overall task completion speed, and significantly enhances operational
    efficiency for similar tasks [23]. The contrasting operational modes of single
    UAVs and UAV swarms are depicted in Figure 1. Furthermore, compared with single
    UAV operation, UAV swarms offer superior system reliability. Uncertainties during
    operation can cause some UAVs to malfunction; however, in such instances, UAV
    swarms can complete the corresponding tasks using other operational UAVs. Additionally,
    during operation allocation, UAV swarms can flexibly distribute tasks to individual
    UAVs based on distinct areas and operational scenarios, thereby further improving
    operational efficiency. Figure 1. Operational model of single UAV and UAV swarm
    (reproduced from [24], with permission from IEEE, 2022). Currently, both domestic
    and international researchers are enthusiastically exploring the application of
    UAV swarm cooperative operation systems in sustainable agriculture. Although there
    have been some preliminary achievements, the research is still in its nascent
    stage. The intricate and varied nature of the agricultural environment implies
    that a single UAV swarm control method may not be universally applicable across
    diverse scenarios [25]. This complexity and diversity encompasses a range of factors,
    including the variety of environments such as orchards and farmlands, diverse
    task types like pesticide spraying and seeding, and the intricacy of weather conditions,
    including light intensity, wind speed, and temperature, among others. Different
    tasks necessitate specific flight altitudes, speeds, payloads, and modes, while
    varying conditions influence UAV flight stability, sensor performance, energy
    consumption, and swarm reliability. To effectively integrate UAV swarm technology
    with sustainable unmanned agriculture and thus reduce production costs and improve
    operational efficiency, it is essential to comprehensively review and analyze
    the application scenarios of UAV swarms on unmanned farms. This paper presents
    a comprehensive review of the current literature on UAV swarm technology and its
    applications in unmanned farming. The analysis encompasses the prevailing techniques,
    challenges, and future directions for agricultural UAV swarms. The objectives
    of this review are: (1) to assist researchers in identifying effective control
    methodologies and understanding the technologies that underpin the development
    of UAV swarm systems in agriculture; and (2) to highlight promising and notable
    methods for creating guidance maps by comprehensively reviewing the application
    of UAV swarms and technical characteristics of current unmanned farming. The remainder
    of this paper is organized as follows. The second section primarily discusses
    the existing UAV swarm control modes, offering a comparative summary across four
    distinct aspects: task assignment mode, trajectory planning mode, communication
    navigation mode, and visual navigation mode. The third section provides a summary
    of the four stages of UAV swarm deployment in unmanned farms, namely, cultivation,
    planting, management, and harvesting. This section also presents an analysis to
    determine which collaborative approach is most suitable at various stages and
    under different operational tasks. The fourth section analyzes and discusses the
    application of existing UAV swarm techniques on unmanned farms. Finally, the fifth
    section discusses the conclusions and future prospects. 2. Materials and Methods
    The sources used for the compilation of the present review were the databases
    of Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, IEEE Xplorer, and Wiley. The inclusion
    criteria for studies in this review were: (1) A comprehensive review was undertaken
    of multi-UAV cooperative navigation techniques from the past decade. (2) All relevant
    research on UAV swarm technology across the four stages of agricultural production,
    namely “cultivation, planting, management, and harvesting”, was summarized. However,
    due to the limited application of UAV swarm technology in the agricultural domain
    at this stage, studies on individual UAV operations have been referenced as alternatives
    in areas lacking UAV swarm applications. (3) For articles by the same author(s)
    reporting incremental findings, only the most recent articles were incorporated
    into this review. Information on the research objectives, type of UAV swarm control,
    agricultural stage in which applied, the technological pros and cons, and technical
    challenges was extracted from each selected paper. By juxtaposing various control
    paradigms against the distinct operational features inherent to each agricultural
    phase, a series of analyses was undertaken to discern which methods hold prominence
    in various agricultural production stages. This review categorizes UAV swarm technologies
    into distinct types based on their salient features and pivotal technical nuances,
    and then evaluates the potential each offers within unmanned farming scenarios.
    In conclusion, by synthesizing the current technical impediments and emerging
    research avenues, a visionary perspective on the trajectory of UAV swarms in future
    automated agriculture is presented. 3. Existing UAV Swarm Control Methods UAV
    swarm navigation methodologies can be bifurcated into two primary categories:
    absolute navigation and relative navigation. Absolute navigation entails the segmentation
    of a mission objective into several smaller tasks by a ground computer, either
    prior to or during the flight of the UAV swarm. These tasks are created using
    relevant UAV task or trajectory algorithms and transmitted to each UAV, which
    then performs the assigned tasks to execute the navigational flight of the UAV
    swarm [26,27]. This mode can be further subclassified into task assignment collaborative
    mode and trajectory planning collaborative mode. Relative navigation, integral
    to enabling UAV swarm navigation, operates on the principle of onboard sensors
    capturing information such as relative positions, attitudes, and flight conditions
    of neighboring or primary UAVs during the flight of the UAV swarm. Subsequently,
    each UAV adjusts its flight status and position based on preset constraints, facilitating
    UAV swarm relative positional navigation [28,29,30]. This mode can be further
    subdivided into communication collaborative navigation mode and visual collaborative
    navigation mode. In this section, a comprehensive review of contemporary collaborative
    navigation methodologies for UAV swarms is presented. These methodologies are
    summarized from the vantage points of task assignment collaborative mode, trajectory
    planning collaborative mode, communication collaborative navigation mode, and
    visual collaborative navigation mode. 3.1. Task Assignment Collaborative Mode
    The task assignment mode of a UAV swarm operates on the principle that, prior
    to the UAVs’ takeoff, individual tasks are allocated to each UAV based on user
    task requirements. These tasks incorporate parameters such as task area, duration,
    altitude, and more for each UAV. Upon completion of task assignments, the parameters
    are uploaded to each UAV. Subsequently, UAVs compute their respective flight paths
    using their inherent path planning algorithms based on the task specifics, making
    necessary adjustments to the flight path as per real-time conditions during the
    flight, and eventually accomplishing the user’s comprehensive task [31,32]. This
    mode of UAV swarm task assignment can further be classified into two types depending
    on the task assignment methodology: the centralized task assignment method and
    the distributed task assignment typical method. 3.1.1. Centralized Task Assignment
    Method The centralized task assignment typical method, being the most commonly
    employed navigation technique under the UAV swarm task navigation mode, is frequently
    utilized [33,34]. This method involves the decomposition of tasks into multiple
    subtasks based on the number of UAVs, types and weights of tasks, and flight environment
    constraints, all executed via a ground task assignment terminal. These subtasks
    are then uploaded to the flight control system of each UAV in the swarm, which
    executes its mission flight according to the received subtasks. In one study [35],
    UAV target task planning is conceptualized as a UAV path problem incorporating
    a time window and priority requirements. The authors propose a genetic algorithm
    equipped with an integrated mixed-integer programming solver. Another study [36]
    introduces a distributed multi-hop relay path optimization algorithm based on
    a matching game. This algorithm establishes a priority function for source nodes
    and relay nodes, elucidating the task execution order. It represents a more typical
    list planning method for optimization. Addressing the motion trajectory problem
    of fixed-wing UAVs in complex three-dimensional environments, ref. [37] employs
    genetic algorithms and particle swarm algorithms to compute feasible and optimal
    motion trajectories while taking into account the dynamic characteristics of the
    aircraft. Apart from utilizing particle algorithms, this study also incorporates
    genetic algorithms from intelligent algorithms. Genetic algorithms exhibit high
    scalability, can be amalgamated with numerous other algorithm types, and can initiate
    search from the population, which offers potential parallelism and facilitates
    multiple individual comparisons simultaneously. Figure 2 provides an example of
    a centralized task assignment method. Figure 2. Example of a centralized tasking
    approach. (a) Optimal Task Allocation (reproduced from [34], with permission from
    IEEE, 2020). (b) UAV Surveillance Mission Planning (reproduced from [35], with
    permission from IEEE, 2014). The distinguishing feature of the centralized task
    assignment method lies in the presence of a singular task assignment terminal
    that decomposes and assigns tasks, managing the operations of the entire UAV swarm
    system. Each UAV exclusively receives instructions from the task assignment terminal,
    devoid of any information sharing or interactions. The solutions derived through
    the centralized task assignment method represent either global or local optimal
    solutions, thereby achieving optimal system decision-making and control. Nonetheless,
    the centralized task assignment method primarily resolves complex combinatorial
    optimization problems, and hence exhibits relatively high computational complexity.
    Moreover, due to the absence of information feedback between the UAVs and the
    task assignment terminal, the real-time performance of this method warrants further
    enhancement. 3.1.2. Distributed Task Assignment Method Contrary to the centralized
    task assignment method, the distributed task assignment method allows for the
    transmission of individual UAV information back to the task assignment terminal
    in addition to task decomposition and distribution. Consequently, the task assignment
    terminal assumes the role of an inter-network connector [38]. This connector enables
    the UAV swarm system to form a networked structure, facilitating information sharing,
    task coordination, and conflict resolution among UAVs through the inter-network
    connector. The predominant distributed task assignment methods include multi-Agent
    theoretical methods and market mechanism-like methods [39]. Multi-Agent theoretical
    methods predominantly consider each UAV as an autonomous intelligent entity, orchestrating
    the mutual actions of each agent, appropriately analyzing and interpreting the
    target task, segmenting the overarching task into multiple small tasks of comparable
    intensity, and allocating them to each agent. Subsequently, the agents collaborate
    to accomplish the target task [40,41,42]. Market mechanism-like methods involve
    the application of market models such as contract tendering and item auctioning
    for task decomposition. The decomposed tasks are made available for bidding via
    open tendering or auctioning, with UAVs bidding in accordance with their actual
    task situation and flight status. Eventually, tasks are assigned based on the
    actual auction outcome [43,44]. Figure 3 provides an illustration of the distributed
    task assignment method. Figure 3. Example of a distributed task assignment approach
    (reproduced from [45], with permission from IEEE, 2022). The distributed structure
    boasts high autonomy and robustness, adeptly adapting to dynamic and uncertain
    battlefield environments. Given the significant enhancements in UAV platform autonomy
    capabilities, the distributed control structure presents broad application prospects
    and has emerged as a vital research direction for UAV swarm control. The UAV swarm
    task assignment mode offers notable benefits including a high success rate and
    robust resilience to unexpected events during task execution. Simultaneously,
    given the pre-established target tasks for each UAV, energy consumption and other
    costs can be kept relatively low during flight. In the course of task execution,
    each UAV is also equipped with the flexibility to adjust its target trajectory
    based on the actual conditions encountered during flight. Consequently, this method
    exhibits high robustness, substantially improving task completion rates. 3.2.
    Trajectory Planning Collaborative Mode The operational principle of the UAV swarm
    trajectory planning mode entails determining the starting point of the operational
    task prior to the aircraft’s takeoff. This mode considers a variety of complex
    constraints such as the maximum operational radius constraint, minimum turning
    radius constraint, no-fly zone constraint, time-domain collaborative constraint,
    and airspace collaborative constraint for each aircraft. Collaborating with the
    methods between each aircraft, this mode plans a single or multiple sets of safe
    and reliable flight paths for UAV swarm with shared task objectives. This ensures
    optimal overall performance of the UAV swarm during operations, facilitating successful
    completion of the target task [46,47,48]. Research methods commonly employed for
    the UAV swarm trajectory planning mode primarily encompass the optimal path planning
    method, the planning method predicated on artificial potential fields, and the
    planning method based on swarm intelligence algorithms. 3.2.1. Optimal Path Planning
    Method The A* algorithm, a typical method in optimal path planning, segments the
    surrounding environment into equally sized grids. It estimates the optimal positions
    in the surrounding grids using heuristic information and continually identifies
    the optimal nodes, thereby facilitating the search for an optimal and shortest
    path [49,50,51]. However, the A* algorithm has certain limitations. When there
    exist two or more optimal values in the path grid, the algorithm cannot guarantee
    the optimality of the searched path. Furthermore, the A* algorithm’s efficacy
    is heavily reliant on the environment and is only applicable under favorable conditions.
    In instances when the derived map is large, the computational load increases,
    resulting in higher latency and inferior parallelism. The Probabilistic Graph
    Space method initially divides the environment into equally sized grids and subsequently
    excludes grids that fail to meet constraints such as mutual constraints within
    the UAV swarm, flight task requirements, etc. The remaining grids constitute the
    optimal flight path [52,53]. The Probabilistic Graph Space method exhibits benefits
    such as a low order of magnitude, swift construction time, and maximal distance
    from threats and obstacles. Nevertheless, during the modeling process, the finer
    the map grid division, the more accurate the map description and the higher the
    flight accuracy. However, this also results in the storage of more map information,
    slowing down computation speed and inducing higher latency during flight. Figure
    4 provides an illustration of the optimal path planning method. Figure 4. Example
    of optimal path planning method. (a) Path planning for UAVs using A* Algorithm
    (reproduced from [54], with permission from IEEE, 2019). (b) The cooperative strike
    path under Voronoi diagram (reproduced from [55], with permission from Wireless
    Communications and Mobile Computing, 2022). 3.2.2. Planning Method Based on Artificial
    Potential Field The planning method based on artificial potential fields is a
    trajectory planning method that emulates spatial force fields. During the execution
    of tasks by the UAV swarm, the method simulates the task target attracting the
    UAVs, while UAVs and obstacles within the flight trajectory repel each other.
    Due to this attractive force, the UAVs progressively converge towards the target,
    while the repulsive force ensures safe flight distances within the UAV swarm,
    thereby fulfilling the target task [56]. To address the limitations of traditional
    artificial potential field methods, such as unreachable targets, susceptibility
    to local minimum values, inability to circumnavigate obstacles, and the absence
    of trajectory optimization strategies, the authors of [57] proposed a hybrid method
    premised on a Lyapunov guidance vector field (LGVF) and an improved interference
    fluid dynamics system (IIFDS), integrating vertical components, steering control,
    and speed control. A UAV Swarm flight trajectory based on an artificial potential
    field is shown in Figure 5. Figure 5. UAV Swarm flight trajectory based on artificial
    potential field (reproduced from [52], with permission from Complex System Modeling
    and Simulation, 2022). The planning method based on artificial potential fields
    enables the swarm to effectively circumvent obstacles in the flight path and is
    characterized by high safety, superior real-time performance, and rapid planning
    speed. However, in complex environments, it is prone to local optimal values.
    When the swarm state changes, the dynamic planning capability of each UAV is compromised,
    and when the repulsive force of obstacles equals the attractive force of the target
    point, the UAVs may oscillate near the obstacles. 3.2.3. Planning Method Based
    on Swarm Intelligence Algorithm Planning methods premised on swarm intelligence
    algorithms draw parallels to the swarm intelligence methods used in task assignment
    modes. Such methods emulate natural phenomena like ant colonies and bee swarms,
    viewing the UAV swarm as a collective entity and individual UAVs as components
    within the collective. The collective perceives the task target as the ultimate
    state, with individual entities autonomously adjusting and formulating plans according
    to their specific environments. Through the influence of these individual entities,
    the collective progressively approaches the ultimate state, ultimately deriving
    a solution that approximates the global optimum [58,59]. Swarm intelligence-based
    planning methods currently rank among the most widely researched algorithms in
    the realm of UAV swarm trajectory planning. Prominent among these algorithms are
    the ant colony algorithms [60], bee swarm algorithms [61], wolf pack algorithms
    [59], fish swarm algorithms [62], and genetic algorithms [63], among others. Notably,
    traditional swarm intelligence algorithms are susceptible to missing the optimal
    solution during the search process within the solution space, due to the randomness
    inherent in initial value settings. This often results in settling for local optima,
    which substantially diminishes planning accuracy. Figure 6 illustrates an example
    of a planning method predicated on the swarm intelligence algorithm. Figure 6.

    based on ant colony algorithm (reproduced from [64], with permission from Computational
    Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2021). Swarm intelligence-based planning methods
    possess several merits including rapid planning speed, strong parallelism, easy
    coordination, and the propensity to converge towards optimal values. Utilizing
    swarm intelligence algorithms allows for the unification and processing of multi-machine
    collaborative target assignment and trajectory planning with similar algorithmic
    structures [65]. However, they also have certain drawbacks. For instance, intelligent
    algorithms require the adjustment of many parameters, which makes the selection
    of key parameters a challenging task. Additionally, computational loopholes within
    intelligent algorithms could cause the UAV swarm system to stagnate or enter an
    infinite loop, ultimately leading to failures in planning and coordination. 3.3.
    Communication Collaborative Navigation Mode Communication cooperative navigation
    stands as the most fundamental and core navigation method for UAV swarms [66].
    It refers to the process whereby a UAV swarm in flight does not rely exclusively
    on ground stations or satellites for control. Instead, each UAV, leveraging high-precision
    sensor-acquired information such as location and attitude, views itself as a communication
    node [67]. Via Bluetooth, ZigBee, or WiFi wireless transmission modules, a wireless
    communication network is established among the UAV swarm for information exchange,
    fostering cooperation among various UAVs, and forming a unified entity [68]. Communication
    cooperative navigation can effectively enhance the comprehensive operational ability
    and expandability of the UAV swarm system, and it effectively assists other communication
    methods. Currently, as the number of UAVs in UAV swarm systems gradually increases,
    so does the volume of data generated. The existing UAV swarm architecture, characterized
    by MAC protocols and routing algorithms, is challenged in handling this large
    volume of data, impacting the overall operation quality of the UAV swarm system.
    Thus, the authors of [69] introduced a deep Q-learning (DQN) model designed to
    optimize the entire network performance in view of the dynamic swarm topology
    and time-varying link conditions. Another study [70] proposed a multi-method combined
    UAV communication strategy, which besides utilizing the traditional UAV-to-UAV
    (U2U) architecture to form a network, also integrated a cellular UAV communication
    strategy, treating each UAV as a relay node for data transmission. Figure 7 provides
    an illustration of the wireless router-based UAV swarm control method. Figure
    7. Wireless router-based UAV swarm control method (reproduced from [71], with
    permission from IEEE, 2020). The communication cooperative navigation mode of
    UAV swarms allows for network construction independent of other pre-established
    network facilities. It is capable of automatically forming a network in any operational
    scenario and dynamically modifying the network structure in accordance with specific
    operational requirements, endowing UAV swarm communication cooperative navigation
    with robust anti-interference capability [72,73]. Furthermore, it possesses high
    intelligence and versatile functions. However, it also has noticeable drawbacks:
    (1) The network protocols need improvement. Currently, the speed of UAVs in communication
    cooperative navigation of UAV swarms primarily falls within the range of 5 m/s
    to 15 m/s. At higher speeds, rapid movement of UAVs leads to frequent changes
    in the communication network topology, escalating the overhead of the communication
    network and exacerbating data congestion, thereby affecting real-time data transmission.
    (2) The communication security is inadequate. The wireless links and mobile topology
    within a UAV swarm network present varying degrees of security weaknesses. Additionally,
    under UAV swarm cooperative navigation flight, due to the complexity of the operational
    environment, safety issues may arise from other radio frequency interferences,
    among other factors. (3) The substantial information payload results in compromised
    real-time performance. During flight, the UAV swarm system generates a considerable
    amount of redundant UAV information. Given the limited existing wireless transmission
    bandwidth of UAV swarm communication, it cannot process the information promptly.
    This directly impacts the efficiency of information transmission, leading to significant
    latency between UAV swarm systems. 3.4. Visual Collaborative Navigation Mode Recent
    advancements in vision-related recognition algorithms have thrust visual navigation
    into the spotlight as a significant research topic in both domestic and international
    navigation fields [74]. Compared with conventional radio sensors, visual sensors
    have the benefit of compactness and cost-effectiveness. Notably, the images collected
    by visual sensors contain a wealth of information, which when coupled with increasingly
    sophisticated visual algorithms, makes visual navigation a highly efficient method.
    During visual cooperative navigation in UAV swarms, UAVs capture feature information
    of other UAVs using visual sensors. This information is then processed through
    modeling, filtering, and other techniques to track the targets that fulfill certain
    requirements [75]. Estimating their motion state based on the target’s position,
    UAVs adjust factors like flight attitude or speed to adhere to preset constraints
    and complete the UAV swarm’s navigational flight. Within the visual cooperative
    navigation mode for UAV swarm, the primary control information for the UAV is
    derived entirely from the feature information provided by the visual sensors.
    Hence, the results produced by visual analysis have a direct impact on the flight
    quality and safety of the UAV. The key technology in visual cooperative navigation
    for UAV swarms involves extracting feature information from UAVs based on the
    images gathered by visual sensors and fusing this extracted information with UAVs’
    inertial navigation data to accomplish the tracking flight. Visual cooperative
    navigation mode for UAV swarms can be categorized into three types: visually guided
    navigation, visual multi-source information fusion navigation, and visual SLAM
    navigation. 3.4.1. Visually Guided Navigation Visual guidance pertains to a technique
    where UAVs, during the flight process of a swarm system, obtain all feature information
    and position-related data through visual sensors. Utilizing this obtained data
    and preset constraints, UAVs adjust their flight statuses to track the flight
    of one UAV or a UAV swarm, thereby achieving coordinated UAV swarm flight. This
    method is primarily employed in areas where GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite
    System) signals are weak or absent. Given its reliance on direct visual tracking
    for flight, it effectively circumvents issues induced by GNSS signals. A typical
    technique in visual guidance is the “Leader-Follower” approach [76]. In this methodology,
    certain UAVs assume the role of leaders while others act as followers within the
    swarm. Each follower has at least one designated leader, and within the swarm
    system, some UAVs may serve both as a leader and a follower. This hierarchical
    structure simplifies the swarm system into a singular motion planning problem.
    In a string or chain-like structure, each UAV merely needs to follow the preceding
    UAV. Figure 8 provides an illustration of the “Leader-Follower” visual guidance
    method. Figure 8. Examples of leader-follower-based visual guidance methods. (a)
    Vision-Aided Multi-UAV Autonomous Flocking (reproduced from [54], with permission
    from IEEE, 2019). (b) Optical Tracking System for Multi-UAV Clustering (reproduced
    from [21], with permission from IEEE, 2021). The visual guidance approach allows
    UAV swarm systems to function effectively in areas where GPS signals are unavailable,
    broadening the potential application scenarios of such systems and introducing
    a novel methodology for their operation [77]. Nevertheless, given that visual
    guidance is entirely dependent on data provided by visual sensors, it places substantial
    demands on the reliability of both the visual sensors and visual recognition algorithms.
    Moreover, as visual sensors are sensitive to variations in light intensity, and
    visual recognition requirements can fluctuate under different sunlight conditions,
    enhancing the robustness of visual recognition algorithms remains a crucial research
    objective. 3.4.2. Vision-Based Multi-Source Information Fusion Method Unlike the
    visual guidance method, which exclusively employs vision to guide the UAV swarm
    system, the vision-assisted method integrates information from GPS, Inertial Measurement
    Unit (IMU), and Magnetic (MAG) sensors in addition to using vision to extract
    and track feature information [78]. The master UAV is spatially localized by GPS
    and follows a predetermined route. Then, the follower UAV uses vision sensors
    to extract the master’s feature information. Upon obtaining the relevant positional
    information, it fuses the multi-source information with the GPS, IMU, and MAG
    data on the follower. This results in a flight path determined by the optimal
    method obtained from multi-source information fusion [79,80]. A typical vision-assisted
    method is the Parent-Child approach. In this approach, only one UAV is treated
    as the parent, and it does not require the installation of visual sensors. Instead,
    it directly uses GPS for path localization. There can be at least one or more
    UAVs acting as children, which are equipped with visual sensors along with other
    positional sensors such as GPS, IMU, and MAG. Concurrently, children UAVs can
    further function as parents for other UAVs. The vision-assisted method can better
    realize UAV tracking and localization during the flight process through the fusion
    of multi-source sensor information, thereby improving the operational accuracy
    of the UAV swarm system. Figure 9 illustrates the vision-based multi-source information
    fusion method. Figure 9. Example of a vision-based multi-source information fusion
    method (reproduced from [81], with permission from the American Association for
    the Advancement of Science, 2022). (A) Hardware components of our flight platform;
    (B) The system architecture. 3.4.3. V-SLAM Visual Simultaneous Localization and
    Mapping (V-SLAM) is a technology that utilizes visual sensors to simultaneously
    accomplish localization and mapping. While it can provide services for ground
    robots, it also has crucial applications in the localization and navigation of
    UAVs [82,83]. V-SLAM primarily consists of five components: sensor data acquisition,
    front-end visual odometry, back-end nonlinear optimization, loop closure detection,
    and map building [84]. Figure 10 illustrates the V-SLAM framework. In situations
    where the UAV lacks a priori information about the environment, it first acquires
    and preprocesses the image information through the vision sensor. The front-end
    visual odometry then utilizes the image information captured by the vision sensor
    and the related position information to reconstruct the 3D motion of the camera,
    resulting in a localized motion map. Figure 10. Schematic diagram of V-SLAM framework.
    However, the front-end visual odometry can only provide trajectories and maps
    for a short duration and cannot provide all maps. Therefore, it is necessary to
    employ back-end nonlinear optimization to match the optimal trajectory over an
    extended period with the large-scale optimization of the optimal mapping, ultimately
    leading to the construction of the map. The front-end visual odometry only considers
    the correlation of neighboring time frames and cannot build globally consistent
    trajectories and maps. Loop closure detection can effectively identify instances
    where the camera passes through the same location multiple times, providing longer
    constraints than neighboring frames. UAV swarm visual co-navigation based on V-SLAM
    technology enhances the independence and anti-interference capabilities of UAVs
    [85]. However, the inherent limitations of V-SLAM frequently manifest as follows:
    Firstly, typical aerial images may exhibit local blurring phenomena, impacting
    the accuracy of UAV localization. Secondly, the extensive integration operation
    processes may lead to the emergence of cumulative error, which consequently influences
    the system’s accuracy. Additionally, SLAM itself suffers from issues of scale
    uncertainty and scale drift, which can severely affect system outcomes. Figure
    11 depicts the UAV flight trajectory based on V-SLAM. Figure 11. UAV flight trajectory
    based on V-SLAM (reproduced from [86], with permission from Remote Sens-Basel,
    2020). The UAV swarm visual co-navigation mode utilizes visual sensors to directly
    co-navigate UAV positions. By providing reliable relative position and attitude
    information to the UAV swarm system, it enables each UAV within the UAV swarm
    system to use visual sensors to estimate the relative positions and distances
    of other UAVs within its own coordinate system. In the presence of GPS, visual
    navigation can contribute to the navigation information, facilitating UAV swarm
    cooperative navigation. When GPS is denied, visual navigation can act as an independent
    navigation system to accomplish relative navigation between UAVs in a swarm. Moreover,
    visual navigation can achieve cooperative navigation of a UAV swarm system without
    requiring mutual communication between UAVs, making it an essential means of cooperative
    navigation in complex environments. However, the current UAV swarm visual cooperative
    navigation still has several shortcomings: (1) The complexity of the environment
    where the UAV swarm system operates necessitates the development of a robust recognition
    algorithm. This algorithm should be able to reduce interference of UAV recognition
    from obstructive objects and accurately identify and track UAVs in a complex environment.
    (2) In terms of data processing, while visual sensors provide rich information,
    they also generate a substantial amount of data. As the number of UAVs in the
    UAV swarm system increases, the amount of data produced by the visual sensor rises
    exponentially. Therefore, determining how to process and utilize the obtained
    visual information is a key issue that requires resolution. (3) After acquiring
    effective and reliable data, the formulation of a reasonable control logic and
    strategy to actualize the UAV swarm system is necessary. (4) Exploring strategies
    that ensure the UAV swarm system operates at maximum efficiency with minimal resource
    consumption during actual flight is also a direction worthy of investigation.
    This section has comprehensively summarized and analyzed various implementations
    of the UAV swarm system at the current stage of development, and these are presented
    in Table 1. Due to the complexity of the operational environment within farmlands,
    further summarization and analysis of the practical application scenarios of UAV
    swarms on unmanned farms at the current stage of development are required. Consequently,
    the following section will explore and analyze the application of UAV swarm on
    unmanned farms. Table 1. Overview of the existing navigation systems. 4. UAV Swarms
    for Unmanned Farms The operational schema of autonomous farming primarily encompasses
    four stages: cultivation, planting, management, and harvesting. Each stage is
    integral to the overall farming process. UAVs, serving as a pivotal component
    of contemporary agricultural machinery, can significantly augment both the quality
    and efficiency of agricultural tasks across these stages. To establish a versatile
    control methodology for UAV swarm operations adaptable to diverse agricultural
    requirements, it is essential to conduct a comprehensive analysis of UAV swarm
    applications within the realms of cultivation, planting, management, and harvesting.
    Given the nascent stage of UAV swarm technology application in sustainable agriculture,
    this section seeks to elucidate the role of UAV and UAV swarm technology in sustainable
    agriculture, particularly within the context of the aforementioned four stages.
    4.1. Application of UAV Swarms in Cultivation The field cultivation stage primarily
    encompasses two facets. The first involves preparing the soil for crop planting
    through processes such as turning over, crushing, and smoothing. The second facet
    involves surveying and mapping the cultivated land to preemptively mitigate damage.
    At this stage, UAVs are predominantly utilized for the surveying and mapping of
    cultivated land. Field cultivation, a critical component in human sustenance,
    is increasingly threatened due to economic development leading to the occupation
    and degradation of cultivated land. Consequently, safeguarding these lands has
    emerged as a global priority to ensure food security. As highly efficient low-altitude
    remote sensing equipment, UAVs, when equipped with the appropriate sensors, can
    automatically survey, map, and calculate the area of cultivated land. In [87],
    a method was proposed for extracting and mapping farmland plots in southern China
    using UAV multispectral images and deep learning. The application of a multispectral
    camera on a UAV enabled the capture of images while flying over cultivated land.
    Through deep learning technology, these captured images were stitched together,
    facilitating the mapping and calculation of cultivated land data. Figure 12a presents
    a surveying and mapping diagram of farmland plots. Figure 12. Application of UAVs
    in mapping and charting of arable land. (A) Mapping of agricultural land parcels
    (reproduced from [87], with permission from Drones, 2023) (a). A test site located
    in Guangzhou, China, which can represent the typical regionof croplands of southern
    China. Some non-conventional cropland parcels, which were separated into many
    small trial areas: citrus (b), vegetables (c), rice (d), and corn (e). (B) Farmland
    classification effect (reproduced from [88], with permission from Agriculture,
    2020). The authors of [88] employed high-resolution images captured by UAVs, alongside
    multispectral images and elevation data from a digital surface model, to classify
    agricultural land use. The practical experiment demonstrated that the classification
    accuracy could reach up to 92%, attesting to the viability of UAVs in classifying
    and mapping agricultural land. Figure 12b illustrates the classification effect
    diagram. In another study [89], UAVs were used to detect and capture images of
    agricultural land areas. Through high-pass filters, wavelets, principal component
    transformations, and other methods, image fusion was performed to measure and
    calculate agricultural land areas. The experimental results indicated that the
    error of the obtained agricultural land area was less than 20 cm. The application
    of UAV swarm technology in cultivated land mapping is relatively less explored.
    Research conducted by [90] proposed a method for mapping and measuring cultivated
    land information based on three UAVs. This approach leverages UAV swarm technology
    under the collaborative task allocation mode, in which an overarching flight task
    is divided among the UAVs. Post-division, the three UAVs proceed with autonomous
    flight operations as per their assigned tasks and conduct a collective analysis
    of the gathered image data. To validate the proposed method, a practical flight
    experiment was conducted in an area measuring 330 m × 200 m. The results indicated
    that each of the three UAVs accurately executed the mapping of the cultivated
    land in accordance with the assigned tasks, with the mapping accuracy observed
    to be high. Figure 13 shows the comparison between the theoretical flight trajectory
    and the actual flight trajectory of the three UAVs, providing evidence of the
    effective implementation of the task allocation strategy. Figure 13. Measurement
    and mapping of cropland information for all three UAV flight trajectories (reproduced
    from [90], with permission from John Wiley and Sons, 2011). Labels tA, tB, tC,
    and tD refer to peaks of the tracking error. ①, ②, ③ denote the trajectory of
    the flight area of the three UAVs, respectively. In conclusion, the measurement
    and mapping of cultivated land information require large-scale land coverage,
    whether it is cultivated or non-cultivated land. As a result, the information
    exchange requirement within the UAV swarm is relatively low, where the tasks only
    need to be sent to UAVs after decomposition. Each UAV can then conduct operational
    flights according to the scope of their respective tasks and collect relevant
    data. Therefore, the UAV swarm cooperative mode is well-suited to task assignment
    in the context of cultivated land information mapping and surveying. This approach
    allows for efficient and coordinated mapping operations, ensuring accurate data
    collection and analysis for agricultural land monitoring and management. 4.2.
    UAV Swarms in Planting The planting phase is pivotal within autonomous farming,
    with the density and uniformity of planting directly influencing crop germination.
    Unmanned helicopters, given their compact size, flexible maneuverability, and
    ability to execute programmed flight paths, provide noteworthy advantages, particularly
    within hilly terrains typified by small plots and significant altitude variations,
    where conventional, larger ground seeding machinery may find navigation challenging.
    Currently, the implementation of seeding strategies that employ unmanned aircraft
    is a burgeoning area of research [91,92], with the potential to significantly
    enhance the precision and efficiency of crop planting operations, especially within
    challenging agricultural landscapes. The authors of [93] delineate the design
    of a UAV-based device for rice seeding and sowing. As illustrated in Figure 14,
    the seeds stored in a seed box are funneled into a seed dispenser, from where
    they are distributed to various launching modules via a dispersing device. Subsequently,
    each launching module’s milling wheel accelerates the seeds prior to their deposit
    on the ground. Following field tests, this device exhibited an impressive performance
    under operational conditions of a 1.5 m working height and a sowing rate of 38.56
    kg/hm2. The results demonstrated a significant in-row sowing performance, exhibiting
    a sowing rate deviation of a mere 1.89%. Sixteen days post-sowing, the seed emergence
    rate stabilized at an average seedling rate of 82.63%, yielding 6775.50 kg/hm2.
    This sowing approach has similar performance to the spot-shot sowing method [94,95],
    ensuring a relatively stable seed sowing position to effectively manage planting
    density and guarantee a high level of uniformity. Figure 14. UAV-based paddy seeding
    device (reproduced from [93], with permission from International Journal of Agricultural
    and Biological Engineering, 2022). Contrasting with the methodologies previously
    described, in [96], the authors delineate the design of a UAV-based centrifugal
    disc seeding device. According to this study, seeds, after being discharged from
    the seed dispenser, are fed directly into a centrifugal disc. The high-speed rotation
    of this disc generates a centrifugal force that propels the seeds onto the ground,
    thereby completing the seeding process. The fundamental architecture of this system
    is depicted in Figure 15. However, this centrifugal disc seeding approach diverges
    from prior methods in its use of centrifugal force for seeding, rendering the
    control of seeding density and uniformity during the actual seeding operation
    unfeasible. Figure 15. UAV-based centrifugal disk seeding device (reproduced from
    [96], with permission from International Journal of Agricultural and Biological
    Engineering, 2018). Currently, no research specifically focuses on UAV swarm navigation
    methodologies applied to planting and seeding. Hence, this section will undertake
    a relevant analysis using the aforementioned two seeding methods in conjunction
    with prevailing multi-agent cooperative control strategies. The point-and-shoot
    seeding method has the advantage of high precision, allowing for well-regulated
    seed placement. Consequently, during practical operations, it suffices to plan
    individual flight trajectories for each UAV, ensuring comprehensive coverage of
    the operation area and preventing instances of missed or redundant seeding. In
    contrast, the centrifugal disc method cannot precisely calculate the landing point
    of seeds on the ground due to the primary influence of the centrifugal force.
    Furthermore, the actual landing points of the seeds may not be evenly distributed,
    potentially leading to missed seeding when using a trajectory task coordination
    mode. Therefore, implementing a visual navigation mode during actual seeding operations
    allows for real-time analysis of ground seed distribution during cooperative flights.
    This approach facilitates timely reseeding for plots that are missed or under-seeded.
    4.3. Application of UAV Swarms in Field Management Field management encompasses
    an array of management measures executed throughout the cultivation process, from
    sowing to harvesting, within the realm of autonomous farming. It constitutes the
    core phase of the entire autonomous farming operation. Currently, the primary
    applications of UAV swarm systems in field management are irrigation control,
    weed identification, pest identification and control, and crop health surveys.
    4.3.1. Agricultural Sprays In Reference [97], a two-UAV field spraying device
    is proposed, with its structural design depicted in Figure 16. The working principle
    involves simultaneously connecting the chemical tanks of two UAVs to a single
    spray bar. The UAVs operate in synchrony, moving the spray bar in unison, thereby
    increasing the operation area and volume of spray per single application. Considering
    the payload capacity of the UAVs is limited, the distance between the two UAVs
    is not particularly large. Moreover, given the requirement for precise synchrony
    in the same direction, the implementation of visual collaborative navigation or
    communication navigation modes can fulfill the aforementioned requirements. Figure
    16. Agricultural spraying device based on two UAVs (reproduced from [97], with
    permission from the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 2022).
    Reference [98] addresses several challenges pertaining to pesticide spraying operations
    conducted by UAV swarms. These challenges include hardware discrepancies, irregular
    field boundaries, spray drift, and varying operator skill levels. To address these
    issues, a mathematical model for a heterogeneous UAV swarm system for crop protection
    has been established. Building upon this model, an optimal spray task allocation
    method for a UAV swarm involved in crop protection was proposed. Following spray
    tests on a five-UAV system, the effectiveness of this optimal spray task allocation
    method was confirmed for actual pesticide spraying operations. 4.3.2. Field Monitoring
    Field monitoring in autonomous farming comprises elements such as weed identification,
    pest detection, and remote sensing of crop growth trends. The authors of [99]
    propose a dynamic path planning coordination method for UAV swarms for field monitoring
    and fertilization tasks, based on an improved distributed ant colony algorithm.
    By comparing the improved algorithm with traditional zigzag methods in a simulated
    monitoring and fertilization environment, it was verified that the improved algorithm
    reduces the time required to complete tasks. The authors of [100] also conducted
    research on the control methods of UAV swarms for field environment monitoring,
    UAV flight trajectory transmission, storage of UAV ground part trajectories, and
    data transmission between the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and the UAVs. The
    reliability of the system was proven through experiments in both simulated environments
    and actual crop monitoring points. Reference [101] introduces a cooperative remote
    sensing approach for real-time water management and irrigation control based on
    UAV swarms. It discusses the development of basic subsystems such as embedded
    multispectral imagers, image stitching, and registration, and provides the results
    of an actual UAV flight test for a typical flight mission. In [102], the authors
    propose a UAV swarm navigation method for crop detection based on wireless communication.
    UAVs share their position information through xBee, Wi-Fi, or other communication
    modules, and the on-board computer sends all this information to the ground station.
    The ground station then plans and adjusts the UAV flight missions collectively.
    Figure 17 depicts the high-level architecture of the prototype. Figure 17. Multi-agent
    swarm of UAV for crop monitoring (reproduced from [102], with permission from
    Springer Nature, 2018). References [103,104] address the issue of weed coverage
    and mapping in farmland, proposing a UAV swarm flight system based on communication
    and visual cooperation. This system shares location information among UAVs through
    the XBee module and collects weed information through the visual collection module.
    The reliability of the system was validated through simulated experiments and
    actual flight tests. In [105], researchers also identify and detect field weeds
    through a UAV swarm system, adopting a coordinated mode of trajectory planning
    under an absolute navigation mode. Reference [106] presents a collaborative method
    based on trajectory planning for UAV swarm systems to collect low-altitude remote
    sensing data in farmland. By comparing four algorithms (Nearest Neighbour based
    on K-means clustering, Christofides, Ant Colony Optimisation and Bellman–Held–Karp),
    the feasibility of this research was validated. In [107], the authors propose
    an enhanced path planning technique for UAV swarm systems in areas of interest
    for the problem of visible light and multispectral collection path planning for
    assessing the health of field crops. By increasing the flight path and collecting
    more data in areas of interest, non-uniform sensor data collection is achieved.
    The feasibility of the theory was validated through simulation and actual field
    experiments. In summary, UAV swarm involvement in the management process of autonomous
    farming mainly encompasses the two aspects mentioned above. In terms of pesticide
    spraying or crop fertilization, precision control is crucial, as the amount of
    spray directly influences crop growth. Therefore, during the operation process,
    it is necessary for each UAV to communicate and coordinate. In practical usage,
    communication collaboration methods or visual collaboration methods are recommended.
    During field inspections, the installation of relevant sensor equipment on the
    UAVs allows for the collection of field information. As this process does not
    demand high precision for minute details, UAVs can complete the corresponding
    tasks by flying according to pre-designed tasks or trajectories during the operation
    process. 4.4. UAV Swarms in Harvesting The automation of the harvesting process
    on unmanned farms is indeed a critical component. It holds the potential to significantly
    enhance farm productivity, reduce labor costs, and ensure the quality and yield
    of crops [108]. UAV swarm technology can greatly contribute to the harvesting
    process on unmanned farms, enabling efficient and precise harvesting, while also
    effectively mitigating crop losses. This technology could revolutionize traditional
    harvesting techniques, paving the way for a new era of smart, automated farming.
    The two predominant applications of UAV swarm technology in the harvesting process
    are yield estimation and automated picking. Yield prediction is of paramount importance
    for farmers as it facilitates informed decision-making related to crop insurance,
    storage requirements, cash flow budgeting, and allocation of inputs such as fertilizers
    and water [109]. Similar to the methods of farmland measurement, mapping, and
    field inspection previously discussed, yield estimation is conducted by installing
    various sensor devices on UAVs to perform low-altitude remote sensing of agricultural
    lands. The collected remote sensing data are then analyzed to estimate the yield.
    At present, there are limited studies applying UAV swarm technology to yield estimation.
    For instance, a study presented in [110] proposed a UAV-based citrus yield estimation
    approach. This approach employs automatic image processing methods for the detection,
    counting, and size estimation of citrus fruits on individual trees, utilizing
    deep learning techniques. The approximation error was a mere 4.53% with a standard
    deviation of 0.97 kg, as validated on 20 citrus trees. This validates the effectiveness
    of the proposed algorithm. Figure 18 illustrates this UAV-based citrus yield estimation
    approach. In another research study [111], a cotton yield prediction model was
    established. The model leveraged multi-temporal, high-resolution, visible and
    multi-spectral UAV remote sensing images. The Bayesian regularized BP neural network
    and the ENVINet-5 semantic segmentation model were used for the prediction process.
    The model was validated through actual field experiments, confirming its feasibility
    for yield prediction. Figure 18. UAV-based citrus yield estimation (reproduced
    from [110], with permission from European Journal of Agronomy, 2020). In [112],
    the authors propose a UAV swarm-based cooperative task assignment model specifically
    for orchard picking. This heuristic cooperative method, with the shortest travelling
    distance as a key indicator, swiftly addresses multiple tasks. The basic performance
    of the algorithm was tested through simulation experiments. In 2023, Tevel Aerobotics
    Technologies, based in Israel, developed an orchard picking system predicated
    on the UAV swarm system. A physical diagram of the system is displayed in Figure
    19. The system comprises ground-based UAVs and a UAV swarm. These components share
    real-time location information with each other via a communication mode. Subsequently,
    they analyze and locate the fruits through vision. Upon successful localization,
    the UAV’s mechanical arm picks the apples and places them into the UAVs. This
    system significantly enhances the efficiency of orchard picking and has emerged
    as a new direction for development in the realm of unmanned farming [113]. Figure

    5. Results and Discussion Upon reviewing the literature discussed above, it is
    evident that UAV swarm technology has significant applicability in diverse aspects
    of unmanned farming. This includes efficient agricultural land management, crop
    fertilization, orchard harvesting, and pest and disease monitoring. Utilizing
    UAV swarm technology can effectively enhance agricultural efficiency, curtail
    costs, and concurrently improve the quality and yield of agricultural produce.
    Due to the varying technical requirements and operating environments of production
    processes on unmanned farms, it is essential to investigate the compatibility
    of UAV swarming technology with agricultural production stages. This paper examines
    the operational requirements of UAVs across the four stages: cultivation, planting,
    management, and harvesting. We then propose specific control methods for UAV swarms
    in each stage. Table 2 provides a detailed analysis of the operational requirements
    and suggested control methods for UAV swarm in these segments. Table 2. Operational
    requirements and suggested control methods for UAV swarm on unmanned farms. On
    unmanned farms, distinct operations necessitate unique flight and procedural requirements.
    By tailoring control methods to each operation’s specific traits, the UAV swarm
    optimizes efficiency and accuracy, thereby addressing the multifaceted demands
    of contemporary agriculture. As illustrated in Table 2, among the four cluster
    control models, the UAV Swarm Collaborative Tasking Model is the most frequently
    employed. This preference can be attributed to the versatility of remote sensing
    imagery technology in various agricultural domains. It offers specific functionalities
    without necessitating exceptionally high operational precision, ensuring effective
    data acquisition within the designated operational zone. Both the Communications
    Co-Navigation Model and the Visual Co-Navigation Model should be chosen and fine-tuned
    based on particular mission contexts. By assessing the diverse operational facets
    of unmanned farms and the corresponding UAV cluster methodologies, future unmanned
    farms can tailor UAV swarm co-navigation approaches based on the nature of their
    operation during the entire automation process. Such strategic alignment enhances
    the intelligence quotient of UAV swarms. Nevertheless, despite the strides made
    in the application of UAV swarm technology within unmanned farming, several problems
    and challenges persist: (1) Limited agricultural application scenarios: It is
    evident from the current applications of UAV swarm technology in sustainable agriculture
    that the focus is primarily on acquiring low-altitude remote sensing images [87,88,102,110].
    When UAVs execute low-altitude remote sensing operations, they navigate a relatively
    simple environment, primarily following pre-established tasks or routes; for example,
    Reference [114] uses simulated annealing algorithms to assign sub-tasks to each
    member of a swarm for operational flights. This process currently overlooks the
    dynamic complexities associated with other environments such as farmlands or orchards,
    such as the avoidance of poles or other obstacles, and the movement of plants
    and animals [115]. For other farm operations like crop sowing [93], pesticide
    spraying [96], and farmland harvesting [110], it is imperative to consider not
    only the operation’s completion efficiency but also the safety of the UAV and
    the farmland [116]. This makes the development of UAV clustering technology in
    these areas relatively slow. Therefore, further research is needed on UAV clustering
    technology in combination with the actual field operation environment, thereby
    extending its applicability to broader scenarios. (2) Insufficient levels of intelligence:
    The realization of unmanned farms requires advanced information perception, quantitative
    decision-making, intelligent control, precision inputs, and personalized services
    throughout agricultural production and management [7]. This facilitates the accomplishment
    of sustainable development goals such as intensive agricultural production, high
    yield, superior quality, high efficiency, ecological balance, and safety [117].
    However, current UAV swarm systems still require manual operations for task planning
    and path scheduling, and cannot completely achieve autonomous decision-making
    and automatic task execution. For example, as reported in [21,35], it is necessary
    to manually plan the UAVs’ mission and adjust the flight trajectory before production
    operations can be carried out. Despite some studies exploring UAV control methods
    based on artificial intelligence algorithms, UAV swarm control algorithms are
    not yet fully capable of environment perception and autonomous decision-making.
    Moreover, with the increasing number and types of sensors carried by UAVs, there
    is an urgent need to solve the problem of how to effectively process and utilize
    the collected data to enhance the intelligence of the swarm [81]. (3) Inadequate
    hardware and software support: The application of UAV swarms in agriculture is
    a long-term project, as UAV swarms can potentially contribute to all aspects of
    unmanned farm operations. Nevertheless, the majority of UAVs are currently designed
    to fly in optimal conditions, often falling short in responding effectively to
    various agricultural environment challenges, such as fluctuating weather conditions,
    physical shocks, and electromagnetic interference [118]. Additionally, current
    UAV operations predominantly rely on manual judgment to determine the appropriateness
    of operational timeframes, with the software support resources primarily serving
    to control UAV swarm flight. If there are any significant weather or scene changes
    during operation, manual adjustments or halting of the UAV swarm’s operational
    tasks may be necessary. Thus, beyond improving the operational perception of UAV
    swarms from an intelligence perspective, it is also vital to integrate other intelligent
    perception devices in unmanned farms to enhance the software decision-making capabilities
    of UAV swarms [119]. Consequently, to further the application of UAV swarms on
    unmanned farms, there is a pressing need to develop more comprehensive hardware
    and software facilities to support UAV swarm deployment. 6. Conclusions and Prospects
    This paper delves into the application of UAV swarm technology in the context
    of unmanned farming. Initially, we provide a comprehensive summary and analysis
    of existing UAV swarm control methods, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses
    of various approaches. We proceed to evaluate the current applications of UAV
    swarm technology within the four primary processes inherent to unmanned farming:
    cultivation, planting, management, and harvesting. Moreover, we propose potential
    implementation strategies based on UAV swarm technology for each operational procedure.
    Furthermore, this paper offers an in-depth discussion on the potential to leverage
    intelligent control aspects of UAV swarms in unmanned farm management. We have
    considered how to broaden the scope of UAV swarm technology applications within
    unmanned farms, improve the level of UAV swarm intelligence, and construct pertinent
    hardware and software infrastructures. In recent years, the swift advancement
    of UAV swarm technology within sustainable agriculture and unmanned farms has
    created promising opportunities. However, it has also encountered several complex
    challenges. Addressing these practical problems necessitates consideration from
    multiple perspectives and dimensions. This paper aims to provide potential solutions
    for the robust development of UAV swarm technology in unmanned farms by exploring
    three specific aspects. (1) Accelerating the autonomy and viability of UAV swarms.
    The numerous components of unmanned farm production necessitate the use of diverse
    technologies and encounter a wide range of environmental variables. These variables
    may include differing crop types, growth conditions, pests and diseases, as well
    as shifting weather conditions. Therefore, to enhance the autonomy of UAV swarms,
    there is a need to improve various control algorithms embedded within the UAVs.
    These include environment perception algorithms, path planning algorithms, and
    cooperative control algorithms, among others. Such improvements can facilitate
    the capacity of UAV swarms to adapt their operational mode to cater to varying
    task information. They can accomplish operational tasks autonomously and make
    adjustments in real-time according to the prevailing environment and task conditions.
    This will essentially improve the level of intelligence of the UAV swarm, realizing
    the efficacy of single-button operation. (2) Building a comprehensive model for
    analysis and decision-making on unmanned farms. A comprehensive model enabled
    by complex multilayer network structures learns by abstracting high-level features
    from massive data sets to facilitate more accurate predictions or decisions. Therefore,
    by leveraging existing comprehensive model algorithms in combination with deep
    learning networks, data related to unmanned farm cultivation and production can
    be used as input parameters. These might include crop yield data, climate data,
    soil data, satellite images, and remote sensing data, among others. Such a comprehensive
    model could simulate and predict the entire agricultural production and planting
    process, allowing for analysis, summarization, and decision-making at each stage.
    Additionally, a comprehensive model could be integrated with an intelligent farm
    machine control system to realize autonomous understanding, prediction, and optimization
    of agricultural production. This integration would significantly enhance the intelligence
    level of agricultural production. (3) Promotion of an integrated system of smart
    agricultural technologies and the agricultural Internet of Things. UAV swarms
    are a critical component of unmanned farms, which also encompass other intelligent
    agricultural equipment such as sensor networks, automated agricultural machinery,
    data processing, and decision-support systems. Therefore, to further enhance the
    intelligence level of unmanned farms, it is not only essential to improve the
    autonomy and feasibility of UAV swarms but also to integrate existing smart agricultural
    equipment and technologies. This integration would facilitate the establishment
    of an intelligent unmanned farm system. Moreover, such a system would significantly
    boost the evolution and implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT) within
    the agricultural sector. A schematic diagram of the system framework is depicted
    in Figure 19. Initially, a remote monitoring and control system is developed,
    through which agricultural producers can remotely supervise the status of the
    unmanned farm and operate various types of equipment. Moreover, this system is
    capable of summarizing the data from all the sensors within the unmanned farm
    and presenting it visually. Further, it can define the types of crops to be planted
    in the plots and the necessary field management requirements, for example, whether
    basic fertilizer application or pesticide spraying should be carried out. Finally,
    we propose to develop an agricultural production model based on the unmanned farm.
    This model would disassemble the entire planting process for different crop types,
    analyzing and decomposing the operational tasks that need to be accomplished in
    each link from the four aspects of “cultivation, planting, management and harvesting”.
    At the same time, the model would determine the automated agricultural equipment
    necessary for each operational task. When the preset time for a certain operational
    task is reached, the remote monitoring and control system would deploy each piece
    of automated farming equipment to carry out the corresponding farm operation.
    During operation, each piece of farming equipment would also feed back operational
    information to the system in real-time. Simultaneously, the system, taking into
    account the actual operational conditions, would make independent decisions, including
    considerations such as whether the current weather conditions are conducive to
    continued operation. Apart from the preset farming operational tasks, the system
    could also analyze soil composition through the real-time data collected by the
    sensor network. This would allow it to make judgments about, for example, a certain
    plot’s fertilization needs, and to control the corresponding agricultural machinery
    to carry out the corresponding farm operation. The ultimate goal is to realize
    an entirely autonomous production process for unmanned farm planting, which requires
    no manual involvement. By enhancing the intelligence and autonomy of UAV swarms,
    developing an integrated model for data analysis and decision-making in unmanned
    agriculture, and promoting an integrated system of smart agricultural technologies
    within the context of the IoT, we believe it is possible to significantly elevate
    the level of intelligence in unmanned agricultural operations, offering a fresh
    perspective for the future development of autonomous agriculture. Author Contributions

    proposes a blockchain-based firmware update method using unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAVs) to solve one of the security issues arising in the Internet of Things (IoT)
    environment, which is the firmware security problem. It has high scalability and
    transaction speed using private blockchains and solves the limitations of internet
    connections by updating the firmware using an UAV. The proposed firmware update
    system safely manages the IoT device and firmware information through four processes:
    participant registration, firmware registration/update, firmware update request,
    and firmware update. The verification of IoT devices and UAVs is performed using
    the IoT device’s public key and Bloom filter, and firmware updates can be safely
    performed using public-key encryption communication. To prove the security of
    the proposed method, a security analysis based on the STRIDE model was conducted,
    and the performance of the blockchain network was analyzed by simulation on the
    Hyperledger. Keywords: blockchain; firmware; unmanned aerial vehicle 1. Introduction
    The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology that connects to the internet by
    embedding sensors and communication functions in various objects. That is, it
    refers to a technology that connects various objects through wireless communication
    [1]. Recently, IoT technology has provided great advantages in various fields,
    such as agriculture [2,3,4,5], medical care [6,7,8,9], smart grids [10,11], and
    smart homes [12,13,14]. Experts predict that by 2020, about 30 billion IoT devices
    will be connected to the internet [15]. However, as interest in IoT technology
    increases, several vulnerabilities and security issues have also been raised.
    One of them is the firmware security issue of IoT devices. Firmware is a type
    of operating system responsible for the basic control and operation of devices
    and is stored in a nonvolatile memory device such as a ROM. Cui and Prada-Delgado
    discussed attacks on the firmware of IoT devices [16,17]. When a firmware attack
    occurs, it can cause problems such as data manipulation and device operation interruption
    through infected firmware. If even a single device is subjected to a firmware
    attack, it is a threat in an IoT environment where numerous devices are connected.
    Therefore, firmware security in the IoT environment is an important issue that
    needs to be addressed. To solve the firmware security problem, various studies
    have been conducted on firmware updates applying blockchain technology. Blockchain
    is a data-distributed processing technology that distributes and stores data,
    such as the transactions of all users participating in the network [18]. The blocks
    in which these transactions are stored are chained and cannot be modified [19].
    Nowadays, blockchain technology is also being applied to various fields, including
    IoT technology. Blockchain is largely divided into public blockchain, private
    blockchain, and consortium blockchain. In public blockchain, everyone can participate
    in the process of confirming transactions and obtaining consensus. Therefore,
    there is a high degree of decentralization. Conversely, only authorized users
    can participate in private blockchains and consortium blockchains. These have
    excellent transaction speeds and scalability because only the designated person
    participates in the consensus process. Thus, blockchain represents a tentative
    solution for securing firmware for IoT devices. However, it is difficult to connect
    with IoT devices where connectivity is limited. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAVs) is an emerging paradigm that has drawn attention both in academia and industry.
    UAVs have diverse functions such as extended coverage, ease of deployment, low-cost
    maintenance, and so on. Thus, UAVs can be beneficial both in urban and remote
    rural areas. In this paper, a blockchain-based firmware update method is proposed
    using an UAV. Providing security in firmware updates in remote areas via UAVs
    has not been explored yet, to the best of our knowledge. The main contributions
    of this paper are as follows. A blockchain-based firmware update scheme using
    UAV is proposed. The limitation of the availability of an internet connection
    by updating the firmware using UAVs is resolved. The secure management of firmware
    and IoT device information in the blockchain network is achieved through four
    processes. Result analysis was obtained by analyzing the blockchain network performance
    using Hyperledger Fabric. Additionally, the verification of the UAV and IoT device
    was obtained through asymmetric encryption and the Bloom filter. Moreover, the
    security analysis was performed using a well-known security model called STRIDE.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Related works are discussed
    in Section 2. Section 3 describes a firmware update system using the proposed
    UAV. Section 4 discusses the security of the proposed system based on the STRIDE
    model, and Section 5 analyzes the performance of the blockchain network through
    simulation. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper. 2. Related Works Among the
    existing researchers, Lee et al. proposed a blockchain-based firmware verification
    and update system for embedded devices in IoT environments [20]. They used blockchain
    technology to verify, distribute, and check firmware versions. In the proposed
    firmware update system, the blockchain network consists of a verification node,
    a general node, and a vendor node. Alexander et al. proposed a framework for firmware
    updates based on blockchain in the IoT environment [21,22,23]. The proposed framework
    devised a firmware update method based on PUSH, and the blockchain network consists
    of a vendor node and a passive node. The vendor node operated by the manufacturer
    creates, verifies, and distributes the firmware update-related smart contract
    to the blockchain network. Passive nodes do not participate in verification, and
    the vendor node receives a firmware update-related smart contract and can execute
    the firmware update process when conditions such as device name and version are
    met. Unlike previous studies where IoT devices saved a copy of the blockchain
    ledger and participated as a blockchain node, a gateway that stores information
    about the IoT devices participates in the blockchain network through a passive
    node. However, in the proposed framework, the gateway delivers the received firmware
    to the IoT device for firmware updates without confirmation. This is dangerous
    if the vendor sends a smart contract or other malicious code-inserted files. Pillai
    et al. proposed that when a new firmware update is released, the device vendor
    generates a hash using the firmware version and the time the firmware was created
    [24]. The hashes generated this way are connected to form a hash chain, which
    is used to verify the received firmware. Baza et al. [25] proposed a blockchain-based
    firmware update scheme for autonomous vehicles to ensure firmware updates’ integrity,
    security, and traceability. It uses smart contracts and cryptographic techniques
    for traceability, accountability, and transparency, providing a high level of
    security and reliability in updating the firmware of an autonomous vehicle. However,
    the authors demonstrated no practical experiments regarding the firmware update
    using the AVs. Seoyun et al. [26] proposed an architecture combining blockchain,
    smart contracts, and edge computing to ensure secure, efficient firmware updates
    for IoT devices. The architecture also includes data privacy and confidentiality
    mechanisms, allowing device owners to maintain control over their data. The authors
    demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed architecture through
    a prototype implementation using the Ethereum blockchain platform. However, the
    Hyperledger platform can be more feasible as it is faster than Ethereum and data
    can only be controlled among specific users. Hanqing et al. [27] proposed a solution
    to address the scalability and efficiency issues of existing blockchain-based
    supply chain traceability systems. The authors demonstrate the feasibility and
    effectiveness of the proposed solution through a prototype implementation using
    the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform. Later, Tsaur et al. [28] proposed
    a secure and efficient firmware update mechanism utilizing a blockchain. However,
    they primarily focused on minimizing the storage needed and enhancing the system’s
    security only. Furthermore, Mingjin et al. [29] introduced some approaches to
    video surveillance and secure data storage techniques using blockchain and edge
    computing. Mingjin et al. [29] proposed a unique system that leverages collaborative
    edge intelligence, where multiple edge devices collectively analyze video data
    for real-time surveillance. Blockchain technology ensures data integrity, trustworthiness,
    and transparency in the surveillance process. Jiang et al. [30] also presented
    a privacy-focused data-sharing mechanism for intelligent transportation systems
    (ITS) using blockchain technology. The proposed system aims to address the challenges
    of data privacy, security, and efficiency in ITS by leveraging a combination of
    blockchain, encryption techniques, and data-sharing protocols. The authors demonstrate
    the feasibility and effectiveness of their approach through a prototype implementation.
    However, there is a lack of research on blockchain-based secure firmware updating
    mechanisms for remote areas using UAVs in the existing literature. As shown in
    Table 1, although the above studies solved the problem of the performance of IoT
    devices due to their participation in the blockchain network through a gateway,
    it is difficult to update the firmware of IoT devices in areas where an internet
    connection is not possible or internet infrastructure is not established. Table
    1. Summary of the existing research along with its drawbacks. 3. System Model
    This paper proposes a blockchain-based firmware update system using an UAV. The
    firmware information is managed on the blockchain network, and based on that information,
    the firmware can be safely updated using an UAV. The proposed system is shown
    in Figure 1 and is composed of the following four entities: Figure 1. Proposed
    system model. Blockchain network: A blockchain network that records and shares
    firmware information. Anything related to the firmware in the blockchain is stored
    in the block, and the information cannot be modified. This paper proposes a private
    blockchain for high transaction speed and scalability, and this network is managed
    by a trusted certification authority. Gateway and IoT device: As a participant
    in the blockchain network, it is a subject that needs a firmware update. To participate
    in the blockchain network, IoT devices must register information such as device
    name, installed firmware, and location (latitude, longitude). By participating
    in the blockchain network, the gateway can obtain information about the firmware
    and request a firmware update. In the proposed system, even the case where an
    internet connection is impossible is taken into consideration. Vendor: In order
    to participate in the blockchain network, information such as vendor name, owned
    device, and owned firmware must be registered. As a participant, it provides firmware
    information. When a new firmware is developed, information about the target device
    and firmware is registered in the blockchain network to store and share information
    securely. UAV: It uses the firmware file developed by the manufacturer and the
    information of IoT devices registered in the blockchain network to securely communicate
    with IoT devices to update the firmware. The proposed system is designed based
    on the Hyperledger Fabric architecture. Only participants who have been verified
    with a private blockchain can participate in the blockchain network. The proposed
    system includes a participant registration process, a firmware registration and
    update process, a firmware update request process, and a firmware update process.
    The data generated by all processes are written as blocks. Participants in the
    blockchain are verified with the Membership Service Provider (MSP), and the UAV
    and IoT devices verify each other using a public key and Bloom filter. Figure
    2 shows the participant registration process for IoT devices and manufacturers
    to participate in the blockchain network. The participant registration process
    is as follows. Figure 2. Participant registration process. To participate in the
    blockchain network, participants must register information on the blockchain network.
    The information provided by participants is as follows. IoT device: device name,
    installed firmware, location (latitude, longitude), and public key. Vendor: vendor
    name, owned device, owned firmware, and public key. In the case of IoT devices,
    the process is divided into two types, as follows, depending on whether there
    is an internet connection. IoT device connected to the internet: In this case,
    IoT devices can participate in the blockchain network through the gateway. Here,
    the gateway becomes a participant in the blockchain network by collecting information
    on connected devices, creating a device list, and registering it. IoT device not
    connected to the internet: In this case, before placing the IoT device, register
    the device’s information and public key in advance on the blockchain network.
    The blockchain network that received the information checks whether the participant
    is registered in the participant storage through the received information. The
    result of whether a participant is registered in the blockchain network is returned,
    as shown in Algorithm 1. When there is no new participant information in the participant
    registry, the information received is added to the registry. The participant registration
    result is delivered to the requester. Algorithm 1: Participant Registration. Each
    registered participant is given a different ID, which is stored in the MSP. Now,
    IoT devices that cannot connect to the internet are stored separately. Participants
    are given different permissions depending on their roles. For example, as the
    manufacturer must manage firmware information, all functions (create, read, update,
    delete) are permitted for the firmware information, but only the read function
    is permitted for the gateway. Figure 3 shows the process of registering and updating
    information on the new firmware by a registered vendor. The firmware registration
    and update processes are as follows. Figure 3. Firmware registration/update process.
    The manufacturer delivers firmware information to register/update the firmware
    on the blockchain network, which is as follows. Firmware registration: vendor
    name, target device, and firmware information. Firmware update: vendor name, registered
    firmware ID, and firmware information. Before registering/updating the firmware,
    check if the requester has permission from the MSP, as shown in Algorithm 2. Requester’s
    permission check result is returned. When the requestor has permission, register/update
    the firmware. Firmware registration: information about new firmware is added to
    the firmware registry. Firmware update: update the information on the new firmware
    by using the registered firmware ID to retrieve its information from the firmware
    registry. When registration/update is completed, information about the firmware
    is notified to the participants of the blockchain network, and the registration/update
    result is delivered to the requester. Algorithm 2: Firmware Registration/Update.
    When information on new firmware is registered/updated, a firmware registration/update
    event occurs and is transmitted to the participants in the network. Thus, the
    gateway can quickly obtain information about the new firmware. Figure 4 shows
    the process of requesting a firmware update by a gateway when information about
    the new firmware is updated on the blockchain network. The firmware update request
    process is as follows. Figure 4. Firmware update request process. The gateway
    receives information about the firmware when registering/updating the new firmware.
    The gateway determines whether to update the firmware by comparing the received
    firmware information with its list of devices, as shown in Algorithm 3. When a
    firmware update is required, it requests the same from the blockchain network.
    To verify the gateway that was requested for the firmware update, the blockchain
    network retrieves the device list of the gateway using the gateway’s ID in the
    participant registry. It checks whether there is an IoT device requiring a firmware
    update by comparing information such as the target device and the firmware version
    of the registered/updated firmware in the device list. The verification result
    is returned. If the firmware update is required, information on the device is
    sent to the vendor. Algorithm 3: Firmware Update Request.    In the case of IoT
    devices that cannot be connected to the internet, when information on new firmware
    related to the IoT device is updated on the blockchain network, the information
    on the IoT device is always delivered to the vendor to update the firmware. Figure
    5 shows the process of updating the firmware of IoT devices that have requested
    an update, performed by a manufacturer using an UAV. The firmware update process
    is as follows. Figure 5. Firmware update process. To update the firmware, a list
    containing information about the firmware and IoT devices is stored in the UAV.
    The Bloom filter is used to block unnecessary IoT device access and verify those
    devices that have requested a firmware update, as shown in Algorithm 4. The Bloom
    filter is created using the information from IoT devices to be updated by the
    UAV. The UAV checks the location information of the devices, moves to the location,
    and requests communication from the IoT device. Now, the UAV is verified using
    the public key registered by the IoT device to participate in the blockchain network.
    After the UAV is verified, the UAV uses its own Bloom filter to verify the IoT
    device. After the verification of the UAV and the IoT device is completed, the
    IoT device uses a private key and the UAV uses a public key to securely communicate
    with a public key encryption method to update the firmware. When the firmware
    update of all IoT devices in the firmware update list is completed, this result
    is recorded by the manufacturer on the blockchain network. Now, information about
    the UAV is also recorded. The blockchain network uses the received firmware update
    result to update the information of IoT devices that have completed the firmware
    update. If the verification between the UAV and IoT device fails, the firmware
    update will not proceed, and the result will also be recorded. Algorithm 4: Firmware
    Update. 4. Security Analysis In this paper, security analysis was performed based
    on the STRIDE (spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial
    of service, and elevation of privilege) model. The possible attack and protection
    structures are discussed below. Spoofing—Spoofing means false identity. There
    is a possibility of transferring the secret message to wrong devices that can
    appear in the network under a false identity. Therefore, in this paper, public
    key cryptography is used to prevent a false identity. Here, a digital signature
    is produced to verify the authentication. Therefore, spoofing issues have been
    resolved using the digital signature after receiving the data. Tampering—Tampering
    means modifying the information. Attackers, such as hackers, can manipulate data
    inside the network. Blockchain technology is used here to store the information
    securely and to prevent illegal data from being tampered with inside the network.
    Repudiation—Repudiation means the denial of any activity by any user inside a
    network. As the blockchain is used in the proposed system, all of the data are
    stored in a blockchain ledger. Once the data is stored with the verification of
    other users of the network, a third party or attacker will not be able to modify
    it by entering the blockchain network. Information disclosure—Information disclosure
    means the leakage of information to unauthorized outsiders. In this proposed system,
    public key cryptography is used to transfer the data, and the digital signature
    is used to verify the authentication of the user. Therefore, the data leakage
    problem is solved by using the digital signature technique. Denial of service
    (DoS)—Denial of service means denying access to system resources to the legal
    users of the network. DoS attacks are made by outsiders to hamper system performance.
    In this proposed system, if a user tries to transfer the data multiple times,
    it is proposed to be blocked so that it can no longer transfer the data on the
    network with the intention of any DoS attack. Elevation of privilege—Elevation
    of privilege means access to system resources without permission. As the registration
    process is completed for every device and the authentication process is maintained
    using a digital signature, unauthorized users will not be able to access the system
    resources or the data inside the network. 5. Performance Evaluation This section
    evaluates the performance of the proposed blockchain network. The implementation
    environment is shown in Table 2. To evaluate our proposed scheme, a scenario was
    considered in which an UAV tried to upgrade the firmware of multiple IoT devices,
    and the firmware was securely mined under the observation of 10 mining nodes.
    An onboard Wi-Fi with the drone was considered in the experiments. A lightweight
    pocket-size Beryl Router (model: GL-MT1300) was attached with the customized tarot
    x6 UAV to connect and transfer the firmware to the IoT devices, as shown in Figure
    6. The NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX was considered as the onboard computing module,
    and Holybro SiK Telemetry Radio V3 was considered for controlling the drone. The
    experiments were conducted for 300 s. Figure 6. UAV for performing the firmware
    update. Table 2. Implementation environment. Hyperledger is an open-source blockchain
    platform that is designed for use by private organizations that know and trust
    each other. Hyperledger is primarily concerned with consortium networks connecting
    several parties to speed up crucial, frequently confidential operations and transactions.
    The primary benefit of Hyperledger is that only authorized parties are permitted
    to participate in and access the data of the blockchain network [31]. Moreover,
    Hyperledger acts as a junction for various distributed ledger frameworks to improve
    efficiency, performance, and transactions. It can support permitted, permissionless,
    or hybrid networks, balancing the overall performance and privacy of a blockchain
    network. Therefore, an organization’s sensitive and internal data can be protected
    and restricted to only some permitted individuals by deploying Hyperledger. Hyperledger
    supports a variety of consensus algorithms, which allows for better scalability
    of the network, and offers a range of privacy features that enable participants
    to keep their transactions private while still allowing for the auditability and
    transparency of the blockchain network [32]. It also provides several tools and
    frameworks to build custom blockchain applications quickly and efficiently. As
    only verified participants can engage in updating the firmware in this proposed
    system, the Hyperledger platform is utilized to implement the idea. Hyperledger
    Fabric is one of the most well-liked enterprise-grade blockchain frameworks and
    is highly customizable and scalable, able to handle thousands of transactions
    per second [33]. Moreover, Fabric-based blockchain offers superior security, scalability,
    confidentiality, and performance. Designers may expand upon what they built using
    Hyperledger Fabric, making the systems scalable. With the capacity to manage large
    transaction volumes, Hyperledger Fabric offers a variety of privacy features,
    including private channels and secret transactions, which are required for our
    proposed UAV-based secure firmware update system. In addition, Hyperledger Fabric
    enables our system to protect sensitive information by providing a robust governance
    model, allowing the proposed system to establish its own rules and policies for
    the network. Therefore, the blockchain network was implemented using Hyperledger
    Fabric. To deploy blockchain on different machines, the Amazon web server (AWS)
    was considered. In addition to npm, node.js, git, python, and docker-compose are
    installed as prerequisites for using Hyperledger Fabric. All nodes are considered
    to have similar configurations, and details are provided in Table 3. RAFT was
    considered as a consensus algorithm. In RAFT, nodes in the network elect a leader
    responsible for managing the blockchain ledger’s replication across all network
    nodes. The leader notifies all other nodes for confirmation when a new block is
    added to the blockchain, and it is added to the blockchain once the block has
    received confirmation from the majority of nodes [34]. One of the primary advantages
    of using the RAFT algorithm is its fault-tolerant capabilities, which are capable
    of operating even if some network nodes fail [35]. Moreover, the RAFT assures
    that only one leader node at a time may modify the blockchain, lowering the possibility
    of errors and guaranteeing long-term, trouble-free operation in the blockchain
    network. The middleware and each of the components were built using Python. The
    following performances were measured and analyzed. Table 3. AWS node environment.
    Transaction rate. Transaction throughput. Transaction latency. Resource consumption.
    The performance analysis measured the performance of the blockchain network when
    there were 2, 3, …, and 10 nodes. Figure 7a shows transaction throughput over
    time. Transaction throughput is the percentage of valid transactions executed
    during a defined period, and this is observed to decrease over time. Network conditions
    change over time, and the responsiveness of nodes is also associated with a decrease
    in throughput. Throughput is related to packet loss, latency, and zippers. As
    the number of nodes increases, it takes longer to verify and share transactions,
    so the response time of nodes increases. It can be seen that, as the response
    time increases, a time delay occurs and the throughput decreases. Figure 7. Experimental
    results performed in blockchain: (a) Transaction throughput over time, (b) Number
    of successful transactions over time, (c) Latency according to the number of nodes,
    (d) CPU usage over time for data creation (left) and data query (right), (e) Memory
    usage over time for data creation (left) and data query (right), and (f) Network
    traffic over time for data creation (left) and data query (right). Figure 7c shows
    the number of successful transactions over time, which naturally increases. It
    can be seen that, as the number of nodes increases, the number of successful transactions
    decreases. As mentioned earlier, it can be seen that this decreases because a
    time delay occurs due to the verification and sharing of nodes. Figure 7c shows
    the delay time according to the number of verification nodes in the blockchain
    network. As the number of nodes increases, the number of nodes that need to be
    verified and shared also increases, so the time required for verification and
    sharing also increases. This causes a delay in the network, and the time delay
    increases due to an increase in the network delay. Figure 7d shows the CPU usage
    over time when executing creation transactions (left) and query transactions (right).
    You can see that the CPU usage when executing the creation transaction is higher
    than when executing the query transaction. This is because the creation transaction
    has a process of verification and sharing, but the query transaction only needs
    to read the data in the copy of the ledger of one node. You can see that the CPU
    usage decreases as the number of nodes increases because the nodes divide and
    execute the required transaction. Figure 7e shows the memory usage over time when
    executing the creation transaction (left) and a query transaction (right). It
    can be seen that memory usage decreases as the number of nodes increases. If there
    are two or four nodes up to 50 s, the memory usage of the query transaction is
    seen to be higher than that of the creation transaction. It can be seen that,
    out of a data list of 200, query transactions reading specific data used more
    memory. However, in due course, it can be seen that the memory usage of the creation
    transaction, which requires verification and sharing, increases further. Figure
    7f shows network traffic over time when executing a creation transaction (left)
    and query transaction (right). Network traffic refers to the amount of data flowing
    through the network within a certain time. It can be observed that more data flows
    through the network when the network traffic of the creation transaction is higher
    than that of the query transaction. Network delays can occur if there is a significant
    amount of data flow. It can be seen that the network traffic decreases as the
    number of nodes increases because multiple nodes divide and process the data.
    Figure 8 shows the time required to process data security tasks in the UAV. We
    considered encryption (symmetric), decryption (symmetric), signing, verification,
    and private/public (pri/pub) encryption and decryption (asymmetric). As the size
    of data increase, the processing time of each operation increases. Figure 8. Individual
    security processing time by data size. A comparative study of the proposed system
    and previous studies was performed, as shown in Table 4, where (O) means that
    the existing problem has been solved and (X) means that the existing problem has
    not been solved. Table 4. Performance comparison. Low resources: This problem
    is the possibility of implementation in an IoT environment with low resources.
    Lee et al. [20] and Mingjin et al.’s [29] research on storing a blockchain ledger
    in local storage is difficult to implement. Firmware verification: This is a verification
    problem for the deployed firmware. Lee et al. [20], Yohan et al. [21,22,23], Hanqing
    et al. [27], Tsaur et al. [28], Mingjin et al. [29], and Jiang et al. [30] used
    blockchain in terms of data security but did not consider verification when deploying
    firmware to IoT devices. Internet connection: This problem is whether the firmware
    can be updated according to the internet connection. Existing studies require
    an internet connection, but the proposed system can update the firmware using
    UAVs at any time as long as devices that cannot connect to the internet are registered
    in advance. 6. Conclusions This paper proposes a firmware update method to solve
    the firmware security problem, which is often raised and with increasing interest
    in IoT technology. To overcome the low-performance issue of IoT devices and the
    limitations of internet connections in existing blockchain-based firmware update-related
    studies for data integrity, we propose a blockchain-based firmware update method
    using an UAV. Through the participant registration process, the firmware registration
    and update process, and the firmware update request process, the information on
    IoT devices and firmware is securely registered and shared. The firmware update
    process uses a public key and the Bloom filter to verify UAV and IoT devices and
    provides secure firmware updates using public key encryption. The proposed system
    guarantees data integrity through blockchain technology, and all processes are
    recorded in blocks. Participants are given IDs so that when an issue occurs, the
    cause can be quickly discovered. Because the firmware is updated using an UAV
    based on the registered information, the load on the network can be reduced, and
    the IoT device where the internet infrastructure is not established can also update
    the firmware. In addition, this paper has completed a security analysis based
    on the STRIDE model and a performance analysis of the blockchain network using
    Hyperledger. However, consensus algorithms can consume resources and energy. Thus,
    choosing a suitable consensus algorithm is necessary to bring efficiency to the
    system, which has been reserved for future investigation. Sixth-generation wireless
    communication is planned to overcome connectivity issues with better coverage
    that can increase the efficiency of the proposed scheme, which will be the subject
    of future work. Author Contributions Conceptualization, J.W.S., A.I. and S.Y.S.;

    The Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to revolutionize agriculture by
    providing real-time data on crop and livestock conditions. This study aims to
    evaluate the performance scalability of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in agriculture,
    specifically in two scenarios: monitoring olive tree farms and stables for horse

    (RPL) 1. Introduction The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) within the
    agriculture sector has advanced significantly, as evidenced by its incorporation
    into various commercial applications such as monitoring weather conditions, soil
    moisture, temperature, fertility, and crop growth, as well as weed and pest detection,
    animal intrusion, irrigation control, and supply chain and food waste management.
    By deploying IoT sensors, farmers can reduce human effort and increase operational
    efficiency in monitoring their farms. Furthermore, sensors use communication channels
    to transmit the obtained status information into consolidated, scalable data repositories
    [1]. The application of data-processing algorithms on collected data can create
    opportunities for the development of further innovations and data-driven services,
    such as decision-making applications that can be combined with IoT actuators to
    act on physical objects (e.g., turning on a water pump) with minimal or no farmer
    intervention. However, sensor integration into industrial-scale frameworks requires
    a large volume of constrained sensor devices, resulting in a self-contained network
    known as a wireless sensor network (WSN) [2,3,4,5,6,7]. Despite the existence
    of these technologies and services, they are not always deployed. In WSNs, four
    constrained elements are used to organize the internal structure of any sensor
    device: (1) sensing element (such as a horse heartbeat signal sensor); (2) limited
    computation power (e.g., main memory and central processing unit (CPU)); (3) short-distance,
    limited-bandwidth radio transceiver; and (4) limited battery power. These constraints
    make it challenging to integrate such a sensor network into the agriculture sector,
    in terms of meeting the scalability and performance requirements of the harsh
    environments of agricultural farms [8,9,10]. In this study, the 6LowPAN and Routing
    protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL) were considered in assessing the
    performance of the WSN. The evaluation results of the RPL protocol in the two
    farming scenarios were modeled and simulated using COOJA, a realistic WSN simulator.
    The first scenario represents an olive tree farm with an integrated WSN that uses
    fixed-position sensor nodes and settings, while the other scenario represents
    a horse training stable, with each horse equipped with a sensor node representing
    the WSN in a mobile case. This approach helps ensure the ability to capture the
    impact of mobility in both scenarios and provides a realistic comparison of networking
    performance indices by sharing the simulation settings for both fixed and mobile
    nodes, with the main difference being node mobility. This paper characterized
    different aspects of the performance requirements in the two farming scenarios
    by comparing: (1) average power consumption; (2) average radio duty cycle; and
    (3) connectivity degrees of the sensor network graph. A new approach was proposed
    to model and simulate moving animals within the COOJA simulator, adopting the
    random waypoint model (RWP) to represent horse movements. The aims of this study
    are twofold: to assess the performance scalability of WSN in the agriculture sector
    and to provide a classification framework for studying IoT in the agriculture
    sector. Several performance metrics, such as network graph connectivity and power
    consumption, were evaluated. Furthermore, the stationary configuration and mobility
    covered both animal and plant farms. The main contributions of this study can
    be summarized as follows: (1) introducing performance assessment metrics for stationary
    and mobile scenarios in 6LowPAN networks; (2) introducing a novel holistic IoT
    ecosystem suitable for the precision agriculture domain that satisfies the requirements
    for both studied scenarios; (3) introducing a new classification approach of IoT
    in agriculture based on several factors. The main originality of this research
    is the assessment of the performance scalability of WSNs in the agriculture sector,
    along with the development of a classification framework for studying IoT in agriculture.
    The study evaluates performance metrics such as network graph connectivity and
    power consumption for both stationary and mobile scenarios in 6LowPAN networks
    and proposes a new approach for simulating moving animals within the COOJA simulator.
    Additionally, the paper introduces a novel holistic IoT ecosystem suitable for
    precision agriculture that satisfies the requirements for both the studied scenarios.
    This paper presented a framework for integrating IoT systems in precision agriculture.
    The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related research works and
    draws a conclusion on how this work helps to fill the gap in the current state
    of the art. Section 3 describes the proposed framework that effectively combines
    an array of sensor measurements, communication technologies, middleware, and applications
    to provide automated decision-making support. Section 4 describes how the proposed
    framework was experimentally validated and tested through simulation, using two
    application scenarios: monitoring olive tree farms and stables for horse training.
    The results obtained through simulation demonstrate the suitability of the proposed
    framework for both fixed and mobile scenarios, providing efficient communication
    performance and low latency. Additionally, Section 5 discusses how the results
    show the advantages of using the RPL protocol for routing in mobile and fixed
    sensor networks, which supports dynamic topologies and improves the overall network
    performance. Section 6 highlights the several practical implications for precision
    agriculture by providing an efficient monitoring and management solution for agricultural
    and livestock farms. 2. Related Works There has been a growing interest in understanding
    the best approaches for integrating IoT solutions within the agricultural sector.
    This interest can be broadly categorized into three stages: (1) Vertical studies
    that examine the best practices and technical guidelines for using IoT-enabling
    technologies such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), gateways, communication
    platforms, and middleware in production farms [3,11,12]. (2) Horizontal studies
    that investigate approaches to bridge gaps among the vertical studies by discussing
    standardization, interoperability issues, large-scale prototyping, and system
    of systems approach [1]. (3) Business-driven studies that focus on integrating
    the entire chain of agriculture, wherein social and technical guidelines and frameworks
    are considered, such as farm-to-fork and traceability for food-chain-related studies
    [13]. IoT and AI state-of-the-art solutions in agriculture have been discussed
    in [14,15]. The RPL protocol has been widely investigated in vertical studies
    focusing on several IoT sectors and applications (e.g., home and building automation,
    urban environments, and industrial applications). However, few research studies
    have examined how RPL behaves in other application domains, such as agriculture.
    For example, the authors in [16] examined the behavior of RPL for precision agriculture
    using a methodology similar to that used in this work; they proposed an extension
    model and presented preliminary network performance measurements of RPL. This
    study further investigates and demonstrates how the RPL behaves in two precision
    agriculture use cases (i.e., stationary and mobile). Many attempts have been made
    to build functional architectures for IoT applications suitable for plant and
    crop field monitoring and management [13,17,18]. Sensors for collecting information
    about the environment, soil, and water level are combined with geographical information
    systems (GISs). The captured parameters are stored in centralized databases using
    data management software. Web and mobile applications provide farmers with easy
    access to these databases. Several studies have proposed using IoT applications
    for monitoring animals, such as using sensor readings to track their health, behavior,
    and nutrition. These readings can be transferred to a centralized server for storage
    and further processing, providing valuable insights to farmers and animal trainers.
    They can then use this information to optimize their cost and time investments
    and achieve more value-added products [19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26]. Similarly, various
    proposed IoT systems have been proposed for monitoring peat forests, such as environmental
    conditions and potentially managing disasters. These systems often use solar power
    and communicate with monitoring centers through LoRa networks. Additionally, some
    studies have proposed using high-resolution satellite imagery to identify changes
    in forest viability and detect foliar diseases. These systems aim to provide early
    warning systems for fires, pest control, or deforestation [25,27,28,29]. In livestock
    farming, a wide range of factors to consider, such as wool and skin, depending
    on the type and number of farm animals. Studies have proposed solutions such as
    support systems for disease diagnosis and treatment, non-contact temperature measurement
    for early disease detection, and IoT monitoring systems for tracking animal behavior
    and health in large-scale pig farms. These systems can provide animal health recommendations
    to farmers in rural areas where veterinary access is difficult [30,31,32,33].
    This study examined the performance of wireless sensor networks (WSN) in two different
    agricultural scenarios: olive tree farms with fixed-position sensor nodes and
    a horse training stable with mobile sensor nodes. The sensors were used to monitor
    the physical condition of the horses, aiming to improve their health and well-being
    while also collecting high-precision measurements. The experiments adopted a random
    waypoint model to simulate the movement of the horses in the second scenario.
    Our evaluation measures included average power consumption, radio duty cycle,
    and sensor network connectivity levels. The paper proposed a new approach for
    simulating moving animals using the COOJA simulator. Despite the limitations imposed
    by the constrained nature of WSNs, extending their lifespan remains a critical
    challenge. Various techniques, such as power optimization algorithms, low-power
    communications, and reactive sensor networks, have been proposed to address this
    issue [34,35,36,37]. However, studies that compare the performance of WSNs in
    fixed and mobile deployment scenarios in the agriculture sector are limited. Furthermore,
    the implementation of IoT technologies such as WSNs in the agriculture industry
    has been slower compared to other domains, indicating a need for further research
    in this area to promote wider and faster diffusion of IoT in the sector [38,39,40,41,42].
    IoT integration within the agriculture sector has matured, as evidenced by its
    extension into several commercial applications. There has been a growing interest
    in understanding the best approaches for integrating IoT solutions within the
    agricultural sector, which can be broadly categorized into three stages: (1) vertical
    studies that examine the best practices and technical guidelines for using IoT-enabling
    technologies such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs); (2) horizontal studies that
    investigate approaches to bridge gaps among the vertical studies; and (3) business-driven
    studies that focus on integrating the entire chain of agriculture. This study
    examined the performance of wireless sensor networks (WSN) in two different agricultural
    scenarios: olive tree farms with fixed-position sensor nodes and a horse training
    stable with mobile sensor nodes. Our proposed system builds upon these existing
    technologies by incorporating machine learning and data analysis techniques to
    provide farmers with real-time recommendations on crop management practices. By
    analyzing data from various sources, including remote sensing [43] and ground-based
    sensors [44], our system can provide farmers with a comprehensive view of their
    fields and make recommendations tailored to their specific needs. Furthermore,
    our system aims to be user-friendly and accessible, requiring minimal technical
    knowledge to operate. By providing easy-to-understand recommendations through
    a user-friendly interface, we aim to make precision agriculture more accessible
    to a wider range of farmers. In conclusion, our proposed system builds upon the
    strengths of existing precision agriculture systems while addressing their limitations,
    with the ultimate goal of improving efficiency, reducing costs, and increasing
    crop yields for farmers. The state-of-the-art precision agriculture systems involve
    the use of advanced technologies such as sensors, GPS, robotics, and data analytics
    to optimize crop production and reduce costs. Remote sensing and ground-based
    sensor systems are commonly used to monitor crop health, soil moisture, and other
    environmental factors. Variable rate application systems use this data to adjust
    inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides, and water according to the specific needs
    of different parts of a field. Autonomous agricultural equipment, such as drones
    and robots, are also being developed and used to automate planting, harvesting,
    and other tasks. In addition to these technologies, precision agriculture systems
    are also integrating machine learning and AI algorithms to analyze large volumes
    of data and make predictions about crop health and yield. This allows farmers
    to make data-driven decisions and optimize their operations for maximum efficiency
    and profitability. The research problems in precision agriculture systems primarily
    involve developing more accurate and reliable sensors, improving data analytics
    and modeling techniques, and addressing issues related to data privacy and security.
    Additionally, there is ongoing research in developing more advanced autonomous
    equipment and integrating multiple systems for a more comprehensive approach to
    precision agriculture. Overall, precision agriculture is a rapidly evolving field,
    with new technologies and techniques constantly emerging. The state-of-the-art
    is driven by a focus on improving efficiency, reducing waste, and increasing yields
    through the use of advanced technologies and data-driven decision making. Our
    proposed system advances the state of the art in precision agriculture by combining
    the benefits of both remote sensing and ground-based sensor systems. By using
    both satellite imagery and ground-based sensors, our system can provide a more
    comprehensive view of crop health and environmental factors, with greater detail
    and accuracy than either system alone. Additionally, our system utilizes machine
    learning algorithms to analyze the data and provide real-time recommendations
    for crop management, further improving efficiency and yields. Overall, our proposed
    system offers a more advanced and integrated approach to precision agriculture
    that can help farmers make more informed decisions and optimize crop production.
    3. Overview of Precision Agriculture This section covers the topic of precision
    agriculture and its applications, the use of advanced information and communication
    technology (ICT) in transforming the agricultural industry, and the advantages
    of utilizing IoT-enabled technologies to enhance precision agriculture. Precision
    agriculture is a modern approach to managing farming and cultivation that utilizes
    ICT to improve production yield, quality, and efficiency [45]. This integration
    of ICT involves optimizing the entire farming process chain, from monitoring plant
    and animal health and growth to observing the environment, applying fertilizers,
    managing water irrigation, and deploying sensors on tractors to collect data on
    soil moisture and crop growth using drones and GPS technology [46]. Decision support
    systems then analyze the collected data to inform farming practices and improve
    overall efficiency. Precision agriculture, which utilizes advanced ICT to improve
    production yield, quality, and efficiency, can greatly benefit from integrating
    IoT in crop and animal farms. In crop farms, such as olive tree farms, IoT allows
    farmers to monitor the growth and health of their plants and collect data such
    as temperature, rainfall, leaf water potential, and overall plant health. This
    information can prevent diseases and pests from affecting the yield. In animal
    farms, IoT sensors can be used to monitor the health and performance of the animals,
    allowing farmers to gather data on the herd’s health, welfare, and physical location.
    For example, in a horse training stable, smart sensors and tags can provide information
    on each horse’s temperature, health, activity, nutrition, and collective herd
    information. This can help farmers identify sick animals and separate them from
    the herd to prevent contamination and reduce labor costs by using technologies
    such as drones for real-time livestock tracking. The application of an IoT-based
    system can have a significant impact on the efficiency of farming operations in
    both olive tree and horse stable management. In the case of olive tree farming,
    an IoT-based system can be used to monitor and control irrigation, fertilizer
    application, and pest management. The system can be designed to collect data on
    soil moisture, temperature, and other environmental factors, which can be used
    to determine the optimal irrigation schedule and fertilizer application rates.
    This can lead to more efficient water and fertilizer use, reduce costs, and increase
    crop yields. In horse stable management, an IoT-based system can be used to monitor
    the health and behavior of horses, as well as the temperature and humidity levels
    in the stable. This can help detect early signs of illness or injury in horses,
    and provide insights into their behavior patterns. The system can also be used
    to automate feeding and watering schedules, which can reduce labor costs and ensure
    that horses receive the proper nutrition. Overall, the application of an IoT-based
    system can help farmers make data-driven decisions, automate tasks, and optimize
    resource use, leading to increased efficiency and profitability in both olive
    tree and horse stable management. 3.1. The Proposed System Model This paper provides
    a reference framework to facilitate the development of precision agriculture applications.
    The proposed model considers heterogeneous sensors and network-enabling technologies
    for near-real-time network access to status information about a pool of agricultural
    resources. These resources include trees, animals, water pumps, applications,
    and other services. These resources can be controlled with minimal management
    effort or farmer interaction. By using this system, farmers can benefit in multiple
    ways: 1. Real-time monitoring: The proposed system allows farmers to monitor their
    crops and livestock in real time, which enables them to take prompt action in
    case of any abnormalities or issues. 2. Automated decision making: The system
    uses data analysis to provide farmers with insights and recommendations for optimizing
    their operations, such as determining the ideal time for planting or harvesting
    or identifying the best feeding and watering schedule for their livestock. 3.
    Reduced labor costs: The system allows farmers to automate many of their tasks,
    such as irrigation and pest control, which reduces the need for labor-intensive
    manual work. 4. Improved crop and animal health: The system allows farmers to
    monitor the health of their crops and animals more closely, which enables them
    to identify and address issues more quickly. 5. Increased yield and revenue: By
    using precision agriculture techniques, farmers can improve their crop yields
    and animal health, leading to increased revenue. 6. Resource optimization: The
    proposed system can also help farmers optimize their use of resources, such as
    water and fertilizers, which can reduce costs and minimize environmental impact.
    The proposed system model for precision agriculture comprises three main layers,
    as shown in Figure 1: devices and platforms, communication layers, and application
    layers. Figure 1. Proposed IoT system model for precision agriculture, showing
    the relationship between various entities such as sensors, network-enabling technologies,
    and agricultural resources for real-time monitoring and control. I. The application
    layer includes user applications, data analysis, and dashboards used to monitor
    and optimize precision operations. The Big Data and analytics module consist of
    a data warehouse storage, which runs at the application layer. This component
    contains the technology and services necessary to integrate and archive data from
    multiple sensors and applications, enabling the IoT system to derive and deliver
    value from its data assets. II. The communication layer offers real-time connectivity
    and enables communication between devices and platforms. This includes sensors
    to sensors, sensors to gateways, and gateways to servers within the IoT ecosystem.
    The framework combines several heterogeneous communication technologies, such
    as IEEE 802.4.15, 6lowPAN, and COAP. III. The devices and platforms layer is the
    foundation of the IoT ecosystem infrastructure. These layers include system components
    such as sensors, gateways, and server platforms. Sensors are devices that capture
    the status information about physical world objects and convert them into digital
    data for transmission and processing. The main goal of the gateway’s platform
    is to aggregate heterogeneous data sources with different communication standards,
    given that an array of sensor devices is required to collect data about plants,
    water, environments, animals, and soil, among others. Servers host user applications
    and data repositories and provide unified access APIs for other systems and users.
    The three main layers of the proposed system model, devices and platforms, communication
    layers, and application layers, interact to perform the high-level operations
    of precision agriculture. The devices and platforms layer is the foundation of
    the IoT ecosystem infrastructure, including system components such as sensors,
    gateways, and server platforms. These devices capture the status information about
    physical world objects and convert them into digital data for transmission and
    processing. The communication layer offers real-time connectivity and enables
    communication between devices and platforms. It includes the network protocols
    required to transfer digital information from the sensor to the application layer.
    The application layer comprises user applications, data analysis, and dashboards
    used to monitor and optimize precision operations. The artificial intelligence
    module hosts machine learning models to predict and anticipate anomalies and actions
    to support the automation process. Remote Sensing hosts applications to analyze
    images coming from satellites and drones. All these layers work together to enable
    farmers to monitor and optimize their crops and livestock, leading to more efficient
    and productive farming operations. 3.2. Precision Agriculture Applications For
    example, an application such as horse monitoring is essential for several reasons,
    such as horses being prone to sudden illnesses such as colic, which can be fatal.
    Therefore, monitoring horses remotely and constantly is essential to be aware
    of their condition and function as quickly as possible in an emergency. For this
    task, WSNs play a decisive role, allowing owners and/or breeders to monitor the
    vital signs and anxiety of the horses or the stable environmental conditions that
    can influence the horses’ comfort. The utilization of WSN technology for farm
    animal monitoring has received considerable research attention. Research has focused
    on monitoring the behavioral preferences of cattle using a combination of GPS,
    satellite imagery, and WSNs. Wireless sensor technology has been used for horses
    to analyze gait (to identify lameness) and detect foaling time. Monitoring cows
    and pasture time on a new grass strip using Zigbee technology has already been
    addressed [47]. IoT systems for horse management, which is a WSN-based system
    that provides a solution for equine real-time monitoring, allows farmers to access
    and evaluate vital health signs and behavioral and environmental measurements
    remotely while being connected to the Internet. In addition to monitoring, the
    system comprises additional functionalities (i.e., registering and alerting and
    remote video streaming). Many sensors have been developed in recent years for
    such horse stables; these sensors can be used to monitor various conditions. The
    following are some mobility-support sensors that can be used for horse monitoring:
    (1) motion sensors; (2) blood pressure sensors; (3) heartbeat sensors; (4) colic
    sensors [48,49]. A commercially available sensor board can be used to use these
    sensors. For example, some boards support up to 16 sensor plugs on the same board,
    which can help create a single node that can measure many physical parameters
    [50,51,52,53]. A second practical example is IoT for olive trees, which integrates
    IoT devices to manage irrigation, fertilization, and pest control on plant structures.
    This system helps to detect the disease in its early stages and the risk of the
    disease spreading in the field by determining the right amount and time of additional
    olive tree irrigation and tree changes caused by agricultural pests. The system
    relies on temperature and humidity sensors on the ground and cameras that take
    pictures of the trees. The data generated by these devices are sent to a database
    server through web services and analyzed. This system sends instructions to decide,
    such as the amount of irrigation and fertilization, the time to water, and the
    precise infection treatment. For example, Libelium’s Waspmote Plug & Sense! Sensor
    Platform is a commercially available sensor board used for best control in an
    olive tree farm. For Example, Libelium’s boards support up to 16 sensor branches
    on a single board so that a node can measure multiple parameters [29]. 3.3. Communications
    Protocols The communication layer in the proposed system model facilitates interactions
    among various IoT subsystems using a variety of network protocols. For example,
    the application layer utilizes lightweight protocols and architectures, such as
    JSON and REST, encapsulated over HTTP/COAP at the network layer. Additionally,
    reliable and unreliable protocols are supported at the transport layer, including
    TCP and UDP. Constrained devices communicate using 6LowPAN, IPv6, and RPL for
    routing data packets. Routing among network nodes is achieved through the RPL
    protocol, which dynamically builds a destination-oriented directed acyclic graph
    (DODAG) at the sink node. This protocol supports static topologies and mobile
    nodes and enables efficient traffic flow toward the sink node [54]. JSON (JavaScript
    Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans
    to read and write and for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset
    of the JavaScript Programming Language. It is commonly used to transmit data between
    a server and a web application, as well as between different systems. JSON is
    also language-independent and can be used in any programming language. REST (Representational
    State Transfer) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to
    create web services. It is based on the principles of the HTTP protocol, which
    is used to transfer data over the internet. RESTful web services are characterized
    by their ability to be accessed by a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and their
    support for the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). RESTful web services
    are lightweight, easy to implement, and easily consumed by many clients, including
    web browsers, mobile devices, and other systems. JSON and REST are commonly used
    together in IoT systems to transfer data in a lightweight, easy-to-use format
    that a wide range of devices and systems can access. HTTP/COAP (Constrained Application
    Protocol) is a communications protocol used at the network layer for IoT systems.
    HTTP is a widely-used protocol for web communication and is typically used for
    web-based applications. COAP is a specialized web transfer protocol for use with
    constrained nodes and networks in the IoT. It is designed to use fewer network
    resources and less bandwidth than HTTP and is optimized for use in low-power and
    lossy networks, such as those found in IoT systems. It uses DODAG to build routes
    and support static typologies and mobile nodes. DODAG is a data structure used
    in RPL to build and maintain routes in a low-power and lossy network such as an
    IoT network. The DODAG is built and maintained by a root node, also known as a
    sink node, which acts as the central point of the network and is responsible for
    forwarding data packets to their intended destinations. The DODAG is essentially
    a tree structure where each node in the network has a specific parent node, and
    all nodes point toward the root node. The DODAG is directed, meaning that data
    flows in a specific direction towards the root node, and is acyclic, meaning there
    are no loops in the data flow. The RPL protocol uses the DODAG to determine the
    optimal routes for data packets, considering factors such as network congestion,
    energy efficiency, and link quality. The DODAG also allows for dynamic adjustments
    to the routes as network conditions change. 3.4. Devices and Platforms This layer
    of the proposed system model comprises the sensor platform and associated sensing
    technologies. Sensors capture and digitize the measurement parameters of physical
    objects and their environments, such as plants, animals, soil, and water. Precision
    applications in agriculture require the identification of specific measurement
    parameters and corresponding sensors. The overall characteristics of the IoT ecosystem,
    including hardware, operating systems, and network stack protocols, also play
    a role in determining the sensor computing platforms. The identification of measurement
    parameter requirements is influenced by three factors: the type of animal or plant
    being considered (e.g., horse, dog, rice, palm, or olive tree), the farm environment
    where the species are studied (such as large arable fields, small/medium-sized
    arable farms, animals in the field or house, indoor horticulture, greenhouses,
    beehives, fishery and aquaculture, and leisure agriculture [55]), and the specific
    applications being used (such as monitoring livestock food supply chain, tracking,
    traceability, early warning systems, and pest management). Figure 2 illustrates
    these factors. Figure 2. Process of identifying the measurement parameters requirements.
    Table 1 summarizes commonly used plant sensory data in precision agriculture.
    The information is adapted from the primary vendor, Libelum, in the IoT domain.
    This list is useful for IoT system developers to optimize their applications and
    make informed decisions about sensor selection. The data type of the sensor is
    also provided to aid in programming. Table 1. Sensory Data used plant sensory
    data in precision agriculture. Sensor device platforms, as shown in Table 2, are
    built from hardware and software components. The functional element of the software
    is responsible for managing the underlying hardware platform and providing a set
    of services for upper-layer applications. Operating systems (OS) play a crucial
    role in the functionality of the sensor device platform. The OS kernel, which
    is the core component of the OS, includes a scheduler that manages resource sharing
    among users, such as CPU, main memory, and I/O device operations. Additionally,
    the programming model of the OS, such as threading, supports concurrency and enables
    efficient resource management [56]. Table 2. Sensors Platforms for IoT in precision
    agriculture. 4. Experiments and Simulation The proposed framework’s overall aim
    is to enhance the effective planning and implementation of an IoT System for process
    management in precision agriculture applications. It provides guidelines and best
    practices for IoT development and implementation practitioners. To validate the
    proposed framework, two application scenarios were used: the first scenario is
    an olive tree farm where the WSN nodes are fixed in the soil and on the tree,
    forming a stationary network. The second scenario represents a horse stable where
    the animals are moving and the WSN nodes need to be attached to horses to be able
    to monitor the health and nutrition status, forming a mobile and changing network
    structure. Therefore, it is important to compare the dynamic behaviors for both
    cases to understand the impact on the network’s DODAG. One of the main limitations
    in the validation process is the difficulty in implementing all the components
    of the proposed system. Therefore, sub-components of the system were experimentally
    validated and tested, while other components were analyzed conceptually. This
    approach allows for a thorough examination of the proposed framework’s performance
    and scalability in a simulated environment, as well as its suitability for edge
    and fog platforms in terms of packet delivery ratio, power consumption, and packet
    delivery rates. The above processes are enabled by data sources from the sensors
    allocated in the two application scenarios. The simulation results demonstrated
    acceptable performance, and thus, the two scenarios were selected to take part
    in the final framework. Overall, the framework was assessed by creating a simulated
    test that primarily aimed to measure communication performance and latency, and
    comparing the efficiency and reliability of RPL protocol for fixed and mobile
    scenarios. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for fixed and mobile nodes have some
    key differences that need to be considered when designing and implementing them.
    In a WSN for fixed nodes, such as in an olive farm, the sensor nodes are typically
    placed in a stationary manner, either in the soil or on the trees. These nodes
    form a stationary network structure that is relatively stable and predictable.
    On the other hand, in a WSN for mobile nodes, such as in a horse stable, the sensor
    nodes need to be attached to the animals and are constantly moving. This results
    in a mobile and changing network structure that is more dynamic and less predictable.
    It is important to compare the dynamic behaviors of both cases to understand the
    impact on the network and the performance of the routing protocol used, such as
    the destination-oriented directed acyclic graph (DODAG) in the RPL protocol. By
    validating both cases, the practitioners can better understand the limitations
    and challenges of implementing IoT systems for precision agriculture and identify
    the most suitable solutions for different scenarios. The fixed sensor nodes in
    the olive tree, as shown in Figure 3, farm scenario form a stationary network,
    whereas the mobile sensor nodes attached to the horses in the stable scenario
    form a dynamic and constantly changing network structure, as shown in Figure 4.
    This allows us to compare the dynamic behaviors of the network in both cases and
    understand the impact on the RPL protocol’s destination-oriented directed acyclic
    graph (DODAG) formation. By validating both scenarios, the experiments aim to
    demonstrate the flexibility and adaptability of the proposed framework in different
    precision agriculture environments and provide insights for future development
    and optimization of IoT systems in precision agriculture. Figure 3. IoT system
    for monitoring olive trees in a fixed position. Figure 4. IoT System for horse
    monitoring. The experiment is designed to measure the communication performance
    and latency of the system, comparing the efficiency and reliability of the RPL
    protocol in both fixed and mobile scenarios. Each scenario was evaluated individually
    within the overall framework and yielded acceptable performance; hence, they were
    selected to take part in the final framework. The system assessment results have
    shown the suitability of our implementation for edge and fog platforms in terms
    of packet delivery ratio, power consumption, and packet delivery rates that demonstrate
    the advantages of improving mobile and fixed sensor networks. The simulation tool
    used for this work is the COOJA simulator, a JAVA-based simulator for Contiki
    OS. The COOJAs mobility plugin needs to be enabled because it is not supported
    by default; it must include information about mobility positions for each node
    during the simulation. Therefore, the mobile node speed was set to 3.33 m/s. All
    node information regarding mobility positions was saved in a file and loaded before
    the simulation process started in the simulator. In all simulations, sensors that
    communicated with a central sink node completed data gathering and aggregation.
    The monitoring unit (MU), a central unit, works as a gateway between the users
    and the sensors, considering the typical physical configuration of a horse farm.
    The MU is a set of customized sensors for each horse on the farm; equine sensors
    in the horse stable are assembled in the sensor node. The horse is equipped with
    airflow, heart rate, body temperature, speed, indicator movements, and colic sensors.
    Each sensor node can read multiple parameters and communicate directly with the
    central point. The base station is plugged into the MU, which is the system’s
    central unit and implements all users’ and administrators’ functionalities, communicating
    between sensor nodes, and connecting the system with the Internet and cellular
    networks. 4.1. Simulation Software: Contiki and COOJA The experimentation utilized
    wireless sensor nodes that were built on the open-source, highly portable, multi-tasking
    operating system, Contiki [57]. This operating system is specifically designed
    for memory-efficient networked embedded systems and wireless sensor networks (WSNs).
    It is capable of running on microcontrollers with minimal memory resources, with
    a typical configuration of 2 kB of RAM and 40 kB of ROM. The use of Contiki in
    our sensor nodes allowed for efficient resource management and ensured compatibility
    with the low-power requirements of our precision agriculture applications. Contiki
    was selected as the operating system for the sensor nodes and used C as the programming
    language. Contiki has many advantages over other sensor-network operating systems;
    for example, it includes an embedded simulation tool, COOJA, which can compile
    and simulate application software conveniently and quickly [41]. For simulation,
    a single sink node was assumed in each application and 36 normal nodes. The sink
    node is assumed to be fixed in the olive farm case and mobile in the horse farm
    case. The static nodes were simulated in COOJA using 36 clients and a single server
    (Sky Mote IPv6 RPL-UDP). The mobile nodes were modeled using a WSN 6lowPan in
    COOJA, where the mobility model was modeled using RWM. The data analysis and processing
    server were fixed at the simulation area’s center. Finally, the simulation duration
    was set as 4 h. Table 3 and Table 4, summarize all used summation parameters.
    Table 3. Sensors Platforms and Simulation Settings. Table 4. Sensors Platforms
    and Sensors Data Parameters. 4.2. Experiment Mobility Model for Both Scenarios
    In the first set of experiments conducted at the olive tree farm, experiments
    deployed a wireless sensor network consisting of 36 static nodes, each representing
    a tree equipped with a sensor board. The nodes were distributed on a grid and
    strategically placed within different squared areas of 25 m × 25 m, 50 m × 50
    m, 75 m × 75 m, and 100 m × 100 m. The sink node, which serves as the central
    point for data collection and transmission, was located at the center of the simulation
    area. This configuration allowed us to evaluate the network performance and assess
    the impact of node density and area coverage on the overall system performance.
    The density and coverage of nodes in a wireless sensor network (WSN) can have
    a significant impact on the overall system performance. A higher node density
    results in a more extensive coverage area, which can improve the accuracy of data
    collection and increase the chances of successful data transmission. However,
    a higher node density also increases the number of nodes that need to be maintained
    and managed, which can increase the complexity of the system and reduce overall
    performance. Additionally, a higher node density can lead to increased interference
    between nodes, which can negatively impact the system’s communication performance.
    On the other hand, a lower node density can result in lower coverage areas, which
    can reduce the accuracy of data collection and decrease the chances of successful
    data transmission. Therefore, the optimal node density and coverage will depend
    on the specific requirements of the application and must be carefully considered
    during the design and deployment of the WSN. In the second set of experiments,
    the focus is on mobile horse farms and the impact of node density and area coverage
    on the overall system performance. The experiments are conducted using the same
    grid-based areas as in the first set, with dimensions of 25 m × 25 m, 50 m × 50
    m, 75 m × 75 m, and 100 m × 100 m. However, in this scenario, 36 nodes representing
    sensor boards mounted on horses are used, and the nodes are made to move based
    on the random waypoint model (RWP) [58]. The sink node remains static and is located
    at the center of the simulation area. The random waypoint model (RWP) is a commonly
    used mobility model in wireless sensor networks (WSN) and mobile ad hoc networks
    (MANET) simulations. The RWP model simulates a scenario where nodes move randomly
    within a defined area, with each node having a destination point chosen randomly
    and a random speed between a defined minimum and maximum value. The node then
    moves towards the destination point at the chosen speed, pauses for a random amount
    of time upon reaching the destination, and then chooses a new destination point.
    This model is used to simulate a variety of mobile scenarios, such as vehicular
    networks or animal tracking, and allows researchers to study the impact of mobility
    on network performance, such as connectivity, throughput, and delay. The RWP mobility
    model distributes the nodes randomly within predefined simulation areas after
    the start of the simulation. At the beginning of the simulation run, every mobile
    node remained in its location for a certain random period (i.e., a pause time),
    and this was uniformly chosen between 0–60 s. Once this time expires, it moves
    to a random location within a simulation area and at a speed uniformly distributed
    between minspeed and maxspeed. The mobile node then moves to the newly selected
    destination location at the selected speed. The node pauses for the specified
    pause time before repeating the same process when it arrives. The node chooses
    a new speed and destination combination and then moves again after the completion
    of the pause time. The simulation setting for the speed of the mobile nodes is
    uniformly selected between 1 and 2 m/s. This model is used in several simulation
    studies and is closer to simulating a horse’s movement. The impact of mobility
    on performance can be significant in wireless sensor networks for mobile applications
    such as horse monitoring. As the nodes move, the network topology changes and
    the routing paths may need to be recalculated. This can lead to increased network
    overhead, decreased packet delivery ratio, and increased power consumption. Additionally,
    the moving nodes may experience varying levels of signal strength and interference,
    leading to further challenges in maintaining stable communication. Thus, it is
    essential to consider the impact of mobility on the overall system performance
    in wireless sensor networks for mobile applications. 4.3. Simulation Flow Chart
    Figure 5 presents the flowchart of the suggested simulation sessions, starting
    with determining the mobility parameters and then generating the corresponding
    mobility file that will be loaded to the simulator once the simulation is started.
    The nodes can be mobile nodes or static, stationary nodes. Next, the system measures
    the sensor set data parameters, as in Table 4. The packets are created and sent
    after sensors collect the data, and the WSN can work as a relay in multi-hop communication;
    therefore, it can forward (broadcast) the received packet to its neighbors. Figure
    5. Simulation Flowchart. 4.4. Data Analysis After collecting the data, a Python
    script was developed using the Pandas library for data analysis and Matplotlib
    for plotting charts. The collected data from the simulation was processed and
    analyzed using statistical methods to obtain the necessary metrics for further
    analysis. The script was used to calculate the sensor network graph’s average
    power consumption, radio duty cycle, and connectivity degrees. The simulation
    was run five times, and the average of the obtained data was taken for further
    analysis. The results were then plotted using Matplotlib to visualize the data
    trends and compare different scenarios. 5. Results Analysis and Discussion The
    results of the experiments conducted in both scenarios were analyzed to evaluate
    the overall performance of the proposed framework. The results demonstrated that
    the proposed framework is suitable for both fixed and mobile scenarios, providing
    efficient communication performance and low latency. Additionally, the results
    showed the advantages of using RPL protocol for routing in mobile and fixed sensor
    networks, which supports dynamic topologies and improves the overall network performance.
    The results also highlighted the impact of node density and area coverage on the
    overall system performance in the fixed scenario, as well as the impact of mobility
    on the performance in the mobile scenario. The random waypoint model used to simulate
    the movement of horses in the stable scenario was found to be suitable to simulate
    the movement of horses. Overall, the proposed framework is a promising solution
    for precision agriculture applications and can be further enhanced by incorporating
    more advanced technologies and techniques to improve its performance and scalability.
    Using simulation as a validation method for the proposed framework in precision
    agriculture applications offers several advantages. One of the key advantages
    is the ability to realistically compare the networking performance indices of
    both fixed and mobile nodes using the same simulation settings. By combining these
    two scenarios, the simulation allows us to capture the effect of mobility on both
    applications, and thus provide a comprehensive understanding of the system’s behavior
    in different scenarios. Moreover, using a software simulator such as COOJA enables
    us to test the system in a controlled environment, which can minimize the cost
    and complexity of implementing the system in a real-world setting. Furthermore,
    the simulation results can be easily replicated and verified, providing a high
    level of confidence in the validity of the results. The first set of results compares
    the performance of the proposed framework in a fixed IoT application scenario,
    where a single static sink node is utilized to collect sensor data from 36 static
    nodes distributed in different square areas of 25 m × 25 m, 50 m × 50 m, 75 m
    × 75 m, and 100 m × 100 m. The second set of results, on the other hand, represents
    a mobile IoT application scenario, where a single static sink node is utilized
    to collect sensor data from 36 mobile nodes that move based on the random waypoint
    model (RWP). In order to compare the performance of both scenarios, experiments
    used the hop count metric as a measure of the number of hops along the path between
    a node and the destination. Figure 6 shows a comparison of the average end-to-end
    packet delivery ratio (PDR) between the mobile nodes and the sink node, calculated
    over five runs for a 4-h duration for each run. This metric is used to evaluate
    the reliability of the network in delivering data packets from the source to the
    destination. Figure 6. Data delivery ratio for trees vs. animals. When all nodes
    are static, as with trees, all packets sent to the sink node from a node follow
    the same path; therefore, the hop count is fixed for all delivered packets. 𝐻𝑆(𝑖)=
    ℎ 𝑖 (1) 𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒𝐻𝑆= 1 𝑚 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑚 𝐻𝑆(𝑖) (2) In Equation (1), 𝐻𝑆(𝑖) represents the
    hop count for all packets sent from node i to the sink, whereas Equation (2) calculates
    the average hop count for all successful packets sent from all m static source
    nodes to the sink. The network topology keeps changing for the hop count in the
    mobile scenario; therefore, the packets sent to the sink from a node may follow
    different paths and result in different hop counts for different packets. 𝐻𝑀(𝑖,𝑘)=
    ℎ 𝑖𝑘 (3) 𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒𝐻𝑀= 1 𝑚 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑚 ∑ 𝑘=1 𝑚 𝐻𝑀(𝑖,𝑘) (4) In Equation (3), 𝐻𝑀(𝑖,𝑘) represents
    the hop count for packet k sent by node I, which is successfully received at the
    sink node. Equation (4) calculates the average hop count for all n successful
    packets sent from all m mobile source nodes to the sink. In these equations, 𝑃𝐷𝑅
    is defined as the ratio of data packets received by the destination to those generated
    by the source; it is mathematically defined by Equation (5). 𝑃𝐷𝑅= 𝑅 𝑆 (5) where
    S represents the sum of all data packets generated by all sources and R represents
    the sum of all correctly received data packets at the sink node. Further, the
    results consider the common term “end-to-end delay”, which indicates the average
    time required for a data packet to be transmitted across the network from the
    source to the destination, and it is mathematically presented as Equation (6).
    𝐸𝐸𝐷= 𝑇 𝑁 (6) where T represents the summation of time spent to deliver all successfully,
    N received packets to the sink by all source nodes in the network. In addition,
    experiments consider network connectivity, which represents the percentage of
    all nodes that can deliver at least one packet to the sink, and it varies from
    100% to 0%. Figure 6 shows the average PDR for different cases. PDR in the static
    case is always higher than the PDR in the mobile case for different simulation
    areas. Here, PDR increases while moving from the dense network 25×25 to a less
    dense network when the congestion level decreases. Further, the PDR is worse for
    a spare network ( 100×100 . There are no path details from all nodes to the sink,
    and some nodes become isolated because of the poor graph connectivity, and the
    poor PDR for mobile nodes 50×50 and 75×75 compared to static nodes result from
    the frequent changes in the network topology with mobile nodes. The RPL route
    reconfiguration cannot cope with the fast network topology changes that result
    in connectivity loss and, therefore, the failure in the delivery of the data when
    mobile sensor nodes move out of the transmission range of the parent nodes. The
    mobility of sensor nodes in WSNs provided new challenges in packet delivery ratio
    and energy consumption because the positions of sensor and sink nodes continue
    to change, resulting in connection failure. Therefore, the node cannot send packets
    to the parent and is dropped. As shown in Figure 7, experiments map the node to
    the number of hops; experiments increase the delay with an increase in the number
    of hops. The delay does not decrease for the nodes at one hop from the sink; however,
    the delay decreases considerably for nodes on the periphery, especially for those
    far away from the DAG root. This is a general observation for a very dense network,
    which is not present in our case. The average number of neighbor node density
    = the average number of neighbors. Further, the term “dense networks” defines
    networks with many nodes within a small area, and such networks affect network
    performance. In high-density networks, nodes are required to send many more messages
    to check the availability of the network where the congestion and collision between
    packets are very high and result in an increase in the transmission delay; this
    requires more resources. Figure 7. Data delay for trees vs. animals. As shown
    in Figure 8, the red values represent the percentage of time for which the node
    stayed in the listening mode and listened to the radio messages exchanged by the
    other nodes. The average listening percentage is approximately 1.75%. The blue
    values indicate the percentage of time the node stayed in transmission mode, i.e.,
    when the node sent packets to other nodes. The average transmission rate was approximately
    2.5%. The network graph represents links between the sender and sinks nodes, as
    shown in Table 5. Figure 8. Duty Cycle Percentage for Random nodes = [1, 15, 31,
    40]. Table 5. Network Connectivity Parameters. In Figure 9, each bar on the Y-axis
    indicates the average total power composite of the four power elements (LPM, CPU,
    radio listen, and radio transmit). The link power management (LPM) represents
    low power, equal to 0.1 mW. The CPU computer programming unit was 0.85 mW, whereas
    the average radio listening power was 2.75 mW. Further, the average radio transmission
    power was 3 mW. Figure 9. Instantaneous Power Consumption for nodes = [1, 15,
    31, 40]. 6. Practical and Research Implications The proposed framework for integrating
    IoT systems in precision agriculture provides a comprehensive solution for the
    effective planning and implementation of IoT systems in precision agriculture
    applications. The proposed system effectively combines an array of sensor measurements,
    communication technologies, middleware, and applications to provide automated
    decision-making support. The experimental results obtained through simulation
    demonstrate the suitability of the proposed framework for both fixed and mobile
    scenarios, providing efficient communication performance and low latency. Additionally,
    the results show the advantages of using RPL protocol for routing in mobile and
    fixed sensor networks, which supports dynamic topologies and improves the overall
    network performance. This research has several practical implications for precision
    agriculture. First, the proposed framework provides an efficient solution for
    monitoring and managing agricultural and livestock farms. The system can be used
    to collect essential information from the fields, such as plant health and soil
    moisture levels, and transmit it to a specific application for analysis and decision-making.
    This can help farmers improve crop yields, reduce water usage, and prevent crop
    damage. Furthermore, automated machine learning can also be used to model the
    sensor data to predict the condition and needs of the crops. Additionally, this
    research has important research implications. The proposed framework is a promising
    solution for precision agriculture and can be further enhanced by incorporating
    more advanced technologies and techniques to improve its performance and scalability.
    The experimental results obtained through simulation provide a foundation for
    further research on the performance of IoT systems in precision agriculture. Moreover,
    the proposed framework can be extended to other application domains that require
    efficient data collection and management, such as smart cities and industrial
    IoT. A limitation of this methodology was the use of only simulation to validate
    the framework; hence, the results may not be exactly the same as those obtained
    in a real-world setting. However, using simulation as a validation method for
    the proposed framework in precision agriculture applications offers several advantages,
    such as the ability to realistically compare the networking performance indices
    of both fixed and mobile nodes using the same simulation settings. Additionally,
    the simulation results can be easily replicated and verified, providing a high
    level of confidence in the validity of the results. One potential area for future
    improvement in this study is the integration of automated machine learning (AutoML)
    techniques to model the sensor data collected by the IoT system. By applying AutoML
    algorithms, the proposed framework can automatically identify patterns and anomalies
    in the sensor data and predict the condition and needs of the crops. This can
    help farmers make more accurate and timely decisions about crop management, such
    as when to water, fertilize, or apply pesticides. Additionally, by automating
    the modeling process, the proposed framework can provide more accurate predictions
    with less human intervention, reducing the time and resources required for manual
    data analysis. Overall, the integration of AutoML techniques can help to improve
    the performance and scalability of the proposed framework, making it even more
    useful for precision agriculture applications. Future improvements include testing
    the proposed framework in a real-world setting to validate the simulation results,
    as well as investigating the use of more advanced technologies and techniques,
    such as machine learning, to improve the performance and scalability of the proposed
    framework. Additionally, more work needs to be performed to evaluate the proposed
    framework in different network topologies and environments to understand its behavior
    in different scenarios. 7. Discussion The proposed framework for integrating IoT
    systems in precision agriculture was evaluated in two different scenarios: a fixed
    IoT application scenario in olive tree farms and a mobile IoT application scenario
    in horse stables. The results of the experiments conducted in both scenarios were
    analyzed to evaluate the overall performance of the proposed framework. In the
    fixed scenario, the results highlighted the impact of node density and area coverage
    on the overall system performance. The average end-to-end packet delivery ratio
    (PDR) between the nodes and the sink node was calculated over five runs for a
    4-h duration for each run, as shown in Figure 7. The results indicate that as
    the node density increases, the PDR also increases, indicating that a higher node
    density results in better network performance. Similarly, as the area coverage
    increases, the PDR also increases, indicating that a larger coverage area results
    in better network performance. In the mobile scenario, the results highlighted
    the impact of mobility on performance. The mobile nodes were simulated using the
    random waypoint model (RWP), which distributes the nodes randomly within predefined
    simulation areas after the start of the simulation. The simulation setting for
    the speed of the mobile nodes was uniformly selected between 1 and 2 m/s. The
    hop count metric was used to evaluate the reliability of the network in delivering
    data packets from the source to the destination. The results indicate that as
    the mobility of the nodes increases, the hop count also increases, indicating
    that a higher mobility results in a higher hop count and a lower PDR. The simulation
    results showed that the proposed framework is suitable for both fixed and mobile
    scenarios, providing efficient communication performance and low latency. The
    results also highlighted the impact of node density and area coverage on the overall
    system performance in the fixed scenario, as well as the impact of mobility on
    the performance in the mobile scenario. The simulation results are a promising
    solution for precision agriculture applications and can be further enhanced by
    incorporating more advanced technologies and techniques to improve its performance
    and scalability. It is important to note that using simulation as a validation
    method for the proposed framework in precision agriculture applications offers
    several advantages. One of the key advantages is the ability to realistically
    compare the networking performance indices of both fixed and mobile nodes using
    the same simulation settings. By combining these two scenarios, the simulation
    allows us to capture the effect of mobility on both applications, and thus provide
    a comprehensive understanding of the system’s behavior in different scenarios.
    Moreover, using a software simulator such as COOJA enables us to test the system
    in a controlled environment, which can minimize the cost and complexity of implementing
    the system in a real-world setting. Furthermore, the simulation results can be
    easily replicated and verified, providing a high level of confidence in the validity
    of the results. 8. Conclusions In conclusion, the proposed framework for integrating
    IoT systems in precision agriculture applications is a promising solution for
    managing agricultural and livestock farms. The simulation results obtained using
    the COOJA simulator demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in
    both fixed and mobile scenarios. The results also indicate that network connectivity
    and average hop count play crucial roles in the performance of RPL in precision
    agriculture applications. Additionally, the best end-to-end packet delivery probability
    was achieved for network scenarios of 75 × 75 and 100 × 100 for both the olive
    tree and horse stable scenarios. The results also demonstrate that the average
    end-to-end delay is directly proportional to the average hop count. As the network
    becomes denser with a decrease in the network area, there is an increase in network
    connectivity and a decrease in hop count. This research can serve as a foundation
    for future studies to enhance the performance and scalability of the proposed
    framework. One limitation of this methodology is that the simulation results may
    not fully represent the real-world performance of the proposed framework in precision
    agriculture applications. This is because the simulation does not take into account
    various real-world factors that may affect the performance of the system, such
    as environmental conditions, human factors, and unexpected failures. Therefore,
    further validation of the proposed framework in real-world settings is necessary
    to ensure its reliability and effectiveness in precision agriculture applications.
    In terms of future improvements, incorporating advanced technologies such as machine
    learning algorithms and edge computing can enhance the performance and scalability
    of the proposed framework. Additionally, integrating more sophisticated sensor
    technologies such as drones and cameras can provide a more comprehensive understanding
    of the farm environment. Furthermore, incorporating a more dynamic mobility model
    for the mobile scenario can provide a more realistic representation of the movement
    of animals in precision agriculture applications. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction In the near future, the
    agricultural sector is called to face a significant challenge due to increasingly
    scarce resources, extreme weather conditions, a growing population, and a reduction
    in arable land [1]. Indeed, according to the FAO, by 2050, the world’s population
    will reach about 10 billion and, to be able to feed everyone, we will have to
    produce 70% more food [2], [3]. A practical and feasible solution is to move from
    the old farming concept to smart agriculture, with the adoption of information
    and communications technologies (ICTs) that help farmers to monitor, manage, and
    optimize their operations more effectively [4]. In particular, the introduction
    of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications, every single step of agricultural
    production can be improved: from soil management to minimizing water consumption,
    from plant protection to animal health and farm automation [5], [6]. Smart devices
    located infields are able to collect information and control the evolution of
    the different processes at various production stages. Besides, the miniaturization
    of electronic components allows to implement IoT sensors with reduced form factor
    and energy consumption, monitoring many variables of interest, such as temperature,
    humidity, wind speed and direction, soil conditions, chemical concentrations,
    crop growth, and solar exposure, as well as possible damages caused by drought,
    hail, or flooding. IoT systems integrate all this and other data and turn it into
    useful statistics: for example, predictive analysis allows farmers to use the
    strictly necessary resources (water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc.) and only where
    there is a real need, e.g., for poorly irrigated areas of the field, weak or sick
    plants, etc. [7], [8]. Despite such potential benefits, the deployment of smart
    agriculture systems is still in its infancy. Indeed, an obstacle to the digitization
    of agriculture is the lack or limitations of Internet connectivity in many areas.
    In the literature, several communication protocols have been proposed, with different
    characteristics related to cost, coverage, power consumption, and reliability
    [9]. Among the available technologies (summarized in Fig. 1 in terms of power
    consumption and coverage range), low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs), enlightened
    in a dashed box in Fig. 1 represent the best solution for supporting smart agriculture
    requirements. One of the most adopted LPWAN technology is LoRaWAN, which offers
    wide network coverage, built-in security, low cost, and limited power consumption
    during operation [10]. Fig. 1. Classification of wireless technologies: power
    consumption versus communication range [11]. Show All Indeed, LoRaWAN is an open
    system based on a very robust modulation (called LoRa), which provides several
    interesting features for covering rural areas with simple devices [9]. For such
    reasons, LoRa has been widely employed and tested in the agricultural field, connecting
    environmental sensors measuring temperature, air/soil moisture, etc., or to control
    different kinds of actuators (e.g., irrigation valves), and in applications, such
    as tractor communications, livestock monitoring, and location tracing [12], [13],
    [14]. Differently from existing surveys, which either treat LoRa together with
    all other IoT solutions or consider very specific technological aspects, we consider
    the adoption of these systems from an holistic perspective. For example, LoRa
    is cited in [5] in the general framework of IoT; [7] cites LoRa among the most
    promising technologies for agricultural IoT, and the same plan is followed by
    [8] which dedicated a Section to LoRa in Enabling Communication Technologies;
    similarly [15] includes LoRa in IoT communication protocols suitable for smart
    agriculture. On the other hand, [16] is specific to LoRa but is focused only on
    the protocol performance, [13] takes into consideration only the energy consumption
    of LoRa, [17] discusses the application of the technologies of industry 4.0 in
    the context of smart agriculture. Papers [18] and [19] deal with specific issues
    meaning the decision support system (DSS) and robotics in agriculture, respectively.
    Instead, in this article, we strive to provide a thorough and focused analysis
    on LoRa/LoRaWAN application in smart agriculture, offering a comprehensive view
    of the advancements and in-field applications of this IoT technology. LoRaWAN
    relies on LoRa modulation, a robust chirp-based modulation scheme, patented by
    Semtech [20]. It supports wireless connectivity with limited data rates over large
    areas and without the need of an operator. LoRaWAN is widely used in smart industry,
    smart home, smart city and, increasingly, in the smart agriculture environment.
    In the view of the authors of this article, LoRaWAN possesses five main strengths
    (low-cost, long-range, low-power, no-operator, and unlicensed spectrum) that can
    bridge the gap between smart agriculture and smart cities or industries. Moreover,
    several recent improvements on the resource allocation, channel access protocol,
    and network planning can enhance the efficiency of LoRaWAN networks, reducing
    capital and operational costs [21]. In rural areas, several experiments have demonstrated
    good coverage of LoRa [22], [23], [12]. Coverage ranges of up to 5 and 47 km have
    been obtained in the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) and line-of-sight (LOS) propagation
    conditions, respectively. In addition, in the case of NLOS propagation, the coverage
    range can be increased by using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [24], [25]. In
    terms of power consumption, LoRa offers up to 15 years of battery life to its
    devices. The low power consumption is a key feature of LoRa that makes it an ideal
    choice for smart agriculture applications. It was demonstrated experimentally
    that the estimated battery lifetime of a LoRa device may be six times that of
    a Wi-Fi device and two times that of a ZigBee device [26]. In this article, we
    provide a broad survey of LoRa-based smart agriculture systems, analyzing the
    state-of-the-art and highlighting for each solution the possible adoption of Machine
    Learning, control automation techniques, and energy autonomy features. We classify
    these works in four main categories: 1) irrigation systems; 2) plantation and
    crop monitoring; 3) tree monitoring; and 4) livestock monitoring. These LoRa systems
    are analyzed in terms of scalability, interoperability, network architecture,
    energy efficiency, and point out some open issues which traverse most of the current
    smart agriculture systems. References have been selected based on recent papers
    dealing with smart agriculture; however, some contributions in different fields
    useful as a benchmark are cited as well. Finally, we present the lessons learned
    and draw future research directions which we think crucial for the success and
    widespread of such technologies. The remainder of this article is structured as
    follows. Section II provides an overview of LoRa technology and its perspectives
    in agriculture, while Section III offers a brief summary on smart agriculture
    applications and their main challenges. Section IV reports on general purpose
    LoRa-based IoT platforms applied to smart agriculture. Section V, instead, discusses
    specific vertical solutions for smart agriculture, according to the four above-mentioned
    categories. Lessons learned and future research directions are proposed in Section
    VI. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section VII. SECTION II. LoRa and Its Perspectives
    in Agriculture LoRa technology is a proprietary physical layer technology patented
    by Semtech, which is revealing as a promising solution for large-scale low-power
    IoT deployments, including smart agriculture applications. Indeed, by operating
    in the unlicensed industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio bands and with
    a robust chirp-based modulation scheme, LoRa provides a cheap solution for supporting
    wireless connectivity with limited data rates (from 0.3 to 27 kb/s) in large areas
    and without the need of an operator. Moreover, LoRa transmissions are regulated
    by having a maximum transmission power of 25 mW (14 dBm) in the uplink, a configurable
    bandwidth of 125, 250, or 500 kHz, and a duty cycle of 0.1%, 1.0%, and 10%, which
    permit low energy consumption. In some scenarios, the battery of LoRa devices
    can last up to 15 years. Although LoRa technology is limited to the physical layer,
    different network solutions can be built on top of it, by exploiting its transmission
    interfaces. Among these, the most consolidated one is the open-source solution
    promoted by the LoRa Alliance, which is called LoRaWAN [27]. LoRaWAN networks
    are based on a simple star of star topology (Fig. 2): end-devices (EDs), such
    as sensors or actuators deployed infield, transmit packets on the wireless medium
    to fixed nodes called gateways (GWs), which, in turn, forward the collected packets
    to a central network server (NS) interacting with several application servers
    (ASs) [28]. The network infrastructure between GWs, NS, and ASs is typically based
    on a wired Internet technology, while EDs are not associated to a specific GW,
    which greatly simplifies implementation (e.g., in case of mobility [29]): in case
    a duplicate packet is simultaneously received by multiple GWs, the NS is responsible
    of filtering these packets and performs other simple decisions on network configuration.
    Fig. 2. LoRaWAN typical architecture. Show All To minimize the protocol complexity
    and the energy consumption, LoRaWAN employs a simple Aloha MAC protocol and defines
    three classes of devices (Fig. 3). Device classes represent different ways of
    managing the reception operations performed by the EDs. Class A devices, corresponding
    to the lowest energy profile, can receive downlink packets only in two time windows
    following the transmission of their own packet to the GW. In other words, devices
    can sleep all the time and downlink transmissions are triggered only after an
    uplink one. Class B devices add to this possibility a periodic scheduling of reception
    windows, by keeping a time synchronization with the GW. Finally, class C devices
    are constantly listening to the channel for downlink packets. Any time that a
    new packet is ready for transmission, devices attempt to transmit by randomly
    selecting one of the available channels in the ISM bands (e.g., in the 868 MHz
    there are 16 channels in Europe), together with a modulation parameter called
    spreading factor (SF). More into details, six different SFs are used in LoRa (from
    SF7 to SF12), which result in different symbol times and in almost orthogonal
    transmissions: when two signals modulated at different SFs overlap, the GW is
    able to decode both transmissions in a wide range of power ratios among the signals
    [30]. Unlike many other IoT technologies, the LoRaWAN specification offers dedicated
    end-to-end encryption to application providers, together with network-level security
    primitives, which allow sharing the same network among multitenant applications
    [31]. Fig. 3. LoRaWAN technology stack. Show All Summarizing, the ease of deployment
    with excellent coverage, the availability of devices with very low energy demand,
    and intrinsic security mechanisms make these systems very suitable for innovative
    agriculture applications. Indeed, several state-of-the-art IoT applications in
    smart agriculture are based on LoRa/LoRaWAN networks. For example, LoRa is used
    to connect sensor nodes measuring environmental parameters or to control different
    kinds of actuators (e.g., solenoid valve for irrigation purposes), and in applications
    such as livestock monitoring and location tracing [13], [10], [14]. These applications
    are not critical for data rates and latency, but often require to work in large
    rural areas, with limited access to energy grids and the Internet, and with decision
    mechanisms which benefit from data-driven learning. SECTION III. Smart Agriculture
    Applications and Challenges While industrial production processes have already
    become smarter and autonomous thanks to the implementation of the so called Industry
    4.0 concept, the integration of technologies such as IoT, artificial intelligence
    (AI), robotics, and big data is more recent in agriculture. The availability of
    IoT technologies for supporting wireless connectivity in rural areas and controlling
    infields smart objects shows a great potential for improving the agricultural
    sector, toward the so called smart agriculture [17], [18], [19]. Indeed, farm
    monitoring and automation can make production more efficient and sustainable [7],
    by promptly detecting and reacting to water or moisture stress, wastes of raw
    materials, crops’ diseases, pests, and nutrient deficiencies, as well as problems
    related to the wellbeing of farm animals. The interest on the development of smart
    agriculture applications has been demonstrated by the recent commercialization
    of agricultural sensors and robots (called Agribots), specifically designed for
    reducing the intense physical labor traditionally required in agriculture [15].
    Apart from the availability of smart devices for interacting with the farm in
    the physical world, smart agriculture applications require to build a digital
    representation of the farm status and a decision logic based on the collected
    data. Different protocols can be envisioned both for providing the wireless connectivity
    to heterogeneous devices (from simple low-cost temperature sensors, to complex
    remote-controlled robots) and exporting data for analysis and decisions [32],
    [33]. Since a large amount of data can be produced by agricultural sensors, big
    data analysis can provide efficient monitoring and processing methods [34]. Data
    processing may involve various features such as data loading, validation, aggregation,
    prediction, classification, image or video processing, and data mining. Thus,
    based on the acquired data, DSSs can optimize the productivity and reduce the
    ecological footprint of the farm. Researchers recognize that digitization of farming
    processes and activities is an important challenge for the adoption of smart agriculture
    technologies [32], [35]. In particular, the major challenges to digitization in
    agriculture can be categorized as follows. Communication Issues: As we will detail
    later, large-scale implementations of IoT solutions require robust and secure
    network architectures. The reliability of communicating information still represents
    a challenge to be addressed in the agricultural context and justifies the adoption
    of LoRa/LoRaWAN technologies. Energy Management: The power supply in devices for
    smart agriculture is a significant challenge and energy harvesting systems are
    a relevant area of research. The main issue concerns the sensor’s power supply
    and how to optimize efficiently the power consumption. Moreover, distributed nodes
    can execute some computations (Edge computing) which consumes more energy, while
    sensor batteries have a limited capacity. Consequently, smart devices require
    efficient energy storage and supply. Data/Device Heterogeneity: In general, the
    agricultural data is produced by heterogeneous sensors (soil sensors, weather
    sensors, trunk sensors, leaf sensors, etc.). In addition, IoT devices generally
    use different network protocols and platforms. Thus, in addition to sensors heterogeneity,
    network and protocol heterogeneity should be considered as well. Getting these
    technologies to work together is often an issue, especially for unskilled farmers.
    Physical Deployments: Spatial deployment of devices on farms proves to be a significant
    challenge, especially when the entire farm needs to be monitored across a large
    area and with different application scenarios (soil, plants, trees, animals, etc.).
    Data Management: The difficulty of interpreting the data can be a huge barrier:
    indeed, numerous sensors are necessary and big data analysis could be required
    to better understand and forecast the unpredictability of agricultural ecosystems.
    Generic Platform: To promote the adoption of smart agriculture technologies is
    often required to develop user friendly software platforms. The challenge here
    is to build a universal platform that can be easily modified to support different
    types of monitoring ranging from specific crop to livestock. These challenges,
    together with the cost of infrastructure investment, the complexity of technologies,
    lack of farmers’ education and training, data ownership, and privacy and security
    concerns, has motivated the research and development of innovative platforms,
    specific network technologies, and new architectures for smart agriculture [32],
    [35]. SECTION IV. Generic LoRa-Based Platforms Since agricultural applications
    are widely different, varying from soil and air monitoring, to irrigation automation
    and livestock breeding, several general purpose IoT platforms have been adapted
    for farmers to accommodate all these applications together under a unified, easy
    to understand and simple to use interface. Therefore, in this section, we will
    discuss some of these LoRa-based platforms horizontally designed for smart agriculture,
    while in the next one, we will dig into more vertical and application-specific
    systems, focusing on the four reference scenarios depicted in Fig. 4. Fig. 4.
    Four reference applications in smart agriculture. Show All Generic and open IoT
    platforms can indeed help to digitize farms by integrating numerous agriculture
    applications, harmonizing specific sensing devices, actuators, and decision logics,
    which exhibit heterogeneous requirements in terms of network bandwidth, latency,
    sensors’ complexity, and energy requirements. A clear example is constituted by
    FIWARE [36], a powerful open-source platform, sponsored by the European Commission,
    that provides standardized interfaces for many different IoT sectors including
    agriculture. The FIWARE platform includes several parts called generic enablers
    (GEs), which provide components and reference implementations that support specific
    APIs, and can integrate data collected from heterogeneous sensors using different
    communication technologies, to create custom applications [37], [38]. Several
    GEs are available making it easier to interface with IoT systems, and the IoT
    Agent for LoRaWAN offers a bridge between LoRaWAN and the FIWARE Context Broker
    (the core component of the “Powered by FIWARE” platforms). Moreover, FIWARE can
    be combined with other third-party platforms to provide accessible tools to worldwide
    farmers and consumers too [39]. Another example is the work in [40] where low-cost,
    LoRa-based devices are used for soil temperature and humidity monitoring, and
    the data is processed and sent to the Cayenne IoT Platform for storage and visualization
    [41]. This platform is a drag and drop project builder for developers and engineers
    that can be used in different IoT applications. It encompasses cloud-based web
    applications as well as mobile apps for Android and IOS devices. Cayenne can integrate
    any tool into the library with a wide variety of IoT ready-to-use devices and
    connectivity options. Other LoRaWAN-based IoT platforms are more specific to the
    agricultural world, aiming at improving the management of generic farms in a highly
    customizable way. For example, the LoRaFarM platform [42] has a generally applicable
    “core” infrastructure, which can be completed with specialized ad-hoc modules
    depending on the farm’s characteristics and requirements. The LoRaFarM platform
    derives its topological structure from the LoRaWAN architecture, since low-level
    communication patterns are built around the LoRaWAN technology (see Fig. 5). Hence,
    expansion modules can be added at farm level (or low level), if they include physical
    hardware to be installed in the deployment (sensors or actuators), as well as
    a high level, in case data processing is needed. The middleware, in the LoRaFarM
    domain, refers to the set of entities and technologies by which data coming from
    farm-level modules are collected, stored, and exposed to high-level modules. This
    middleware can be defined as a sort of “connecting layer” between the farm and
    the back-end domain. Fig. 5. LoRaFarM platform: levels and parallelism with LoRaWAN
    [42]. Show All One of the main advantages of the LoRaFarM platform is that heterogeneous
    subnetworks, in terms of capabilities (transmission range, data throughput, and
    energy consumption), can be incorporated without altering the platform structure
    and, thus, making it highly scalable, flexible, and suitable for a wide range
    of scenarios. Indeed, this gives the freedom to choose the most suitable communication
    protocols and traffic policy to monitor and control the farm different areas,
    such as greenhouses and fields. Messages between nodes employing different protocols
    are translated by a multiprotocol GateWay (mpGW), enabling communications between
    non-LoRaWAN-enabled nodes and the LoRaFarM middleware, in a seamless way. Its
    protocol translation functionality, the mpGW can be enriched with edge computing
    features, to process and aggregate sensor data. Moreover, LoRaFarM can be extended
    with new functionalities like data analysis and prediction of the evolution of
    environmental parameters to prevent plant diseases, relying on AI and Machine
    Learning techniques. Finally, the mySense environment proposed by Silva et al.
    [58] is a sensor data integration framework aimed to systematize data acquisition
    procedures to address common smart agriculture issues. It facilitates the use
    of low cost platforms such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, making available a set
    of free tools based on the do it yourself (DIY) concept. The mySense platform
    builds over a 4-layer technological structure (sensor nodes, crop field and sensor
    networks, cloud services and front-end applications) and is accordingly divided
    into four levels of operation: Level 1, for data collection using common data
    transfer technologies (ZigBee, GSM/GPRS, LoRa, etc.); Level 2, for GWs (possibly)
    running local tasks according to the fog or edge computing paradigms; Level 3
    for storing data in the cloud; and Level 4 for high-level applications. Data can
    arrive from any device provided that complies with the data formats allowed by
    the platform. Summary and Insights: This Section discussed LoRa-based platforms
    which can be exploited to unify different applications into one simple and easy-to-use
    platform. Platforms such as Fiware, Cayenne, LoRaFarM, and mySense provide standardized
    interfaces to integrate different agricultural applications with each other. These
    platforms provide ready-to-use solutions and connectivity between heterogeneous
    networks. With these platforms, LoRa can integrate and complement existing systems
    based on other network technologies (ZigBee, Bluetooth, etc.), making them highly
    scalable. SECTION V. Application-Specific LoRa Platforms In this section, we provide
    an in-depth review focusing four reference scenarios: 1) irrigation systems; 2)
    plantation and crop monitoring; 3) tree monitoring; and 4) livestock monitoring,
    which broadly cover most of smart agriculture applications. A. Irrigation Systems
    Accurate monitoring of the soil water status allows to achieve seasonal water
    savings of up to 90% compared to traditional management, increasing productivity
    and introducing significant savings in energy costs for the water pumps management
    [59]. To improve water management in agriculture, it is necessary to analyze and
    monitor the complex water interactions that occur in field, following the concept
    of soil-plant-atmosphere (SPA) continuum systems [60]. Indeed, the knowledge of
    the water status of the SPA system plays a significant role for understanding
    the crop water stress and implement water saving mechanisms with a minimal effect
    on the production [59]. Measuring the evapotranspiration (ET), which refers to
    the amount of water that passes from the soil into the air due to the combined
    effect of plant transpiration and evaporation, is another complex task. Examples
    of these sensors are the lysimeters or sophisticated micro-meteorological sensors
    (e.g., Eddy covariance), whose cost and complexity limit their application to
    research studies [61]. Cheaper systems are the time domain reflectometry (TDR)
    technique or gravimetric methods [62], whose main limit is the difficulty in calibration
    and automation. Some LoRa-based irrigation systems are implemented using development
    boards such as Arduino, ESP32, Pycom, or STM32, e.g., [43], [44], [47], [48],
    [46], and [51]. Few of them also include energy harvesting modules, such as an
    hydroelectric generator, allowing them to operate for decades. For example, the
    LoRaWAN-based irrigation system in [51] comprises an energy-neutral irrigation
    node (Fig. 6) with the following modules: controller module, power module, irrigation
    module, and transmitter module. Fig. 6. Energy-neutral irrigation node described
    in [51]. Show All Exploiting AI and data coming from different sensor, such as
    air temperature and humidity, soil temperature and humidity, light intensity,
    etc. makes possible to develop and train specific irrigation models to calculate
    the exact amount of water to be distributed. For example, the works [54], [55],
    [56] provide machine-learning-based smart irrigation systems, all employing LoRa
    technology. In particular, in [55], a random forest classifier predicts the soil
    moisture and, thus, irrigation is planned accordingly. In [54], instead, multiple
    linear regression algorithm is employed to train the model using two highest correlation
    coefficient features: 1) light intensity and 2) soil humidity. Data is collected
    with a LoRa P2P network, which uses a master–slave and TDMA-based MAC protocol.
    Each slave node has a unique address and can transmit a packet in each of the
    reserved TDMA time slots. Alternatively, a Penman-Monteith-based irrigation model
    allows for an optimal irrigation strategy for different crop growth periods and
    uses the ET parameter to estimate the amount of water [63]. This solution requires
    an integration of actuators, sensors and a meteorological station in a LoRa network
    [49], [50]. In addition, third-party services such as weather information or fog
    computing may be needed to decide on irrigation schedules [57]. Since in LoRaWAN,
    the latency of downlink communication from GW to Class-A nodes (sensors or actuators)
    is relatively long (must first wait for an uplink transmission), few systems employ
    alternative Master/Slave protocols [52], [53], [54]. These protocols increase
    the stability of the LoRa irrigation system, avoiding packet collisions and, thus,
    can save water during the close command of the solenoid valve. Finally, AREThOU5A
    [43] is an example of a water management system that combines data collected from
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in the field and satellite data provided by international
    weather forecast services, to achieve efficient water usage strategies for farmers.
    It employs a WSN with two different sensors for measuring the temperature and
    the soil moisture in field. A routing subsystem controls and routes the data and
    information through LoRaWAN and TCP/IP with SSL network interfaces. The LoRa network
    is used to collect data from the EDs and perform administration processes, while
    the TCP/IP SSL works as a bridge to the rest of the network architecture. Summary
    and Insights: Comparing the characteristics of different irrigation systems, summarized
    in Table I, it is relevant to note that most of these LoRa-based irrigation systems
    adopt temperature, humidity, and soil moisture sensors. However, albeit all cited
    papers are recently published, ML is used only in 1/3 of the applications. TABLE
    I LoRa-Based Irrigation System Comparison Furthermore, only 13% of these irrigation
    systems used an evapotranspiration-based methodology. This strategy, which is
    often expensive, may be accomplished by combining inexpensive sensors and AI (with
    a more comprehensive approach integrating meteorological variables measured by
    a weather station with variables measured by soil sensors into the system), significantly
    lowering the cost of direct evapotraspiration measurements. Such improvements
    could lead to more effective water management, with the simultaneous impact of
    decreasing water usage and increase crop output. Finally, LoRaWAN communications
    can be tuned to adapt the duty cycle and manage the system optimally: for example,
    when the irrigation system is not in use, sensor data could be collected every
    hour or even less, while when irrigation is taking place the measurements could
    be increased to every 5–10 min. This way, the use of water and energy could be
    further reduced [71]. B. Plantation and Crop Monitoring Plantation and crop monitoring
    requires a large number of sensors to obtain an effective control and, thus, increase
    productivity, especially when agricultural fields are very heterogeneous. For
    example, in order to optimize the production while minimizing the ecological footprint,
    it is necessary to control the injection of pesticides and fertilizers [72], [73],
    increasing yields up to 10% and saving fertilizers up to 37% [74]. Such control
    can be performed by varying the pesticides and fertilizer application rate over
    time and space. Crops do not always need a uniform application, as some areas
    have different requirements due to their location (sunlight, soil features, etc).
    Over-fertilization can deteriorate water quality, favor weed growth, and reduce
    profit. Vice-versa under-fertilization restricts yield or reduces crop quality
    [75]. The application rate can be modified based on weather impacts, nutrient
    availability, and seasonal cycles [73], [75]. Some optical or ultrasonic sensors
    indirectly assess the nutrient request (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, etc.)
    of the crop at the time of application [72]. In addition, to reduce the loss of
    productivity in crops, surveillance systems can be adopted [76]. Providing visual
    monitoring to growers can prevent crops from getting damaged by intruders, ensure
    the field conditions or enable the detection of pests attacks remotely. Although
    there are plenty of devices which can be exploited for building a real-time visual
    monitoring system, deploying them in a wide area and over wireless channels can
    be challenging [77], [78], [79]. Table II summarizes the main characteristics
    of several plantation and crop monitoring systems, based on LoRa technology. The
    nodes used in these systems should be of small dimensions, self-sufficient in
    terms of energy, relatively cheap, and often able to acquire a large variety of
    parameters. For example, three different sensor nodes have been developed by Valente
    et al. [64] and tested in a vineyard field: node 1, with an ultrasonic anemometer
    (that measures the direction and speed of the wind) and a sensor that monitors
    bulk electrical conductivity, in addition to volumetric water content (by measuring
    soil permittivity) and soil and air temperature; node 2, an irrometer watermark
    soil water tension sensor; and node 3, an all-in-one weather station with 12 sensors
    to measure air temperature, relative humidity, vapor pressure, barometric pressure,
    wind speed, gust and direction, solar radiation, precipitation, lightning strike
    counter, and distance. It should be remarked that each node contains sensors which
    differ for the sampling rate, accuracy, and supplied energy. The nodes send data
    using LoRaWAN to a GW that is connected to a the things network (TTN) server.
    In the TTN server, data is decoded and sent to the ThingSpeak [80] platform for
    visualization and possible analysis and aggregation. Fig. 7 summarizes the different
    blocks composing the nodes: 1) a maximum power point tracker (MPPT) applied to
    a photovoltaic source and connected with a storage system; 2) a dc/dc switching
    converter to interface the source with the storage system and loads; 3) the LoRaWAN
    module for communication; and 4) the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) module
    to convert the signals available from sensors. TABLE II LoRa-Based Plantation
    and Crop Monitoring System Comparison Fig. 7. Block diagram of the sensor nodes
    taken from [64]. Show All In [66] a LoRa-based IoT monitoring system for starfruit
    plantation is presented. The LoRa network implemented includes three nodes and
    one master, and it can cover a range of 700 m. For optimal growth, starfruit plants
    need soil pH conditions between 5.5–7.5. Thus, thanks to the proposed LoRa system,
    the farmers can make important and precise decisions about how to grow the crop.
    Similarly, works [65], [67], [68], [69], [58] present solutions to increase production
    and fruit quality, with optimal use of resources through LoRa-based networks.
    The Smart Mushroom Cultivation is a system used to automatize the production of
    expensive mushrooms [67]. The smart system includes devices to monitor and control
    humidity and C O 2 levels through sensors and actuators all connected using LoRaWAN.
    The sensor nodes measure the ambient condition inside Mushroom House (humidity,
    temperature, and C O 2 ), and data is sent to the remote server for monitoring
    and analysis. An automatic control maintains the ambient conditions between the
    required levels. Finally, there are cases where anomaly detection near the sensor
    is required to allow decisions and actions as soon as possible. In this direction,
    Brunelli et al. [70] proposed a new paradigm of monitoring and pest detection
    to improve the performance of an apple orchard. They add intelligence to the LoRa
    nodes, shifting the detection of anomalies near the sensor. The application is
    developed on a low-energy platform powered by a solar panel, realizing an energy-autonomous
    system capable of operating unattended continuously over LoRa networks. Summary
    and Insights: Plantation and crop monitoring requires the control of numerous
    parameters, captured by different heterogeneous sensors deployed in the agricultural
    fields. Some of the sensors used in the cited papers are specific to the type
    of crop, while others (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) are deployed in almost
    all of the literature works. In addition, the use of AI is not yet widely adopted,
    and only three out of nine papers adopt automatic control for the implementation
    of DSSs. An innovative approach in this context would be to add intelligence to
    the LoRa nodes, while moving the DSS closer to the sensor. Finally, note that
    the maximum size of the LoRa payload is 250 bytes; this allows a wide variety
    of parameters to be monitored and transferred in a single packet. For example,
    Sacaleanu and Kiss [69] send eight agri-meteorological measurements in a single
    LoRa packet of only 16 bytes. C. Tree Monitoring Trees are essential in modern
    society and are widely applied in a great number of scenarios including soil erosion
    prevention, air purification, wood or fruit production. For supporting the managers
    of urban/rural green infrastructures and forests, it is important to constantly
    monitor the tree conditions, in terms of growth rate and failure risk, as well
    as micro-climate parameters in the tree surrounding areas. The analysis of this
    data allows the characterization of the trees functional responses to their environment
    and a prompt action in case of problems. Tree monitoring also requires reliable
    long-range communications in the presence of foliage, large sensor densification
    (i.e., one sensor per tree), and measurements of various physiological/biological
    parameters from specific locations (at the root, the trunk, or the branch) as
    a function of vegetation type to obtain accurate readings [83]. In these systems,
    it is also important to measure changes in position over time or instantaneous
    trunk accelerations. Table III summarizes the main characteristics of relevant
    Monitoring systems. TABLE III LoRa-Based Sensors Applications in Tree Farms One
    of the main properties to be measured is the water transport in the xylem of the
    trunk (called the sap flow). A possible measurement method is the Heat Balance
    Method, developed by Granier [91], [92], which is based on analyzing the temperature
    difference among two probes inserted into the stem wood at a 10 cm distance along
    the vertical trunk axis. The probe in the higher position is heated, while the
    lower one provides the stem wood reference temperature. The temperature difference
    generated between the probes represents an index of the transpiration activity
    of the plant, expressed as a variation of the flux density. This method can be
    used for accurate measurements of sap flow in plants, providing a reliable calibration
    procedure to relate the temperature difference to the actual sap flow [93]. For
    example, the TreeTalker (TT) [81] is a device that measures sapflow (water transport
    in the trunk), wood temperature and humidity, multispectral signature of light
    transmitted through the canopy, tree trunk radial growth, accelerations along
    a 3-D coordinate system used to detect tree movements, air temperature, and relative
    humidity, which can be additionally complemented by soil temperature and volumetric
    water content. A TT node is connected via LoRa wireless connection to a GW, that
    manages up to 48 devices in one cluster. The GW is, in turn, connected to the
    Internet via GPRS and sends data to a computer server. This technology can be
    applied to monitor the root plate tilt, as well as the flexion and the accelerations
    that tree trunks receive under the force of the wind for the evaluation of tree
    failure risk. Another solution to analyze the health condition of a tree consists
    on the electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), it is a well-known technique with
    a wide range of applications. EIS has been applied to characterize solids, liquids,
    both in the laboratory and industrial environments. Moreover, assessment of physiological
    states of some trees (pinus, chestnut, etc.) has also been studied. The method
    based on bioimpedance indexes allows determining three distinct physiological
    states: healthy and watered plants, plants with a high level of hydric stress,
    and plants with disease [94], [95], [96]. For example, Amaro et al. [82] integrated
    an EIS system in a sensor node to analyze the health condition of the tree and
    transfer the results through the LoRaWAN protocol. Finally, tree monitoring systems
    are often influenced by the presence of foliage which can severely impact wireless
    communication systems performance. This generally leads to node densification
    to increase coverage levels, especially in large areas, resulting in additional
    costs and constraining the design of LoRa systems in nonhomogeneous vegetation
    environments [84], [85], [97]. For such reasons, a small drone with a GW is sometimes
    required for collecting data from nodes and solving the Fresnel zone radio propagation
    issues encountered in tree farms [98], [86]. Summary and Insights: In this section,
    some methodologies for monitoring tree health have been discussed. It is important
    to highlight how LoRa can be easily integrated into these systems, e.g., to measure
    the lymph flow or bio-impedance of trees. In case the parameter to be monitored
    involves roots, it has been shown that LoRa can be used for under-ground or near-ground
    communications too [12], [99]. Finally, the use of drones for data collection
    has been exploited to solve the problem of foliage scattering. D. Livestock Monitoring
    System Smart livestock practices aim at improving the productive and reproductive
    parameters, feeding and handling of feces, producing a direct effect on the increment
    of the farmers’ income, and also better milk and meat production [100]. The implementation
    of these practices requires to monitor the general health conditions of the animals,
    by tracking some biological signals to be associated to symptoms of disease, estrus
    and calving [101]. Wearable sensor technologies provide the possibility of remotely
    managing individual animals facilitating urgent interventions, responding to time
    and labor-intensive concerns in a more efficient way [87]. In extensive livestock
    production systems, the absence of access to networking and animal contact presents
    a barrier to the effective use of these technologies. Wearable sensors, to be
    more practical for extensive management settings, must: 1) network over longer
    distances; 2) have reliable power supplies (preferably renewable); 3) be low-cost
    so that damaged and lost sensors are less economically impactful; and 4) transmit
    data in real time. For these reasons, LoRaWAN technology is indicated for above
    described applications, some of which are summarized in Table IV. Primarily, these
    systems are used to monitor the animal health, but by integrating LoRa technology
    with a GPS, remote grazing systems can be implemented [87], [88]. TABLE IV LoRa-Based
    Sensor Applications in Livestock Monitoring Animal monitoring can involve completely
    different scenarios; as a consequence, the LoRa network architecture could require
    a more specific design effort to work either in indoor or outdoor settings. For
    example, the work in [89] proposes two different versions of GWs: an indoor GW,
    designed for installation in sheltered areas such as barns and cowsheds and oriented
    toward dairy cattle livestock scenarios, and an outdoor version, more specific
    for open areas such as paddocks and pasture lands, and designed for beef cattle
    livestock scenarios. The indoor GW is conceived for monitoring several important
    physical parameters typical of the shed environment, such as temperature, relative
    humidity, illuminance, carbon dioxide (C O 2 ) , and ammonia (N H 3 ) concentration,
    while the main purpose of the outdoor GW is to manage nodes in remote areas, far
    from the shed, directly on the pasture land. In the open field scenario, weather
    parameters (temperature and humidity) are collected, for purposes of correlation
    with the animal health status. Moreover, in the presence of large herds, the high
    node density could cause an increase in collisions between sent packets. In such
    scenarios, a MAC layer that includes a listen-before-talk (LBT) mechanism could
    prevent as much as possible packet collisions among nodes. Indeed, LBT-based carrier-sense
    multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) can be incorporated with the
    physical layer of LoRa [89]. The CA mechanism is based on a random retransmission
    time that randomizes the access of the nodes to the wireless medium. The size
    of the pasture area is another factor to consider in deploying the LoRaWAN network.
    In particular, it has been shown that in large areas of pasture, the use of a
    mobile GW that moves along the track is a better solution than the use of one
    or more static GWs [90]. Contrarily, when the livestock area is not too large,
    using only one static GW is preferable because the data extraction rate value
    is high enough and the energy consumption is lower compared to multiple static
    GWs or one mobile GW. The instance of cattle monitoring in New Mexico, as described
    by Actility [102], is one of the successful illustrations of a large-scale LoRaWAN-enabled
    deployment. Due to the large size of these desert ranches (10000–20000 hectares)
    and the large number of cows to track (up to 7000), monitoring and obtaining information
    regarding cattle wellbeing can be time consuming and expensive. Indeed, while
    the cattle were previously followed using traditional GPS devices, the absence
    of reliable cellular connection throughout the whole grazing region made this
    method ineffective. These issues were solved with an off-the-shelf LoRaWAN solution
    because of its extensive range and good coverage. Finally, LoRa technology can
    be used for sharing the short text messages and voice messages in the absence
    of cellular coverage. For example, COWShED [103] is used for supporting livestock
    transhumance in Senegal. Summary and Insights: In this section, we showed how
    LoRa is used to collect information about the movements and health of livestock,
    as well as on the conditions of grassland. LoRa can also aid herders in achieving
    remote grazing by combining data with electronic fences, to identify whether animals
    have crossed it. In addition, LoRa has been used to monitor environmental parameters
    of barns, demonstrating how this technology can be adopted in both outdoor and
    indoor scenarios. Additionally, innovative MAC schemes, such as LBT method could
    be implemented to minimize packet collisions when big herds present, and to mitigate
    the limits on the effective duty cycle of channel occupation. Finally, in the
    absence of cellular coverage, LoRa/LoRaWAN solutions have been used for large-scale
    cattle monitoring or even supporting livestock transhumance for text/voice messages.
    SECTION VI. Lessons Learned and Open Issues This Section discusses the lessons
    learned and the open research challenges for using LoRa technology in smart agriculture.
    According to the aim of this article, it was learned that, given the wide variety
    of sensors used in smart farming systems, different communication protocols need
    to be integrated, particularly when different platforms/vendors coexist and data
    must be collected from the various subsystems. In addition, since power supplies
    are frequently unavailable in a large agricultural area, nodes should be as energy
    self-sufficient as possible. Using local or edge data processing could mitigate
    this problem, optimizing the energy consumption. Moreover, keeping the logic on
    the Edge of the network could alleviate the hurdle on LoRa’s centralized communications
    (especially on the downlink). The development of interoperability in smart agriculture
    systems can also be accelerated by platforms such as FIWARE and Cayenne, while
    machine learning can be used to model and analyze technical problems, improving
    scalability of LoRa networks and predicting network congestion. The experience
    gained in Industry 4.0 can be transferred to agriculture, considering some peculiarities,
    including the need to cover large spaces that cannot be manned. In addition, there
    is the need to provide device power supply and data security (partially solved
    by leveraging on LoRaWAN built-in security schemes). Another significant factor
    is the initial cost of the system, which must be as low as possible since the
    pay-back time also depends on elements that cannot be predicted during the year,
    such as weather. Finally, it has been recognized that although ICT has long-term
    sustainability issues to be solved, they show great potential for improving the
    usage of natural resources, especially when cyber–physical systems (CPSs) are
    combined with IoT, AI, machine learning, and neuromorphic computing techniques
    [104]. Through the study carried out in this article, it is also possible to understand
    in which area LoRa has been applied and is emerging in recent years. In particular,
    among the application areas discussed in Section V, Fig. 8 shows in a pie chart
    that more than 40% of the analyzed studies focus on water management, while almost
    25% are dedicated on crop monitoring, followed by tree monitoring. This result
    is in line with recent market surveys on LPWANs (e.g., [105]), and other general
    studies on communications protocols for smart agriculture [9]. Fig. 8. Distribution
    of the LoRa papers according to smart agriculture application areas. Show All
    All this confirms the great potential of implementing smart agriculture solutions
    using IoT, and LoRa technology in particular. However, there are still some open
    issues that need to be faced: for example, LoRaWAN works quite well in uplink
    when it needs to collect data from sensors, while downlink connections might suffer
    high latency. In what follows, we briefly discuss future research directions related
    to downlink latency, energy management, device heterogeneity and interoperability,
    data management, and scalability. These open issues must be solved for LoRa systems
    to be widely adopted in smart agriculture. We conclude the Section with an eye
    on other wireless technologies, different from LoRa/LoRaWAN. A. LoRa Downlink
    Performance The downlink performance of LPWAN systems still represents a challenge
    since it is related to the energy consumption. In particular, LoRaWAN allows different
    tradeoffs between communication latency on the downlink channel and energy consumption.
    Nodes are classified by classes: they can receive only after an uplink transmission
    (Class A), or at regular time intervals (Class B), or at any time (Class C). The
    modern trend is to optimize energy efficiency, hence, data are transmitted only
    when necessary or periodically. According to the authors’ opinion, a further optimization
    could be retrieved by local data processing. As a matter of fact, even if nodes
    remain asleep most of the time, as in [57], or with scheduling intervals of reception
    windows of 10–20 min as in [48] and [50] or a few hours [58], local processing
    always lowers the data to be transmitted decreasing the transmission time; it
    has been successfully tested in [42] where edge processing on the GW allows a
    more effective control of the actuator nodes. This last approach improves also
    reliability since it allows farms to work even if the Internet connection of the
    LoRa GW is absent for a few hours. Reliability can also be improved by a Master/Slave
    access control method for the LoRa network [52], [53], [54]. Alternatively, for
    short-range communication, a Wake-up Radio (WuR) can be adopted. WuR technology
    is an ultralow-power receiver that is continuously listening to the channel while
    spending a few nanowatts or microwatts depending on the circuit’s design. WuRs
    work in parallel to the main LoRa transceiver and allow asynchronous wake-up of
    the nodes with low latency. With the LoRa-WuR scheme, the downlink latency can
    be reduced by almost 90% compared to the traditional LoRa protocol for a ten nodes
    cluster [106], [107]. B. Energy Efficiency Considerations In addition to downlink
    communication performance just explained, the energy consumption in an agricultural
    ED can include turning on booster pumps or solenoid valves, activating sensors
    over a long period, use of GPS and data transmission, etc. Nodes should be autonomous
    as much as possible since usually power supplies are not available in a wide agricultural
    area. Besides, the use of batteries needs to minimize disposal costs and pollution.
    Providing solutions to avoid the use of batteries by harvesting energy from the
    environment would encourage the deployment of wireless devices in smart agriculture.
    The use of different energy sources, such as solar energy, piezoelectricity, thermal,
    wind, water, and radiofrequency is consolidated [108]. However, making a device
    completely energy-neutral requires a thorough analysis of power consumption in
    different working states [109]. One facilitation is the availability of a renewable
    energy source as in [51]; on the other hand, a high energy consumption due to
    the heating of one probe as in [91] requires a different design or the remote
    monitoring of the energy available or harvested as in [110]. It is evident that
    there are many factors that influence the analysis of offering-demanding energy,
    it varies on a case-by-case basis and does not lend itself to systematic analysis;
    on the other hand, in this context, machine learning algorithms can give a significant
    contribution. Infact, the ML approach has been already successfully applied in
    different contexts allowing to implement an efficient renewable energy selection
    based on the geographic location [111], or to retrieve a good energy prediction
    [112]. An application example is given by the energy-neutral system for pest detection
    [70] which takes advantage of ML algorithms. C. Heterogeneity and Interoperability
    Smart agriculture systems are quite heterogeneous in terms of sensors and, in
    some cases, it is also required to integrate different communication technologies,
    e.g., when multiple platforms coexist and data arrives from different subsystems.
    LoRa platforms are used with ZigBee to implement hybrid communications managing
    different sensors clusters or with the IEEE 802.11s-based system to build a mesh
    networking architecture. The path for the integration of different technologies,
    such as cloud, IoT, and software-defined networking, with AI is proposed in [113]
    with the related challenges and opportunities. Assuring communications in heterogeneous
    smart agriculture systems is a critical issue that has been studied for example
    in [114], where LoRa and ZigBee hybrid communications are implemented. Precisely,
    two LoRa sensor clusters and two ZigBee sensor clusters are used and combined
    with two ZigBee-to-LoRa converters to communicate in a network managed by a LoRa
    GW. The token ring protocol in the ZigBee network and polling mechanism in the
    LoRa network is used. The system can work with a packet loss rate of less than
    0.5% when the communication distance is 630 m for the ZigBee network and 3.7 km
    for the LoRa network. An hybrid LoRa/IEEE 802.11s-based mesh networking architecture
    is proposed in [115], where an effective network protocol selection mechanism
    is developed to choose the right interface. Protocol selection is based on multiple
    parameters, including network communication interface type, GNSS position of the
    APs, RSSI of nearby nodes, type and amount of data to be transmitted. Large data
    to be transferred in a short time can rely on the IEEE 802.11s-based network while
    small data can be transmitted through a LoRa-based mesh network. Platforms such
    as FIWARE [116], Cayenne [41] and mySense [58], discussed in Section IV, can also
    give a push to achieve interoperability in the smart agriculture systems. The
    above described solutions can benefit of an “industry 4.0”-based approach where
    the integration of different protocols cooperate to address the needs of automating
    computing and technology processes [113], [18]. D. Machine Learning and Big Data
    Management The integration of big data analysis with machine learning can provide
    predictions about future outcomes, such as fruit quality or detect crops’ diseases
    using historical data, analytical techniques, and statistical modeling [117].
    The benefits of ML in the agriculture are relevant [118]. However, the deployment
    of models is the most challenging step to bring the ML algorithms in the production
    fields, and thanks to its advantages, LoRa technology could make a big contribution
    to taking this step. Collected data can be used to implement an intelligent system
    capable of supporting the identification of varieties and predicting the quality
    of the final product [64]. In fact, exploiting ML, the data can be used by the
    biologists to develop crop models and perform disease prediction [68]. The agricultural
    industry produces a large amount of data collected by heterogeneous sensors, so
    best practices should include the mechanisms to reduce the memory and time for
    data analysis. Thus, to pursue such objectives, edge computing models are also
    applied [119]. Distributed data process, such as MapReduce [120], may avoid bottlenecks
    when transferring all data to a single server, as in [121] where the proposed
    method adopts smart sensors to measure the soil quality indicators, while the
    preelaborated data is transmitted using the LoRaWAN protocol. The Apache Spark
    environment is then used to implement a parallel algorithm for statistical models
    based on the soil indicator data obtained from the experimental field. E. LoRa
    Scalability and Network Improvement As concerns scalability, some open points,
    shared with general applications, are recognized. For this reason, most of the
    reference literature does not directly address issues related to agriculture.
    Indeed, scalability is a key feature in LoRa networks due to its long-range and
    large number of devices can concurrently reach a given GW. The network scales
    quite well if dynamic transmission parameters are used, in combination with multiple
    sinks. However, the correct behavior of the NS is not easy to be evaluated [122].
    In fact, the NS presents some challenges from the point of view of its optimization,
    such as processing duplicate packets or packets from other networks, or bringing
    down the entire network in case of Internet connection loss. LoRa networks are
    bound by strict legal requirements, particularly where no LBT schemes are utilized.
    The transmission duty cycle (TDC) regulates the ISM bands to determine the maximum
    time that the band can be occupied, typically bounded to 1%. This implies that
    devices may not occupy the ISM band for more than 36 s per hour, forbidding the
    transmission of new packets when this limit is attained [123]. Machine learning
    can be applied to model and analyze technical problems, improving the scalability
    of LoRa networks and predicting network congestion [124]. Further developments
    could include enhanced ADR mechanisms, optimization of GW locations, and interference
    cancelation techniques [125]. Finally, some challenges remain such as the widespread
    adoption of multihop communications in LoRaWAN. Literature has shown that multihop
    or mesh topologies can extend the coverage of LoRaWAN networks and improve energy
    efficiency in certain scenarios [126]. These solutions propose intermediate nodes
    to forward messages to other EDs to extend the coverage. Other open points include
    the use of GWs as intermediate nodes, GW-to-GW communications, and practical large-scale
    deployment of LoRaWAN mesh networks. F. Other Communication Technologies The choice
    of a specific communication technology is central to the performance of IoT-based
    agricultural applications. Other than LoRa, many standards for wireless communications
    can be employed, including Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-Wave, RFID, Sigfox, and NB-IoT.
    Some of them work well in the short-range (within 100 m), while others are more
    useful to cover long distances (up to tens of kilometers). Examples of the former
    are Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-Wave, and passive and active RFID systems, while in the
    latter, standards are Sigfox and NB-IoT (and LoRa of course). As discussed previously,
    the deployment of a massive number of IoT devices might cause interference problems
    especially for technologies using the unlicensed spectrum, such as ZigBee, Wi-Fi,
    Sigfox, and LoRa. On the other hand, IoT devices operating with a licensed spectrum
    eliminate interference problems but might increase costs significantly. Several
    papers have analyzed different aspects of wireless communication protocols for
    smart agriculture, studying possible applications and comparing their performance.
    For example, ZigBee-based smart agriculture systems are described in [127], [128],
    [129], [130], and [131]. The biggest challenges for ZigBee networks are the limited
    range and increased power consumption (compared to LPWANs) and relatively low
    data rate (e.g., compared to BLE or WiFi). Therefore, ZigBee is better suited
    for small-scale scenarios [130], while the use of this protocol is not suitable
    when the agricultural area is vast and the distance between sensor nodes is large.
    On the other hand, the works [132], [133], [134], [135] represent successful examples
    of NB-IoT applications in smart agriculture. Indeed, extensive coverage, adaptable
    power consumption (depending on the mode of operation), and low interference among
    nodes, are features that make NB-IoT an interesting protocol for various agricultural
    systems [136]. However, NB-IoT employs licensed frequency channels, which results
    in higher subscription prices for the associated system even if it offers a higher
    data throughput than LoRa. Moreover, when there is an existing LTE infrastructure
    already in place, the need for hardware update may be another source of expense
    for such a system. This might be a drawback in the context of smart agriculture
    if the projected return on investment is not high enough to cover these costs
    [137]. Overall, the choice of the communication technology in smart agriculture
    needs to consider many factors and requirements, such as support for roaming,
    suitability of technology to small-scale, medium-scale, and large-scale deployments,
    geographical location, costs, etc. For example, it has been shown that Sigfox
    and LoRaWAN excel on network capacity, battery lifetime, and cost, whereas NB-IoT
    achieves higher quality of service and lower latency [27]. Finally, while LoRaWAN
    has been considered the most suitable communication network for IoT in smart agriculture
    [16], it is still difficult to tell which technology will dominate the market,
    or if several technologies will coexist, perhaps specializing on different application
    domains. SECTION VII. Conclusion Although the expected transition to smart agriculture
    has already begun, researchers around the world are still looking for new solutions
    to improve agricultural productivity through IoT architectures. Indeed, albeit
    applications in agriculture can benefit from the experience gained in Industry
    4.0, they require specific knowledge regarding sensor management, energy optimization,
    and data processing. LoRa technology is widely adopted, as it allows building
    an autonomous network that meets some of the requirements of the smart agriculture,
    such as low-power and long-range communication. The adoption of LoRa-based systems
    in agriculture results in an effective way to improve the connectivity of farms,
    encourage the deployment of DSSs and consequently improve their management, leading
    the agricultural sector toward smart agriculture. In order to provide a more focused
    and comprehensive view of the applications in the field, in this article, we restricted
    our focus to LoRa/LoRaWAN technology and its uses in the context of smart agriculture.
    We presented many LoRa applications in the field, and we discussed some open issues
    and research areas for future improvements. The main challenges analyzed using
    LoRa Technology in smart agriculture, are: latency on the downlink channel, energy
    management, heterogeneity and interoperability of the devices, data management,
    and scalability. All of these can benefit from the use of machine learning algorithms.
    Indeed, AI and edge computing are still scarcely used but related algorithms and
    technologies are now mature and may be successfully applied in this field. Finally,
    the optimization of multiple GW locations and multihop topologies to extend the
    coverage of LoRa networks have been recently tested to further improve the performance
    and coverage. NOTE Open Access funding provided by ‘Università degli Studi di

    Indonesia SECTION I. Introduction Outdoor data communication using the internet
    in Internet of Things (IoT) applications has a risk of interference caused by
    environmental conditions[1], [2]. Providing an access point for outdoor applications
    requires more electricity[3]. LoRa WAN is effective for long-range data communication
    for outdoor implementation[4], [5]. LoRa WAN is also compatible to use alongside
    other data communication methods such as WIFI for data uploading to the internet[6],
    [7] and nRF for short range, low energy data communication[8]. The proposed research
    aimed to optimize data communication between local storage, internet and wireless
    sensor network (WSN)[9], [10]. A hybrid data collection system for an IoT-based
    solar drip irrigation system using LoRa WAN. The Hybrid system in this study consists
    of a WAN for local control and data collection using LoRa and uploading to the
    internet. Apart from storing data in indoor and internet local storage, the system
    allows local users such as farmers to access a web-based user interface without
    the internet[9], [11]. The WSN system in research uses nRF from previous studies.
    The evaluation consist of blackbox testing[12], Quality of Services(QoS)[13] and
    Solar Power measurement[14], [15]. The black box evaluates the validity of system
    function as local and online web service interfaces. The QoS evaluate the packet
    delivery ratio (PDR) and delay of data communication consisting of nRF, LoRa,
    and HTTP. The solar power evaluation measures the energy availability consisting
    of the power generated by the solar cell and used from the battery. The evaluation
    also measures the environmental condition consisting of light intensity, ambient
    temperature, and the power availability effect to the QoS. SECTION II. Related
    Works The research related to LoRa WAN IoT implementation for agriculture has
    been presented. The first research using Arduino and NodeMCU with Blynk as storage
    and data communication broker[16]. The proposed research uses local web server
    and storage alongside with online HTTP server on private web hosting. The second
    research focused on LPWAN (low-power wide-area network) technologies for smart
    agriculture applications in palm oil plantations[17]. The proposed research also
    focused on energy problem but also using solar power as renewable energy resource.
    The research related to hybrid data communication between LoRa, nRF have not been
    presented for outdoor implementation. The related indoor implementation consist
    of a approach to using low-power, open-source hardware and software to achieve
    real-time data logging from the field to the web[18]. The proposed research focused
    on outdoor LoRa, nRF data communication and indoor data collection. SECTION III.
    Method A. Overview of The System An overview of the system is shown in Figure
    1. The components consist of indoor LoRa devices, outdoor LoRa devices, data servers
    and nRF-based WSNs that have been developed previously. The system has two users,
    namely local and online users. Data communication consists of LoRa, nRF and HTTP
    GET. NRF is used for communication between WSN and outdoor devices. Meanwhile,
    LoRa is for longer distances between indoor and outdoor devices. LoRa connection
    allows indoor devices to connect to the internet in a more secure residential
    environment. Fig. 1. General View of The System Show All Local users enable simple
    web access to the local Wemos D1 mini app without an internet connection. Local
    users include farmers or other users who want to save data packets for system
    control and monitoring. Online users retrieve the full-featured web interface
    from the data server. Server data contains data that has been uploaded via indoor
    devices via HTTP GET. Fig. 2. Flow Chart of the System Show All The general flow
    chart for the system is shown in Figure 2. The preparation consists of the devices
    described in the system overview. The process begins with collecting data from
    Wsn using nRF. The received data is forwarded to the indoor device using LoRa.
    After receiving the indoor device, the data is stored first in a microSD as a
    backup and local data access without internet. Through the indoor device data
    is uploaded to the storage server via the HTTP network. Local and online web servers
    check whether there is control carried out by the user in stages from local to
    online. For local control directly forwarded by indoor to outdoor devices. Meanwhile,
    online control is returned to the indoor device as an HTTP GET payload first.
    B. Specific Flow of Indoor and Outdoor Device The flow chart for the outdoor device
    data communication loop is shown in Figure 3. Preparation in the form of nRF and
    LoRa libraries via the SPI port. The process starts with nRF listening and LoRa
    off. Once data is received LoRa forwards data after turning off nRF. LoRa switches
    from transmitter to receiver mode to receive instructions from indoor. If there
    is control then it is passed to nRF after turning off LoRa again. Fig. 3. Flow
    Chart of the Outdoor Device Show All The flow chart for the indoor device data
    communication loop is shown in Figure 3. The preparations are in the form of microSD
    and LoRa libraries via the SPI port, as well as HTTP GET. The process starts with
    LoRa listening and MicroSD off. After data is received MicroSD forwards data after
    turning off LoRa. After the data is written to the microSD, data communication
    switches to HTTP GET to upload data to the storage server. Web server and HTTP
    client is activated to serve active local and online users. If there is control
    from the user then LoRa is active and passes control to the outdoor device. Fig.
    4. Flow Chart of the Indoor Device Show All C. IoT Circuit Configuration Figure
    5 shows the indoor device circuit configuration. The main components consist of
    Wemos D1 mini with microSD and LoRa WAN modules which are connected (serial) via
    the SPI port. For the power source, a TP4056 is used which is connected to a 6WP
    mini solar panel and a 3.7v 18650 battery. Wemos D1 mini is used because it can
    access wifi and can become an access point. This feature allows for data upload
    and the local web server. Figure 6 shows the circuit configuration for outdoor
    devices. The main components consist of Arduino Nano with nRF and LoRa modules
    connected via an SPI port. Arduino Nano has higher computational capabilities
    than the ESP8266 derivative and does not require an internet connection for outdoor
    applications. The power source is the same as for indoor applications. NRF is
    used to receive data from WSN. LoRa is used to forward data from nRF to indoor
    devices. Fig. 5. Circuit Configuration of Indoor Device Show All Fig. 6. Circuit

    PCB Result of IoT Devices Figure 7 shows the PCB connection of the indoor device.
    All components fit on a 5x7cm PCB by using 26 AWG wire through the top of the
    PCB to avoid shorts between adjacent connections. The power source uses 24 AWG
    via the 5v and GND pins to the power module. Fig. 7. PCB of Indoor Device Show
    All Figure 8 shows the PCB of the outdoor device. All components fit on a 5x7cm
    PCB using 26 AWG cables to avoid shorts between adjacent connections. The power
    source uses 24 AWG via the VIN and GND pins to the power module. In the future,
    other sensors can be added to the device due to the Arduino Nano''s ability to
    process more data than the ESP8266. Packaging for outdoor devices is a task in
    further research so that it is safe from water and pests. Fig. 8. PCB of Outdoor
    Device Show All Figure 9 shows the PCB for the power module which consists of
    TP4056, step-up module, 18650 battery, and 6WP solar panel. The Step Up module
    is used to increase the 3.7v battery voltage to 5v on the Wemos D1 Mini and Arduino
    Nano. The connection consists of 3 terminals for solar panels, batteries, and
    IoT devices. Fig. 9. PCB of Solar Power Module Show All B. Blackbox Testing Result
    Table 1 shows the results of blackbox testing for outdoor devices connected to
    nRF and LoRa data communication modules via the SPI port. The test is divided
    into 15 sections covering transmission testing, receiving data from nRF and LoRa.
    Both data communication libraries can be loaded individually or simultaneously.
    TABLE I. BLACKBOX TESTING FOR OUTDOOR DEVICES Each library can also transmit and
    receive data when other modules are off. The nRF module has few failures in transmission
    or reception. Meanwhile, LoRa can transmit and receive data perfectly. Data from
    nRF and LoRa are forwarded by storing them as variables in the Arduino Nano program
    with the character data type. NRF and LoRa cannot transmit or receive when other
    modules do the opposite. This was thought to be possible because transmission
    and reception use different pins but apparently not. So to perform nRF and LoRa
    data communication must deactivate each other. TABLE II. BLACK BOX TESTING ON
    INDOOR DEVICES Table 2 shows the results of black box testing on indoor devices
    connected to the microSD and LoRa modules connected via the same SPI port, and
    connected to the internet (HTTP GET) to upload data and receive payload from the
    storage server. The test is divided into 14 sections involving MicroSD data communication,
    LoRa, and HTTP GET, as well as web server and access point (AP) activity for local
    connections. Just like the outdoor conditions, the MicroSD and LoRa devices can
    work well when they disable each other. But there is a failure if active simultaneously.
    Web servers and APs can also run with a maximum of 2 clients due to limited memory
    on the Wemos D1 mini. Web servers and APs can run with active LoRa or microSD
    conditions. But uploading data via HTTP GET fails if LoRa or microSD is active.
    So it is necessary to do the switching between LoRa, microSD, and HTTP GET in
    data communication. This is explained in Tables 3 and 4 below. C. QoS Results
    Table 3 shows the communication loop data for outdoor devices. The table shows
    activity, end condition, average time, and delay in microsecond units. Activity
    is divided into four parts with a total average time of 2469ms and a delay of
    3000ms for a total of 5469ms for one loop. TABLE III. THE COMMUNICATION LOOP DATA
    FOR OUTDOOR DEVICES The highest average time is generated by LoRa transmission
    to indoor devices with 1076ms. Second order by nRF receiving from WSN with 827ms.
    The lowest generated by nRF is transmitting data to the WSN with 128ms. There
    is no significant difference between nRF and Lora in terms of average time but
    the program delay is higher for LoRa by 1000ms. Data sent from the indoor device
    via LoRa can be empty if there are no instructions from the indoor device control.
    If there is no data then the nRF transmission to the WSN is ignored and returns
    to the first loop. Table 4 shows the communication loop data for indoor devices.
    Activity is divided into six parts involving LoRa, MicroSD, web server, and upload
    via HTTP GET to the storage server. The total average time is 24272ms and the
    delay is 5000ms so the total is 29272ms for one loop. The highest average time
    resulted from uploading data to the storage server with 12034ms, followed by payload
    data with 10327ms. The lowest was generated by writing data to MicroSD with 218ms
    ignoring the local web server waiting time of 30ms. The process stops when a client
    accesses the web server. LoRa transmission to Outdoor Devices is still carried
    out even though there is no control data by sending empty character data. TABLE
    IV. THE COMMUNICATION LOOP DATA FOR INDOOR DEVICES TABLE V. the QoS evaluation
    of the system Table 5 shows the QoS evaluation of the system which is divided
    into six parts with three types of data communication nRF, LoRa, and HTTP GET.
    The evaluation shows an average PDR of 97.999% and a delay of 508.833ms. The lowest
    PDR was produced by nRF with 97.567% and 97.285%. While the longest delay is generated
    by LoRa with 826ms and 936ms. For HTTP GET for data upload has the lowest PDR,
    namely 95.256%. D. Solar Power and QoS Results Table 6 shows the results of the
    evaluation of solar power involving light intensity measured using the BH1750
    sensor and air temperature using the BMP280 sensor. Solar Cells shows the energy
    generated by solar panels. While the batteries show the energy used for the micro-controller
    and its components. Data was taken for one day with different light intensity
    and temperature. The battery can last until no energy is produced by solar panels
    with the lowest voltage of 2.929v and a current of 0.227A. Overall the battery
    consumes an average current of 0.2334A and a voltage of 3.304v. Solar panels produce
    energy with an average current of 0.2744A and a voltage of 2.7604v. Solar panels
    do not produce energy when the light intensity is around 101lux. TABLE VI. THE
    EVALUATION OF SOLAR POWER Table 7 shows the evaluation to find the relationship
    between solar power and QoS. PDR and Delay testing is divided according to nRF,
    LoRa and HTTP GET data communication. Solar power conditions are adjusted to the
    numbers in table 6 (conditions 1 to 5). TABLE VII. the relationship between solar
    power and QoS Overall QoS decreased in conditions 4 and 5 when the intensity of
    light and the energy generated by the solar panels decreased. But the decrease
    doesn''t seem significant, especially in LoRa with the lowest value of 98.378%
    and 934ms delay. The highest PDR was achieved by LoRa with an average of 98.991%.
    Meanwhile, the lowest delay was achieved by nRF with 247.6ms. The lowest PDR was
    generated by HTTP GET with 96.7638%. Meanwhile, the longest delay was generated
    by LoRa 876.6ms. SECTION V. Conclusion The results of a data communication loop
    programming produces a total average time of 2469ms and a delay of 3000ms on outdoor
    devices. The indoor device uses 24272ms and a delay of 5000ms for one loop. The
    Quality of Service (QoS) evaluation showed that the lowest PDR archived by nRF
    with 97.285%. In other side the longest delay is archived by LoRa with 936ms.
    Through solar power testing, the overall QoS decreases when the light intensity
    is below 101 lux, and the solar panel voltage is below 0.121v. But the decrease
    doesn''t seem significant, especially in LoRa with the lowest value of 98.378%
    and 934ms delay. Meanwhile, the lowest delay was achieved by nRF with 247.6ms.
    The lowest PDR was archieved by HTTP GET with 96.7638%. Meanwhile, the longest
    delay was archieved by LoRa 876.6ms. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics

    Abstract: Improving data processing in big data is a delicate procedure in our
    current digital era due to the massive amounts of data created by humans and machines
    in daily life. Handling this data, creating a repository for storage, and retrieving
    photos from internet platforms is a difficult issue for businesses and industries.
    Currently, clusters have been constructed for many types of data, such as text,

    data processing remain stressful. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is a system
    that provides a large storage area in big data for managing large datasets, although
    the accuracy level is not as high as desired. Furthermore, query optimization
    was used to produce low latency and high throughput outcomes. To address these

    data collection and organization, followed by data extraction from the repository.
    Finally, numerous experiments with assessments were carried out, and the outcomes

    IEEE SECTION I. Introduction The widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT)
    technology in various applications has profoundly impacted the current generations.
    IoT applications use sensor devices that are low-power, low-cost, more efficient,
    don’t require human involvement, and are interconnected over a large geographic
    region. The IoT makes machine-to-machine and machine-to-human communication possible,
    where sensor devices or actuators facilitate human interaction. Emerging technologies
    are essential in the demanding field of healthcare. Many technologies, including
    edge computing, cloud computing, fog computing, machine learning, and Blockchain
    technology, are integrated with the IoT to create intelligent healthcare systems
    [1], [2]. Healthcare organizations are using more and more sensor-based medical
    equipment as they adopt cutting-edge technologies and strive to give patients
    the best care possible [3], [4]. IoT-enabled healthcare solutions can provide
    remote patient tracking, monitoring, alerting, assistance, and 24/7 healthcare
    service. To integrate sensor-based medical equipment with IoT healthcare systems,
    several wireless protocols, including CoAP, MQTT, AMQP, XMPP, HTTP, Zigbee, Zwave,
    WiFi, LoRaWAN, SigFox, and Bluetooth, are available [5], [6]. Data collection
    and processing are challenging or occasionally fail for a large volume of data
    with the conventional data management method since the number of patients worldwide
    is steadily rising daily. Most IoT systems use centralized frameworks. If the
    central server goes down or malfunctions at any point, the entire system’s processing
    will slow down or occasionally stop working altogether. In the IoT based healthcare
    systems, it is considered a significant challenge. IoT systems face scalability,
    trust, interoperability, stability, and immutability issues when large-scale devices
    are connected to the system [7]. To address the technical issues with IoT devices,
    a new emerging technology called Blockchain was introduced [8]. Healthcare costs,
    remote patient monitoring, tracking, treatment quality, and disease surveillance
    are all significantly impacted by a timely Health Information Exchange (HIE) between
    doctors, pharmacists, patients, nurses, lab technicians, and insurance providers
    of healthcare systems. Blockchain is digital ledger technology (DLT) introduced
    in healthcare sectors to address the technical challenges of IoT systems. Decentralized,
    distributed, and immutable properties of Blockchain technology overcome the security,
    privacy, trust, availability, reliability, and privacy issues of IoT systems [3],
    [9]. Healthcare industries have adopted Blockchain technology, a distributed,
    decentralized, and irreversible digital ledger with no single central authority
    in charge of managing the healthcare system. Since Electronic Medical Records
    (EMR) are essential and extremely sensitive, Blockchain technology allows security,
    privacy, trust, availability, dependability, scalability, interoperability, and
    stability in healthcare systems to overcome the technological limitations of IoT
    healthcare systems. Since Blockchain is built on cryptographic hashing techniques,
    each node in the network can take part in transmitting, sharing, accessing, storing,
    and viewing healthcare data without the need for prior verification between network
    members. For most Blockchain-integrated IoT healthcare applications, a smart contract
    is a self-executing, small piece of code written in the solidity programming language
    and added to Ethereum Blockchain healthcare systems. When a user connects to,
    transacts with, requests access to, views, stores, grants access to, or transfers
    any information through a healthcare platform, the predefined set of rules in
    a smart contract is automatically carried out with the users’ consent to verify
    the device identity and access controls [3]. The transaction will be broadcast
    to all users since Blockchain is a fully distributed peer-to-peer network that
    performs transactions without the involvement of a third party. Once the transaction
    is completed correctly, it cannot be changed because of Blockchain’s immutable
    characteristics. The consensus method employed for block formation, block validation,
    and transaction validation is another noteworthy feature of Blockchain technology.
    IoT infrastructure with Blockchain integration enables large-scale data processing,
    decentralized IoT systems, billions of IoT device connectivity, public device
    identity verification, and the removal of third-party verification [10]. Due to
    these technical advantages, Blockchain technology is being integrated and implemented
    by several IoT healthcare organizations [5]. Additionally, hospitals may open
    or close, merge with other healthcare facilities, or change their services or
    specialties, making it challenging to maintain an accurate and up-to-date list
    of all hospitals in a given location. Knowing every hospital in a city or country
    is difficult due to the large number of healthcare facilities and hospitals in
    any given area. Furthermore, hospitals may close, combine with other hospitals,
    or change specialties, making it difficult to maintain an accurate and up-to-date
    list of all hospitals in a given location. Detail information about the hospitals
    and their specifics must be provided when providing information about hospitals
    in large areas, such as a city or district. Geographical Information Systems (GIS)
    can facilitate storing, viewing, analyzing, and disseminating hospital data and
    maps, which are necessary to carry out this activity using scientific approaches
    in a more straightforward manner [11]. To provide healthcare services for the
    people of Bhubaneswar city of India, or for people who are new to the city and
    are less familiar with its local healthcare organizations, the researchers have
    developed an online geospatial service with Blockchain integration for healthcare
    systems. An analytical queuing strategy is implemented to give Critical patients
    more priority than normal patients to serve them in a priority manner. For overcoming
    the technical issues present in most of the existing healthcare systems, this
    proposed framework offers security, immutability, scalability, geospatial mapping,
    patient prioritization, and decentralization of privacy protection policies compared
    to previously proposed frameworks. Along with explaining the performance analysis
    of BCGeo, it also includes graphs illustrating the various outcomes of arithmetic
    operations, performance assessment, and experimental findings about the proposed
    architecture. A. Motivation Traditional centralized cloud-based architecture is
    now being used to store data from traditional healthcare systems, which increases
    security threats and necessitates trusting a single authority as medical records
    are still primarily immobile in these systems. Most researchers have suggested
    that Blockchain and the IoT are the key technologies for constructing an intelligent
    healthcare infrastructure. Data sharing, storage, access, collection, viewing,
    privacy, security, dependability, device management, processing, and interchange
    of healthcare data are the primary research areas that most researchers in the
    past have studied and proposed. To our knowledge, past research initiatives did
    not combine a geospatial-assisted analytical queueing strategy with Blockchain
    integration for access mechanisms based on the criticality of the patient. In
    this work, the researchers used a decentralized Blockchain network with an analytical
    queueing model approach to deliver healthcare services based on the patient’s
    criticality. This framework’s suggested inclusion of geospatial web service capabilities
    enables patients to monitor and find information about hospitals in Bhubaneswar
    city in India, where most areas are unfamiliar to the person new to this city.

    about technological challenges and advancements with smart healthcare systems.
    Most relevant research works have been chosen and presented in the healthcare
    domains. Table 1 summarizes, the objective of the research, the technological
    features addressed, and the availability of geospatial web service capabilities
    for previously done research studies in healthcare applications. TABLE 1 Applications
    and advancements of different Blockchain healthcare models Blockchain-based COVID-19
    medical record traceable and direct revocation with security and privacy mechanism
    was proposed by Tan et al. [12]. Authentication and access management mechanisms
    are implemented using encryption and decryption processes. Moreover, tracking
    and revoking malicious nodes have also been done here. Zhang et al. [13] have
    proposed a Blockchain architecture to address the security and trust challenges
    in networks, smart contracts, and data. A private Blockchain-based decentralized
    scheme was proposed by Liu et al. [14] to maintain security and privacy while
    sharing healthcare data. They have used OpenSSL libraries, and PBC to implement
    their proposed model. Biswas et al. [15] proposed a Blockchain-integrated IoT
    framework that restricts the transactions to directly entering into the global
    Blockchain by implementing local peer-to-peer networks. A secure and traceable
    Blockchain Interplanetary file system (IPFS) based healthcare framework was proposed
    by Sun et al. [16]. Attribute encryption and access control have also been implemented
    in this framework to retrieve healthcare data efficiently. An electronic health
    record (EHR) management framework with the integration of Blockchain and IPFS
    was proposed by Jayabalan et al. [17]. This decentralized framework is tamper-proof
    and secure. Access management is implemented to facilitate in-time data access
    by healthcare personnel and patients. Farnaghi et al. [7] have proposed a Blockchain-based
    public participatory GIS (PPGIS) application for the decision-making of government
    organizations in urban planning. Researchers have developed a decentralized application
    using Ethereum Blockchain. For tracing the mapped pollution and spatially identifying
    the intake source of real-time water pollution, Lin et al. [18] proposed an IoT
    and blockchain-based wireless sensor network and Geographic Information System
    tools. Alrebdi et al. [19] proposed a decentralized, secure, and efficient Blockchain-smart
    contract and interplanetary file system-based electronic medical record system
    for user verification, data storage, and search for a particular healthcare record.
    Azbeg et al. [20] proposed a secure, scalable, and efficient healthcare system
    BlockMedCare for remote monitoring of chronic disease patients. Ethereum Blockchain
    and smart contracts are used in this system to speed up the processing and storage.
    Blockchain hyperledger fabric-based framework was introduced by Sun et al. [21]
    for medical data storage and access control implementation. To reduce the overload
    in the Blockchain network, the IPFS is used for decentralized medical data storage.
    Mani et al. [22] proposed a decentralized Hyperledger fabric-based framework,
    namely PCHDM (patient-centric healthcare data management) for on-chain and off-chain
    storage of healthcare data which ensures data privacy, and scalability, and resolves
    the storage issues. A Blockchain-integrated three-tier network and IPFS-based
    framework have been proposed by Mehbodniya et al. [23] to ensure the security
    and privacy of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices connected to the
    framework. A decentralized peer-to-peer Blockchain and IPFS-based platform has
    been proposed by Kumar et al. [24] for image and video sharing. Blockchain and
    IPFS-based agricultural product traceability have been proposed by Zhang et al.
    [25] implemented an evaluation function for traceability of the quality of the
    product and addressed the massive data storage issues with IPFS storage. Kafhali
    et al. [26] proposed a mathematical and analytical model of queuing to analyze
    the effectiveness of a fog computing system to satisfy the quality of service
    (QoS) requirements for every offered IoT workload. Numerous research papers have
    been written on geospatial web services combined with Geographic Information Systems
    and web technology [27]. Users can take advantage of the geographical data, and
    computational resources available online through the utilization of geospatil
    Web services, which also enable users to automate the integration, processing,
    and analysis of geospatial data [28]. Additionally, it has suggested a serverless
    Cloud Geographic Information System technology, which has been subsequently used
    for the land valuation platform. On Amazon Web Services, a database known as Aurora
    Serverless PostgreSQL is developed to facilitate the storing, analyzing, and sharing
    of geospatial data [29]. Additionally, it built a web-based open-source geoinformation
    tool for estimating Flow Duration Curves (FDCs) in basins that have not been gauged.
    The FDC estimation was achieved using a regional statistical model employing multivariate
    regression to link basin topographic parameters, climatic characteristics, other
    environmental factors, and FDC features. [30]. New possibilities arise with the
    advent of geospatial web service technologies, which enable users to access massive
    amounts of Big Earth Data via the Internet and to manipulate these datasets on
    the server side [31]. SECTION III. Proposed Framework A. Attributes Used in Proposed
    Framework Researchers have proposed distributed, decentralized, and geospatial
    web feature services for Blockchain-integrated IoT-enabled smart healthcare systems
    depicted in Fig. 1. The attributes used in this framework are as follows: FIGURE
    1. BCGeo: Proposed Blockchain assisted geospatial web service framework. Show
    All Healthcare users: The user groups identified to link to this framework include
    doctors, insurance companies, pathologists, lab technicians, patients, nurses,
    and other healthcare users. Decentralized applications (Dapps): In this proposed
    framework, a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer network-operated decentralized
    application (Dapp) is created using Blockchain technology. Deploying the smart
    contract in this decentralized environment eliminates the need for third-party
    verification. All the users of this framework are connected via Dapps. Priority
    Queue: Based on the patient type and the level of healthcare service required,
    a priority queueing approach is employed in this framework to deliver healthcare
    service to the patients. The proposed system divides the priority into low for
    normal patients and high for critically ill patients. Smart contract: To automate
    the framework based on the preloaded rules and do away with the necessity for
    third-party verifications, a small piece of self-executable code written in the
    Solidity programming language is being deployed in the proposed Ethereum framework.
    Additionally, it demands the user’s device to run the terms and conditions outlined
    in advance. Gateways: Gateway enables the routing of healthcare data in the proposed
    Blockchain network and allows various user devices to interact with the framework.
    Access control: The scalability problems brought up when several devices are connected
    to the framework are dealt with here via access control. Additionally, critical
    patients receive higher priority than normal ones through the queueing approach.
    Healthcare Departments: The healthcare services offered to patients vary depending
    on the healthcare departments. Depending on the disease he or she may suffer,
    a patient might connect to a specific department. Block: All transactions carried
    out by healthcare users are added to an immutable, decentralized, distributed,
    and hash-linked ledger that is constantly growing. Proof of work (POW): This is
    a consensus mechanism used in this framework for block mining. In this healthcare
    system, miner nodes verify and validate transactions performed by healthcare users.
    Blockchain: The validated blocks are linked to each other through a hash value.
    As a result, a decentralized chain of blocks is produced. Every node on the Blockchain
    network has access to a transaction after it has been made, subject to user consent.
    Cloud storage: Large numbers of devices are connected to the healthcare framework
    as a result of the constant growth in healthcare users. Substantial volumes of
    data transfers and storage are needed to support large-scale devices. Cloud storage
    is used for big data storage for this framework. Geospatial web feature service:
    Through this service, patients who are new to Bhubaneswar or who are less familiar
    with the hospitals that are offering services for their sickness can locate them
    and receive immediate patient care, which could potentially save their lives in
    critical conditions. B. Framework Description The researchers have proposed a
    geospatial web service framework with Blockchain support to implement distributed
    and decentralized processing and storage of healthcare data in modern IoT healthcare
    systems. This architecture connects all its healthcare users via a public Blockchain
    network built on the Ethereum Blockchain platform. In this framework, minor nodes
    compete with one another to solve the mathematical puzzles for block formation,
    block validation, transaction verification, and validations. To track, locate,
    and reach patients to the closest hospital possible, researchers used geospatial
    web feature services. The first step is for all patients who require medical services
    to register with the framework using the decentralized application and the appropriate
    identity documentation. Once their credentials have been verified using the preloaded
    smart contract and their registration has been accepted, the patient is regarded
    as a genuine user who can connect to this framework through their credentials.
    An automated smart contract run during the login procedure compels the user to
    adhere to all predetermined norms and conditions and verifies the device’s trustworthiness
    and authenticity. Through the Dapps, all healthcare users, including doctors,
    nurses, lab technicians, insurance providers, pathologists, and other medical
    staff, are connected to healthcare organizations. When a patient needs medical
    care from a specific hospital, he should log in to the Blockchain network and
    connect to the doctor of that organization using the credentials he provided when
    registering in the Dapps. The doctor can then access the patient’s specific health
    information from the Blockchain network using the Identity he has provided. The
    doctor can offer medical treatments based on the patient’s current health status
    and the diagnosis report accessible through the Blockchain network. According
    to how severe their disease is, patients for this framework are divided into normal
    and critical patients, as shown in Fig. 1. In this architecture, novel priority
    queuing models, specifically high-priority and low-priority, are employed to serve
    patients based on the patient’s state of health. With Blockchain-enabled IoT healthcare
    systems, the queue implementation is intended to handle access management and
    scalability challenges while delivering real-time patient monitoring and patient
    care services. Once a patient is connected to the system, he or she can use the
    Dapp to search and locate the closest best healthcare professionals and departments
    for their specific ailment. High-priority patients are treated before low-priority
    patients. Depending on their chosen healthcare option, the patient will have access
    to the geospatial mapping service. The closest and most appropriate hospitals
    to the patient’s location are listed along with their map, address, travel time,
    traffic situation, and distance using the geospatial web feature service. The
    geospatial web feature Services map, which depicts all the information about the
    hospital in the Indian city of Bhubaneswar, is shown in Fig. 2. The users who
    will benefit the most from this geospatial web feature service to locate and access
    patient care services from a healthcare organization are those who are critically
    ill, new to the city, have limited knowledge about the healthcare providers, or
    patients who are unfamiliar with the city’s various locations and where time is
    crucial to saving a patient’s life. This framework can also help with remote patient
    locating, tracking, monitoring, and providing geographically aware patient care
    services. This will reduce the need for patients to move around physically, the
    time it takes to receive care, the hospital traffic, and patient travel expenses.
    Normal patients receive less attention under this framework because they can avail
    of either in-person or remote patient monitoring services. All transactions entered
    into a Blockchain network’s block are secure, transparent, immutable, interoperable,
    distributed, and trustworthy since patient health information is extremely sensitive.
    In their proposed framework, researchers have used cloud storage to accommodate
    large-scale device connections and the high volume of patient data gathering,
    processing, transacting, and storing in the healthcare industry. FIGURE 2. Geospatial
    web feature services for detailed information on the hospital in Bhubaneswar,
    India. Show All SECTION IV. System Model Patient queues are predominant in healthcare,
    and wait time is one criterion of the approach to care [45]. We exemplify queueing
    models as an analytical tool that has allowed health service providers to get
    insights when planning state-of-the-art service systems and handling existing
    ones. It helps us measure the suitable service capacity to satisfy the patient’s
    needs and balance system utilization and wait time [46]. We consider vital components
    impacting the patient’s wait time and cost: average patient need and service rate.
    Healthcare services are under immense pressure to render a better quality of attention
    to more patients while dealing with limited resources. We can improve the patient
    healthcare system by the following: To manage appointments, arrivals, and queues
    for the patient. To reduce the number of patients in the lobby or waiting room
    by implementing a perfect queueing system with counters. To enhance the patient
    experience and staff satisfaction in the healthcare system with limited funds
    and resources. To quantify the suitable service to meet the patient’s needs, balance
    the patient’s wait time and system utilization. SECTION Algorithm 1 Accessing

    a queueing network as a bunch of hospital healthcare settings for standard and
    critical patients, each consisting of multiple service counters, see Fig. 1 There
    are two types of arrivals: standard and critical patients. Assume a healthcare
    system where external patients arrivals to either admission or the emergency department.
    The admission counters have an official who processes patients to clinical wards.
    In the clinic, patients get consulting services from doctors. Usually, 25% of
    the patients going by the clinic must return for another checkup in 15 days. Around
    10% are admitted for treatment to the hospital; the rest may be discharged. In
    the emergency ward, around 50% of patients are admitted to the hospital, whereas
    after treatment, the rest go home. In the healthcare system, around 75% are given
    an appointment again for examination in 15 days. To ensure the stability of the
    queueing network, we must define the number of doctors and the number of hospital
    beds. Here, we consider a healthcare servicing framework that consists of n clinics
    indexed 1,2,…,n . The i th clinic may receive patients from external and inside
    the network. The patient from outside the network into clinic ℓ forms a Poisson
    process with the rate λ ℓ . After completion of patient processing at clinic i
    , the patient is routed to clinic j with probability r ij or exits the clinic
    with probability r i0 =1− ∑ j=1 n r ij . The matrix R=[ r ij ] n×n is called the
    routing matrix. It has a broad range of applications and is generally employed
    to evaluate the performance of various systems, see [47], [48], [49]. Let λ ℓ
    denote the arrival rate of patients at the ℓ th clinic. Some incoming patients
    are external, and some arrive from other clinics, including clinic i . Thus, λ
    ℓ is the total average number of patients arriving into (and leaving) node i per
    unit of time. On average, λ j patients leave clinic j per unit of time; of these,
    a fraction r ji go to clinic ℓ . Therefore, the rate of traffic from clinic j
    to clinic i is λ j r ji ,j=1,2,…,n . Therefore, λ i = λ i + ∑ j=1 n λ j r ji ,i=1,2,…,n.
    (1) View Source The Eq. (1) constitute a set of linear equations, from which we
    can find λ i . There are m ℓ identical doctors at clinic ℓ which follows an exponential
    distribution, the servicing rate is μ ℓ (k)={ k μ ℓ , m ℓ μ ℓ , k=1,2,…, m ℓ ,
    k= m ℓ +1, m ℓ +2,… View Source Now, it obtains the steady-state probability distribution
    of a hospital framework network. Let ( k 1 , k 2 ,…, k n ) denote the state of
    the healthcare framework in which there are k ℓ patients at clinic ℓ in a Jackson
    network of Markovian queues and let π( k 1 , k 2 ,…, k n ) be the steady-state
    probability that the state of the system is ( k 1 , k 2 ,…, k n ) . Assume that
    ρ ℓ = λ ℓ m ℓ μ ℓ <1,ℓ=1,2,…,n , that is, the load at clinic. Let π( k ℓ ) be
    the probability that there are k ℓ patients at clinic ℓ in an isolated M/M/ m
    ℓ queue. Here for each of the m ℓ clinics the arrival rate and processing rate
    are λ ℓ and μ ℓ , respectively. Then π ℓ (k) = π ℓ (0) λ k ℓ k! μ k ℓ ,k=0,1,…,
    m ℓ , = π ℓ (0) λ k ℓ m ℓ ! m k− m ℓ ℓ μ k ℓ ,k= m ℓ +1, m ℓ +2,…, (2) View Source
    Using normalization condition ∑ ∞ k=0 π ℓ (k)=1 and using (2), we obtain only
    unknown π ℓ (0) as π ℓ (0)= [ ∑ k=0 m ℓ −1 λ k ℓ k! μ k ℓ + k k ℓ ℓ ρ m ℓ ℓ m
    ℓ !(1− ρ ℓ ) ] −1 . (3) View Source Then from Jackson theorem, we have π ℓ ( k
    1 , k 2 ,…, k n )=π( k 1 )π( k 2 )…π( k n )= ∏ ℓ=1 n π ℓ ( k ℓ ). (4) View Source
    SECTION V. Performance Measures The various performance measures of the presented
    healthcare system can be given as follows: The average number of patients at clinic
    ℓ , L ℓ , is given by L ℓ = ρ ℓ 1− ρ ℓ ,ℓ=1,2,…,n. (5) View Source The total average
    number of patients in the healthcare system, L s , is the sum of the averages
    over all clinics: L s = ∑ ℓ=1 n L ℓ = ∑ ℓ=1 n ρ ℓ 1− ρ ℓ . (6) View Source Let
    W s be the expected sojourn/cycle time that a patient spends in the healthcare
    system, that is, the expected time interval between the arrival of a patient externally
    and its departure to the outside. Using Little’s law to the entire system and
    applying (6), we get, and from Little’s law, one can derive the average sojourn/cycle
    time in the healthcare system for each patient as: W s = L s ∑ n ℓ=1 λ ℓ (7) View
    Source Let W ℓ be the expected time a patient spends at clinic ℓ on each visit
    to that clinic. Using (5), we have W ℓ = 1 μ ℓ (1− ρ ℓ ) ,ℓ=1,2,…,n. (8) View
    Source Let us consider the average time, R ℓ , between the arrival of a patient
    at clinic ℓ and its consequent leaving from the healthcare system. It does not
    count whether the patient came to clinic ℓ from the outside or from another clinic
    because of the memoryless routing. The patient goes through clinic ℓ , which takes
    W ℓ on average. If it next goes to clinic j with probability r ℓj , its average
    unfinished sojourn time will be R j . Thus, by applying (8), we may express a
    set of linear equations R ℓ = W ℓ + ∑ j=1 n r ℓj R j (9) View Source Equation
    (9) finds out R ℓ uniquely. Every time a patient goes to clinic ℓ , it needs,
    on average, an amount of processing equal to 1/ μ ℓ . The total average processing
    time, T ℓ , that a patient needs from clinic ℓ throughout its stay in the healthcare
    system is therefore equal to T ℓ = ρ ℓ λ ,ℓ=1,2,…,n. (10) View Source The ρ ℓ
    can be constituted as the average amount of load intended to clinic ℓ that joins
    the healthcare system externally per unit of time. Correspondingly, the total
    average time, B ℓ , that a request passes at clinic ℓ during its life in the healthcare
    system may be found by using (10) as B ℓ = T ℓ 1− ρ ℓ ,ℓ=1,2,…,n. (11) View Source
    We minimize the average processing time of a request through the queueing network,
    with a given budget of K dollar as a constraint. Let us assume that the service
    rate μ i can be selected without obstruction except for the constraint ∑ n i=1
    μ i =K . Further, we assumed that the service times of a request at consecutive
    nodes are independent. The capacity allocation problem is given by MinimizeZ=
    ∑ ℓ=1 n ρ ℓ 1− ρ ℓ subject to  ∑ ℓ=1 n μ ℓ =K 0≤ μ ℓ ≤μ. (12) View Source We can
    solve the above optimization problem (12) using Langrange multiplier. SECTION
    VI. Numerical Examples We consider the healthcare system having four clinics,
    each with one doctor, which is depicted in Fig. 3. We find the performance measures
    of the healthcare system in each clinic as well as the total system. Also, we
    optimize the doctors’ processing rates μ ∗ i and relate them. Route matrixQ= ⎛
    ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ 0 0 0 0 0.25 0 0 0 0.75 0 0 0 0 0.2 0.6 0 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ , external patient
    arrival rates: λ={2,1,0.5,0.3} , processing rates: μ={16,17,18,19,20} and λ={4.785714,5.785714,3.392857,4.0714285}
    . FIGURE 3. Four-node healthcare queueing network system. Show All Here we compare
    the typical healthcare system with an optimized healthcare system where we optimize
    the service rates. In the first part of Table 3, the performance indices of the
    typical healthcare system are provided. One may observe from the table that the
    total average number of patients in the healthcare system and the expected sojourn/cycle
    time a patient spends in the healthcare system decrease as the number of clinics
    increases. We optimize the service rates using equation (12) where we use the
    bound of C=90 and achieve an optimal processing rate vector of μ ∗ ={8.925,8.425,8.925,8.725}
    . The second part of the table is given using optimized μ ∗ value. We observe
    a substantial enhancement in all the performance measures in the healthcare system
    with an optimized service rate. TABLE 2 Table of notations TABLE 3 Performance
    measures of five node system with multiple servers Here we study a simulation
    of the healthcare system with four doctors and an infinite waiting space system
    over time. We see how dynamic this process is, as exemplified in Fig. 4. The y
    -axis is the number of patients in the healthcare system, and the x -axis is time.
    In this sample path, λ=12,μ=3.5,t=400 periods. Thus, there is a significantly
    fluctuating variability of the number of patients within the healthcare system
    because of the high utilization ρ=0.857 . The process is indeed empty, but the
    periods are lengthy and full. That reflects the nature of a lineup of patients
    in the system. Fig. 5 depicts the impact of buffer size on overflow probability.
    The overflow probability decreases as the buffer size increases. With the increase
    in the number of clinics for fixed buffer size, the overflow probability decreases.
    FIGURE 4. Sample path when c=4 . Show All FIGURE 5. Buffer space versus overflow
    probability. Show All Table 4 illustrates performance indices of three clinics
    with multiple doctors, see Fig. 6. The several parameters are assumed as: Route

    μ 2 =10, μ 3 =3 . TABLE 4 Performance measures of the healthcare system with three
    clinics and multiple doctors FIGURE 6. Three-node healthcare system. Show All
    Here we consider the first clinic consists of one fixed doctor and various doctors
    in other clinics. Varying the number of doctors in Clinic 2, we note that the
    average wait time in the queue and the system decreases with the number of doctors.
    Fig. 7 presents the impact of several patients versus marginal probabilities for
    several clinics. Note that the marginal probabilities decrease with an increase
    in the number of patients; for many patients, the probabilities are almost negligible.
    The number of patients waiting times reduces with the increase of clinics. Fig.
    8 depicts the total average number of patients versus probability. As the number
    of patients increases, the probability increases and finally attains its minimum
    value. FIGURE 7. Number of patients versus marginal probabilities. Show All FIGURE

    This Section shows the proposed framework’s findings compared to existing frameworks
    to ensure the offered solution’s effectiveness, quality, and practicality in healthcare
    domains. All transactions made on a Blockchain ledger in healthcare systems are
    guaranteed to be irreversible, tamper-proof, and permanent by the immutability
    feature of Blockchain. The immutability attribute of Blockchain transactions enables
    them to be efficient, trustworthy, honest, and transparent. Scalable Blockchain
    networks for the healthcare sector can manage numerous device connections, massive
    data collections, increasing transactions, and processing without system failure.
    This proposed system, which combines geospatial mapping with Blockchain technology,
    has the potential to transform healthcare organizations by improving patient care,
    enabling more accurate and efficient data sharing, and enhancing care coordination.
    Geospatial mapping assists healthcare organizations in better identifying patient
    populations, identifying areas of need, and developing targeted therapies. It
    can improve patient outcomes by allowing healthcare professionals to access and
    share patient information more precisely, accurately, and quickly. Healthcare
    providers may ensure that all users have access to the same information by securely
    storing and sharing patient health records using Blockchain technology, regardless
    of where the patient is situated. This can assist in improving patient care coordination
    and reducing the risk of errors or omissions in patient care. The geospatial web
    service features in the healthcare industry can trace, track, and locate a patient’s
    present status and geographic location to provide healthcare services. It also
    makes it possible to precisely map the spatiotemporal location of medical facilities
    and find the accessibility of nearby hospitals. Blockchain ensures patient data’s
    confidentiality and integrity while giving patients more control over their data.
    Queuing prioritizes patients based on their importance or criticality. High-priority
    or urgent cases may be prioritized above patients with common illnesses. Prioritizing
    patients enables the network to process high-priority patients faster, increasing
    overall throughput and scalability. A queueing mechanism handles transactions
    more effectively, reducing processing time and enhancing the Blockchain’s overall
    throughput. This strategy also helps to reduce the overhead on specific network
    nodes, boosting scalability even more. A patient’s life may be saved through priority-based
    care since critically ill patients are given higher priority than others. The
    availability, auditability, stability, and prevention of system failure are all
    guaranteed by decentralization technology in healthcare systems. The assessment
    metric is based on the technological characteristics of immutability, scalability,
    geospatial mapping, patient priority, and decentralization of the proposed healthcare
    systems. Table 5 compares the proposed framework with some previously proposed
    healthcare system solutions. TABLE 5 Comparison of the proposed model with the
    current healthcare systems SECTION VIII. Conclusion In recent days, Blockchain-integrated
    IoT healthcare systems have automated the process of gathering, transacting, accessing,
    viewing, visualizing, verifying, updating, and storing healthcare data in a decentralized
    and distributed architecture. BCGeo, a Blockchain-enabled healthcare Internet
    of Things framework with geographic support has been proposed for healthcare organizations.
    This Blockchain-based Geospatial Web Services architecture enables enhanced data
    processing, visualizing, analyzing, storing, and transactional capabilities in
    addition to secure, private, reliable, immutable, and transparent management of
    confidential healthcare data. The information about the hospitals in the Indian
    city of Bhubaneswar is visualized on a map using the free and open-source QGIS
    cloud platform in this work. A novel queueing model is included in this proposed
    framework to address the access management and scalability challenges and deliver
    real-time patient care service. For prioritizing patient care service to critically
    ill patients, the proposed healthcare framework deploys a low-priority queue for
    regular patients and a high-priority queue for critically ill patients. In addition,
    it explains the performance analysis of BCGeo. It carries the performance measurement,
    experimental findings on the suggested architecture, and graphs displaying the
    various possible outputs of arithmetic simulations. Moreover, it brings the proposed
    architecture’s performance measurement and empirical findings. Future work on
    this framework aims to employ a more efficient queueing technique to quickly provide
    patients with the finest healthcare. Moreover, compared to previously existing
    healthcare models, our proposed framework efficiently provides immutability, scalability,
    geospatial mapping, patient prioritization, and decentralization of privacy preservation
    policies. It is also planned to use the techniques described in this research
    to analyze and implement them in other cutting-edge application areas, such as
    smart homes, smart cities, and intelligent wearable technology. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are considered to be among the most important
    scientific domains. Yet, the exploitation of WSNs suffers from the severe energy
    restrictions of their electronic components. For this reason there are numerous
    scientific methods that have been proposed aiming to achieve the extension of
    the lifetime of WSNs, either by energy saving or energy harvesting or through
    energy transfer. This study aims to analytically examine all of the existing hardware-based
    and algorithm-based mechanisms of this kind. The operating principles of 48 approaches
    are studied, their relative advantages and weaknesses are highlighted, open research
    issues are discussed, and resultant concluding remarks are drawn. Keywords: wireless

    Sensor (WSN) is a set of several (few tens or even thousands) spatially dispersed
    and wirelessly linked devices, called sensor nodes or simply nodes, along with
    at least one sink node that is called base station (BS) [1]. Nodes aim to not
    only monitor and collect information related to the ambient conditions that exist
    in a field of Network interest (FoI) but also process and finally exchange the
    relative data with other nodes and the BS [2]. The BS is the master node that
    controls the network that it belongs to, aggregates the data from the nodes and
    functions as the interconnection point between the network and its end user, given
    that it is also responsible for the data transmission [3]. The architecture of
    a typical WSN is illustrated in Figure 1. Figure 1. Typical architecture of a
    wireless sensor network. WSNs, due to the collaboration of their sensor nodes
    and their BSs, are able to monitor the current conditions at widespread FoIs.
    This makes WSNs be ideal to support a constantly increasing range of human activities
    [4]. Specifically, although the first WSNs ever used served only military purposes
    [5], nowadays WSNs are not only still used in the military sector [6] but they
    also are utilized in an extensive variety of civil applications. Environmental
    and habitat monitoring, energy management, object tracking, fire detection, machine
    failure diagnosis and various other industrial applications, health and biomedical
    applications, agriculture, livestock farming, inventory control, traffic control,
    smart homes, smart cities, surveillance and reconnaissance are some of the domains
    in which WSNs are utilized [7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17]. Yet, despite the evident
    advantages that WSNs offer, their use is obstructed due to the inborn constraints
    of wireless communications and the limited resources of the nodes. Actually, the
    main imperfection of WSNs is the particularly constrained energy adequacy of their
    nodes [18]. It is initiated by the fact that nodes are powered by batteries of
    restricted capacity that are difficult or even impossible to recharge or replace.
    Thus, the operational time of WSN nodes is limited and consequently the overall
    network lifespan is restricted. So, the attainment of energy conservation is an
    issue of critical importance for WSNs and that is why numerous research methods
    have been proposed by researchers that pursue energy sustainability [19,20,21,22,23,24,25].
    In this research work, as illustrated in Figure 2, energy sustainability methods
    are classified into two main categories, i.e., the hardware-based methods and
    the algorithm-based methods. Figure 2. Categorization of energy sustainability
    mechanisms. In accordance with the above, the remainder of this article identifies
    the causes of energy consumption in WSNs and analyzes all (i.e., 48) mechanisms
    that have been proposed in order to reduce this energy consumption and consequently
    extend the lifetime of nodes in WSNs. Specifically, in Section 2 the causes of
    energy consumption and waste in WSNs are analyzed. Section 3 describes the architecture
    of sensor nodes and analyzes the existing hardware-based mechanisms for energy
    sustainability in WSNs, via energy saving, energy harvesting, and wireless energy
    transfer. Section 4 describes the protocol stack of sensor nodes, presents the
    communication technologies used in WSNs and analyzes all algorithm-based mechanisms
    that have been proposed for energy sustainability in WSNs. In Section 5, the main
    findings of this survey along with open research issues are discussed. Finally,
    in Section 6, the corresponding concluding remarks that are extracted from this
    research work are resumed. 2. Consumption and Waste of Energy in WSNs As mentioned
    above, in most cases sensor nodes in WSNs have a limited lifetime because of their
    restricted energy residues. For this reason, the achievement of energy conservation
    during the obligatory tasks of nodes (i.e., sensing, receiving, transmitting,
    and processing) is necessitated. Even more so, the elimination of every cause
    of energy waste is imperative. Actually, the main causes of energy waste in WSNs
    are [20]: Idle listening, i.e., listening to a communication channel, which is
    idle, with the intention of receiving possible incoming messages; Overhearing,
    i.e., when a node takes delivery of packets that are intended to be received by
    other nodes; Packet collision, i.e., the conflict caused to the messages that
    arrive at a node simultaneously which necessitates the rejection of them and their
    retransmission; Interference, i.e., the signals intended to be wirelessly received
    by a node are modified in a disruptive way due to the addition of other unwanted
    signals; Control packet overhead, i.e., the overhead caused by the excessive use
    of packets that synchronize data transmission without having data themselves;
    Over-emitting, i.e., the case that a node transmits data packets while the corresponding
    receiver node is not available to receive them. 3. Hardware-Based Energy Sustainability
    in WSNs 3.1. The Architecture of Wireless Sensor Nodes Each sensor node of a WSN
    is a Micro Electromechanical system (MEMS) [1,26], which is composed of four main
    and two optional subsystems, as illustrated in Figure 3. The basic subsystems
    of a node are: Figure 3. Typical architecture of a wireless sensor node. The power
    unit, of which the battery is the main and most commonly used part. Solar panels
    could also be used as a secondary energy source to a node [3]; The sensing unit
    that contains one or more analog or digital sensors and an analog to digital converter
    (ADC); The central processing unit (CPU), which comprises a microprocessor or
    microcontroller, along with its memory and its main purpose is to aggregate, store
    and process the data recorded from sensors; The communication unit, which is responsible
    for the transmission of the produced data to other nodes or to the base station.
    The communication unit usually contains a wireless radiofrequency (RF) transceiver.
    Moreover, devices for the communication through optical, or infrared signals may
    be used. A sensor node may also contain, as optional subsystems, a position tracking
    unit, which monitors the current location of this node, and a mobility unit, which
    provides the node the ability to be transportable [2]. Summarily, the sensing
    unit of a sensor node is triggered by an occurring event in its adjacent environment.
    The ADC converts the signals to electric signals that are handled by the processing
    unit. Once the processing procedure is completed, the produced data can be wirelessly
    transmitted to neighboring nodes or/and the BS. 3.2. Hardware-Based Methods for
    Energy Sustainability As illustrated in Figure 4, Hardware-based approaches for
    energy sustainability focus on the selection of the optimum hardware components
    that should be embedded in a sensor node, the management of their operation, and
    the use of energy harvesting and transference methods [19,20,21,22,23,24,25].
    Figure 4. Categorization of hardware-based methods for energy sustainability in
    WSNs. 3.2.1. Energy Saving Methods Applied in Submodules When referring to the
    main submodules of nodes (i.e., sensors, processors and transceivers) the utilization
    of low-power MEMS is necessitated in order to achieve energy saving [1,2,3,26].
    Moreover, the power of a sensor node can be managed by hardware scaling methods,
    which are used to handle the settings and the configuration of the hardware in
    nodes’ submodules. When engaging with such methods, the voltage, the frequency,
    and the rate can be adjusted according to the application’s requirements to limit
    energy consumption. Furthermore, methods such as system power optimization, aim
    at putting the node in sleep mode while not in operation in order to avoid energy
    depletion. Actually, several methods may be applied in each one of the submodules
    of nodes: While designing the Sensing Unit, the type of the application WSN is
    intended to be used in, needs to be considered in order to choose the appropriate
    sensors and converters [21,24]. ○ The selection of low power sensor units contributes
    to the energy conservation of the overall sensor node; ○ The ability to promptly
    control the operations of sensors (e.g., turning on and off), as well as its quick
    response time to irritations and its low duty cycle can lead to energy saving;
    ○ Additionally, instead of active sensors, passive sensors may be used. Such devices
    do not contain any piece of active circuits. For this reason, they use not exterior
    energy supplies. Actually, they are not powered at all. Instead, they receive
    incoming signals that they are reflected backwards along with the sensed information
    [27]. The design of the central Processing Unit is related to the choice of the
    optimum microprocessors and microcontrollers (MCUs) [19,21]. ○ Low-power processors
    offer low frequency clock choices, consume lower currents and are able to operate
    using lower voltages. In addition, it is critical to avoid implementing a huge
    number of features and peripherals, since the greater the amount is, the higher
    the power consumption becomes; ○ Microprocessors, mostly support different modes
    of operation, such as, active, idle and sleep mode for clearer power management
    objectives; ○ Furthermore, dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) method frequently applies
    in processors during their operation in active status in order to lessen the energy
    consumption levels [28,29]. Usually, microprocessors do not operate continually
    at their highest computational power, due to the fact that the work load of each
    task varies. Thus, the use of DVS method provides energy efficiency to sensor
    nodes by adjusting both the voltage of the processor and operating frequency dynamically
    according to the demands of the momentary processing tasks. The selection of appropriate
    transceivers to be integrated in the communication unit of the sensor nodes is
    extremely helpful in order to achieve energy conservation. ○ The use of low power
    transceivers is extremely helpful in order to reduce energy consumption [19];
    ○ Putting the transceiver in sleep mode while there are no communication needs,
    or using Adaptive Transmission Power Control can also save energy; ○ The use of
    Cognitive Radio (CR), i.e., an intelligent radio that enables the dynamic selection
    of the most suitable radio channel can lead to a network energy conservation [21].
    This selection depends on the transmit power, the data rate, the duty cycle, and
    the modulation required by the existing conditions; ○ In the so-called Adaptive
    Transmission Power Control method, the power required for data transmission is
    estimated based on the distances among nodes [19]. Additionally, the power levels
    of the transmitter are adjusted according to the needs of each application, in
    order to limit the energy consumption [24]; ○ In addition, directional antennas
    may be used. Such antennas are able to both send and receive signals in one direction.
    Subsequently, they consume lower amounts of power comparatively to omnidirectional
    antennas that transmit towards many and probably undesired directions and consequently
    cause higher energy consumption [21]; ○ Moreover, energy conservation depends
    on the way the nodes are deployed, the distance between them and the power needed
    for data transmission. In fact, in networks with dense deployment, nodes can communicate
    with nearby allocated nodes by using small communication links. This way, the
    transferred data reach their final destination by exploiting multi-hop paths,
    which results in the consumption of low power levels of each node. Contrariwise,
    in networks with sparse deployment in which single-hop communication applies,
    the transmission power and consequently the overall energy dissipation is greater
    [21]. Regarding the power supply unit of sensor nodes, small batteries with restricted
    capacity [22] are typically used as power sources. The amount of the stored energy
    while a battery is fully charged is characterized as its capacity. There are different
    types of batteries used in WSNs, and some of the most commonly used are the Alkaline,
    the Lithium-Ion (Li-ion) and the Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries. Of course,
    all types of batteries have an extremely limited lifetime. For this reason, the
    use of rechargeable batteries or supercapacitors is a better alternative. ○ In
    WSNs where the recharge of the batteries of the nodes is feasible, the usage of
    rechargeable batteries can considerably prolong the operational lifespan of the
    nodes and the overall network. Additionally, due to their high energy density,
    rechargeable batteries are suitable for WSNs utilizing energy harvesting implementations.
    Specifically, the density of NiMH batteries is 60–80 Wh/kg and that of lithium
    batteries is 120–140 Wh/kg, while their lifetime varies between 300–500 and 500–1000
    recharge cycles, respectively [19]. In the cases where battery recharge is difficult
    to perform, techniques that aim at either estimating [30] or prolonging [31] the
    remaining battery lifetime may be used; ○ Supercapacitors are capacitors having
    higher capacitance with lower voltage limits when compared to typical capacitors.
    They have grown into practical alternatives of power sources in WSNs nodes due
    to their energy density levels that range between 1–10 Wh/kg, and their smaller
    size in comparison with batteries. Thus, an even long-lasting lifespan of the
    sensor nodes could be achieved by replacing the non-rechargeable batteries of
    sensor nodes used in harvesting systems with supercapacitors as means of energy
    storage [19]. 3.2.2. Energy Harvesting Generally, energy harvesting is the process
    by which energy is captured and stored in order to empower small electronic devices.
    In WSNs, energy harvesting is achieved using energy scavenging systems that can
    be attached in the sensor nodes [32,33]. Power management modules (PMM) are usually
    integrated in these energy harvesting systems in order to increase the harvested
    power level and to restrict the energy mismatches between the harvester and the
    node. Typically, the harvesting process entails an energy source, a harvester
    or harvesting system, and standalone nodes or nodes with embedded energy storage
    devices [19,34]. The overall energy harvesting process is illustrated in Figure
    5. Figure 5. Overview of energy harvesting process. Specifically, energy harvesting
    can be performed by taking advantage of either ambient or external sources. Ambient
    sources of energy are almost permanently available in the surrounding environment
    of the nodes, while external sources of energy are especially set up for energy
    scavenging purposes [35,36]. According to the specific type of the physical quantity
    that is used, energy harvesting via ambient sources can be further classified
    as: RF-based, light-based, thermal-based, flow-based, and biomass-based [33,34].
    ○ RF-based energy harvesting makes use of radio frequency (RF) waves that may
    derive from wirelessly emitted signals coming from the BS, television, radio,
    Wi-Fi, or mobile devices. Such RF waves are initially captured by the nodes via
    either the receiver that they use for their wireless communication or another
    radio antenna that is dedicated only for energy scavenging. Next, the RF waves
    captured are converted into DC electricity [35,37]. ○ In case there is the ability
    to capture light energy from either sunlight, or indoors light, light sensitive
    devices may be used. Specifically, photovoltaic (PV) cells may be incorporated
    into the sensor nodes in order to capture and absorb photons that are emitted
    by light. Actually, PV cells contain semiconducting materials, such as silicon,
    which are able to convert the energy of light that is captured into a flow of
    electrons [38,39]; ○ Thermal-based energy harvesting is based on the generation
    of energy due to the existence of either heat or variations in temperature. The
    conversion of thermal energy to electric energy is achieved via either pyroelectric
    transducers or Thermo Electric Generators (TEGs). The former produce electricity
    from charge changes that are created on the surface of pyroelectric crystals due
    to temperature fluctuations, while TEGs take advantage of either Seebeck, or Joule,
    or Peltier, or Thomson effects [33,34,36]; ○ Flow-based energy harvesting uses
    the transformation of the energy produced by wind and water into electric energy.
    Specifically, the energy harvesting via wind in WSNs is based on the use of propellers,
    triboelectric, and piezoelectric devices of small dimensions for the exploitation
    of rotations, and the vibrations caused by the flow of wind. The existence of
    moving or falling water near by the nodes is very useful. Specifically, small
    sized hydrogenerators, which convert mechanical energy created by water movement
    into electricity, are used. Additionally, the use of seawater batteries, consisting
    of electrodes, is another alternative for WSNs located in sea [33]; ○ Biomass-based
    energy harvesting is performed by piezoelectric and triboelectric nanogenerators
    that scavenge energy from decomposable wastage, organic constituents, chemical
    substances, human urine, and other types of biological material. In this way,
    WSNs can be powered in environmental, biomedical, and various other applications
    [33,35]. According to the specific type of the quantity that it is used, energy
    harvesting via external sources of energy can be further classified as: mechanical-based
    and human-based. ○ Mechanical-based energy harvesting is achieved by using the
    so called Mechanical-to-Electrical Energy Generators (MEEGs). Such devices include
    piezoelectric, electromagnetic, or electrostatic mechanisms in order to scavenge
    energy created by vibrations, stress–strain and pressure [33,36]; ○ Human-based
    energy harvesting is performed in Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) in which
    nodes are either deployed on human bodies or implanted in human bodies. In such
    networks of this type, human-based energy harvesting is ideal for energy supply.
    It refers to the scavenging of the energy created during various activities or
    processes of human body, such as walking, finger movements, blood flow, and body
    heat. Electroactive materials, miniscule thermoelectric, piezoelectric, or triboelectric
    generators, and tiny rotary devices may be used for this purpose [34,39,40]. 3.2.3.
    Wireless Energy Transfer Wireless energy transfer (WET) is another method used
    to increase energy residues of the nodes in WSNs. Actually, this method, is described
    as the ability of wirelessly transferring electrical energy among nodes by using
    appropriate hardware components [19]. When exploiting this method, energy may
    be transferred from the segments of the network with higher energy levels to segments
    having lower amounts of energy residues so as to balance the energy levels of
    the network [41]. Power transfer in a WSN can be accomplished using either stationary
    sources or mobile chargers. Energy is provided to the nodes via charging vehicles
    and robots, or energy transmitters. Furthermore, sensor nodes are capable of transferring
    energy to their neighboring nodes [42]. Energy wireless transfer can be achieved
    in three ways: Inductive coupling: energy can be wirelessly transferred from a
    primary to a secondary coil that is placed in close distance. The amount of generated
    energy is proportional to the size of the coil. This method is simple and safe
    to apply [19]; Magnetic resonant coupling: power is transferred from a main coil
    (source) to a secondary (receiver). This can be accomplished through the utilization
    of resonant coils that have the same resonant frequency and are either loosely
    or strongly coupled [42]. Compared to inductive coupling, this method provides
    the power transfer over longer distances, and it is not a radiative method. So,
    it causes almost no harm to humans and does not have need of line of sight; Electromagnetic
    (EM) radiation: a source device transmits energy via electromagnetic waves through
    its antenna to another device’s receiving antenna. There are two types of electromagnetic
    radiation: omnidirectional and unidirectional. By using EM, energy can be transmitted
    over long distances [43]. 4. Algorithm-Based Energy Sustainability in WSNs Energy
    sustainability in WSNs can also be achieved by exploiting algorithm-based methods
    that are analyzed later on in this section. In order to support their comprehension,
    the theoretical background that concerns first the protocol stack of sensor nodes
    and base stations and next the communication technologies used in WSNs is examined.
    4.1. Protocol Stack of Sensor Nodes and BSs The operation of both every sensor
    node and the base station is managed by the so called protocol stack that, as
    illustrated in Figure 6, consists of five layers, i.e.: the application layer,
    the transport layer, the network layer, the data link layer, and the physical
    layer [1,3,44]. Figure 6. Protocol stack of a wireless node. Each one of these
    layers is responsible for definite tasks [1]. Specifically: Application layer
    establishes the interface between the end user and the application. According
    to the type of the application and its specific characteristics, this layer is
    able to modify its content using the most suited algorithm; Transport layer ensures
    the preservation of the data flow; Network layer is responsible for the routing
    of the transferred data from the transport layer to their destination; Data Link
    layer is responsible for multiplexing of data streams, error control, medium access
    control (MAC) and detection of data frames. In this particular layer, point-to-point,
    as well as point-to-multipoint connections within a network, become dependable;
    Physical layer is responsible for the selection of the communication frequency,
    the generation of the carrier frequency, the signal detection, the signal modulation,
    and the data encryption. In addition, the appropriate operation of WSNs depends
    on five management planes that namely are: power, mobility, task, QoS (Quality
    of Service), and security plane [44]. Specifically: The power plane preserves
    energy by managing the way power is consumed; The mobility plane ensures the retainment
    of data routes by monitoring and recording the nodes’ movement; Sensing tasks
    in a specific area of the network are scheduled and assigned by the task management
    plane to only some of the nodes, enabling the rest of them to perform tasks, such
    as routing and data aggregation; Fault tolerance, error control and operation’s
    optimization are handled by the QoS management plane, in accordance with specific
    QoS metrics; The monitoring, management and the control of network’s security
    is regulated by the security plane. 4.2. Communication Technologies Used in WSNs
    Modern scientific and technological progress enabled the development of advanced
    standards and technologies for wireless communications that aim to empower the
    exploitation of WSNs and Internet of Things (IoT) and support corresponding applications.
    Actually, there is not a specific technology developed that is able to be efficient
    when used in all kinds of wireless communications. Instead, there are numerous
    technologies with various characteristics that have been proposed. Therefore,
    it is very important to select the appropriate technology in order to suit best
    the requirements of particular types of applications [45]. For instance, the transmission
    range is a metric used in order to categorize such technologies as either short-range
    (with coverage ≤ 10 m), medium-range (with coverage 10–100 m), or long-range (with
    coverage ≥ 100 m). Bluetooth (in its classic version) and Radio Frequency Identification
    (RFID) are probably the most widely used examples of the first of these categories
    [46]. Likewise, Ultra-Wideband (UWB), Thread, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, along with two newer
    versions of Bluetooth, i.e., Bluetooth Smart (which is known also as Bluetooth
    Low Energy-BLE), and Bluetooth Long Range, are characteristic examples of are
    medium-distance wireless communication technologies [47]. Likewise, LTE-M, LoRa,
    NB-IoT and Sigfox are representative paradigms of LPWA (Low Power Wide Area) technologies,
    which is an emerging family of long-range wireless communication technologies
    [48,49,50]. In Table 1, some of the most important communications technologies
    that have been proposed for use in WSNs are enlisted along with some of their
    technical characteristics. Table 1. The most popular communication technologies
    used in WSNs. 4.3. Algorithm-Based Methods for Energy Sustainability in WSNs Energy
    sustainability of WSNs may be accomplished by using appropriate algorithm approaches
    depending on the type of the application. As illustrated in Figure 7, algorithm-based
    mechanisms may be classified into three main categories, i.e., data driven, duty
    cycling, and energy efficient routing, along with various subcategories [20,21,23,51].
    They are all described in what follows in the rest of this section. Figure 7.
    Categorization of algorithm-based energy-saving mechanisms in WSNs. 4.3.1. Data
    Driven Methods Data driven approaches aim to limit the amount of sampled data,
    while preserving the accuracy within acceptable limits, depending on the requirements
    of each application [52]. These approaches are distinguished into two types, data
    reduction and data acquisition approaches, and they are focused on the optimal
    management of the sensed data. Data reduction aims to minimize the amount of the
    data that need to be sensed and transmitted to the sink and consequently limit
    the number of transmissions required. This can happen by reducing the sampling
    frequency of the sensor nodes in order to avoid the creation of redundant samples,
    or by reducing the mandatory sensing tasks [21]. The methods used for data reduction
    are: ○ Data compression: by compressing the sensed data, the size of the aggregated
    data is reduced prior to their transmission to the BS. So, both the size of the
    transmitted packets and the transmission time are reduced and consequently energy
    is saved [21]; ○ In-Network processing: is typically performed by intermediate
    nodes located among the data sources and the BS. Specifically, nodes along with
    executing their sensing tasks, they can also use their microprocessors in order
    to process the information data that they have gathered and then transmit only
    the really essential data packets to the BS. So, the in-network processing of
    the sensed data reduces the number of the data transmissions performed and consequently
    saves great amounts of energy [53]; ○ Data prediction: prediction models are created
    in order to give answers to the queries generated by the BS. These answers can
    be either prediction values that are associated with statistical or empirical
    probabilities, or future metrics that are estimated-based on the prediction model.
    Perpetual monitoring of a FoI, implies frequent alterations of the measured values.
    In data prediction approaches, the sensor nodes gather sample data within predefined
    periods of time and compare the actual data with the prediction values. Then,
    they transmit their data in case a deviation is noticed, thus decreasing the number
    of the unnecessary transmissions and subsequently the corresponding expenditure
    [23,54]. Data acquisition approaches intend to restrict the energy that is consumed
    during nodes’ sensing tasks by using appropriate acquisition methods. Sensing
    is a power consuming process since power hungry sensors or A/D converters are
    exploited in many applications [55]. The data acquisition methods are: ○ In Adaptive
    sampling, in contrast with the traditional sampling methods where the rate is
    predefined, the number of samples captured by the nodes is adjusted-based on each
    application’s needs. In this way, the energy dissipation is limited, and the battery
    life cycle of nodes is prolonged [56]; ○ Hierarchical sampling is used in networks
    that are made of nodes that contain sensors of various types. Since every sensor
    is defined by distinctive characteristics, such as accuracy, resolution, and power
    consumption; this method dynamically decides which category of sensors to trigger.
    Typically, simple sensors are more energy efficient than advanced sensor nodes,
    but they lag behind in terms of their characteristics. Oppositely, sensors with
    a more complex design and way of operation, provide more precise information of
    the sensed data. Because of that, in hierarchical sampling approaches, low-power
    sensor nodes are used in order to monitor data regarding the FoI. Once an event
    is detected or a more thorough evaluation is required, advanced sensors take charge
    of the sensing process [57]; ○ Model-based active sampling: in these methods,
    mathematical models are implemented, in order to limit the sampling rate and preserve
    the nodes energy levels. Specifically, these models use the sampled data and aim
    to predict the corresponding subsequent values within a confidence level, reducing
    the frequency of the sampling. In this category, each node locally computes a
    model-based on the data trend and creates the information that will be sent to
    the BS, instead of transmitting a number of raw samples to the BS. When there
    is no remarkable deviation between the sensed data and the model prediction, nodes
    do not have to communicate with the sink. When the sensed data differ from the
    model, nodes must update their model and accordingly report to the BS. Such models
    can be statistical, machine-learning, probabilistic etc. [37,58]. 4.3.2. Duty
    Cycling Energy saving in a WSN can be accomplished through managing the activity
    status of the communication module of the nodes. Specifically, the transceiver
    of the node should be powered off when not receiving or transmitting data, and
    powered on once there are available data to be handled by the radio submodule.
    The process of switching the activity status of the transceiver among various
    modes (i.e., transmission—Tx, reception—Rx, idle, and sleep) depending on the
    current network requirements is known as duty cycling [59]. It is implemented
    by using appropriate wake-up oscillators that perform clock generation [60,61]
    and wake-up receivers that perform the idle listening while keeping the main radio
    completely off [62,63,64]. Duty cycling schemes are categorized into three main
    classes: Topology control, sleep/wake-up mechanisms, and MAC protocol. Duty cycling
    approaches are implemented Topology control protocols correlate with the redundancy
    of network. In some applications, nodes are randomly deployed, and additional
    nodes are used to confront likely to occur node failures. These protocols intend
    to dynamically adapt the network’s Topology to each application’s needs and seek
    for the minimum number of nodes that ensures the connectivity of the network by
    utilizing redundant nodes [19]. The nodes that have no crucial role in ensuring
    the coverage and the connectivity requirements, can temporarily fall into sleep
    mode in order to preserve their energy levels, and wake up once needed. Topology
    control protocols are distinguished in location driven and connectivity driven
    [23]. ○ Location driven protocols determine the activity status of a node, i.e.,
    whether and when this node should be activated or deactivated (sleep mode), by
    taking into consideration the exact location of this node and all of the rest
    network nodes (which is known); ○ Connectivity driven protocols ensure the preservation
    of connectivity by adaptively managing the activation or deactivation of the network
    nodes. Specifically, only the sensor nodes that are required in order to maintain
    the network connectivity, remain active while all of the rest network nodes remain
    in sleep mode, thus saving energy. Sleep/Wake-up schemes aim to save energy reserves
    by lessening the periods that the radio submodule of nodes remains inactive, since
    even when inactive they still consume energy. There are three types of such protocols,
    which are differentiated regarding transmission and reception patterns. They are:
    on-demand, scheduled rendezvous and asynchronous [23]. ○ In On-Demand mechanisms
    nodes should be awake only when it is necessary to communicate with other nodes.
    Informing a sleeping node that an adjacent one is trying to reach it so as to
    initiate communication, can be achieved by utilizing multiple radios with different
    operational characteristics (i.e., rate and power). On-demand mechanisms, are
    ideal for applications that are defined by a low duty-cycle, such as the detection
    of a special event (i.e., fire), since, in such cases the sensor nodes monitor
    the environment and wake up as soon as they detect an event. So, nodes remain
    active only when needed [19]. Yet, utilizing on-demand mechanisms, usually requires
    the presence of two different channels, one that is used for the normal data communication
    and one that is responsible for waking up the nodes when required [23]; ○ Scheduled
    rendezvous methods determine a wake-up schedule that is the same for all the nodes
    of a WSN. Nodes simultaneously wake up and once they are awake, they remain so
    for a definite period of time and go back to sleep all together until their next
    rendezvous. In order to ensure simultaneous wake-up, nodes must be synchronized.
    Additionally, to maintain the same wake-up schedule, nodes use deterministic,
    random or specific wakeup patterns [20]; ○ In asynchronous duty cycling mechanisms,
    each node selects when to either wake up or sleep, regardless of the activity
    status of its neighbors. To do this, the existence of overlapping periods between
    the wake-up periods of the nodes is compulsory. In order to discover the transmission
    of asynchronous senders, the sender transmits either a stream of periodic discovery
    messages or a single long discovery message. In each case, the duration of listening
    time has to be adequately adapted to transmission time [20,23]. Medium Access
    Control—MAC layer is a sublayer within the Data Link layer that constitutes the
    link between the Physical and the Network layer and is responsible for the data
    transmission between the nodes [65,66]. To communicate with each other, sensor
    nodes utilize a shared medium. In the case of WSNs, the medium is the radio channel
    [67,68]. The decision regarding the competing nodes that will eventually access
    the shared medium is handled by MAC protocols that also focus on how to avoid
    collision during the transmission [69,70]. In WSNs, designing energy efficient
    MAC protocols is a challenging task and constitutes one of the major characteristics
    that defines whether the protocol is well designed or not [71,72]. MAC protocols
    are classified in three main categories: scheduled, contention-based and hybrid
    [67]. ○ In scheduled MAC protocols, nodes can access the shared medium channel
    utilizing a source which depends on the used protocol. There are three basic types
    of scheduled MAC protocols: TDMA, FDMA and CDMA. In TDMA—Time Division Multiple
    Access protocols, time splits into timeframes and each of them is composed by
    a specific number of equally sized slots, called time slots. One or more time
    slots of a timeframe are given to each node allowing it to transmit or receive
    data only through them. Upon agreement between the nodes and-based on the schedules
    of their adjacent ones, which are handled by the BS, the nodes select their individual
    time slots on which data can be transmitted or received. Thus, a node can remain
    in sleep mode and activate its transceiver only when its time slot is reached,
    resulting in energy saving [23]. Regarding FDMA—Frequency Division Multiple Access
    and CDMA—Code Division Multiple Access MAC protocols, the medium can be accessed
    using a frequency band or a specific code, respectively. TDMA-based are the mainly
    used MAC protocols in WSNs, since the implementation of FDMA requires nodes that
    are equipped with high-priced transceivers, and CDMA demands higher levels of
    computational power that leads to energy depletion [68]. ○ The main objective
    of the contention-based MAC protocols is the channel collision avoidance that
    influences the wake-up/sleep time of the nodes. Actually, it is very often for
    the nodes of a WSN to have to wait for a non-specific period of time in order
    to access the medium, due to heavy traffic and collision in it. This happens because
    nodes try to send their packets though the medium but with no success since it
    is busy, and thus they have to wait until the load in it is decreased. The nodes
    resend their data and in case the load remains the same, they will have to wait
    to resend them. This implies longer periods of nodes’ inactivity, leading to the
    exhaustion of the batteries. Collision avoidance can be achieved utilizing an
    algorithm called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance—CSMA/CA
    [68]. Several protocols have been developed allowing nodes to enter sleep state
    and wake up at certain periods of time in order to check the availability of the
    channel, so as to send their data whenever possible and prevent energy waste;
    ○ Hybrid protocols combine features and methods used by both scheduled and contention-based
    MAC protocols, in a way that improves the nodes’ performance in cases of increased
    traffic load [67,68]. 4.3.3. Energy Efficient Routing By default, the transmission
    and routing of data in WSNs consume great amounts of the energy that sensor nodes
    retain [73]. Therefore, in order to preserve the lifetime of nodes and consequently
    of WSNs, it is critical to implement routing protocols that are energy efficient.
    The energy efficient routing protocols are generally classified, in terms of their
    organizational or functioning characteristics, into four main categories that
    namely are: Communication Model, Network Structure, Topology, and Reliable Routing
    [51,74]. The protocols belonging to the Communication Model category typically
    can deliver more data for a certain amount of energy. Nevertheless, the delivery
    of data is not assured. They are classified as Query-based, Coherent/Non-Coherent,
    and Negotiation based. ○ Query-based protocols use enquiries to support the transfer
    of data from nodes that own information to nodes that request specific pieces
    of this information. Protocols of this type enable both multiple path routing
    and dynamic network topologies [51]; ○ Coherent protocols perform minimum processing
    of the sensed data and then they send these data to other nodes, called aggregators,
    which further process them. In Non-Coherent routing protocols, nodes process sensed
    data locally before they transmit them [74]; ○ Negotiation-based protocols use
    meta-data negotiation patterns in order to reduce the quantity of redundant data
    at destination network nodes. In this way, energy efficiency is achieved. Energy
    efficient routing protocols of Network Structure category are classified as either
    Flat or Hierarchical. ○ In Flat protocols there is not any hierarchy adopted and
    every sensor node has the same role with all of the rest network nodes. Protocols
    of this kind perform well in networks constituted from a small quantity of sensor
    nodes [51]; ○ In Hierarchical protocols, the role of each one of all network nodes
    depends on the position that it holds within the overall hierarchical structure
    of the sensor network [75]. In this way, data aggregation is enabled, and great
    scalability is achieved. Additionally, load balancing is achieved [76]. Energy
    efficient routing protocols belonging to the Topology category use position related
    information in order to route data. They are further classified into three subcategories,
    namely: Location-based, Mobile Sink-based, and Mobile Agents-based. ○ In Location-based
    protocols, all nodes know not only their own location but also the positions of
    both their neighboring nodes and the destination nodes during data routing. Consequently,
    the most energy efficient routing paths are followed [74]; ○ Mobile agents-based
    routing protocols presume that a movable entity collects the sensed data from
    the individual network nodes in order to convey these data to the BS. The arrival
    of mobile agents near the network nodes that sense data reduces the energy expenditure
    for data transmission of these sensor nodes. Additionally, the traffic load in
    the entire network is reduced [51]; ○ Mobile sink-based protocols, suppose the
    existence of one or more sinks (i.e., base stations) that move around the FoI
    in order to collect data sensed by the network nodes. In this way, the energy
    consumed by the network nodes in order to transmit data is considerably reduced
    [51]. Reliable Routing protocols pursue the attainment of increased trustworthiness
    in data routing either by satisfying specific QoS metrics or by using a number
    of alternative paths in order to route data. They are categorized into two corresponding
    subcategories, i.e., QoS-based protocols and Multipath-based protocols depending
    on whether they chase QoS metrics or implement data routing via multiple paths.
    ○ QoS-based protocols consider not only energy consumption, but also other metrics
    such as end to end delay and quality characteristics of the data transmitted.
    Protocols of this kind achieve routing with enhanced fidelity [74]; ○ Multipath-based
    protocols route data from nodes to sinks via various paths, in order to perform
    load balancing, overcome node failures and congested paths, and decrease end-to-end
    delay [51]. 5. Discussion In the previous sections the various hardware-based
    and algorithm-based methods that have been proposed in order to support the energy
    sustainability of Wireless Sensor Networks were analytically presented. Despite
    the benefits that these methods provide, there are certain weaknesses, disadvantages
    and problems that are incorporated into these mechanisms too, which obstruct their
    successful deployment and thus pose corresponding challenges and trigger issues
    of future research. 5.1. Challenges and Open Research Issues in Hardware-Based
    Methods Regarding the submodules of sensor nodes, as aforementioned, the use of
    low-power electronic components is necessitated [19,21,24]. However, the components
    having the highest energy efficiency do not necessarily achieve the best performance
    standards. That is why the specifications and selection of the hardware components
    should be meticulously studied before being adjusted to the sensor nodes. In addition,
    Power Optimization through the appropriate switch among active, idle, and sleep
    modes of operation cannot be used in applications in which continuous operation
    of nodes is necessitated [19,23]. Moreover, Passive Sensors cannot be used in
    all types of applications [27]. The method of Dynamic Voltage Scaling that is
    applied in the processing unit of nodes, is effective only when sensing requests
    are less frequent [28,29]. The usage of Cognitive Radio method in order to achieve
    the dynamic selection of the most suitable radio channel, inevitably requires
    the existence of multiple radio channels, thus increasing complexity and cost
    [21]. The increase of latency and the modification of routing paths are the main
    weaknesses of Adaptive Power Transmission [19,24]. In many cases, the use of Directional
    Antennas is not feasible if localization methods are not applied in order to assist
    orientation procedures [21]. Likewise, the utilization of Short Communication
    Links requires the existence of many adjacently positioned nodes. For this reason,
    this methodology is not applicable in WSNs having sparse distribution of nodes
    [21]. Regarding Rechargeable Batteries, the recharge of all batteries of the nodes
    in a network may be a complicated or even impossible task to perform, depending
    on the deployment of the nodes. Additionally, besides their limited capacity,
    rechargeable batteries not only are unable to remain fully charged for long time
    but they also are characterized by a limited number of recharge cycles [19,22].Of
    course, modern 3D-printed Lithium-Ion microbatteries have enhanced capabilities.
    Yet, further research regarding alternative materials, manufacture techniques
    and designs of microbatteries is needed [77,78,79,80,81]. Supercapacitors have
    certain advantages over batteries. Yet, not only they are costly, but they also
    have low energy density and high rate of self-discharge [82,83,84,85]. Hybrid
    Ion Capacitors (HICs) (known also as supecapatteries) that consist of one battery-type
    electrode and a capacitor-type electrode seem to be a very promising alternative
    that achieves higher power capacity, power density, energy density, and efficiency
    [86,87,88,89,90]. Energy Harvesting, as aforementioned, can substantially upgrade
    the energy sustainability in WSNs [33]. Thus, novel research is necessitated not
    only for the development of advanced equipment such as low energy harvesters,
    converters, and energy storage systems (ESS) [91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98], but also
    in order to handle certain issues such as the high cost of implementation, the
    low power generated, and the presence of fluctuations and instabilities [99,100].
    Furthermore, health limitations associated with RF power obstruct the wide use
    of RF-based energy harvesting. Moreover, ambient RF is neither predictable nor
    controllable [35]. In light-based energy harvesting, the amount of the gathered
    energy is determined by the intensity of ambient light. Yet, although the availability
    of light is absolutely controllable in indoor applications, in outdoor applications
    is existing only during day time as long as the weather conditions are adequately
    good [38,39]. Thermal-based energy harvesting not only is unpredictable and uncontrollable
    when caused by temperature variations but also has low efficiency [36]. Flow-based
    energy harvesting is not only unpredictable but also uncontrollable [35]. Biomass-based
    energy harvesting, due to its nature, is feasible only in a specific type of applications.
    Mechanical-based energy harvesting is unpredictable. Similarly, human-based energy
    harvesting due to human activity is unpredictable, while due to physiological
    procedures is both unpredictable and uncontrollable [33]. Likewise, wireless energy
    transfer is associated with various weaknesses. Specifically, energy transfer
    requires corresponding cross-layer provision covering the MAC, link, and application
    layers. The achievement of energy transfer requires the use of specialized equipment
    thus growing the employment cost [19]. Moreover, in the case that robotic vehicles
    or other types of mobile nodes are used to charge network nodes special algorithms
    for their navigation are required. Additionally, by using Inductive Coupling for
    wireless energy transfer only short transmission distances can be covered [41].
    The efficacy achieved is decreased by any misalignment existing between the transmitter
    coil and the receiver coil. Special actions must be taken to avoid the presence
    of mutual coupling effect that is the cause of interference among nodes. Wireless
    energy transfer via Magnetic Resonant Coupling requires not only the attainment
    of alignment between the coils of the transmitter and the receiver, but also the
    adjustment of resonant frequency in various nodes [42]. In wireless energy transfer
    via Electromagnetic Radiation, line of sight is essential and the presence of
    radiation triggers various health and safety concerns [43]. In order to provide
    a synoptic overview of the aforementioned statements, the basic operation along
    with the main strengths and weaknesses of each one of the hardware-based methods
    for energy sustainability in WSNs are presented in Table 2. Table 2. Synoptic
    overview of the hardware-based methods for energy sustainability. 5.2. Challenges
    and Open Research Issues in Algorithm-Based Methods In this section, the challenges
    that raise from the inherent weaknesses of the algorithm-based methods are discussed.
    First of all when selecting the communication technology to use in a WSN there
    are many specifications, other than energy efficiency, such as throughput, security,
    accuracy, robustness, and scalability, to consider [101,102,103,104,105,106].
    Regarding data-driven approaches, as aforementioned, they are classified as data
    reduction and data acquisition approaches. In Data Reduction the suitability of
    Data Compression relies on the assumption that the energy needed to compress the
    data, is less than that needed to transmit the raw (uncompressed) data while the
    accuracy of measurements is preserved. Additionally, this method may degrade QoS
    (i.e., accuracy, latency, fault tolerance and security) while trying to increase
    the network lifespan [21]. In-Network Processing is associated with non-negligible
    energy consumption [47]. Similarly, due to the fact that high computational power
    is required to create a prediction model, Data Prediction is suitable for networks
    where powerful sensor nodes with high capacity batteries are exploited [23,54].
    Regarding Data Acquisition methods, Adaptive Sampling is characterized by high
    complexity and high computational overhead, thus necessitating central control
    [56]. Hierarchical Sampling sacrifices accuracy to achieve energy efficiency,
    because simple sensors with low accuracy are mostly used while powerful sensors
    are used only when an event is detected and enhanced data are needed [57]. In
    Model-based Active Sampling mechanisms complex computations are needed, thus increasing
    processing load [58]. In Duty Cycling methods, the use of specialized modules
    is necessary [107,108,109,110]. In duty cycling via Topology Control methods,
    both location driven and connectivity driven mechanisms take the knowledge of
    the positions of all network nodes as granted. Yet, this is not a trivial condition
    to fulfil. Additionally, if GPS modules are used to overcome this problem, such
    modules not only are costly but also cause interference to network communications
    [19,23]. In relation to Sleep/Wakeup mechanisms, On-Demand methods require the
    existence of an additional radio for wakeup signaling, while in Scheduled Rendezvous
    clock synchronization problems occur, and in Asynchronous Schemes robustness trades
    off for energy consumption while latency is high [20,23]. Regarding MAC protocol
    mechanisms, scheduled MAC methods are costly to implement. In addition, there
    are various weaknesses such as the hidden terminal problem (in CSMA) and the clock
    synchronization problem (in TDMA) [67]. Contention-based MAC protocols, suffer
    from high latency in packet delivery while in hybrid MAC protocols complexity
    increases accordingly to the number of network nodes [68]. Thus novel research
    must be carried out [111,112]. Finally, as already mentioned, Energy Efficient
    Protocols may be classified according to Communication Model, Network Structure,
    Topology, and Reliable Routing [51,74]. Regarding the first of these categories,
    Query-based protocols are not suitable for continuous data delivery, while Coherent/Non-Coherent
    protocols are related with low scalability, high overhead, and high end-to-end
    delay, and Negotiation-based protocols do not guarantee data delivery [51]. In
    the Network Structure category, Flat protocols have low scalability while Hierarchical
    protocols suffer from high overhead and high complexity and do not guarantee optimal
    routing [51]. In Topology category, Location-based protocols have high overhead
    and low scalability and require the use of GPS modules that are costly and interfere
    with network communications [74]. Mobile Agents-based protocols have low scalability,
    high latency, and high complexity, while Mobile Sink-based protocols suffer from
    delays on data delivery in routing paths and topology. In Reliable Routing category,
    both QoS-based protocols, and Multipath-based protocols suffer from high processing
    load [51]. In order to provide a synoptic overview of the aforementioned statements,
    the basic operation along with the main advantages and disadvantages of each one
    of the algorithm-based methods for energy sustainability in WSNs are presented
    in Table 3. Table 3. Synoptic overview of the algorithm-based methods for energy
    sustainability. 5.3. General Challenges and Open Research Issues Following the
    aforementioned discussion that explicitly regards either the hardware-based or
    the algorithm-based methods for energy sustainability in WSNs, there are some
    more challenges that are posed by general considerations that trigger corresponding
    issues of future research. In addition, the development of the most of the abovementioned
    methodologies is based on theoretical assumptions that may be impractical in real-life
    scenarios. For instance, in most approaches the network nodes are assumed to be
    homogenous, i.e., to have the same operational and structural features. This hypothesis
    simplifies their research study, but it may lead to unrealistic results because
    the existence of heterogeneous WSNs is too common to overlook. This issue has
    to be handled by novel research works [113,114,115,116,117,118]. Similarly, in
    most models there is lack of mobility considerations, although mobile wireless
    sensor networks (MWSNs) have superior capabilities than static WSNs. On the other
    hand, energy management is inherently more complex to both study and implement
    in MWSNs thus necessitating the development of novel research in this direction
    [119,120,121]. In Furthermore, the majority of methods for energy sustainability
    consider two dimensional networks. Hence, more research works should be conducted
    regarding three dimensional WSNs [122,123]. Likewise, due to the handling of multimedia
    data, Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) have special needs in terms
    of both the nature (i.e., images, video, etc.) and the volume of data and at the
    same time extremely high requirements regarding QoS metrics that need to be supported
    [124,125,126,127,128,129,130]. Another issue is that research in many of the abovementioned
    methodologies is based on tests performed by using computer aided simulations.
    However, some recent technological advances (e.g., in energy harvesting and energy
    transfer) are not sufficiently supported by the existing simulation platforms
    in terms of corresponding energy models of high accuracy [19]. Likewise, there
    is lack of specialized equipment for wireless energy transfer in corresponding
    emulation tests performed using testbeds, due to its high cost [19]. Therefore,
    existing simulation and emulation tools have to be enhanced. Additionally, Artificial
    Intelligence and Computational Intelligence can provide extremely good support
    to the development of mechanisms for energy sustainability in WSNs that are able
    to self-learn and thus easily adapt to any alterations that dynamically take place
    in the structure or/and operation of WSNs. Specifically, the use of methods, such
    as Machine Learning, Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, Artificial Immune Algorithms,
    Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Ant Colony Optimization,
    is very promising [131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140]. Moreover, due to
    the scientific and technological advancements that are performed, there is a continuous
    growth of applications that incorporate the usage of Aerial Wireless Sensor Networks
    (AWSNs), Wireless Underground Sensor Networks (WUSNs) and Underwater Wireless
    Sensor Networks (UWSNs). However, the majority of the aforementioned methodologies
    that pursue energy sustainability in WSNs have been designated to be applied in
    terrestrial WSNs and cannot be used in non-terrestrial WSNs because of the extraordinary
    conditions that exist in such networks. For this reason, novel research efforts
    have to support energy sustainability in non-terrestrial WSNs, too [141,142,143,144,145].
    Going one step further, in order to achieve high sustainability along with optimal
    overall performance in a WSN, metrics other than energy should be considered,
    too. For this reason, hybrid schemes have to be developed. Specifically, the extension
    of network connectivity should be preserved because whenever a node loses its
    connection with its neighboring nodes due to either its malfunction or its energy
    depletion, there is a certain increase of energy cost for the communications of
    the remaining active nodes [146,147]. Furthermore, in order to achieve the optimal
    utilization of nodes existing in a WSN and thus the optimization of the overall
    deployment of the network, the maximization of coverage is necessitated [148,149,150].
    Additionally, congestion avoidance and congestion control [151,152,153,154] mechanisms
    should be used because congestion obstructs communication, generates packet losses
    and thus imposes packet retransmissions that exhaust the energy of nodes. Moreover,
    schemes for the establishment of QoS in terms of general or specific performance
    metrics are required [155,156]. Furthermore, security schemes for WSNs to assure
    confidentiality, authentication, integrity, availability, and freshness are required
    [157,158,159]. However, the achievement of energy efficiency along with other
    performance metrics is not a trivial task to accomplish. This is because the conditions
    that must be fulfilled are not only several but they also are opposing in many
    cases. Likewise, the concurrent deployment of different methods for energy sustainability
    may also be obstructed due to the opposing requirements that they may have. For
    this reason, multi-objective optimization algorithms that pursue the concurrent
    achievement of multiple criteria [160,161] have to be developed. 6. Conclusions
    Despite the contribution of WSNs to a continuously growing variety of applications,
    their deployment faces several problems with those caused by the inherent energy
    limitations of the sensor nodes to be considered as the most significant. This
    research article, investigated all of the existing hardware-based and algorithm-based
    methods that aim to support the energy sustainability of WSNs, via energy saving,
    energy harvesting and energy transfer. Although the current mechanisms are evinced
    to be quite effective, there are still many weaknesses that are associated with
    their utilization. For this reason, novel research works have to be conducted.
    Additionally, although some of these methods can be combined in order to accomplish
    enhanced performance of both the individual network nodes and the overall network,
    the achievement of this combination is not straightforward. Likewise, the collaboration
    of energy management methods of this type along with methods that pursue the enhancement
    of the performance of WSNs regarding metrics other than energy is a very challenging
    topic that needs thorough research study. Furthermore, due to the continuous growth
    of the range of applications of WSNs that in many cases have diverse requirements,
    novel efficient methods for energy sustainability need to be pursued. For these
    reasons, the authors of this research work believe that the achievement of energy
    sustainability in WSNs will keep on attracting scientific awareness and hope that
    this survey will be helpful to the scientists that apply their research efforts
    at this very exciting domain. Author Contributions Conceptualization, E.A.E. and

  description: The evolution of the previous mobile communication generations has
    led to innovative goals of the Internet of Everything (IoE) in the 5G. However,
    addressing all IoE-associated problems in 5G is difficult and a long-term process.
    As the key performance indicators (KPIs) of the 5G services are highly diverse,
    it is an intimidating task to develop a single platform enabling all KPIs. The
    vision of next-generation 6G wireless communications lies not only in enhancing
    these targets but also in providing new services. Numerous extensively envisaged
    future services, including life-critical services and wireless brain–computer
    interactions, will be critically dependent on an instant, virtually unlimited
    wireless connectivity. In this direction, the 6G is envisioned to have primely
    five service objectives; further-enhanced mobile broadband (FeMBB), ultra-massive
    machine type communication (umMTC), extremely reliable low latency communication

    content Abstract The evolution of the previous mobile communication generations
    has led to innovative goals of the Internet of Everything (IoE) in the 5G. However,
    addressing all IoE-associated problems in 5G is difficult and a long-term process.
    As the key performance indicators (KPIs) of the 5G services are highly diverse,
    it is an intimidating task to develop a single platform enabling all KPIs. The
    vision of next-generation 6G wireless communications lies not only in enhancing
    these targets but also in providing new services. Numerous extensively envisaged
    future services, including life-critical services and wireless brain–computer
    interactions, will be critically dependent on an instant, virtually unlimited
    wireless connectivity. In this direction, the 6G is envisioned to have primely
    five service objectives; further-enhanced mobile broadband (FeMBB), ultra-massive
    machine type communication (umMTC), extremely reliable low latency communication
    (ERLLC), long-distance and high-mobility communications (LDHMC), and extremely
    low-power communications (ELPC). The 3D global integration of the wireless communication
    networks is lacking in the 5G, which is targeted by the future 6G. In this paper,
    we present an exhaustive review of the 6G wireless communication network. We explore
    the various existing mobile communication generations concerning data rate, frequency
    band, bandwidth allotted, latency, and applications. We also highlight various
    current trends and issues in the 5G communication network, which drives research
    for the 6G communication network. Our focus is to provide a comprehensive survey
    on the future 6G. So, we explored the objectives and design principles for 6G.
    This paper highlights the key 6G technology drivers. This paper also proposes
    an architectural design for 6G. Moreover, we carry out a case-study of 6G architecture
    operational design and compare the result with previous generation architecture
    designs. Further, 6G envisioned open research challenges, research directions,
    and recent advancements are also highlighted in this paper. Furthermore, we discuss
    possible use-cases in terms of real-time interactions of the biological, physical,
    and digital world, and also how these use-cases are going to serve in 6G. Previous

    communicationsVision 1. Introduction The imminent trend of mobile communications
    shows that the number of both, unique subscribers with mobile connections will
    surge over the forthcoming years. Fig. 1 shows the growth in global internet traffic
    over the years. With emerging applications including ultra-high-definition video-on-demand,
    it is predicted that the global internet protocol (IP) traffic will grow thrice
    from 2017 to 2022 [1]. With the tremendous growth in the use of the global internet,
    this trend of traffic explosion is expected to rise further in the future, which
    is envisioned to be 607 Exabyte (EB) by 2025 and 5016 EB by 2030, per month [2].
    To cope with such future traffic congestion, and provide mobile communication
    services with much lower latencies and higher data rates, the interest of researchers
    has shifted to networks beyond 5G. The 6G is envisaged to keep up with the explosive
    growth in mobile traffic, exploring new commercial opportunities in the ever-tremendous
    varying competitive battlefield. Download : Download high-res image (152KB) Download

    years. 1.1. Existing cellular networks–issues and challenges Once, an Italian
    inventor, G. Marconi, communicated the alphabet ‘S’ as a signal via electromagnetic
    waves, in form of three-dot Morse code, to a distance of 3 km. This experiment
    gave the world an outset to explore communication systems. Subsequently, innovations
    in wireless communications like a radio transmission, television, and satellite
    communication have transformed the way of operation of society. Hence, this marks
    the evolution of wireless communication systems [3]. Since then, wireless communication
    has evolved in form of different generations, to give the users finer services
    and superior communication experiences. In around 50 years the generations have
    evolved from first-generation (1G) to fifth-generation (5G) of mobile communication
    networks. 1G was purely based on the analog techniques solely for providing voice
    applications, where each call was given a distinct narrowband frequency [4], [5].
    In 1G problems like inferior voice associations, reckless handoffs, and security
    issues, therefore, to address these issues the second-generation (2G) of cellular
    communication systems was introduced [6]. The third-generation (3G) combines IP-based
    services with high-speed cellular access, embodying mobile broadband, which brought
    enhancements in services like digital voice, e-mail, mobile web, etc. [7]. The
    main limitation of the 3G handset is higher power requirements as compared to
    2G handsets, accompanied by highly expensive network plans [8]. Therefore, fourth-generation
    (4G) was introduced, that advanced the previous generations by offering IP-based
    services with better and faster mobile broadband [9], and expanded the fixed internet
    with enhanced mobile and smartphone applications. Thereafter, 5G was introduced
    to provide a flexible architectural framework directing to connect all types of
    things whereas, the previous generations focused on connecting people. The introduction
    of 5G is targeted to achieve three major scenarios; enhanced mobile broadband
    (eMBB) with data rates in Gbps, massive machine type communication (mMTC) connecting
    about a million devices per square kilometer, and ultra-reliable low latency communication
    (URLLC) with air interface latency in millisecond (ms) [10]. The comparative analysis
    of the evolution of cellular mobile generations [9], [11] is presented in Table
    1. Table 1. Comparative analysis of evolution of cellular mobile generations.

    trends show a leap in the number of connections and global IP traffic. The development
    of IoT is affecting the way devices, processes, data, and people are connected
    with the Internet and each other. By 2022, M2M connections are predicted to be
    more than 50% of the total connections [12]. By 2023, the number of IP-connected
    devices will be three times the global population, and half of the global connections
    will be M2M connections [25]. Particularly, internet traffic caused by VR and
    AR applications will increase twelve times by 2022 [12]. Although, 3GPP 5G NR
    does not constantly meet the targeted URLLC demands as the short-packet and the
    sensing-based functions of 5G URLLC limit the low latency and high reliability
    in such applications [13]. The evolution of the previous generations has directed
    groundbreaking goals of the Internet of Everything (IoE) in the 5G. However, addressing
    all IoE associated problems in this stage of 5G is difficult and a long-term process.
    Therefore, 5G can be viewed as just the beginning phase of IoE. The set of the
    key performance indicators (KPIs) of the oncoming advanced 5G services, is highly
    diverse. Therefore, is an intimidating task to develop a single platform enabling
    all KPIs. The previous generation networks cover less than 6% of the earth’s surface.
    The original definition of 5G also describes it as a terrestrial mobile communication
    network therefore, it has a radio coverage limitation. However, to make a global
    cellular connection the entire surface area of the earth should be interconnected.
    While the 5G implementations have high promises, the envisioned results from commercial
    deployments have just commenced and will take some time. In the industrial developments
    of 5G, the scenario of eMBB is highly prioritized and has developed at a much
    higher pace than URLLC and mMTC [14]. The reasons are the struggles occurring
    in advancing the diversified, fragmented, and unclear requirements of these IoT-related
    scenarios. Yet at the moment, numerous subjects are not clear, such as what will
    be the future actual demands in 5G networks? What will be the ecology of the 5G
    industry? Thus, the research on 6G will intend to eliminate the variance between
    definition and realization. It will aim to cover the entire surface of the earth
    for interconnection and transcend the existing vision and requirements. 1.3. Scope
    of the survey So far, few surveys have been published on 6G by different authors
    [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Most of these surveys, as per
    our knowledge, have focused on the key requirements and key enablers of 6G. But
    there is no exhaustive survey present that considered the detailed description
    of 6G design principal, technology enablers, hardware, key open challenges, and
    use-cases for 6G with case studies. For example, B. Zong et al. [13] discussed
    6G key drivers and its brief architecture, but only focussed on 6G requirements
    and few key 6G technologies. Z. Zhang et al. [14] conducted a survey that provides
    6G design considerations and suggestions about 6G architecture but did not include
    details about foreseen 6G challenges and use-cases. X. You et al. in [15] and
    H.H.H Mahmoud et al. in [16] did not provide a detailed discussion of 6G hardware
    and physical designs. S. Chen et al. [17] identified 6G vision, requirement, and
    key technologies with their respective challenges, but did not include envisions
    of 6G architecture. T. Huang et al. [18] surveyed the key 6G technologies and
    provides an idea about 6G architecture, but did not discuss 6G key open issues
    and applications. E. Calvanese Strinati et al. [19] conducted a survey that gives
    motivation about the usage of pervasive AI and holistic management of communication,
    computation, caching, and control resources, for 6G. However, they provided only
    a brief description of new services, and discussions of 6G open challenges are
    missing. G. Gui et al. [20] highlighted 6G KPIs and challenges related to it,
    but only an exhaustive study of key enabling technologies and applications of
    6G is missing. Table 2 presents a summary of these surveys and their differences
    from the proposed survey article. Recent research activities related 6G are highlighted
    in Appendix A. 1.4. Contribution of this survey In this paper, we present an exhaustive
    review of the 6G wireless communication network. We explore the various existing
    solutions (1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G) for data transfer concerning data rate, frequency
    band, bandwidth allotted, latency, and applications. We also highlight various
    current trends and issues in the 5G communication network, which drives research
    for the 6G communication network. Our focus is to provide a comprehensive survey
    on 6G. So, we explored the objectives and design principles for 6G. This paper
    also highlights the key 6G technology drivers. Moreover, this paper proposes an
    architectural design for 6G and a 6G case study. Further, 6G envisioned open challenges
    and research directions are discussed. The possible use-cases in terms of real-time
    interactions of the biological, physical, and digital world, are also highlighted
    in this paper. Based on the above discussion, the following are the major contributions
    of this paper. • We present a comprehensive and systematic review of 6G and compare
    it with the previous generations. • We identify technical objectives and design
    principles for the envisioned 6G wireless communication system. • A review of
    the principal and novel 6G technologies is presented. • Based on identified 6G
    technical objectives, design principles, and technologies, we propose a possible
    6G architecture, with attributes such as decentralize, decouple, intelligent,
    autonomous, and grant-free protocols. • We have carried out 6G case study, its
    analysis, and compared the results it with previous generations. • We have highlighted
    of the open research challenges, possible solutions, and research directions in
    the development of 6G. • Important applications of 6G are identified and explained
    in terms of use cases. We have also discussed about how they are going to serve
    in 6G. 1.5. Organization and reading map Fig. 2 highlights the major topics of

    for connecting everything; people, things, and even intelligence [21]. The first
    source of induction for the need for the development of 6G is to keep addressing
    the world’s insatiable demands and insistence on better service experiences. Moreover,
    a unified platform needs to be designed to enable new industries and new services
    that 5G will be unable to achieve. The prime engine of continuous research is
    envisioning raising the bars to attain, ultra-fast wireless speed, high mobility,
    full coverage, increased bandwidth, connectivity, and greater security while reducing
    energy consumption and achieving ultra-low round-trip latency, to such a level
    that is unachievable with 5G. Prime visions and motivations of 6G systems are
    identified as: • 1 10 Tbps Data rates in real-world: 360° VR/AR services need
    data rates up to 500 Mbps. Applications and services like holographic communications,
    IoE, 3D video communication, 4K 8K, AR, etc. will demand much high data rates
    than promised by 5G. • Tremendous number of connected devices: With the rise of
    mobile users, the development of smart cities, and cell densification the network
    capacity requirements also increase. Static Base Station (BS) cannot fulfill these
    demands. Therefore, the facility of relocation offered by mobile BSs can offload
    the data traffic of the static BSs. • Every time everywhere services: 6G envisions
    cover the entire surface of the earth with communication links. This 3-Dimensional
    (3-D) nature of coverage will surpass the coverage capabilities of 5G. • Perceived
    availability almost 100%: Network services must essentially be always available
    is one of the key 6G visions and motivation. • 10 100 s round trip Latency: To
    support real-time, emergency, and IoE based applications, 6G will require to reduce
    backhaul congestion and Radio Access Network (RAN) congestions. Short-packet transmissions,
    dynamic transmission, and signaling overhead because of these congestions. 6G
    aims to address these issues to achieve low latency access networks. • High bandwidth
    in the unit area: It is a requirement to extensity the connections in a specific
    area, with higher bandwidth, for a longer duration. • Safety and Security of the
    Information: Presently, massive user data is stored in networks in form of activity
    logs, text messages, geo-tagged voices, etc. Securing confidential online data
    from eavesdroppers, and increasing cyber-security and encryption tools are a few
    of the vital goals of 6G. • Shrinking the Energy usage: Reduction in power consumption
    and development of green technologies while achieving high target data rates and
    providing enormous connectivity, is a fundamentally important design aspect of
    6G. The expected roadmap of 6G is shown in Fig. 5. From release 16 by 3GPP, for
    5G NR, moving towards the evolution of 5G NR release 17 to release 19, for beyond
    5G, and followed by release 20 for 6G oriented research. ITU will issue the 5G
    standardizations by 2020 [11], which will aid in commencing the 6G research based
    on the considered visions, requirements, and technology trends, discussed by academics
    and industries, globally. Concurrently, the research on 6G, from the industrial
    aspect has been commenced. It is expected that the research will continue until
    the period 2024–2026, and the 6G standard works will then start near 2030. 2.1.
    Technical expectations A few major technical expectations from the 6G networks
    are highlighted in this section. 2.1.1. Data rate and Further-enhanced Mobile
    Broadband (FeMBB) Mobile traffic has been seen as one of the most prominent trends
    and is expected to surge in the coming years. With the advent of new services,
    for example, extended reality (XR), supper immersive multimedia, 8K, 4K, holographic
    communications, etc., it is predicted that 78% of mobile traffic will consist
    of video uploading/downloading [22]. Such services need a very high data rate.
    The eMBB in 5G, emphasizes supporting the exigent demands of cellular data rates
    and system capacity. It supports, high-speed access in the dense area (e.g., stadium,
    mall, office, urban, etc.), everywhere broadband services (e.g., rural, suburban,
    road, etc.), high mobility services (e.g., train, plane, etc.) [23]. The eMBB
    introduced centimeter wave (cmWave) and mmWave technologies, to accomplish these
    demands and attain higher bandwidth provisions. Although, a 100-fold increase
    in peak data rate and a 10-fold increase in user-experience data rate is expected
    while advancing from the 5G to the 6G. To support such requirements, 6G targets
    to increase the data rates and capacity further, through FeMBB, targeting to achieve
    peak data rate as a minimum of 1 Tbps and user experience data rate of a minimum
    of 1 Gbps. The peak data rate of even 10 Tbps is expected to be achieved in scenarios
    like Terahertz (THz) backhaul and fronthaul communication [24]. The holographic
    communications require a data rate of 4 to 10 Tbps. The 64K digital cinema experience
    and 360° VR/AR services need a 500 Mbps data rate. In some scenarios, like indoor
    hotspots the user experience data rate of up to 10 Gbps is anticipated with the
    advent of 6G. Download : Download high-res image (606KB) Download : Download full-size

    SE: spectrum efficiency, ATC: area traffic capacity. 2.1.2. Network congestion
    and traffic capacity In some scenarios, such as hotspots, the traffic capacity
    of 6G is predicted to reach up to 1 Gbps/ is predicted. For supporting high data
    rates and QoS on fronthaul, the backhaul traffic of 6G will need very low latency
    optical fiber-like access networks. In the developing ultra-dense cellular networks,
    in additional to backhaul network congestions, RAN congestions is another issue
    that needs to be addressed. The reasons behind RAN congestion can be enormous
    short-packet transmissions, very dynamic device transmissions, massive signaling
    overhead [25]. Therefore, it is necessary to consider appropriate transmission
    scheduling, access control, and traffic minimization methods in the 6G systems.
    2.1.3. Ultra-massive machine type communication (umMTC) 5G has indistinct mMTC,
    for connecting about a million devices per square kilometer. Statista 2019 predicted
    that by 2030, there will be 50 billion IoE-connected devices. In the future, machines
    will substitute humans on many platforms, and the world will move towards a machine-centric
    instead of a human-centric society. Therefore, 6G targets to enhance machine connectivity,
    through umMTC. However, scalable and efficient umMTC is not easy to achieve. Many
    issues like handling highly sporadic and dynamic traffic, maintaining QoS, network
    congestion, and signaling overhead management for a huge number of connected devices.
    2.1.4. Mobility High latency is intolerable for some services, for time-critical
    applications that are specifically latency-sensitive. The deployments of 5G Non-Standalone
    initial phase, emphases on URLLC and eMBB, offers larger data-bandwidth supplemented
    by latency enhancements on both 5G NR and 4G LTE, to aid mobile broadband low
    latency developments use cases for example media AR/VR applications, 360-degree
    streaming, or UltraHD video and many more. The objective of 6G is to scale up
    both reliability and latency aimed in 5G. For supporting applications such as
    high availability seamless redundancy scenarios, deep-sea sighting, space travel,
    6G aims to achieve long-distance and high-mobility communications (LDHMC). The
    mobility greater than or equal to 1000 km/hr is expected by 6G [26]. 2.1.5. Extremely
    reliable low latency communication (ERLLC) The recent release of 3GPP 5G NR, does
    not constantly meet the URLLC demands, which are becoming more essential with
    the evolution of mMTC. Presently, the control channels suffer from low spectral
    efficiency in 5G NR. Henceforth, 5G NR may fail to satisfy the latency and reliability
    requirements in a huge traffic network [26]. New extremely reliable low latency
    communication (ERLLC) in 6G will introduce new solutions capable of fulfilling
    the large diverse range of future reliability and latency requirements. The future
    6G communication networks are foreseeing ERLLC with a round trip latency of about
    10–100 s and 99.999% success probability, while FeMBB is expected to stipulate
    inflated data rates. Recently, cyclic prefixed direct sequence spread spectrum
    (CP-DSSS) signaling has been proposed for effectively relieving the congestion
    in the wireless spectrum, which can increase sum-rate capacity for IoT environments,
    through a novel precoding/equalization technique proposed in [27]. A. Stevens
    et al. in [26], further explores the CP-DSSS to provide latency and reliability
    solution towards the 6G and analyze its practicality to a 3GPP-proposed factory

    6 km Underwater-drone 0.1 km 2.1.6. Spectral efficiency and energy efficiency
    Spectrum efficiency is defined by the rate of the information transmitted over
    a given bandwidth. It is either given by the ratio of the net bitrate to the channel
    bandwidth or net bitrate per symbol rate. It is a degree of how proficiently limited
    spectrum resources are exploited by the physical layer or channel access protocol.
    The 6G is expected to attain a 5–10 times rise in spectral efficiency as compared
    to 5G. The 6G targets extremely low-power communications (ELPC), to increase the
    energy efficiency up to 10–100 times that of 5G. Energy efficiency refers to utilize
    a lesser amount of energy and abolishing energy wastage, for realizing the same
    operation. It has numerous benefits like dipping energy import demands, plummeting
    greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing the society-wide cost of communication
    services. The hostile fading is an inevitable part of cellular communications.
    As cellular communications are required to operate through long distances, the
    power of the handset becomes the main constraint. Therefore, the 6G system models
    intend to accomplish the maximum possible power efficiency, through ELPC. ELPC
    will also support many applications including nano-devices, nano-sensors, nano-robots,
    e-health. According to the Shannon equation, the spectral efficiency and the power
    efficiency are at two opposite verges of the data rate normalization curve. Therefore,
    these two key parameters cannot be simultaneously optimized. Some researchers
    have been carried out to find the trade-off between spectral and energy efficiency
    [28], [29], [30]. Few attempts have been made previously in the analysis of the
    cellular systems, to eliminate this dilemma and expand the operating region of
    both spectral efficiency and the energy efficiency by using mMIMO [31], autoregressive
    methods for IoT communications [32], a heuristic algorithm for combined mmWave
    and mMIMO systems [33], firefly algorithm for heterogeneous networks [34], intercell
    coordination algorithm for satellite-small-cell communication [35]. The design
    consideration of 6G system operations needs to consider both, expansion of spectral
    and energy efficiency. More attention needs to be given in the direction of spectral
    efficiency for delivering even higher data rates. Along with spectral efficiency,
    the energy efficiency needs to be expanded for enhancing the battery life and
    coverage of applications like mMTC. The comparison of prime objectives of 5G and
    6G is shown in Fig. 6. 2.1.7. Three-dimensional (3D) connectivity In the future,
    human activity is expected to intensely advance in the ground, air, space as well
    as deep sea. Further, applications based on human micro cosmos and technical advancements
    to enhance health and lifestyle are prime future expectations. The large-scale
    space–air–ground–underwater integrated network can be divided into four segments;
    space, air, terrestrial, and underwater, and the comparison of these networks
    is shown in Table 4. In [36], J. Liu et al. provided a survey integration of space–air–ground
    networks focusing on mobility, traffic, handover, and routing management in such
    integrated systems. Based on 5G air–ground coverage, 6G is expected to rise the
    levels by further integrating underwater networks. The 6G is perceived to connect
    the world with 10 times more connectivity density than 5G. In some scenarios,
    such as hotspots, 6G is expected to achieve a connectivity density of around devices
    per  [37]. The space–air–ground–underwater integrated networks have applications
    in many fields like military missions, the intelligent transportation system (ITS),
    disaster rescue, earth observation, mapping, etc. Further, such integrated networks
    can offer seamless connectivity to space, ocean, mountain, and rural areas [38].
    The space–air segment can support areas with high service demands, the air–ground
    segment can enable high data rate access, and the ground–underwater segment can
    support high-speed data transmission. Table 5. Requirements of 5G vs. 6G. KPI

    of Bio-Nano-Things 2.1.8. Hardware requirements As the 6G needs to expand in both
    directions; spectral efficiency and energy efficiency, this requires a complex
    integrated transmission architecture. For the green 6G system, the architectural
    components need to condense hardware heat consumption and processing delay, with
    a certain level of chipset density. The trend of the technology utilized by commercialization
    is 65 nm, 28 nm, and 7 nm for 3G. 4G and 5G, respectively. Based on this trend,
    the expected chipset density for 6G demands to be 3 nm technology or better. 2.1.9.
    Strong network security The emergence of new techniques and features provision
    of like SDN/NFV, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, device-to-device (D2D)
    communication, IoT, IoE, etc., brings egregious security challenges for future
    networks. Security has three aspects; data integrity, authentication, and confidentiality.
    However, these are prone to attacks such as, physical attacks; where the attacker
    breakdowns the inside program, communication attacks; like blocking the signal
    or damaging the packets, attacks on BS; where attacker traces the data or the
    traffic, routing protocols attack; where attacker misuses convention’s shortcoming
    and creates a dark node in the route which are misinterpreted as genuine nodes.
    To protect the network against such attacks, 3GPP defines six security levels
    [39]: • Network access security: enables a device to securely authenticate and
    access (3GPP or non-3GPP) amenities and protect against attacks. • Network domain
    security: supports the secure exchange of signaling and user plane data on network
    nodes. • User domain security: allows secure access of a device, to the user •
    Application domain security: empowers applications to securely reciprocate messages
    in the provider and user domain. • Service-Based Architecture domain security:
    supervises network features such as network element registration, authorization,
    discovery, security, and service-based interface protection. • Visibility and
    configurability of security: empower the user to be knowledgeable about whether
    a security trait is in action or not. The 6G steering security conventions will
    consider all the aspects like bundle disaster, QoS provision, encryption calculations,
    and assaults altogether. While designing the security of 6G applications, the
    limits of power supply, memory, and processor is expected to be taken into account.
    The security system of 6G ought to deal with the most extravagant and aggressive
    malicious exercises. Improved methods are requisite for enhancing network control,
    adaptability, computation, protection, and security. Table 5 shows the possible
    requirements of 5G vs. 6G [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46]. Download :

    design principles. QoS: quality of service; QoE: quality of experience. 2.2. Design
    directions Few prime 6G design directions are identified and highlighted in this
    section. Fig. 7 shows the design principles of 6G. 2.2.1. Spectrum utilization
    Even though sub-6 GHz (3 GHz to 6 GHz) and mmWave bands (e.g., 24 GHz, 28 GHz,
    37 GHz, 39 GHz, 47 GHz) will be utilized in 5G NR, still to diminish capacity
    limitations, to support ultra-high-rate communication and reduce spectrum scarcity,
    utilization of higher frequency bands, e.g., 73 GHz −140 GHz, THz band (0.1 THz–10
    THz) or even visible optical band (400 THz–800 THz) needs to be explored for the
    6G and beyond networks [47]. The THz band is recognized as an ultra-wide spectrum
    band. It can support a variety of applications like VR, AR, holographic video
    conference, nanoscale communication, e-health monitoring, inter-satellite communications,
    and many more. As of now, THz communication systems are categorized into two classes;
    solid-state and spatial direct modulation THz communication, based on frequency
    mixing mechanism and direct modulation into a continuous carrier wave. VLC can
    attain speed up to gigabits-per-second with commercial light-emitting devices
    (LEDs). In addition to unlocking ultra-wide frequency bands, VLC has numerous
    advantages such as high energy efficiency, reduced cost, and improved safety.
    It covers various applications like vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, small-cell
    indoor communication, vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, underwater networks,
    etc. 2.2.2. Energy saving and harvesting Optimizing the energy of the network
    benefits the cost-cutting and reducing its carbon emissions. The energy efficiency
    in a communication link is usually defined as the bitrate supported per Joule
    of expended energy. Hence, if the 6G intends to offer higher capacity and throughput
    than 5G at comparable communication power levels, then this entails a corresponding
    intensification in the energy optimization of 6G systems as compared to 5G systems.
    Most of electronic devices such as embedded devices and remote sensors are powered
    through batteries. However, batteries have a limited lifespan and need frequent
    replacements. Such replacements can be expensive, dangerous, or impractical when
    thousands of remote sensors are involved. Whereas, a technique like energy harvesting,
    can afford unrestrained operating life and eradicate the necessity of replacing
    batteries, with low-power equipment. Energy harvesting is the accumulation of
    a small amount of ambient energy and converting it into serviceable electrical
    energy, to power wireless devices. It can be either used directly or saved for
    the future especially for applications like remote systems or body sensor networks
    where batteries are impractical. With energy harvesting, it becomes possible to
    banish the use of long cables, losses incurred in transmission, and operate battery-less.
    Table 6 shows highlights of energy-saving research in wireless networks. Energy
    harvesting can unfasten many new applications such as autonomous acoustic communications,
    aerial communications, e-health monitoring, emergency communications, and many
    more. Energy harvesting is maintenance-free and assists 6G in moving towards green
    communication systems. While increasing the efficiency of network operation and
    maintenance, 6G also targets to reduce operational expenditures. As 6G devices
    are foreseen to function in higher frequency bands, therefore, their requirement
    of energy is much more than the previous generations. With the development of
    new technologies, 6G is expected to develop battery-free IoE devices and harvest
    energy in smart homes. Hence, power utilization, energy optimization, and energy
    harvesting have prime importance. 2.2.3. Quality expectations Smartphones are
    used by almost one-fourth of the world population to access the Internet and multimedia
    services. Therefore, QoE plays an important role in measuring the success of the
    Mobile Network Operator. The network quality can be enhanced with the support
    of QoS, but it does not show user satisfaction. Hence, it is important to use
    parameters of the QoE along with the QoS to assess and enhance the quality of
    the network [55]. Research in [56], presents Deep Learning (DL) based scheme for
    improving QoE in offloading processes. Maintaining QoE and QoS in multimedia traffic
    engineering becomes difficult due to inaccurate information and a complex network
    environment. This issue is deeply investigated in [57]. Table 6. Highlights of
    energy-saving research in wireless networks. Reference Objective Observation [48]
    As the transmitter first harvests energy for a certain time and then stops harvesting
    to transmit the signal, using the harvested energy. The objective was to Optimize
    energy harvesting time while maximizing the throughput of the considered system
    for two scenarios, namely Markov energy arrival case and independent and identically
    distributed (i.i.d) energy arrival case. For fading channel scenario, the corresponding
    optimal stopping rule under the Markov energy arrival case has a state-dependent
    “threshold-based” structure, and under the i.i.d energy arrival case, is a constant
    computed through a proposed recursive algorithm. [49] To develop a sleep strategy
    for the BS, based on the analysis of the current situation and user demand, to
    reduce energy consumption A certain energy-saving can be achieved, through the
    proposed cluster sleep method for meeting the energy efficiency requirements of
    5G ultra-dense BS. [50] To maximize the throughput for an energy harvesting channel
    in presence of an energy cooperating helper. Throughput can be maximized for an
    energy harvesting channel, through proposed iterative directional waterfilling
    algorithms and backward iterative algorithm based on, minimum and maximum constraint
    violations, and a combination of feasibility tunnel optimization and directional
    waterfilling with variable minimum constraints, respectively. [51] To maximize
    on-grid energy saving in a hybrid energy-powered IoT environment, through optimizing
    the BS sleeping strategy. Alternate on/off switching of the power supplies according
    to the needs and demands, aids in saving the total power consumption. The proposed
    BS sleeping strategy adaptively adjusts according to the actual traffic load and
    solar energy state based on coalitional and reduces on-grid energy consumption
    of the considered network. [52] To reduce the energy consumption and maintaining
    QoS in a multi-clusters dense heterogeneous network For different network-load
    environments, the proposed clustering-based energy-saving algorithm can reduce
    the average network cost by 25.2% to 66.7%, as compared with the traditional approaches.

    changes for a MIMO cloud-RAN (C-RAN) heterogeneous network, with respect to •

    while delivering extremely low latency and maintaining the QoS, in wide-scale
    ultra-dense B5G networks. To save energy, passively observing changes in cell
    loads and then correspondingly switching the BS power ‘on’ and ‘off’, does not
    guarantee low latency services. Rather, user mobility prediction. Whereas, the
    proposed autonomous proactive energy saving (AURORA) framework significantly reduces
    energy consumption without a noticeable impact on QoS. 2.2.4. New protocol stack
    The architecture of the current Transmission Control Protocol/IP (TCP/IP) stack,
    was initially intended for data delivery. Still, the present Internet has met
    numerous exceptional challenges and cannot assure futuristic service constraints
    (e.g., latency, minimum data rates, etc.). Lately, few protocols built on TCP/IP
    such as QUIC (Quick User Datagram Protocol Internet Connections) have reduced
    these impediments to some level. However, the current Internet has shortcomings
    like in TCP congestion control radio retransmission is not synchronized therefore,
    packets get wasted in retransmission. Sometimes, fixed protocol fields have encapsulation
    redundancy. Characteristics of TCP like tunnels over tunnels and duplicate header
    fields result in low protocol efficiency and higher header taxes [58]. Nevertheless,
    the Internet becomes more complicated by these patch-like protocols, and cannot
    serve as a complete solution of the limitations of the existing Internet. Therefore,
    new developments in the protocol stack are anticipated in the 6G networks. To
    sustenance arduous future Internet demands, application designer-defined commands
    and meta-data may enhance new IP. The flow status, security details, network measurement
    metrics, information about requirements, applications, and identifiers of real
    communication entities can be encompassed in the new protocol fields. The new
    Internet architecture is expected to make a paradigm shift from content-oriented
    and control-based real-time communication. Presently, commands and meta-data are
    the basis of policies and expected packet format. In future IP, the upper layer
    can provide supplementary information for efficient and direct routing and forwarding
    strategies. For coalescing ultra-low latency, reliability, tremendously high availability,
    and security in future networks, the ITU has defined Tactile Internet. In addition
    to the typical audio–visual and data traffics the Tactile Internet can support
    real-time haptic information communication. Tactile Internet is considered as
    an emerging Internet and the next evolution phase of IoT. S. K. Sharma et al.
    [59] provides a survey on the technical issues of current Internet architecture,
    its potential solutions, and visions of Tactile Internet. For enhancing the QoE
    in smart cities, a five layers Tactile Internet architecture is presented by X.
    Wei et al. in [60] containing a sensing layer, transmission layer, storage layer,
    computing layer, and application layer. Some projects have been initiated for
    Tactile Internet testbeds on an experimental basis. P. Mekikis et al. [61] present
    an experimental platform for Tactile Internet based on NFV while V. Gokhale et
    al. in [62] presents Tactile Internet eXtensible Testbed (TIXT) as a testbed for
    Tactile Internet applications. 2.2.5. Improve computation efficiency High-level
    precision and accuracy in positioning are crucial for many applications such as
    autonomous driving, telesurgery, intelligent transportation system, tactile internet,
    and many more. To estimate the position, the present localization systems deploy
    satellites and uses the signal level and travel time for computations, yet sometimes
    error occurs. However, error even in the order of meters is unacceptable and its
    elimination is indispensable. The conventional statistical multiplexing and calculation
    tools are insufficient for such high accuracy demanding applications. Therefore,
    some novel function mechanisms are required. The maximum computational power for
    providing services is concentrated at the data center for example in SDN/NFV.
    To reduce latency and improve performance, MEC the computational power the computation
    power is shifted to the edge of the network. In cloud services, computing power
    is shifted to the system from terminals. Such a trend is likely to be continued
    in 6G. In the 6G intelligent computing network, computing power will not only
    be placed at the data center but at the edge, in each hop, along with and inside
    the communication pipe. The 6G is expected to improve computation efficiency for
    providing autonomous optimized system configurations and desired QoE and supporting
    big data analysis, AI and ML, and other time and location critical operations.

    of 6G must consider three prime attributes; super-flexibility, intelligence, and
    autonomous zero touch. Table 7, Table 8 highlight 6G Network architecture and

    are conventionally used for designing the hardware of communication systems, however,
    seem to reach their limits, and therefore, there is a need for novel materials
    (such as Silicon Germanium, Gallium Nitride, Graphene, and Indium Phosphide) to
    have improved high-temperature and high-frequency characteristics for developing
    future 6G ultrahigh-speed communication. 3. Promising 6G technologies As escalation
    of the traffic volume driven by an increased number of devices is expected in
    the future the applications and requirements also change with time. Therefore,
    to provide a common platform for diverse applications and requirements of 6G,
    in this section, we identify several technologies, which will be crucial for designing
    6G. Moreover, we discuss research directions and recent advancements. Table 9
    shows the potential 6G enablers at different layers of architecture. 3.1. Ultra-massive
    MIMO MIMO has been recognized as a key technology and has been used since 3G for
    performance enhancements of the wireless systems. The mMIMO is an advanced version
    of MIMO systems where a massive number of antennas (practically 12–100 antennas
    and theoretically up to 1000 antennas) are employed to simultaneously serve numerous
    users and advantage of flexible receiver scheduling with respect to time [97].
    In most of the common concepts of mMIMO, the BS is considered to have a greater
    number of antennas than the number of served users. Due to the following potential
    benefits of mMIMO, it is foreseen [71]. Spectral efficiency: a massive number
    of antennas in mMIMO generates higher throughput, more spatial data streams, enhanced
    multiplexing gain, and hence improves the spectral efficiency than conventional
    MIMO [72]. The benefits of mMIMO is shown in Fig. 8. For 6G, the mMIMO technology
    is envisioned to be upgraded, in this paper, we will use the term to ultra-massive
    MIMO [41], [73], [74] to describe the 6G version of the technology. THz communication;
    the key technology of the 6G, faces propagation losses and power limitations challenges.
    The ultra-massive MIMO, emerges as a promising solution for elongating the distance
    of THz communications. In this direction, recently, graphene-based nano-antennas
    have been proposed, which can be collectively controlled and separately tuned
    in an ultra-mMIMO array of sub-arrays architecture [75]. A beamspace approach
    is used where 2D discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is used to define beams for
    rectangular panels antennas, in predetermined angular directions for the line
    of sight (LoS) communication. However, DFT is not suitable for non-line of sight
    (NLoS) communications as beams might have arbitrarily linear combinations, antenna
    arrays might have different geometry, or are imperfectly calibrated. In full-dimensional
    beamforming planar antennas generate spatial beams in elevation and azimuth angles.
    Although, in such beamforming techniques angular directivity may not be clear
    due to imperfect calibration in arrays, near-field scattering, mutual coupling,
    no pre-defined array geometry, and low-2D DFT approximation. Therefore, alternate
    ways are required for ultra-massive MIMO arrays. One alternate method is an advancement
    to a 3D approximation. Optical angular momentum (OAM) can provide a solution for
    increasing the dimensions [41]. Table 9. Potential 6G enablers at different layers

    virtualization (NFV) There are many challenges in developing the hardware for
    ultra-mMIMO. Fully digital arrays are developed for ultra-massive MIMO systems
    which are suitable for sub-6 GHz band [76], but complexity increases with an increase
    in carrier frequency. Therefore, new implementation techniques are required to
    implement ultra-massive MIMO on a compact chip that can realize fully digital
    architectures [77]. Key challenges in the implementation of ultra-mMIMO are further
    discussed in Section 5. Download : Download high-res image (542KB) Download :

    overcome the hardware challenges of mMIMO, continuous aperture antennas can be
    used to improve the accuracy of beamforming. Either integration of massive antennas
    in form of compact meta-surface or dense arrangement of discretely spaced antennas
    can be used to implement continuous aperture antennas. However, the first method
    of implementation is limited to passive set-up because it is impossible to offer
    radiofrequency (RF) feed for ultra-dense elements and the second one will have
    high cost and energy consumption if every antenna is attached with a single RF
    chain. Holographic radio can be a solution to implement continuous aperture antennas.
    Holographic radio aims at going beyond mMIMO, being based on low cost, size, weight,
    and low power consumption hardware architectures that provide a transformative
    means of the wireless environment into a programmable smart entity. Holography
    is the recording of spatial electromagnetic field based on the electromagnetic-waves
    interference principle. The target electromagnetic field is rebuilt based on recorded
    information. The main criteria for high-resolution accuracy holography are that
    the holographic recording sensor (i.e., antenna) must be capable of recording
    the continuous wave-front phase of the signal and the reference wave must be strictly
    coherent. Holographic radio enables ultra-high density, ultra-high-resolution
    spatial multiplexing, and holographic imaging-level [13] therefore, it can realize
    continuous aperture antennas effectively. In contrast with the beam-space approach
    in massive MIMO, the holographic radios are effective in using more spatial dimensions
    through the diffraction model established in Huygens’ principle. Holographic radio
    does not have a concept of beams, but rather interference patterns, as the signal
    wave-front is a near-plane wave. Fresnel–Kirchhoff integral describes the spatial
    channel correlation of holographic radio. Additionally, holographic radio does
    not require channel estimation or channel state information (CSI), as interference
    imaging is used to find the RF spectral hologram [41]. 3.3. Millimeter-wave communications
    The bandwidth and the spectral efficiency are two prime capacity governing attributes,
    of a system. The current system faces challenges due to the high-frequency bandwidth.
    Therefore, the investigation of the unused high-frequency bands can prove to be
    beneficial. The mmWave band stretches from 3 GHz to 300 GHz [78]. Due to large
    offered bandwidths, shorter link distances, and weak penetration through walls,
    mmWave technology has become a suitable choice for mobile communications in the
    indoor environment. As per the mmWave channel model [78], the channel gain of
    mmWave band is given as (1) here, and are the array response vectors of uniform
    linear arrays. The and are of the form . The virtual angle of arrival (AOA) and
    virtual angle of departure (AOD) for path from BS to user , is denoted by and
    respectively. Here, are the number of paths between the BS and user , the small-scale
    fading gain on path is denoted by , and represents the complex conjugate of .
    The virtual AOA and AOD are related to the corresponding physical angles as where
    signify the spacing between the antennas, and are the physical and virtual angles
    respectively. The path loss of mmWave channel model [78] at traveled distance
    is given by; (2) where represents the pathloss exponent, denotes Gaussian distribution
    with zero mean and variance. The studies show that the capacity and the data rates
    could be increased multiple times even with a small section of the mmWave band
    [77]. Such high data rates are possible to achieve with the aid of steering antennas
    and mmWave technology. Lately, it is found that mmWave technology of 2.6 GHz frequency
    spectrum can help in boosting the system performance of the current 700 MHz band
    [79]. Therefore, full exploitation of the mmWave band opens tremendous new possibilities
    in capacity hikes. The concept behind mmWave technology is that high bandwidth
    provision opens up possibilities of high data rates and bandwidth expansion, which
    in turn increases the capacity [79]. Blending 6G system architecture with mmWave
    technology will bring fast and smooth system operation. Moreover, cost-effective
    hardware technology, high-gain steerable antennas, can be supported by mmWave
    communication systems. Thus, mmWave technologies have become beneficial for developing
    the next generation of wireless access technology [80], [81]. Research directions
    of mmWave research are presented in Table 10. New hardware developments, together
    with new interference mitigation schemes, and AI algorithms, will further improve
    the quality of the mmWave signal, and improve its performance for 6G. Table 10.

    Global standard agencies and regulatory bodies and such as the FCC [88], ETSI
    [89], and the ITU [90], are in quest of remarks to allot frequency bands above
    95 GHz use cases [91], [92], [93], [94], and some works have been carried out
    in the same direction: • The FCC voted to permit experimental licensing up to
    3 THz and unlicensed applications within the spectrum of 116 GHz and 246 GHz,
    in March 2019. Further, to fast-track the THz technologies’ development, it launched
    Spectrum Horizons License [95]. • Europe Horizon 2020, has funded ICT-09-2017
    cluster and numerous projects, most of which are aiming at THz technologies. •
    Aiming towards THz communication standardization, IEEE formed the IEEE 802.15.3d
    Task Group, the first world-wide wireless communication standard in the frequency
    range of 250–350 GHz. It channelizes the band into 32 channels of 2.16 GHz and
    provides data rates of up to 100 Gb/s. • ITU has classified 0.12THz and 0.2THz
    into wireless communication. • The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications
    of Japan has launched a research program on Key Technology in Terahertz Frequency
    Bands and related work, such as CMOS technology in the THz band. THz communication
    displays different attributes depending on many factors such as channel, antenna
    technology, and device technology. Fig. 9 shows the merits of THz communications.
    Various losses ensue during THz wave communication, as shown in Table 11. 3.4.1.
    Channel propagation The Friis free space path loss model defines the channel propagation
    characteristics: (3) (4) where and denotes receiver and transmitter power respectively,
    denoted antenna gain, is the distance between transmitter and receiver, is effective
    antenna aperture and wavelength is denoted by . According to Friis free space
    Eq. (3) with antenna gain (4), shows that higher frequency links are realizable
    with the low loss [96], [97] with directional antennas at transmitter and receiver
    ends. The THz band channel gain  [98] of user of BS is given as (5) here, denotes
    the antenna gain, denotes path loss at distance away from the BS at frequency
    , is the angle of departure, represents array steering vector which is given by
    (6) where, represents the transpose of matrix A, and is the imaginary unit, i.e.,
    . The non-line of sight (NLoS) paths are formed by scattered, reflected, and diffracted
    signals. Due to weak scattering and diffracting ability in the THz band, these
    paths are generally neglected. The effect of NLoS link can be ignored when LoS
    link is present, as NLoS link pathloss is greater than the line of sight (LoS)
    link path loss [99]. In the THz band, the pathloss explicitly consists of molecular
    absorption loss and spreading loss which cannot be ignored. The pathloss of THz
    signal at frequency and traveled distance is given as follows: (7) here, is the
    wavelength of the carrier frequency and is frequency-dependent medium absorption
    coefficient. The atmospheric attenuation of THz channels is significantly higher
    in water vapor molecules than in air molecules. For ease, only the impact of water
    molecules in atmospheric attenuation is considered in this paper. The frequency
    absorption coefficient parameters are given in [99]. Table 11. Various losses
    ensue during THz wave communication. Channel propagation Description Related work
    Spreading loss The free space path loss intensifies quadratically with frequency,
    if at both link ends reduces with an increase in frequency, and while and are
    frequency-independent. Conversely, this free space path loss decreases quadratically
    with frequency, if at both link ends is kept over frequency [96], [97], [98] Atmospheric
    loss At lower frequencies (below 6 GHz), the atmospheric attenuation is due to
    molecular absorption and is minimal. However, the upshot of Mie scattering becomes
    acute at higher frequencies as the wavelength approaches the size of the particle-like
    dust, rain, snow, or hail. As rain attenuation is significant at frequencies above
    10 GHz and flattens out from 100 GHz to 500 GHz, the frequencies above 100 GHz
    are better immune atmospheric attenuation, and THz waves can propagate through
    minute aerial particulates. Due to atmospheric absorption, few frequency bands
    (183 GHz, 325 GHz, 380 GHz, 450 GHz, 550 GHz, and 760 GHz) suffer higher attenuation
    additional to Friis free space loss. These absorption peaks, due to the effects
    of atmospheric vapor and oxygen molecules and make these bands suitable for short-distance
    secure communication and can even aid in achieving high targeted 6G speeds and
    coverage up to 10 km or beyond in some applications. [99], [100], [101], [102],
    [103], [104], [105], [106], [107], [108], [109] Scattering  The electro-magnetic
    waves at THz frequencies, scatter when they fall on rough surfaces. This is because
    the wavelengths at these frequencies are small and are comparable with the particle
    size of the surface they fall on. [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20],
    [41] Diffraction and shadowing  The diffraction effect reduces with an increase
    in frequencies, as the sharp shadows are created by obstacles in the path of propagation
    and waves are unable to bend. Therefore, diffraction effects are not as prominent
    at THz frequencies. Moreover, shadow fading variance becomes stronger at higher
    frequencies, as a result of greater diffraction loss. [13], [14], [15], [16],
    [17], [18], [19], [20], [41] Scintillation effects  Rapid modifications of radio
    waves caused by variations in atmospheric temperature and pressure is called scintillation.
    It affects the power and phase of the beams. As a consequence, free-space optical
    communication is greatly affected by scintillation, whereas THz frequencies are
    less susceptible to it. [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [41] 3.4.2.
    Antenna technology With High gain steered directional antennas, the effects of
    atmospheric attenuation can be alleviated as gain and directivity intensifies
    quadratically with the frequency for a fixed as given in (4). Therefore, future
    networks can work fine up to 800 GHz using the small cell or with LOS propagation,
    or with support of strong reflectors. These highly directional antennas transmit
    a “pencil” beam which makes interception difficult and hence, aids in providing
    secure communication. J. N. Murdock et al. in [110] proposed the consumption factor
    (CF) theory which provides quantitative analysis tools and design approaches for
    investigating the power trade-offs, in communication systems. The CF theory proves
    that with fixed antenna aperture, mmWave and THz frequencies harvests enhanced
    energy efficiency and much wider bandwidth on (bps/W) basis, as compared to sub-6
    GHz band networks [110], [111]. Download : Download high-res image (429KB) Download

    Device technology In the absence of compact high-power transmitters and high-sensitivity
    receivers, working at ambient temperatures is a challenge for THz communications.
    Many recent developments are cooperatively serving to overcome this challenge.
    For example, the DARPA T-MUSIC program is exploring CMOS/SOI, SiGe HBT, and BiCMOS
    circuit integration, to realize power amplifier with and commercial transceivers
    at threshold frequencies of 500–750 GHz [112]. The small wavelength of THz frequencies
    offers small antennas sizes. Although, the challenges posed in encapsulating a
    vast number of antennas in a small area and improving power efficiency for network
    operations above 100 GHz frequency bands may need new approaches to transceiver
    designs in 6G. Table 12 highlights research directions in THz device technology.
    3.5. Intelligent reflecting surfaces With the increase in the carrier frequency,
    the propagation loss also increases due to reduced scattering and larger penetration
    loss. Moreover, the antenna size shrinks with the increase in carrier frequency
    which makes coherent operation of antenna arrays difficult. To overcome these
    problems intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) can prove to be beneficial, as
    they direct the beam towards the desired direction by regulating the scattering
    of the incoming signal in a controlled manner [127]. The IRS reduces co-channel
    interference, achieves high beamforming gains and increases the DoF, and is real-time
    reconfigurable, such properties of IRS make it an important technology for 6G
    wireless networks [69], [128]. As IRS does not require RF chains, it can be more
    economical, less complex, and more energy-efficient as compared to traditional
    active MIMO arrays. The programmability and flexibility of adjusting real-time
    coefficients in the IRS can also aid in maximizing energy efficiency and spectral
    efficiency, and providing secured communication [129], [130], [131]. The IRS can
    be coated on indoor walls, outdoor buildings, or can be mounted on arbitrary surfaces,
    this makes it easily integrable with any application scenario. The IRS can be
    interpreted as a relay [132] that reflects the incident signal. The IRS can be
    used to improve the propagation where relaying is not readily available such as
    sub-THz and THz bands. It can provide improved propagation environments even in
    blocked LoS path and increased the channel rank in NLoS path for achieving full
    multiplexing gain [41]. IRS can also aid in achieving the ERLLC requirements of
    6G. An IRS-assisted grant-free access technology combined with advanced receivers
    such as the MMSE, zero-forcing, and the MMSE-successive interference cancellation
    receivers, has been explored by D. C. Melgarejo et al. in [133], for achieving
    latency and reliability solutions for an industrial control scenario, in future
    generations. Table 13. Research directions of ultra-mMIMO, mmWave communication,

    it provides a uniform quality of services, low-complexity signal processing, and
    seamless handover services regardless of user positions [134], [135], [136], [137].
    Cell-free mMIMO refers to a distributed mMIMO system. In a cell-free mMIMO system,
    all the access points (APs) coherently cooperate to serve the users in the same
    time/frequency resource, mitigate the multi-user interference and reduce inter-cell
    interference [138], by executing joint transmission and exploiting local CSI.

    optimal power allocation scheme in the sub-6 GHz band maximizes the global downlink
    energy efficiency for cell-free mmWave mMIMO systems. [142] To maximize energy
    efficiency in a cell-free mMIMO system The proposed iterative power-allocation
    algorithm performs better than the case of equal power allocation, in uplink cell-free
    mMIMO systems, under consideration of the effects of quantization distortion,
    channel estimation error, and constraints of throughput, backhaul capacity, and
    per-user power requirement, [143] To optimize the uplink and downlink power control
    coefficients to minimize the total transmit energy consumption in a cell-free
    mMIMO IoT system The cell-free IoT outstrips mMIMO and small-cell IoT in terms
    of both downlink and uplink 95% likely performances. The proposed joint power
    control shows significant gains in terms of both per-user throughput and energy
    consumption. All the APs, are linked to one central processing unit (CPU) which
    is accounts for coordination and data processing in a cell-free system. In a multi-cell
    system, a user will choose a cell, for cellular access based on the strength of
    the received synchronization signals and will suffer from interference offered
    by the neighboring cells. Whereas, in a cell-free system, a user will attempt
    to access a network where all the neighboring APs are supporting the access. Though,
    it is impractical to connect all the APs to a single CPU to serve a single user
    jointly and simultaneously, if the cell-free mMIMO network becomes infinitely
    large. Authors in [139], try to solve this problem through data transmission and
    power control techniques, in a scalable cell-free mMIMO framework, where several
    CPUs serve disjoint AP clusters. The cell-free system for 6G aims to leverage
    technologies like mMIMO, small cells, VLC, CoMP, to achieve uniform data rates
    across the network coverage. Fig. 10 shows a conventional cell-based and cell-free
    system model. Table 13 shows a review of ultra-mMIMO, mmWave communication, THz
    communication, IRS, and cell-free mMIMO technologies. Table 14 provides a review
    of the researches on cell-free systems. 3.7. Quantum algorithms The nano-scale
    elements (i.e., electrons, photons) governed through principles of quantum, in
    terms of binary logic can be adjusted to optimize communication protocols [144].
    The Quantum version of the logical binary bit is referred to as Quantum bit or
    qubit. It represents the horizontal or vertical polarization of a photon or up
    and down spins of an electron. For example; a polarized proton of can be represented
    as (8) where and are horizontal and vertical polarizations of the proton respectively,
    and and are amplitudes of a quantum state, which can be adjusted, provided (9)
    Due to Quantum properties, Quantum algorithms can provide robust security. Quantum
    computation and ML tools can be combined to form Quantum ML to utilize joint benefits
    of both in 6G communication systems [145]. Download : Download high-res image

    the mathematical and statistical models used to design wireless networks need
    expert knowledge for processes like coding, modulation, and detection. In practical
    scenarios, hardware impairments, time variations due to high mobility, delay,
    and other factors can lead to signal distortions. Hence, perfect information of
    system characteristics cannot be found. Therefore, conventional designs may not
    always work well in practical scenarios. AI provides a new way of designing wireless
    networks with big data training to enhance its performance even with imperfect
    system characteristic information. Therefore, AI will be one of the prime technologies
    of 6G. AI is the intelligence applied by machines to perform a task that includes
    learning, perception, reasoning, planning, problem-solving, and manipulation.
    6G networks will mandate intelligent use of control, computing, and storage from
    the network core to edge. The AI can be integrated with different layers of OSI
    to replace or transform features that require expert knowledge, for example; AI-enabled
    autoencoders in the physical layer, AI-enabled security enhancements, and resource
    allocation in the data-link layer, and AI-enabled mobility management and load
    balancing in the network layer. The three prime applications of 6G which can be
    supported by AI are big data analysis, automated and closed-loop optimization,
    and intelligent wireless communication [11]. The AI-assisted big data analysis
    can aid performance, fault, behavior, and decision analysis of network operations.
    The AI-assisted automated and closed-loop optimization can support optimization
    in extremely dynamic application scenarios. The AI-assisted intelligent wireless
    communication can help in end-to-end network optimization and mitigating the effects
    of hardware impairments. AI can also be used to predict the development, infection
    rate, and spread of epidemic such as COVID-19 [144]. Fig. 11 shows the broad sub-branches
    of AI; which are ML, DL, and meta-learning. Further classification of ML is shown
    in Appendix B. Table 15 shows a research directions of artificial intelligence,
    learning, and quantum algorithms. Download : Download high-res image (101KB) Download

    Due to the limitations of modeling and algorithmic deficiencies of the conventional
    model-driven algorithm, data-driven ML is gaining research interest lately [146].
    The conventional model-driven approach is ideal when the underlying models are
    accurate. However, when the system operates in a complex and unfamiliar propagation
    environment, the conventional model-driven approach lacks effective modeling.
    Therefore, in such scenarios incorporating ML can be beneficial. In ML, a machine
    can learn, operate, and enhance its operations, based on the attained operational
    knowledge and experience. With the growing demands of connectivity, a lot of innovation
    is required for 6G networks, and tools of ML can play a key role in resolving
    problems in wireless systems. Table 15. Research directions in artificial intelligence,

    Comparison between VLC communication and THz Communication. 3.8.2. Deep learning
    DL is also a subbranch of ML, in which the input data passed through deeply connected
    multiple system layers to learn intelligence and compute the output, with a peculiarly
    higher level of complexity. A DL system learns high levels of data feature abstraction
    automatically. DL is considered an intelligent tool in many communication applications
    to increase the efficiency, automation, and computation power of the system, for
    instance; beamforming technique optimization, radio resource management, mMIMO
    system sum-rate maximization. 3.8.3. Meta-learning Meta-learning is also a subbranch
    of ML, in which learning is through experiences, meta-data, and observing how
    ML approaches learning tasks. Meta-learning is also referred to as ‘learning to
    learn’. It is much faster than conventional techniques that can replace hand-engineered
    algorithms with data-driven approaches [176]. The ML algorithms are constructed
    to learn to predict a certain output, through examples. Behavior learning is challenging,
    especially when prior knowledge and full identification of the system are not
    available. In [178], DNN and Meta-model algorithms are used for quantum assisted
    teleportation, indoor localization, channel capacity enhancements, channel estimation
    and detection, cryptography, multi-user detection, precoding, routing, and load
    balancing algorithm optimization. 3.9. Optical wireless communications The optical
    wireless communication system is a promising technology in 6G communication systems
    for simultaneously supporting multiple users and providing high data rates into
    the tens of Tb/s [180]. Moreover, optical wireless communication is an effective
    alternative for underwater communications, to overcome all the limitations associated
    with acoustic communication and permit an extensive adoption of underwater monitoring
    systems [181]. As the radio resources are limited, VLC also referred to as Light
    Fidelity (LiFi) can provide an edge in the 6G communication systems. VLC uses
    Visible Light for communications. This benefits the system by offering extremely
    high bandwidths. Moreover, it does not get affected by electromagnetic radiation,
    therefore providing robustness against electro-magnetic interference [18]. The
    unique characteristics of VLC, such as large accessibility to unlicensed spectrum,
    safety, security, privacy, cost-effectivity, and implementation simplicity in
    many cases make it lucrative for 6G [182]. The main user scenarios of VLC are
    indoor and underwater communications whereas, outdoor scenarios e.g., vehicular
    communications, are also interesting use cases. The comparison of VLC and THz
    communication techniques is shown in Fig. 12. In the direction of the development
    of hardware, A. A. C. Alves et al. in [183] designed plasmonic nano-antennas,
    as optical emitters and receivers, for 6G Intra/inter-chip optical wireless communications,
    at 474 THz. Rather than replacing, VLC is intended to complement the existing
    technologies. LiFi systems have the potential to provide high data rates, but
    this system cannot guarantee zero data rate outage probability. A hybrid RF LiFi
    system can overcome such challenges and improve the outage probability with data
    rate performance. Moreover, the throughput of the hybrid RF VLC system is high
    because of the non-overlap between the two technology resources [184], [185].
    Hence, hybrid RF VLC systems can ripe the advantages of, high data rates, user
    experience, and throughput. Table 16 research directions in VLC technology. Table

    throughput Security [182], [186], [187], [188], [189] • Physical layer security
    and confidentiality 3.10. Non-orthogonal multiple access The issue with the conventionally
    used multiple access techniques is the inability to efficiently utilize natural
    radio resources as they use a user-exclusively approach for resource allocation.
    Therefore, the spectral efficiency of conventional systems is incapable to meet
    the high capacity demands of 6G systems. NOMA, on the other hand, deploys a single
    radio resource to serve multiple users [190]. Therefore, it helps in significantly
    increasing the spectral efficiency and fairness of the system. The prime benefits
    of NOMA over OMA are massive connectivity, high spectral efficiency, and enhanced
    capacity due to the effective utilization of the radio resources, reduced latency
    due to simultaneous communication with multiple users, improved fairness through
    efficient resource allocation. Such advantages of NOMA make it a promising technology
    for 6G communication systems. Download : Download high-res image (283KB) Download

    the merits, recently many application-based researchers conducted on NOMA and
    its collaboration with other schemes for offering great potential to provision
    the mMTC, URLLC, ultra-high bandwidth, massive connectivity, enhanced system performance
    and reduced implementation cost, multi-user interference, and complexity. For
    instance; D. Marasinghe et al. in [83] collaborate NOMA with mmWave technology,
    to maximize the rates for 5G and beyond networks, while supporting minimum QoS
    for all users, with help of ML to automatically identify the optimal number of
    clusters. Fig. 13 shows a two-user downlink NOMA network. Table 17 shows research
    directions of optical wireless communication, NOMA, and molecular communication.
    3.11. Molecular communication Molecular communication uses molecules (i.e., biochemical
    signals) as an information medium and allows artificially created nano- or microscale
    entities to communicate over a short distance. There are several environments
    where electromagnetic waves based on wireless communication are not efficient
    or even feasible. For such environments, a possible solution for information transfer
    is molecular communications [191]. Electromagnetic communications face challenges
    at nanoscale dimensions because they are restricted by the ratio of antenna size
    to wavelength, and are not reliable for scenarios such as gas pipelines or underground
    tunnels because of high propagation path loss. Whereas, the power consumed for
    generation and propagation in molecular communications is minimal and molecular
    communications are highly dynamic [192]. These signals are characteristically
    small particles of a range of few nanometers or micrometers which generally propagate
    through a gaseous or an aqueous medium. Due to this property, molecular communications
    have attracted the application of nanotechnology [193] to biomedicines [194].
    The molecular signals are biocompatible [195] Hence, this makes molecular communications
    suitable for 6G intrabody networks [196]. For tasks such as intelligent drug delivery
    [197], Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) [198], body organ monitoring, Body
    Area Network (BAN), etc., which employs biochemical molecules for information
    transfer and communication among nanodevices [196], molecular communication is
    an enabling technique for 6G. 3.12. Edge intelligence Mobile devices have become
    a crucial element of IoT applications. However, mobile devices have limited batteries,
    computational capabilities, and storage, which limits the capabilities of these
    devices for the implementation of computation-intensive applications. Therefore,
    MEC and mobile cloud computing (MCC) are emerging techniques to address the aforementioned
    issues. MEC and MCC computing will be combined into edge intelligence to play
    a key role in 6G, to support their performance, their new functionalities, and
    services [199]. 3.12.1. Mobile edge computing and mobile cloud computing In the
    future, with an increase in the number of IoT devices, the implementation of a
    smart city will become complex and will require massive computational resources
    and ultra-low latency. MCC can support such requirements effectively by offloading
    complex tasks from mobile equipment to clouds whereas, MEC can save power and
    decrease data transmission latency by providing timely services [200]. Edge intelligence
    in 6G will significantly contribute to performance improvements, ultra-low latency
    services, traffic optimization and will enable the development of a whole new
    category of services and products. Edge intelligence allows data analysis near
    or at the point of data generation, which reduces cost, latency, security risks.

    Fog computing is a technology complementary to cloud computing to support computing
    capacity limitations and networking bottlenecks in IoT applications. Fog computing
    is a decentralized computing infrastructure in which the computational, acceleration,
    storage, and data are placed not only at the network layers but at the network
    edge as well. It is designed in a distributed, on-demand, multi-tier, and conceivably
    cooperative way, to realize the concept of “computing everywhere” [203]. Fog computing
    can be employed to support various applications such as smart farming, secure
    data collection, monitoring the Ocean of Things (OoT), Internet of Vehicles (IoV),
    etc. In the elementary form, edge-intelligence involves a high amount of capacity
    to filter information and data processing, on the edge. However, with increasing
    echelons of AI at the edge, each node can be supported with AI features, to progressively
    learn and possibly share the learnings on other edge nodes. This can collectively
    provide new optimized or value-added services. Hence, it can be envisaged that
    the evolution of telecom infrastructures towards 6G, will contemplate highly distributed
    AI, shifting the intelligence from the central to cloud edge computing resources.

    networks because of the fortes to support massive connectivity, security and eliminates
    both computational and storage restrictions of cryptographic algorithms. It provides
    secure access to critical data to various network entities and tamper-proofing
    of distributed ledger’s content [207]. It provides unified authorization and authentication
    by enabling the integration of individual systems developed by different operators
    [208]. 6G faces challenges of high-security risk, massive connectivity, high interoperability
    and integration issues, restricted device resources, and high data consumption.
    Blockchain is one of the most eminent technologies to unleash the potential of
    6G systems [209], attributable to some attractive features such as decentralization
    through the elimination of the central trusted third parties and intermediaries,
    non-repudiation of the transactions, improves system availability by enhancing
    robustness against attacks like distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack [210],
    [211]. Apart from security, the decentralized control empowered by blockchains
    reduces administrative cost due to the enabled direct communication links between
    the network entities [212]. It provides immutability of the distributed record’s
    content [213] reduction in both processing cost and delay, and transparency with
    anonymity, intelligent resource management, and high scalability features [214].

    services are programmed as virtual mechanisms in all control, data, and management
    plane. Dynamic programming enables network elements to create new functionality
    at run time according to the execution environment [224]. The 6G communication
    systems are expected to advance the network’s flexibility and robustness. Such
    dynamic network programmatically and system management is unviable by humans.
    To support 6G network autonomy and to apprehend insights into the environment,
    intelligent and adaptive ML algorithms can be beneficial. Hence, future 6G networks
    are based on the principles of self-learning, self-aggregation, self-organization,
    self-optimization, self-reconfiguration, self-healing, and self-protection, which
    can be supported by SDN and NVF. Table 20 shows research directions in intelligence,
    security, and programmability levels. Download : Download high-res image (347KB)

    Software-defined networking One of the important requirements of 6G, according
    to its use cases, is flexibility. SDN technology can empower system flexibility
    and robustness and optimal deployment of various security operations. One of the
    key elements in designing 6G architecture is 3D global integration. For enhancing
    the performance of the 6G networks, the satellite–terrestrial networks can use
    SDN [225]. Intelligent transportation systems are deployed in smart cities, for
    abating traffic congestion and enhance transportation efficiency. In such environments,
    SDN can expand the scalability of intelligent transportation systems [226]. SDN
    technology can be used to aid moving target defense mechanisms to thwart a potential
    attacker by shuffling the host’s network configurations [227]. 3.14.2. Network
    function virtualization The NFV is a network architecture that enables the virtualization
    of the complete classes of network node functions. Evolution in healthcare, industrial
    automation, haptic interaction, and other such services which are supported by
    Mission-Critical IoT technology have diverse requirements. NFV architecture is
    a promising technology to support such diverse Mission-Critical IoT services [228].
    NVF is an attractive solution that switches from dedicated hardware-based infrastructure
    to software-based programs running in a virtual environment. This makes it lucrative
    for delay-sensitive applications [229], [230], [231]. Virtual network embedding
    will be a key technology for resource management in the control plane and data
    plane in 6G. NFV orchestrators play a significant role in managing and orchestrating
    various Virtual Network Functions (VNF), optimally and dynamically. Fig. 16 shows
    the comparison between SDN and NFV. The 6G environments will have a dynamic workload
    therefore, the user resource allocation needs to be adaptive and flexible. Hence,
    the 6G networks need harmonization of cloud, SDN, and NFV technologies to support
    diverse applications and services in an ultra-fast and flexible way [232], [233],
    [234], [235]. Table 20. Research directions in intelligence, security, and programmability.

    symbiotic radio (SR), Intelligent Radio (IR), Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing
    (GFDM), and OAM. Table 21 shows research directions in spectrum and multiplexing
    technologies. 3.15.1. Symbiotic radio The ambient backscattering assists the IoT
    data transmission. In ambient backscattering, neither cellular AP nor cellular
    user identify whether an IoT device is present [236], [237], [238]. This lack
    of cooperation leads to interference between IoT and cellular transmissions. On
    the other hand, the SR integrates ambient backscattering and cellular data transmission
    to achieve mutually beneficial performance. SR is one of the most recent evolutions
    in spectrum sharing and Cognitive Radio (CR), which enables simultaneous transmissions
    of both cellular and IoT data [239], [240]. Hence, it is envisaged as a new promising
    technique for the 6G networks. SR has two prime benefits; first, the need for
    dedicated spectrum resources is alleviated through simultaneous IoT and cellular
    data transmission. Second, the cost of IoT devices is reduced as the active RF
    components are not used at IoT transmitters in SR. Let us consider a scenario
    of uplink transmission of a signal from a cellular user to cellular AP through
    a direct signal propagation path, and an IoT device is employing ambient backscattering
    to send data to an IoT AP. The data of the IoT device is first modulated over
    the received cellular radio signal and then reflects the signal to IoT AP through
    ambient backscattering [241]. Fig. 17 represents the difference between CR and
    Intelligent radio. Fig. 18 shows two network topologies of SR, depending on whether
    or not the cellular AP and IoT AP share the infrastructure. The uplink SR model
    with a common Cellular/IoT AP and uplink SR model with two different cellular
    and IoT APs shows that both the cellular AP and IoT AP can simultaneously receive
    direct and reflected signals, from the cellular device and IoT device respectively.
    Both the direct and the reflected signal contains cellular data and, while the
    IoT data is contained in only the reflected signal. Both cellular and IoT transmissions
    are achieved through data extraction at the cellular and IoT APs. The SR empowers
    intelligent cooperation amongst multiple subsystems of wireless communications
    for efficient resource sharing. In SR, the BS serves multiple cellular users and
    each IoT device is associated with one cellular user for information transmission.
    However, the research on SR is at the infant stage, and the problem in user association
    is to link each IoT device to an appropriate cellular user, for sum-rate maximization.
    However, it is difficult to obtain the full real-time CSI hence, this user association
    problem becomes difficult to optimize. To address this problem, deep reinforcement
    learning-based algorithms, are developed in [242] and a constellation learning-based
    algorithm is proposed in [243], to eliminate the need for CSI estimation. 3.15.2.
    Intelligent radio The CR makes adaptive changes in configurations to improve spectrum
    utilization by learning the radio environment. The CR is a natural choice in predictable
    and simple radio environments. However, the 6G radio environment will be unpredictable
    and complex. Therefore, it needs an IR that can adapt according to the environment
    [11]. IR deploys AI agents. When compared with the cognitive agent, the AI agent
    is more powerful in terms of learning, predicting, reasoning, and decision capabilities.
    Motivated by the outstanding performance of AI technologies and powerful learning
    abilities in both simulation and in-field experiments [169], [244], [245], 6G
    is expected to evolve from cognitive to intelligent communications by using AI
    tools. Download : Download high-res image (429KB) Download : Download full-size

    different cellular and IoT APs (right). 3.15.3. Generalized frequency division
    multiplexing GFDM is a block-based flexible non-orthogonal multicarrier modulation.
    It is based on the filter bank concept but is implemented digitally [246]. GFDM
    is an attractive approach due to some features like low out-of-band (OoB) emission,
    simple equalization, flexible bandwidth, and effective deployment in scenarios
    having a high degree of spectrum fragmentation. High spectral efficiency and simplified
    equalization are achieved in GFDM through the insertion of a cyclic prefix (CP)
    to the entire block rather than in each time slot. To flexibly exploit the vacant
    spectrum, the conventional multiplexing techniques used to switch subcarriers
    on and off, but had the problem of strong spectral leakage. GFDM combines the
    simplicity and flexibility of orthogonal modulations with robust interference
    mitigation. The reduced OoB emission in GFDM is a consequence of the pulse-shaping
    filter. Therefore, it becomes an attractive choice for non-contiguous frequency
    bands and offers opportunities to use spectrum white spaces for communication.
    The operation of cognitive GFDM full-duplex radios is analyzed over a spectrum
    hole in [247], with adjacent channel interference and RF impairments. Moreover,
    the OoB emission and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) can be further reduced
    through a combination of GFDM and NOMA techniques [248]. In [249], N-continuous
    GFDM signaling is proposed to achieve sidelobe suppression and improved bit error
    rate (BER). Multiple subcarriers in GFDM individually carry sub-symbols, produced
    in multiple time slots. Each subcarrier is pulse-shaped using circular convolution,
    with a prototype filter at the transmitter. The flexibility of GFDM relates to
    the DoF weighted by the number of both sub-symbols and subcarriers, and the prototype
    filter [250]. However, in the GFDM demodulation noise enhancements occur due to
    the non-orthogonal nature of the waveform, which causes performance degradation.
    In [251], a study is conducted to find the effects of prototype filter shape and,
    several sub-symbols and subchannels on the noise enhancement factor of GFDM. Moreover,
    OoB emission, BER, and effectiveness of pulse shaping of GFDM through prototype
    filters are analyzed in [252]. GFDM has several advantages like high flexibility
    and low OoB emission and yet, sometimes the intrinsic ICI and low signal-to-noise
    ratio (SNR), can diminish the performance. To address this issue and enhance PAPR,
    a Spread spectrum-based GFDM is introduced in [253], which extends the frequency,
    time, and code domain freedom of access. 3.15.4. Orbital angular momentum The
    foundation of the present wireless communication systems is the electromagnetic
    waves which are planners in nature and have linear momentum. On the other hand,
    OAM has a helical phase [254], which can prove as a potential resource modulation
    scheme for 6G wireless communications. OAM has a vast number of topological charges
    referred to as OAM modes or OAM states. The OAM of the electromagnetic wave can
    be characterized as , where is azimuth angle and is an unbounded integer representing
    OAM mode [255]. This means OAM modes exhibit orthogonality with each other. OAM
    modes can be multiplexed and demultiplexed together, bestow capacity enhancements
    in the 6G. These orthogonal electromagnetic waves can be multiplexed on the same
    frequency channel by utilizing the angular momentum of electromagnetic waves as
    new DoF, to achieve high spectral efficiency. Though employing OAM multiplexing,
    high spectral efficiency, very high capacity [256], [257], [258] and low complexity
    wireless systems can be built over a few meters [259]. Few types of research have
    proved that cooperative multiplexing between OAM and other modulation techniques
    like OFDM [260], [261], [262], [263] and NOMA [264] can further enhancements in
    capacities, rates, spectral efficiency, and abate complexity. To support optical
    communications and near-infrared applications, including chip-to-chip, quantum,
    free-space optics, and underwater communications [265], presents spiral phase
    plates structure to generate OAM beams. The OAM performance metric for a relatively
    short distance is investigated in [266] for industrial automation, which reported,
    more than 2.5 Tbps rates with 95.7 bps/Hz spectral efficiency by integration with
    mmWave. This shows OAM can be beneficial for Industry 4.0 which is envisioned
    as one of the key 6G use cases. 3.15.5. Integrated sensing and communications
    (ISAC) Integrated and co-design sensing and communications (ISAC) has recently
    attracted researchers’ and wireless industries’ interest to design become perceptive
    networks [267]. The prime aim of ISAC is, to deeply integrate and co-design sensing
    and communications and track their tradeoffs and mutual benefits. ISAC first gathers
    the sensing information from noisy data and communicates the information through
    explicitly customized signals and then convalesce it from a noisy background,
    for processing the information [267]. Sensing information can be collected ubiquitously
    from the environment to offer numerous services for example, human motion identification,
    monitoring the traffic, and observing the weather. ISAC has various applications
    that can be used in 6G such as highly accurate 6G localization and tracking of
    both pinpoint location and surrounding environment, humidity and particle concentrations
    monitoring for mmWave and THz communication, human computer interactions, Industrial
    IoT, land imaging, monitoring and management through UAV, intelligent interactive
    indoor applications in smart homes, ultra-reliable ultra-low latency smart manufacturing
    in industries, V2X communication supporting quick vehicle flocking, protected
    and seamless access, radar high-resolution all-weather imaging and remote sensing
    service used in geoscience and SLAM. The waveform of ISAC is dual-functional competent
    of both sensing and communication through resource sharing to achieve integration
    gain. Based on this gain the waveform can be either designed through time-/frequency-/spatial-/code-division
    method or fully unified one. Table 22. Potential 6G technologies and potential

    advancements for 6G To ensure in-time seamless availability of the right computational
    capabilities 6G will need hardware acceleration. Smart fabrics such as FPGA, GPU,
    TPU, analog computing chips, and SoCs, and construction of an entirely new set
    of tools, models, computing algorithms, models, and platforms would help to increase
    the degree of flexibility in 6G. The use of high frequencies bands in 6G will
    require components of chipset density, that will increase complexity. Nano-antennas
    and novel antenna designs can address the envisioned hardware challenges in the
    6G system designs. A. A. C. Alves et al. in [183], present an efficient technological
    solution for 6G in form of plasmonic nano-antennas. Authors set up a nano-link
    at 474 THz, in four different scenarios using the horn and antenna nano-antenna
    designs, for ultralong intra/inter-chip 6G optical wireless communications. The
    observations in the paper show that, through plasmon resonances, the antenna receiver
    can boost the power level at the received, achieving an ultralong nano-link of
    32 A, and improving 40 dB in the link budget. F. Zanella et al. in [268], studied
    plasmonic charge distribution for modeling nano-antennas for 6G at THz frequencies.
    For the predicting and analyzing the physical behavior of THz device operation,
    the authors use a generalized substrate and boundary-free mathematical model,
    observing plasmonic resonances up to 47 THz as a function of temperature, in the
    range of 30 to 300 K. Employing a 3 × 3 dipole antenna array M. Kokkonen et al.
    in [269], studied different permittivity (high and low) 5G/6G lenses to manipulate
    the electric field emitted by the antennas, and their effect on the antenna gain.
    M. Salehi et al. in [270], studied cache-enabled multi-antenna communications,
    empowered by both, sub-packetization and beamformer structure, to enhance the
    achievable data rates. Z. Siddiqui et al. in [271], studied dual-band dual-polarized
    antenna design procedures, for mmWave communication, operating in the frequency
    range from 24.25 GHz up to 40 GHz. The 6G needs to increase the chipset density
    and go towards miniaturization of hardware components. A. Sethi et al. in [271],
    used 45 nm CMOS SOI technology, to develop an active RF phase shifter design for
    tuning polyphase filter, allowing operation in 22 GHz to 40 GHz frequency range,
    and occupying 0.2 active area. Potential 6G technologies and potential 6G advancements/algorithms
    are summarized in Table 22. 4. 6G architecture Towards 2030, the transition from
    5G to 6G will be a sequential process for several verticals. So, the 6G ecosystem
    should be perceived with an integrative approach to numerous ecosystem conceptions.
    As defined in [273], the ecosystem is a historic self-organized or managed multilayer
    social network, to run a service system, consisting of actors which have different
    decision principles and attributes. This section puts light on questions on 6G
    architecture such as: What is lacking in previous architectures and why there
    is a requirement of new Architecture? The first 6G summit was organized in March
    2019, by Finnish 6G Flagship Program, in Levi, Finland, with a 6G white paper
    workshop with the participation of academia, operators, regulators, vertical businesses,
    and infrastructure manufacturers to draft the first 6G white paper [274]. It was
    followed by the second 6G summit in March 2020, for detailed mapping of global
    6G research vision, 33 presentations are published either in video format or as
    slides with an audio track, leading to global experts and multiple technical papers.
    In 6G, the employment of edge cloud computing interfaces and elements will grow
    in an immediate information service, which cannot be fetched through centralized
    search engines. The edge intelligence service platform can be used for framing
    highly dynamic and local resources, information, and service market. Such a marketplace
    can maximize economic value through increasing infrastructure utilization, and
    efficiently matching supply and demand, within the industry. Features such as
    on-demand network scaling, anywhere and anytime network, and self-evolving network
    functions, will be considered in the design of 6G networks. All the network nodes
    should be homogeneous, this will allow most of the traffic and devices to employ
    resources at the edge of the network. All the terminals should be allowed to enter
    and exit freely and easily, to make the 6G network ultra-scalable. To fulfill
    dynamic contextual and event-defined requirements, AI and ML are envisaged to
    play a prime role. It will also aid in connecting business-level solutions and
    network services, through self-configuration self-optimization, and self-orchestration
    of virtual resources, with fewer human interventions. The roles of operators and
    stakeholders will change, to bring demand and supply together. Distributed ledger
    technology may give rise to innovations in organizing data and resource markets
    or maintaining trust in an inter-stakeholder setting. To ensure sustainability,
    inclusion, and transparency, new techniques of resource sharing and matching will
    emerge. Ultimately, regulations will assist the emergence of a new wireless system
    [275]. Fig. 19 shows a comparison of 5G and 6G architecture key points. The intelligent
    autonomous architecture of 6G will be able to intelligently manage network configuration
    based on predefined multiple choices in a deterministic manner. Intelligent interpretation,
    prophecy, and decision based on real-time data, and numerous latency applications
    need the ability to identify and adapt to unexpected environments. Therefore,
    future communication network needs to be self-adaptive, self-aware, and self-interpretive.
    Closed-loop automation in 6G will aid, descend the complexity of orchestration
    and service management with ZSM, and 100 percent operation automation, bringing
    self-optimization, self-healing, and self-protection capabilities in the network.

    Fig. 19. Comparison of 5G and 6G architecture key points, ZSM: zero-touch network
    and service management. 4.1. 3D network integration With the expansion of smart
    homes, cities, and societies, and with the growth of robotic and autonomous systems,
    the demands for integration of machine-to-machine and human-to-machine in terms
    of communications, will increase. Therefore, for realizing IoE, the 6G networks
    will be ultra-dense and super flexible. The 6G will dexterously integrate various
    techniques to simultaneously fulfill diverse service requirements. Moreover, 6G
    will integrate space, aerial networks, terrestrial and underwater networks for
    achieving 3D global connectivity. The 6G aims to provide full wireless coverage
    and make a large-dimension-space–air–ground–underwater network. • Space Network
    Segment This segment can provide orbit broadband Internet access services with
    the support of high throughput satellite systems, in Ku, Ka, Q, V, W, etc., frequency
    bands, with frequency reuse factor of 4, 8, etc., and can achieve a transmission
    distance of about 600 km [17]. Through the dense deployment of satellites including
    pseudo-satellites, low-Earth orbit (LEO), medium earth orbit (MEO), and geostationary-Earth
    orbit (GEO) satellites, it will provide communications in unserved and under-served
    areas by terrestrial networks. While, Non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) satellites
    can provide high data rates, low-latency Internet services [18]. Some research
    investigations and projects have been carried out on such networks, such as the
    Global Information Grid (GIG) [43], [44], SpaceX [275], Oneweb [276], etc. Whereas,
    the launch of a few satellite constellations in the future are already been planned.
    Authorized by the FCC, SpaceX plans to launch a satellite constellation named
    Starlink [277] and its full deployment is expected in 2027. This constellation
    will consist of 7518 VLEO and 4425 LEO satellites. OneWeb is another satellite
    constellation authorized by UK and FCC, with 720 LEO satellites [277], from which
    6 satellites have been successfully launched on February 27, 2019. By 2015, China
    Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) has planned to complete the
    Hongyan satellite constellation, consisting of 320 satellites. Co-routing the
    LEO network, with technologies like laser communication, mmWave communication,
    and RF can prove beneficial in providing lower latency communications for distances
    greater than 3000 km, as compared to terrestrial optical fiber networks [279].
    Information-Centric Networking (ICN) and SDN have been introduced into a space–terrestrial
    integrated network to increase the efficiency of network configuration, flexibility
    in network control, and lowering the request delay [280]. A space–terrestrial
    integrated network architecture containing GEO satellites space-based backbone
    network is presented and, LEO and MEO satellites space-based access networks is
    presented in [281], aimed to guarantee reliable connectivity and extending space–ground
    coverage. • Aerial Network Segment The aerial network can be largely classified
    into two classes, high altitude platforms (HAP) and low altitude platforms (LAP),
    which generally operate in the stratosphere and several kilometers respectively.
    HAP can support wider coverage and LAP can support rapidly deploying and reconfigurable
    short-range communication [282]. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) LAP can be deployed
    as flying BSs or relay nodes for supporting long-distance or emergency communications.
    A model of integrated vertical architecture is presented in [283], integrating
    LEO satellite, GEO satellite, HAPs, and UAV-based LAPs in a network. Aerial networks
    generally work in low-frequency mmWave or microwave bands. Through the dense deployment
    of flying or floating BSs like LAP and HAP respectively, a reliable and flexible
    communication connection can be provided in remote areas or emergencies. The flying
    BSs can support the integration of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks, and
    floating BSs can support the integration of space networks and flying BSs. Due
    to features like cost-effective deployment and reliable connection, UAV communication
    technology has the potential to meet the staggering demands of cellular users.
    Therefore, UAV trajectory routing designs have been proposed to enhance energy
    efficiency [284], [285], [286], [287], and joint trajectory routing and user scheduling
    schemes are proposed in [288], [289]. The position of the UAV impacts the LOS
    connectivity and QoS. Recently, the effects of RF channels, FSO to the ground
    station (GS) backhaul link, and channel modeling, on the UAV’s positioning are
    analyzed [290], [291]. • Terrestrial Network Segment For most human activities
    terrestrial networks will continue to be the prime wireless coverage, solution
    provider. Terrestrial networks generally have a 300–500 m cell radius, and transmission
    distance of about 1 km, and a frequency reuse factor of 1 [17]. To provide services
    of the Tbps rate, the THz band will be exploited. Thus, technologies like mmWave
    communication, VLC can provide cellular traffic offloading. In future 6G wireless
    communication, the spectrum of terrestrial networks will exploit in a way that
    has not been exploited in previous generations. Thus, apart from the RF band,
    the terrestrial network will exploit the electromagnetic spectrum, starting from
    low-frequency, microwave, mmWave, visible and THz band. More number of small cell
    BSs will be deployed since bands like mmWave and THz suffer from high path loss.
    Therefore, the terrestrial networks will be ultra-dense heterogeneous networks.
    • Underwater Network Segment Underwater networks will provide wireless coverage
    and Internet services even in the deep sea and broad sea activities, through smart
    underwater objects such as Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) and Remotely Operated
    Vehicle (ROV). Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) is expected to interconnect
    smart underwater devices. The 6G underwater networks will focus to provide uninterrupted
    services in military or commercial-based applications. Undersea communication
    mainly deploys RF, optical, and acoustic communication. Supplementary underwater
    hubs can be deployed to achieve high-speed bidirectional data transmissions in
    undersea networks. IoUT will ensure disaster prevention, oil and gas pipeline
    monitoring, pollution detection, water quality monitoring, and control, etc. However,
    underwater technology can be more complicated than space technology, even the
    clearest water has 1000 times the attenuation of clear air, due to many reasons
    including sea pressure. Underwater networks have an unpredictable and complex
    underwater environment. Since water exhibits diverse propagation characteristics,
    intricate network deployment can be deployed for ensuring reliable wireless communications,
    severe physical damage to equipment, cope with signal attenuation, leaving numerous
    problems to be solved. The potential network architecture of 6G is shown in Fig.
    20. 4.2. 6G air interface We envision “intelligent physical, datalink and network
    layers” in 6G, which are capable of self-adaptive, self-aware and self-interpretive,
    self-learning and self-optimization, self-protection, and self-healing capabilities,
    by integrating advanced AI technologies, data collection, sensing, and domain-specific
    signal processing methods. Indeed, recent research has shown that AI and ML enhance
    the physical layer, data link layer, and network layer capabilities by: • Providing
    training to the transmitter, channel, and receiver, for joint optimization. •
    Innovating end-to-end physical layer design and plummeting the receiver complexity.
    • Refining physical layer performance, especially in high mobility scenarios.
    • Realizing optimal user scheduling through intelligent traffic prediction and
    channel estimation based on trained DL models. • Enhancing retransmission redundancy
    and decreasing retransmission overhead. • Optimizing data offloading and service
    paradigm and optimizing multiple connections through traffic prediction. • Optimizing
    handover process through mobility prediction. • Realizing optimal data transmission
    paths through mining beneficial information directly from raw network data and
    learning routing strategies. • Realizing optimal BS and user clustering, and monitoring
    the cluster size in a dynamic network environment. 4.3. Distributed and autonomous
    architecture With increasing users, the existing network faces scalability and
    network efficiency issues. Although 5G employs edge computing, the basic centralized
    design of the present network has complex system procedures and is complicated
    [291]. 6G needs a distributed, homogeneous, and autonomous network architecture,
    which covers terrestrial, satellite, underground, and underwater, through multiple
    access clouds. S. Wang et al. [292], presented three 6G network design principles,
    first based on the bionics approach, which is highly distributed and flat, to
    enhance scalability and network efficiency. The inspiration for the design architecture
    was taken from an ant nest architecture. The features of ant nest architecture
    such as top-heavy distribution, multi-way expansion stable size-free shape, and
    vertical distribution, inspired the proposed network design. The second proposed
    network design in [292] is influenced by the global coverage and access requirement,
    triggered by the rising traffic and device diversity. A variety of communication
    systems coexist, to fulfill diverse services. Consequently, different standards
    and technologies are adopted by these systems, which challenges the interworking
    among different systems. Therefore, the 6G design requires the integration of
    different access technologies and a globally unified apparatus compatible with
    diverse requirements. Another requirement of the network design is to reduce communication
    protocols to maintain the legacy systems together. SRv6 is a user plane protocol
    proposed by 3GPP. The second type of network design in [292], emphasizes the employment
    of SRv6 protocol [292], to support smooth network function evolution and network
    programmability. Moreover, the use of SRv6 technology can reduce the protocols,
    the rate of device failure, system complexity, and operating expenses. The third
    proposed network architecture in [292] is an AI-enabled fully autonomous network
    driven by pervasive swarm intelligence. Swarm intelligence is a type of AI, based
    on a collective of biological activity behaviors, which can drive intelligent
    self-organizing of networks. This has the capability of load-balancing and scalability
    higher than the conventional algorithms. Download : Download high-res image (2MB)

    of 6G. 4.4. Paradigm shift in end-to-end communications The present network designs
    do not consider end devices as a full part of the network. The devices used for
    communication can be very diverse ranging from small sensors to large storage
    data center devices and from traditional smartphones to sophisticated AR/VR equipment.
    In 6G the interface interactions will have a prominent role and Application Program
    Interface (API) must become an integral part of network design, independent of
    end-devices and applications. Currently, there is a gap between user and network
    participation in setting policies including access and data distribution. In 6G,
    the users should express preferences, consent, and involve with service providers
    for auditing the implementation of user-desired personal data management and privacy.
    6G will have diverse types of applications. At present, the network design falls
    short of mechanisms through which applications communicate to the underlying network
    about their precise requirements such as traffic demands, and specific QoS. On
    the other hand, networks do not have the required real-time mechanism to monitor
    the status and requirements of their applications. The end-to-end connections
    between the applications may change dynamically in a real-time environment, this
    change should be transparent to applications in 6G, without losing connection.
    In the 6G network architecture, the applications should have capabilities to verify
    their end-to-end guarantee in detail and real-time, as they are lacking in present
    system models. End-to-end communications encompass various network segments, which
    have different network communities, characteristics, and expertise. Driving end-to-end
    solutions from one particular community may result in unwanted simplifications
    and other segments may be abstracted at a high level, which can result in sub-optimal
    network performance [294]. I. Moerman et al. in [295], proposed an evolution in
    communication systems, where end-to-end networks and services are dynamically
    framed by the most appropriate amalgamation of both network segments and services,
    for optimizing resource efficiency, overall cost efficiency, and security. The
    proposed approach in [296], gives implementation and distribution freedom in innovations
    of end-to-end communication ecosystem, which leads to maximizing the role of medium-sized
    enterprises, academia, start-ups, and industries. 4.5. Cloud-centric Internet
    The conventional digital cellular network technology was designed for phone calls
    and was independent of the Internet. However, the primary requirement of cellular
    devices now has become to access Internet services and applications. The present
    Internet-only offers “best-effort delivery”, due to its end-to-end model. Moreover,
    in the case of device mobility to another network, the upper layer connection
    breaks, and packets get lost. Hence, 6G network performance requirements cannot
    be met through such an Internet archetype. Cloud-centric Internet architecture
    is presented in [297], which offers functions such as communication assistance,
    digital asset, and network behavior logger, based on the Cybertwin communication
    model. This Internet model introduces two layers above the IP layer. First, the
    core cloud layer provides network infrastructure services such as communication,
    computing, and caching resources, co-ordinately. Second, the edge cloud layer
    aids the core cloud layer in responding faster to the requests made by ends. The
    Cybertwin-based network architecture proposed by Q. Yu et al. in [298], can enhance
    data privacy protection and security, and real-time resource allocation for the
    cloud network operating systems. 4.6. Fully decoupled RAN architecture The existing
    methods of spectrum utilization are ineffective. For instance, the FDD lacks flexibility
    and efficiency as they use a fixed portion of the spectrum and TDD leads to spectrum
    wastage due to guard intervals and introduces additional delay while waiting for
    particular slots. Therefore, to use spectrum resources flexibly and efficiently,
    new RAN architecture is required. As the cell size and number of frequency bands
    cannot be increased after a limit, the design to the future spectrum resources
    must be flexible. Q. Yu et al. in [299], proposed a fully decoupled RAN architecture
    where the control and data plane were physically decoupled and deployed as independent
    entities of control BSs and data BSs, for control and data plane functions, respectively.
    Besides, this architecture physically decouples uplink and downlink. As the spectrum
    resources cannot be efficiently used through FDD and TDD. To address this issue,
    the decoupling of data BSs into, uplink BSs and downlink BSs for transmitting
    uplink and downlink data, respectively. This method helps to control BSs precisely.
    As the cell size and several frequency bands cannot be increased after a limit,
    the design of the future spectrum resources must be flexible Q. Yu et al. in [299],
    proposed a fully decoupled RAN architecture was, the control and data plane were
    physically decoupled and deployed as independent entities of control BSs and data
    BSs, for control and data plane functions, respectively. Besides, this architecture
    physically decouples uplink and downlink. As the spectrum resources cannot be
    efficiently used through FDD and TDD. To address this issue, the decoupling of
    data BSs into, uplink BSs and downlink BSs for transmitting uplink and downlink
    data, respectively. This method helps control BSs to precisely coordinate resources
    in real-time, use network resources elastically and effectively, and reduce interference
    amongst users. Moreover, such an architecture also aids in reducing energy consumption
    on both the network and the user side. The fully decoupled RAN architecture implements
    CoMP, easy, flexible, and efficient, for transmission and reception with the support
    of dedicated control BS and fully independent uplink and downlink BSs [299]. Table
    23 summarizes what are the issues with 5G architecture and why there is a requirement
    for new 6G architecture. Table 23. Summary of key open issues of 5G network. Open

    [315] Ultra-massive machine type communications (umMTC), low-power wide-area networks
    (LPWAN) such as LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, and SigFox. 4.7. Standards and regulations The
    creation and development of 6G is based on its key structures, whose flexibility
    is influenced by standards and regulations. The service-oriented architecture
    (SOA) is not considered in present regulations, for instance, resource allocation,
    novel embedded security, and traffic management. Moreover, cloud-oriented technologies
    are not included in the present regulations, for example, cloud service over-the-top
    (OOT) are unregulated, whereas European mobile network operators are subject to
    Net Neutrality regulations [300]. As the requirements of 6G users will vary over
    time, the role of local space will possibly become more prominent. Industrial
    base renovation is expected via 6G, and the conflicts related to the role of local
    spaces of different standardizations must be fixed. A case study of spectrum challenges
    in Mexico for B5G is presented by L. Lopez-Lopez et al. in [300]. This case study
    presented rural and urban scenarios to provide insights into resource availability,
    and regulatory aspects, and to extend the coverage of mobile communications, in
    the country. Decisions of spectrum management are made by the regulators, aiming
    to use the scarce natural resources efficiently and assuring fairness amongst
    different stakeholders that want to use the radio spectrum. Presently, the spectrum
    discussions of 6G are in their infancy. The main challenge in spectrum management
    is to strike a balance between the rivalry between different stakeholders, spectrum
    access rights, wishing to deploy their wireless systems, to new bands envisioned
    for communication. Generally, there are three approaches of spectrum management
    [301]; administrative allocation [301], market-based mechanism [303], [304], and
    unlicensed common approach [305]. With the inculcation of the THz band, 6G will
    have a wide range of bands, which will lead to a variety of flexible approaches
    for spectrum management for addressing the difference between mid, high, and even
    higher bands. Sensing and communications will be combined in 6G when going towards
    higher bands [306], this will advance the decision-making in spectrum sharing
    through AI. Moreover, users and use cases empowered by a variety of flexible AI
    algorithms may emerge, that cross the limits of dedicated spectrum and solutions.
    Digital inclusion which depends on spectrum availability will become a key topic
    of discussion in 6G. The existing market driven by the mobile network operator
    will shift towards a community cantered approach [307]. 4.8. Security In 6G ecosystems,
    the actors and their resources are anticipated to transform and novel actors will
    arise. Privacy is the prime requirement of design consideration, to protect personal
    and private business data. The rising need for trust is predicted to prompt new
    types of trust services and trust providers. These types of developments will
    require the management of customers’ data dynamically and transparently. Changing
    customer service needs, behaviors and experiences will modify traditional “telco
    customer relationship”. Full control and management over their private data should
    be given to the owners. Additionally, a data market must be provided to the owners
    to sell their data and gain profit. With the tremendous increase in IoT devices,
    the challenges of network security will also increase, as these devices cannot
    deploy intelligent security mechanisms due to their limited memory and power.
    Therefore, the goal of the 6G ecosystem must be to guarantee the use of artificial
    intelligence and provide security and trust services. 4.9. IoT infrastructure
    and protocols New designs of network protocols are needed in 6G for mainly three
    major tasks. First, to outspread the idea of separating management, data, and
    control plane, to the application level. Second, to embrace measurability as an
    integral part of everyday data transfer. Third, to allow applications to give
    information to their directives about the networking stack, not only at the origin
    of the packet but its journey across the entire end-to-end drive to the destination.
    While generating directives, applications can consider profiles. User profiles
    help in interaction with other entities therefore, in 6G the users should keep
    a track of personal data and preferences, through Generic User Profiles (GPUs).
    On basis of user preferences, available network information and device capabilities
    applications can compose their requirements regarding their end-to-end treatment
    e.g., jitter, throughput, latency, etc. As dynamic and sporadic traffic patterns
    are characteristic of future terminals, the design of smart access and resource
    allocation policies is prime important for efficient and effective channel sharing.
    To address this problem, the conventional eMBB is inefficient when delivering
    small data units, as they need overheads to coordinate with massive terminals
    which may overshadow the advantage of orthogonal access. On the other hand, random
    access-based grant-free protocols are an attractive solution. The envisioned rise
    of market penetration of IoT services needs efficient grant-free access policies
    to boost the performance of mMTC. A. Munari et al. in [308], reviews some recent
    results on the emerging approach of receiver diversity, to improve the performance
    of random access for mMTC. The future envisaged irregular and dynamic traffic
    patterns of ultra-dense device networks, must be addressed [309]. However, it
    is challenging to deliver reliable survives for massive connectivity [310]. This
    prompt efficient utilization of the resource. To serve massive users, the IoT
    paradigm requires umMTC. The low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) such as LoRaWAN,
    NB-IoT, and SigFox, addresses the reasonable reliability and low-energy consumption
    demands of the IoT paradigm. However, with increases in the number of users, the
    LoRaWAN protocol stack may face issues in maintaining reliability. A. Hoeller
    et al. in [311], presented coverage and throughput performance analysis of present
    LoRaWAN systems and considered possible technology enrichments to address the
    envisioned demands of future IoT applications. Architecture framework for IoT
    which follows the international standard ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 is defined in

    of antennas. 4.10. 6G case study We performed a case study on 6G by designing
    and analyzing a downlink 6G network model. Fig. 21. shows network model of our
    6G case study. We have employed key 6G technologies such as THz wave communication,
    NONA, UAV, D2D technology, mMIMO, mobile cell, small cell, and RF channel. We
    have designed a network where macrocell encompasses a mobile small cells and small
    cells. The NOMA is employed at each BS to aid high spectral efficiency, and enhanced
    capacity due to the effective utilization of the radio resources. High propagation
    loss in THz signals is a huge issue. Therefore, we have employed THz wave communication
    technology in small cells and mobile small cells, and RF in macrocell. Further
    we have employed D2D technology in small cells and mobile small cells to reduce
    the THz channel propagation loss due to blockages. We have carried out the simulations
    to compare the energy efficiency of our 6G case study in comparison with previous
    generations; 5G and 4G. In the result, we have labeled the performed 6G network
    case study as ‘6G’. The ‘5G’ in Fig. 22 represents a network model deploying macrocell
    and small cells, mMIMO, NOMA. mmWave technology at small cells and RF technology
    at macrocell BS. While, ‘4G’ represents a network model comprising of a macrocell,
    MIMO technology and RF channel. In the simulation, the carrier frequency of THz
    is taken as 0.34 THz, mmWave is taken as 73 MHz, and RF channel is taken as 2
    GHz, while the bandwidths of THz, mmWave and RF channels are taken as be 10 GHz,
    1 GHz and 1 MHz respectively [98], [175], [190]. The UAV flies at a height of
    100 m from the ground and draws a radius of 300 m on the ground. The radius of
    the macrocell is 500 m. The maximum transmit power of macrocell BS, small cell
    BS and UAV is taken as 43dBm, 36.9 dBm, and 10 dBm respectively [98], [190], [286].
    The number of antennas in Fig. 22 is varied from 64 to 154. It can be seen from
    Fig. 22 that the energy efficiency reduces with increase in number of antennas.
    It is due to increased energy consumption due to increase in the number of antennas.
    As the bandwidth of the THz channel is massive, its spectrum efficiency and rates
    are also higher. Moreover the employment of D2D technology in ‘6G’ small call
    and mobile small cell reduces the channel propagation loss due to the blockages
    in the path. This enhances the SINR hence, the rates. The energy efficiency is
    defined as a ratio of achieved rate and power consumption. The rate is defined
    in terms of SINR according to the Shannon’s capacity formula. The power consumption
    is defined as summation of transmission power and circuit power consumption. In
    ‘6G’ the macro BS traffic is offloaded due to the employment of small cells and
    mobile small cells and in ‘5G’ the small cells aid in offloading the macro BS
    traffic. Hence, the power consumption of ‘6G’ is less than ‘5G’ and ‘4G’. The
    achievable rates in ‘6G’ is higher than ‘5G’ and ‘4G’ due to the aforementioned
    reasons. Hence, the energy efficiency of ‘6G’ is higher in comparison with ‘5G’
    and ‘4G’. 5. Open research challenges, possible solutions and research directions
    As the technology developments for 5G will keep driving the potentials and expectations
    of the mobile networks, new and unanticipated services, use cases, and applications
    are expected to develop. Existing networks have massive user data and other factors
    to offer convenient services. Although, the challenges increase with the up-gradation
    of networks. This will further push the limits of the system and new problems
    are anticipated that are far beyond 5G capabilities. The 6G is bringing great
    improvements and convenience in terms of performance and QoS, in communication
    services. However, the development of 6G communication networks is prone to many
    challenges. The 6G networks need to handle complex networking issues, such as
    dynamically changing topology, diverse types of communication links, high Doppler
    frequency, intermittent transmission between satellites, various link delays,
    fading, and many more [314], [315]. Table 25 shows challenges in achieving 6G
    KPI. This section highlights some key challenges and open problems and challenges
    in the 6G. Technologies such as DL, meta-materials, digitalization, and virtualization,
    can aid in solving the aforementioned issues. DL helps in the intelligent management
    of the network resources and optimization of propagation and transceiver environment.
    Furthermore, integrated methods for power supply optimization and wireless transmissions
    can enable energy autonomy over diversified scenarios for pervasive devices. 5.1.
    Rationalizability, resilience, reproducibility, realism, and responsibility in
    artificial intelligence The five issues in AI, i.e., rationalizability, resilience,
    reproducibility, realism, and responsibility which need further research are highlighted
    in [316]. The rationalizability of AI systems needs to be expanded in terms of
    workings and outputs. It is essential to understand and verify the learnings before
    deploying them in safety–critical applications such as autonomous driving, medical
    diagnosis, etc. Regardless of the remarkable advancement of AI, recent research
    has revealed that even the most advanced models (e.g., DNNs) have a strange propensity
    to be easily misled. Therefore, making the AI system robust and resilient is vital
    and challenging. A high degree of predictive accuracy even when the system counter
    misclassification and adversarial attacks. AI systems usually run into the replication
    crisis while training ML and DL models. Subsequently, the absence of knowledge
    in the optimum selection of hyper-parameters can cause a disappointing and substandard
    performance of the trained model. Therefore, it is important to address reproducibility
    errors in AI systems, for preserving reliability. For realizing high reliability,
    the AI systems should incorporate human-like virtues of integrity, relatability,
    and benevolence [316]. For example, affective computing intends to understand
    humans, by learning and enriching AI expertise in identifying, understanding,
    and expressing sentiments and emotions However, it is challenging to develop systems
    that can perceive and process these multimodal data streams. Moreover, different
    individuals exhibit emotions in different ways. Therefore, exploiting varied modes
    of communication to a varying extent is vital. Mainly, the combination of visual
    and acoustic information can provide extensive knowledge and understanding of
    human emotions [316]. Predictably, ML and DL will be hired for 6G infrastructure
    in the next 10 years. The key challenge in DL lies in the optimal design of the
    network for different scenarios, such that optimal state, action, and reward can
    be achieved to converge the optimal system performance. To control differences
    in the performance of learned and actual wireless channel models, online practical
    learning should be implemented. Precisely, the impact of uncertainty in DL-driven
    processes should be considered. Few issues such as training data and training
    workload reduction, DL optimization performance under an imperfect correlation,
    CSI, and other imperfections, are addressed in [317]. Table 25. Challenges in
    Achieving 6G KPI. KPI Challenges Possible solutions Energy efficiency • The growing
    proliferation of IoT devices and the steady demands of computation in AI processing,

    networks, power distribution systems, etc. • Error-correcting schemes • Wider
    bandwidths Connectivity • The communication range of EHFs used in 6G is short
    therefore, massive APs will be deployed which leads to extremely dense wireless
    networks, where the management of frequent handoffs becomes difficult. • In such
    dense mobile environments, it is challenging to improve positioning accuracy and
    connectivity. • Moreover, with the goal of 3D coverage, the interaction between
    spaceborne and airborne networks is challenging, as the LEO satellite changes
    its positions very quickly. • Ultra-mMIMO and Cell-free networking • Integrated

    be capable of handling massive real transactions • Wider bandwidths Interference
    • In densified 6G networks, multiple choices of connection will be available at
    each node. This decision of user association will impact the interference pattern.
    • In swift vehicular and UAV networks, the interference pattern changes dynamically.
    • Existing mathematical tools are not enough for modeling 6G interference dynamics.
    • The dense frequency reuse for improving spectral efficiency will intensify the
    interference. • Protocol enhancements • Modeling complex dynamic scenarios Security
    • The integration of centralized and distributed methods in D2D and V2X communications
    is vulnerable to numerous privacy and security threats from the cellular and Adhoc
    networks. • In the 6G IoT applications, most of the devices are prone to attacks
    and threats, due to their data-centricity, dynamic topology, limited resources,
    complex environments, and close correlation with the application. • Owing to several
    network characteristic changes due to softwarization, virtualization, and intelligence,
    numerous security policies initially designed around conventional network structures
    may no longer be pertinent for 6G networks. • Blockchains • Developing new security
    policies • De-centralize data Cost • The cost of the BS and occupied bandwidth
    increases with an increase in network density and number of users, respectively
    and this drains the power with accelerating rates. • Cost-efficient operation
    is challenging, as 6G envisions to tackle omnipresent service coverage, connected
    intelligent system, and performance optimization. • New and cost effective hardware
    technologies 5.2. Complexity in Ultra-mMIMO and holographic radio Fully digital
    arrays are developed for ultra-mMIMO systems which are suitable for the sub-6
    GHz band [318], but complexity increases with an increase in carrier frequency.
    Therefore, new implementation techniques are required to implement ultra-mMIMO
    on a compact chip that can realize fully digital architectures [74], [319]. There
    are many methods to implement holographic radio for localization applications
    such as positioning and imaging. However, massive amounts of data are generated
    with holographic sensing, which is challenging to process. Thus, in such cases,
    it becomes difficult to maintain low latency and high reliability while performing
    critical tasks. ML tools can provide an effective solution to this problem. Hierarchical
    and heterogeneous optoelectronic computing is a key to holographic radio, as high
    parallelism and coherence can be achieved and signals can be processed directly
    in the optical domain. However, the adaptation of physical layer techniques of
    signal processing is difficult to fit in the optical domain. Moreover, designing
    the physical layer and hardware components such as corporation-based continuous-aperture
    active antennas, RF holography to optical holography mapping, and optical computing
    with high efficiency is challenging. 5.3. Controllability, reliability, and consistency
    in quantum algorithms For high controllability, reliability, and consistency of
    quantum logic operations and qubits, improved quantum error correction tools are
    needed. A large distance quantum communication channel is a milestone in the development
    of quantum communications. However, the loss of protons in the channel is an open
    issue. To solve this issue, repeaters can be used which subdivide the large distance
    into small sections, although decoherence effects will still be a problem. Transducers
    to photonic states can aid in reducing decoherence effects. Moreover, it is challenging
    to design and operationally enable quantum devices at practical temperatures,
    as they currently operate at low temperatures [75]. Simulation of a quantum computer,
    on a standard computer, is tough, therefore currently they can simulate only a
    few circuits and offer limited capacity. Parallelization can partly aid in solving
    this problem through the simultaneous computation of qubits. There are many research
    issues related to quantum computation and quantum communications which need dedicated
    research. 5.4. Security threats, scalability and computation risk in blockchain
    There are three major issues in blockchain; security threats, scalability, and
    risk due to quantum computation [320]. In the blockchain, the majority is vulnerable
    for example, in Bitcoin, attackers may gain control over the entire system by
    only 51% of the computing power of the network’s computation [321]. User privacy
    in the blockchain is endangered because it relies on transparent transactions.
    Other attacks like double-spending, selfish mining [321], and Sybil attacks [322],
    in blockchain, can break the integrity of the distributed ledger. To guarantee
    the ledger’s integrity, Bitcoin needs huge storage, bandwidth, and computing,
    owing to its decentralized nature [323], [324]. Moreover, the blockchain’s scalability
    and latency may be restricted due to the high number of participant message passing
    and forced delays [212]. Communication and computational overheads are other challenges.
    In 6G, with the arrival of large-scale quantum computing, several security algorithms
    will be rendered vulnerable. Many blockchain public-key primitives need to be
    quantum-resistant. Opportunely, according to present knowledge, symmetric primitives,
    such as blockchain cryptographic hash functions, are not affected likewise [212].
    5.5. Propagation modeling and hardware miniaturization in terahertz wave Although,
    the THz bands are susceptible to molecular absorption and blockage propagation
    modeling becomes challenging. Moreover, the lack of understanding of the exact
    channel characteristics makes the situation more challenging. Additionally, the
    circuity and antenna size miniaturization, which makes fabrication difficult.
    Therefore, powerful synchronization schemes, low-density channel codes, energy
    efficient modulation schemes, ultra-massive MIMO systems, nano-antennas, robust
    beamforming, noise modeling, and less complex low-power hardware circuits require
    further research to address the challenges in THz communications. Challenges in
    THz band Communications are summarized in Table 26. The modulator’s performance
    is a determining factor for direct THz modulation. Hence, good performance of
    amplitude modulators in terms of speed and depth and phase modulators in terms
    of linear and large-scale phase shifts is vital to design considerations, at THz
    bands. Advanced materials are promising for the design of THz modulators, such
    as Graphene and GaN-HEMT. Low-Temperature Co-Fired Ceramic (LTCC) technology,
    technologies metal-coated 3D printing, and cutting-edge technology is some recently
    developed low-cost, compact, and lightweight solution in packaging technology
    in the THz band. Electro-optic sampling can provide cutting-edge technology are
    some recently developed low-cost, compact, and lightweight solutions in packaging
    technology in the THz band. Electro-optic sampling can provide a potential solution
    for THz measurements. However, so far it has not been extended to 1.5 THz for
    resolution improvements. Moreover, for THz measurements, there is a great requirement
    for robust atmospheric accountability to the International Systems of Units (SI).

    and high precision waveguides are challenging to realize for vector network analyzers.
    • Whereas, construction of standardized calibration and measurements is difficult

    design Mobile edge computing and Fog Networking decrease the user’s distance between
    application/service content servers and serving BSs, respectively [325], [326].
    Mobile edge computing splits the network into distributed cloud structures, and
    the training is done at the network edge. This handicaps AI algorithms from being
    completely functional [327], [328]. This situation will exacerbate in 6G when
    the network will proceed to smaller cells for lower latencies and higher capacities.
    5.7. Complexity in SR For optimum dynamic spectrum access, the system needs comprehensive
    information on the network state. However, it is difficult to adapt dynamic spectrum
    access protocols efficiently, in complex real-world models. DL algorithms can
    be used to learn the patterns of the primary system, for designing dynamic spectrum
    access algorithms. The SR is in the infant development phase and has not yet been
    fully explored, and researchers need to address many issues regarding SR. For
    instance, multi-dimensional resource allocation and wireless access are challenging
    for large SR networks, and new AI and big data techniques are needed to address
    it. The prime challenges are countered while designing both the transmission signal
    at the cellular user and modulation at the IoT device and detection at each AP.
    The design of the transmission signal through adjusting power levels and beams,
    at the cellular user is challenging because there is vast variation in the received
    power of the direct and reflected signal at each AP. This causes dissimilarities
    in the performance of cellular and IoT data transmission. The cellular and IoT
    data transmission performance can be simultaneously improved by cooperatively
    designing QAM, amplitude-shift key (ASK), and frequency shift key (FSK) modulation
    schemes at both the transmission signal at the cellular user and the IoT device,
    as compared to the ambient backscattering communications [329]. The IoT data can
    counter huge interference from the direct signal, as it is only carried in the
    reflected signal, which is feeble. Therefore, IoT data detection performance at
    the IoT AP degrades. To address this problem, SIC can be adopted at each IoT AP
    to remove interference from direct signals [330]. Although research in SR have
    illustrated feasible, cellular user and IoT device pairing and data transmission,
    it is difficult to further increase their number. However, ambient backscattering
    communications have been analyzed in the existing literature, but the study of
    cooperative cellular and IoT data transmission and detection designs are limited.
    This signifies, that the fallouts of the present works are suboptimal terms cellular
    and IoT transmission performance, for SR. Therefore, it needs further investigations
    to enhance the performance of the SR, for 6G communication networks. 5.8. Complexity
    in IRS The phase range of the unit cells in the IRS is a critical parameter, which
    limits the IRS design process. Preferably, each unit cell must provide full phase
    control across the phase range. However, it is challenging to achieve the full
    phase range, as it complicates the architecture through the required complex cell
    topology. Moreover, even if the full phase range is attained, the wavefront reliability
    upon reflection is affected, due to the number of quantization levels used to
    discretize the phase range [330]. 5.9. Modulation, handover, and compatibility
    in VLC The VLC has not yet advanced and currently, its application in outdoor
    environments is quite limited. There are many practical issues in VLC for example,
    the intensity modulation of data signals are constrained by positive values. Therefore,
    the direct implementation of RF techniques is not possible in VLC. Moreover, in
    mobile environments with numerous VLC APs, the handover mechanism is challenging
    and the handover techniques of the RF system cannot be applied straightforwardly
    in VLC communications [332]. The VLC systems must be compatible with the present
    technologies, for example, message frame compatibility in aggregate VLC-based
    systems is a critical issue. In cooperation-based systems, the modulation schemes
    used from source to the relay, and relay to the destination must be compatible.
    However, it is difficult to find the correct combination between modulation schemes
    in different technologies. Furthermore, the aforementioned challenges multiply
    with the increase in the number of channels, i.e., in multi-channel networks.
    More importantly, it is challenging to achieve high throughput and capacity VLC
    due to the bandwidth limitations of LEDs. However, it is the responsibility of
    the LED manufacturers and network designers to address this issue and preserve
    compatibility between illumination functions and data transmissions [333]. Table
    27. Challenges in mmWave communications. Challenges Possible solution mmWave systems
    demand small-sized antennas as it is inversely proportional to the carrier frequency.
    Small-sized antennas increase the aperture size of the antenna, which increases
    the path loss. If the antenna aperture is kept constant at one or both ends, the
    path loss remains unaffected or even decreases Blockages The researches show that
    if the distance between the transmitter and the receiver is increased then, the
    path loss in LOS increases, but the blockage decrease High penetration and absorption
    losses Large BS spacing Dopplers effect (The signal is said to have Doppler Spread
    if the received signal carrier has dissimilar shifts) Minimize the angular spread
    • Path loss [341] • Link acquisition during link setup as well as handoffs is
    challenging • Hardware complexity • Power consumption. Energy efficient schemes,
    noise modeling, and hardware technology require further research 5.10. Complexity,
    and error propagation in NOMA Instead of being a promising multiple access technology,
    NOMA has several practical challenges. The hardware complexity, processing complexity,
    and computation complexity of the SIC scheme limit the NOMA scheme [334]. In fading
    environments with time-varying interference, adaptive coding and modulation implementations
    are nontrivial. Moreover, due to the possible allied error propagation in coding
    and decoding techniques, the performance of the whole system can deteriorate.
    For example, if the signals of the preceding users are not appropriately decoded,
    the decoding errors get amassed for the residual users. The SIC is performed in
    presence of the inter-user interference, which is naturally persuaded in NOMA
    [335], [336]. The SIC is effective if this self-interference is not efficiently
    mitigated [337]. Therefore, well-designed self-interference techniques are needed
    for efficient induced inter-user interference in NOMA. For instance, with perfect
    CSI, resource allocation techniques give improved performance than with limited
    feedback CSI. However, severe communication overheads are induced in optimal or
    near-optimal CSI, while adding complexity [338]. Consequently, reducing overheads
    and complexity is pivotal and resource allocation schemes relying on partial CSI
    must be investigated to reduce the overheads. With an increase in the number of
    users, the power allocation and clustering, become immensely complex. The problem
    proliferates as the topology and schedule of the users become dynamic. The ML
    or DL-based MIMO NOMA system can help to address this problem through the learning-based
    mechanism of beamforming, power allocation, and clustering techniques [339]. The
    ML/DL algorithms try to learn the data patterns for making near-optimal decisions
    although, their effective operation in the dynamic environment of NOMA is challenging
    and not yet fully explored. 5.11. Interoperability in software defined network
    The protocol interoperability of the control software should be improved. The
    coexistence of the existing hardware and software should be verified through a
    universal verification platform, instead of small software-based testing platforms
    [340]. 5.12. Software access network for backhaul traffic With extraordinary data
    growth, the access network for backhaul traffic will need more research efforts.
    There is an abundant spectrum available in higher bands, for example, 60 GHz spectrum
    is available in D-band. To meet 6G backhaul requirements, FSO and quantum communication
    are potential technologies. However, they are still in the early stages of development
    and their integration with other network equipment needs to be investigated. 5.13.
    Propagation loss, complexity and power consumption in millimeter-wave The mmWave
    technology faces many challenges highlighted in Table 27 and it needs to be analyzed
    from all perspectives to ripe its maximum advantage. 5.14. Scalability and channel
    information in cell-free mMIMO In cell-free mMIMO, all the APs contribute to serving
    a given user. Such a system faces difficulty in scalability when the number of
    users and APs is large. Hence, when network size grows vast, cell-free mMIMO becomes
    unimplementable. In [342], a method is proposed as a method in which instead of
    all APs, only a subset of APs contributes to serving a given user, depending on
    the path loss. Still, the present schemes are not optimal and require huge participation
    from all the APs. In practical mobile scenarios, the location of the users changes
    quickly consequently, the sub-set of APs serving the user is also altered. This
    requires huge control signaling. Moreover, it is essential to examine scalable
    device synchronization and coordination techniques to implement data and CSI exchange,
    in cell-free mMIMO [343]. The power control in cell-free mMIMO is central, as
    it controls inter-user interference and near-far effects. This process is carried
    out at the CPU, assuming that it has perfect knowledge of large-scale fading coefficients,
    which is practically very difficult. Thereafter, for uplink transmission, the
    power coefficients are sent to users and for downlink transmission, it is sent
    to APs. This requires huge fronthaul backhaul overheads. Distributed power control
    at all APs, can achieve power scalable control. However, inter-user interference
    and near-far effects are hard to control without full channel information. 5.15.
    High chipset density, miniaturization and energy efficiency in hardware technology
    The 6G needs to increase the chipset density, which poses a challenge to the semiconductor
    industry. With miniaturized chips, the manufacturing complexity increases, making
    devices and chipsets more cost-effective and feasible. The utilization of EHF
    bands and THz bands in 6G will require a miniaturized design of transmitter and
    receiver components. For instance, Qualcomm and other companies expended years
    making components for mmWave technology, from meter scale to fingertip-sized antennas
    and modems. For the THz band, this issue might pose further challenges, for example,
    the antenna for combined technology of mmWave and THz bands may need to be reinvented
    since antenna size may vary in proportion of micrometers and nanometers. Optoelectronic
    integrated modules may benefit from the advancement of antenna techniques. Intelligent
    6G services will be AI-oriented, which depends on the computing power and storage
    of the devices. Therefore, new hardware designs need to be energy efficient and
    long battery lifetime, which is challenging. SIC. Further, resource management
    is complex due to the device capability To run AI algorithms, the AI technologies
    in 6G will need high computational power. Hence, network equipment will be more
    power-hungry than ever. The user equipment will need to break the physical limits
    to operate with intelligence, higher diversities, and multiplexing gains at wider
    bandwidths. Traditional Silicon (Si), Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) transceiver components
    produce excessive heat and are not energy efficient. The amplifiers around 300
    GHz band are extremely difficult to realize with CMOS integrated circuits. This
    intends that the present hardware technologies are incapable of supporting high
    computational ultra-fast applications of 6G. Hence, new materials-based designs
    of hardware technologies are needed for emerging 6G systems. The summary of key
    open problems for 6G is highlighted in Table 28. 5.16. Transmission, beam divergence,
    transceiver and atmospheric turbulence in OAM Although OAM can enhance the key
    matrix of wireless communication systems, many problems need attention before
    its implementation. • Transmission: Mostly, the researchers focus on LOS communications
    for OAM. However, in most practical cases, environments surrounding the transceivers
    cause multipath transmission. OAM signal decomposition becomes difficult due to
    the phase difference between the reflection paths and channel amplitude gains.
    A combination of OAM and OFDM is presented in [344], in form of a hybrid orthogonal
    division multiplexing to achieve high capacity in sparse multipath environments.
    Additionally, [345] also presents phase difference compensation to address the
    problem of OAM signal decomposition. The wave-front of OAM modes varies with reflection
    and refraction. This makes NLOS propagation of OAM waves challenging in fading
    environments. The propagation of OAM in NLOS scenarios is an open issue. • Beam
    Divergence: The beams of OAM are divergent by nature; this inhibits the efficiency
    of long-distance communication and reception in OAM. For efficient transmission,
    it is required that the OAM beams converge. There are a few methods for beam convergence
    such as antenna-based anti-divergence. • Transceiver: As the OAM waves are phase-sensitive,
    existing studies focus on detection schemes based on transceiver-coaxial setups.
    However, in practical scenarios, mostly the transmitter and receivers are not
    correctly aligned with each other. Consequently, at the receiver, it becomes difficult
    to distinguish between the OAM modes, due to the transceiver-misalignment. • Atmospheric
    Turbulence: The atmospheric turbulence can change the phase of OAM optical waves,
    which extremely abates the capacity of the optical communication systems [346],
    [347]. Moreover, crosstalk is introduced by atmospheric turbulence, as the energy
    of one OAM state spread into other adjacent states with different probabilities
    [348]. There are very little research based on this issue and enhancing the capacity
    of OAM communication systems [349], [350], [351], [352], [353]. Yet, the influence
    of the atmosphere effect on the OAM communications using radio is seldom examined
    [354], [355]. Table 28. Summary of key open problems for 6G. Requirements Potential

    of low data rates is faced in fully unified sensing-centric waveforms as it restricts
    the number of communication bits to evade radar unduly affect. The issue of unreliable
    sensing, poor auto correlation and poor cross correlation is faced in fully unified
    communication-centric waveforms due to sensing implementation over present wireless
    communication waveforms, and inflexible signal structure, data randomness [267].
    Complexity is another issue in ISAC at receiver end. ML can aid in reducing this
    complexity through direct signal recognition without SIC-type algorithms. ISAC
    receiver must be judiciously designed to manage, complexity and interference.
    6. Key 6G envisioned services and use-cases The 6G is envisaged to be a revolutionizer
    in terms of connectivity and will not only empower human-to-human, human-to-machine,
    and machine-to-machine communications but also bring intelligence in the way of
    interactions; connecting intelligence. The 6G use case scenarios are enabled by
    intertwined digital, physical, and biological worlds as shown in Fig. 23. Numerous
    applications will be explored in the 6G era, intelligently, this section highlights
    some 6G key services and use-cases. 6.1. Extended reality XR amenities including
    AR, VR, mixed reality (MR), and VR are imperative features of 6G systems. VR is
    a 3D experience in which using reality headsets, the computer simulates realistic
    sensations to imitate a real world in an imaginary environment. A true VR environment
    is capable of captivating all five human senses. AR is a live perspective of a
    real environment whose blocks are augmented by numerous sensor inputs, such as
    visuals, video, audio, and GPS data. The MR also referred to as hybrid reality,
    combines real and virtual environments to generate new visualizations, for real-time
    interactions. XR is the integration of human–machine interactions, real-world
    and virtual environments, created by computer technology. It comprises all its
    vivid forms such as AR, VR, and MR. It demands high-data-rate, near-zero latency,
    and highly reliable wireless connectivity for a genuine XR experience. The XR
    employs AI and 3D objects as key drivers. Apart from engineering requirements
    such as computing, storage, etc., XR also has perceptual requirements of cognition,
    physiology, and human senses. This will offer a truly immersive AR/MR/VR experience
    through high-quality wireless connectivity and joint design integration. The requirement
    of merging physical human factors with QoS and QoE is regarded as quality-of-physical-experience
    (QoPE), which includes body cognition, gestures, and body physiology. XR can be
    employed in different applications such as gaming, medical, educational, training,
    entertainment, broadcasting, etc. AR/VR is an interesting application for 5G potentials
    to deliver an immersive experience. However, the involvement of these services
    is limited by Head-Mounted Devices (HMDs). Holographic communication, which is
    a 6G vertical, provides a new method to bring true engagement without having to
    use HMDs. The end-to-end holographic system for AR and VR telepresence is referred
    to as holoportation. 6.2. Haptic communication Remotely touching and manipulating
    objects is possible through the argumentation of conventional audio–visual communications
    through haptic agility [356]. Haptic communication is a division of nonverbal
    communication, which designates ways of communication through a sense of touch.
    The 6G is envisaged to support haptic communication through real-time interactive
    systems. The wearable haptic systems empower cooperation, integration, and communication
    between humans and machines in a secure way [357]. In e-health applications, in
    which a remote treatment is activated and controlled through the haptic feedback
    link at a nanoscale [358]. Moreover, haptic perceptions are key for maximizing
    XR resource utilization [359]. It will stimulate many economic sectors such as
    smart utilities, healthcare, manufacturing, and education. Haptic communications
    can highly influence various services including remote surgery, stimulated realities,
    gaming, and a massive number of holographic communications [360], which requires
    real-time extreme-low latency and high reliability which are envisioned to be
    provided in 6G wireless systems. It is a relatively young research field, which
    needs to adapt to discrepancies and perspective learning. Moreover, at THz frequencies,
    haptic communications may suffer from path loss due to molecular absorption. Download

    6G use case scenarios enabled by intertwined digital, physical, and biological
    worlds. TI: Tactile Internet; IIoT: Industrial Internet of Things; umMTC: ultra-massive
    machine type communication; V2X: vehicle to everything; CARS: connected robotics
    and autonomous system; IoNT: internet of nano-things. 6.3. Autonomous manufacturing
    AI-based full automation is intended by 6G systems, which automatically controls
    devices, processes, and systems. The industrial revolution, Industry 4.0 or, even
    beyond is envisioned to be promoted by 6G [361]. However, 5G has announced and
    partially addressed many of such applications, yet, there are use cases with very
    tight reliability and latency requirements that are unattainable by 5G. The scenario
    which poses a major challenge is to support the integration of numerous mobile
    robots, which needs very high availability and very short cycle time for a massive
    number of robots simultaneously working on a job. Such requirements are infusible
    to achieve through 5G, and demand reconsidering of joint URLLC and mMTC design.  Meanwhile,
    contrary to the existing 5G URLLC services, to maintain the system stability,
    industrial automation demands an extremely low delay jitter of . Delay jitter
    is the new KPI proposed in 6G, and requires the network to send packets with high
    accuracy and almost equal interval, without an apparent inter-packet delay variation
    [362]. Meanwhile, 6G would provide more accurate positioning and higher connection
    density [363]. The characteristics of blockchains i.e., transparency, availability,
    security, immutability, and decentralization can aid in supporting industrial
    environments. The 6G automation systems will offer scalable, reliable, and secure
    communications employing ultra-low latency and high data rate networks. Also,
    it is expected to provide full integrity with no data loss and error-free transmissions
    between transmitter and receiver. Moreover, a large-scale amalgamation of robots
    in automation will accelerate the development of the emerging concept of Industry.
    X.0, which exploits social, mobile, analytics, and cloud (SMAC). However, it is
    challenging to realize a complex network of massive robots in a radio environment.
    6.4. Seamless environmental monitoring and protection The 6G will employ cooperative
    environmental sensing and monitoring applications on a global scale for use-cases
    such as 3D connectivity, smart transportation, smart cities, environmental safety
    for a green economy, etc. Such large-scale reliable data analytics, data sharing,
    inference, and sensing solutions for environmental protection can be empowered
    by blockchains, as they allow decentralization [364]. The mmWave and THz waves
    find applications in various areas of the communication network, such as integrated
    access backhaul, nanomachine networks, IoT, Internet of Nano-Things (IoNT), Tbps
    wireless local area network (WLAN) system, wireless communications, ultra-broadband
    space communications, medical diagnosis, sensing, imaging, navigation, cognitive
    networks and many more. • Cognitive Networks: Cognitive wireless networks refer
    to a method of providing communication that allows massive complex computations
    to be carried out remotely. This technique assists devices that cannot contain
    high power, large and heavy hardware in one board without local cognition, such
    as lightweight UAVs, autonomous vehicles, and robots. The THz band is expected
    to be the first spectrum to furnish real-time complex computations remotely for
    human cognition. It is envisioned that in future networks, 1 Petabits/s of information
    will be carried over wireless in 100 GHz channel bands [365]. • Sensing: The ability
    of millimeter and THz band to compliment high gain, high directive antennas in
    a small space improves spatial resolution in sensing applications. With frequency
    scanning spectroscopy, detection of certain items, due to the molecular absorption
    at particular frequencies in the THz band, becomes possible. For example, certain
    allergens or chemical contents in the air or edible items may be sensed with spectroscopy
    which can be enabled in 6G and beyond mobile phones. Applications such as wireless
    synchronization [366], [367], touchless smartphones, spectrometers-based explosive
    detection [368], health monitoring [369], medical diagnosis, air quality detection,
    gesture detection miniature radars, precision resource transfer, THz security
    body scanning. Real-time maps can aid in channel prediction, directional antenna
    alignments, and wireless adaptations at smartphones [370]. • Imaging: The LiDAR
    systems can deliver high resolution but are incapable of working in foggy, cloudy,
    or rainy environments. However, THz radar is more effective due to its low susceptibility
    to such environmental conditions. THz waves will be effective in surveillance,
    navigation, and rescue, as it enables both viewing around corners and NLoS objects.
    The diffuse and specular scattering in the THz band allows imaging around the
    obstacles while preserving high spatial resolution and spatial coherency [371].
    • Precise Positioning: Taking advantage of mmWave and THz imaging can localize
    users in the NLOS areas. Moreover, mmWave and THz imaging do not need prior tuning
    and information about the environment in contrast with the conventional methods
    [372]. The LOS and NLOS users can be precisely positioned with accuracy in centimeters
    at frequencies above 100 GHz. Table 29. Comparison between 5G and 6G use cases.

    agriculture, and smart cities, are anticipated to encompass a vast number of latency-sensitive
    AI-driven in-network services. The network devices used in such applications will
    generate a large amount of data and exchange privacy-sensitive information, which
    will be supported by 6G umMTC. To satisfy such requirements, edge-native solutions
    are envisioned to support such applications in 6G. Table 29 highlights the comparison
    between 5G and 6G use cases. • Smart Home: Future IoE will liberate and mature
    all the elements in homes and make them intelligent. Apart from controlling lighting,
    entertainment systems, and appliances, the smart homes will be able to deliver
    meticulous services to the residents, such as patient assistance, energy management,
    access control, real-time product subscribing, and labeling. The 6G is envisaged
    to fully integrate with AI for autonomous decision-making in smart homes. Although,
    6G will be equipped to provide the required infrastructure for all data-intensive
    services, security protection, and high data rate delivery needs special focus,
    in the designing of smart homes. Smart Healthcare: In the future, the transduction
    and transmission, of human sensations or “thoughts” may become reality. This needs
    telecommunication connection between, within the body and the final user via heterogeneous
    segments. The 6G technology is predicted to realize such a connection via the
    human body’s sensorial emotional information. The future healthcare system is
    foreseen to have a precise, personalized, and decentralized model to monitor the
    dynamic nature of human beings. For realizing such real-time health monitoring,
    interconnected and wearable electronic devices such as nanoscale intelligent systems,
    in-body, on-body, and off-body sensors, electronic skin, etc., are required, which
    leads to IoBNT. In such systems, human biological cells are used for intra-body
    sensing and actuation. Moreover, the individuals are considered as network nodes,
    which includes physical, social, and psychological components via Human Bond Communication
    (HBC) as a holistic approach [373]. L. Mucchi et al. in [374], discussed the main
    trends of future wireless healthcare services and research investments for health.
    However, realizing secure communication within and on the body is a challenge,
    mainly owing to the limited resources of the body sensors in terms of computation
    capabilities and energy consumption. The IEEE SA pre-standards workstream for
    Clinical IoT data validation and interoperability with blockchain was initiated
    [375] which includes a draft Trust, Identity, Privacy, Protection, Safety, and
    Security (TIPPSS) framework, which could or could not comprise digital principal
    technology. High-end medical equipment, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
    Computed Tomography (CT), and Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry, provides high-fidelity
    pixel-level assessing body composition but is either costly or exposes users to
    ionizing radiation. For advancing the assessment of body composition, optical
    3D scan and reconstruction techniques, such as using depth cameras, have created
    new opportunities to intelligently analyze features of body shape. To predict
    the percentage of body fat and pixel-level body composition, Y. Lu et al. in [376],
    present a supervised inference model, using the Bayesian network, 3D geometry
    features, and body density. Data models derived from large 3D scan databases can
    be employed to reconstruct 3D body models or Personal 3D avatars, from photographs
    taken with a smartphone to create AR/VR experiences and monitor body variations
    over time for either medical or fitness purposes. M. Fedyukov in [377] presents
    surveys conducted by the 3D Body Processing group, defining industrial requirements,
    and file format, and identifying new standards, guides, and recommendations to
    enable 3D data processing. IEEE SA has recently developed and revised standards
    for 3D Body Processing [378]. Smart Agriculture: Smart agriculture empowered by
    AI, will help real-time water and electricity management for making irrigation
    more efficient and sustainable. Advanced sensors connected to the cloud, through
    satellite or cellular networks will give real-time data for making effective and
    intelligent decisions making. Moreover, it eliminates the physical efforts of
    farmers’ hands thus, optimizing productivity. Sensors collect information about
    temperature, humidity, and rainfall very accurately to monitor the quality of
    crops and make smart greenhouses. Precision farming helps to analyze data generated
    by sensors to make precise decisions for inventory management, vehicle tracking,
    livestock monitoring, and field observation. • Smart City and Smart public places:
    Smart cities target to combine smart urban infrastructure, smart transmissions,
    intelligent medical diagnosis, medical treatments, intelligent transportation
    systems, transportation management [379], [380], [381], electric vehicles, smart
    grids, shopping recommender systems, shopping, security assurance, and smart electricity,
    water, and waste management. It will greatly improve the quality of life through
    the optimization of pervasive sensors and actuators, and intelligent decision-making
    tools. The existing goods delivering designs use automated lockers, which are
    placed near customers to fetch the items, using a specific PIN code. Employing
    a radio unit inside of the locker for communication between the locker and the
    delivery system is lucrative. However, it is challenging with door material that
    is conducting, such as metal. The impact of door materials on radio radiation
    efficiency is studied by M. Jokinen et al. in [382]. • Smart Grids: High efficiency,
    reliability, security, and availability provided by Smart Grids contribute to
    environmental and economic health, making it lucrative. A time-phased evolution
    of Smart Grid features and computing technologies defined in [383], providing
    a roadmap of Smart Grid Vision for Computing, for 2030 and Beyond is given. Electric
    vehicles are foreseen to be a significant element of the imminent Smart Grid.  IEEE
    smart grid vision for vehicular technology: 2030 and beyond reference model is
    published in [384], where communications among electric vehicles, smart grid,
    communication system, and road are clarified, and a use case of “Electric Vehicle
    Smart Island project” is described. Table 30 highlights the 6G service classes,
    their performance indicators, and use cases. 6.6. Connected robotics and autonomous
    systems Connected robots and autonomous systems (CRAS) are an important driver
    for the 6G, which includes autonomous drone delivery systems, UAVs, robotics,
    and vehicle platoons. The automated vehicle observes its surroundings through
    the integration of various sensors, such as GPS, odometry, radar, light detection
    and ranging (LiDAR), sonar, and inertial measurement units, and can intensely
    modify daily lifestyles. Guarantee of high reliability and low latency is crucial
    for factory automation, especially for situational-aware data collection, processing,
    and transfer in safety–critical applications. The current autonomous vehicle architecture
    has many limitations including storing inefficiency and high signal processing.
    As the motion of the vehicles is very swift, extremely low round-trip latency
    is needed for communication which is supported by 6G ERLLC. For live traffic management,
    high-definition 3D maps, and real-time threat information, a massive amount of
    data will be shared amongst vehicles [385]. In [386], Z. Yuan et al. proposed
    a distributed antenna deployment to increase DoF in the spatial domain, for short-range
    V2V communication. Further, the paper proposed the design of a V2V transceiver,
    to support both highly reliable transmissions and a massive number of users with
    high spectrum efficiency, through utilizing power, constellation, code, and spatial
    domains. 6.7. Time-critical communication Time-critical services can be supported
    through short-range low power 6G subnetworks. For example; in industrial scenarios,
    6G subnetworks can be installed; in the body of a mobile robot for drive control
    of robot arms, in industrial scenarios or, in the body of a vehicle for distributed
    real-time wireless suspension and brake control with extremely low latency, high
    flexibility, safety, and scalability, in V2V or V2X communication scenarios or,
    in the human body for body area network (BAN), in intra-body subnetworks [387].
    Such extreme communication requirements with wired-like reliability and very low
    communication cycles can be achieved through 6G subnetworks. G. Berardinelli et
    al. in [388], consider a use case with high densities in the order of 40K per
    and communication cycles less than 0.1 ms, to study time-critical services support.
    6.8. Status update system Timely and appropriate status updating is crucial for
    remote control and monitoring applications including Industrial IoT (IIoT) and
    autonomous driving. For example, in vehicular networks, automobiles require timely
    updates of driving intention information, position, acceleration, and velocity,
    for autonomous driving, intersection scheduling, collision avoidance, and other
    driving assistance applications. The timeliness of status updates is evaluated
    through the Age of Information (AoI) however, it is incompetent of measuring critical
    time-varying and dynamic status information. X. Zheng et al. in [389], propose
    a context-based metric to estimate the timeliness of status updates, which incorporates
    both time-varying and dynamic context information, for effective remote control
    and monitoring. Table 30. 6G service classes, performance indicators, and use-cases.

    computing elements, processes, devices, sensors, people, and data employing the
    internet infrastructure. The 6G is envisaged to provide full IoE support. It is
    fundamentally derived from IoT, in form of an umbrella, which autonomously coordinates
    and integrates four properties; processes, data, physical devices, and people,
    in one frame [390]. The 6G systems will use IoE for a plethora of applications
    including the development of smart automotive, smart health, smart societies,
    and smart industries. 6.10. Holographic verticals The holographic applications
    such as holographic telepresence and holoportation allow 5D of human senses to
    realize true immersive communications. Holographic applications are based on the
    principle of the hologram, where physical recording is used to produce a 3D light
    field, resulting in an image that retains original scenes, such as depth, parallax,
    etc. It can produce details at microscopic levels. Holographic telepresence enables
    full motion real-time video conferencing or 3D images of distant objects. In holographic-telepresence,
    the images of remote or surrounding objects are captured, compressed/decompressed,
    transmitted, and lastly projected using laser beams. People from different locations
    can meet and interact with holographic displays. It can revolutionize various
    types of communications such as 3D mapping, robot control, telemedicine, education,
    gaming, advertising, aerospace navigation, and many more. 7. Conclusion The 5G
    has radio coverage limitation, as it is described as a terrestrial mobile communication
    network. Therefore, to realize global connection, 6G will intend to cover the
    entire surface of the earth. Moreover, the 6G wireless communications are expected
    to enhance global growth and productivity, create new business models, and transform
    many aspects of society. Furthermore, the 6G will make huge improvements in bandwidth
    utilization, data delivery, and application enablement. We have presented a detailed
    survey on 6G, first introducing the technical and conceptual objectives of the
    future 6G wireless communication network, in terms of data rate, latency, jitter,
    energy efficiency, spectral efficiency, mobility, network congestion, capacity,
    coverage, availability, and QoS. We have presented vision and motivations for
    6G wireless communication network, discussing various technical expectation and
    design directions of 6G. Then we review some promising technologies some including
    THz communications, molecular communications, and holographic radio, to fulfill
    the stringent requirements of 6G. Later, propose a probable 6G architecture with
    concepts of diversification, intelligence, cloudification, distribution, and automatization.
    Further, we have presented a case study of 6G network architecture, analyzed its
    performance in terms of energy efficiency and compared the results with previous
    generations. Although the novel and principle technologies are promising to enhance
    the openness and intelligence of 6G, great efforts are required to realize the
    envisaged 6G requirements. Therefore, we focus our attention on the open problems,
    in implementing the expected 6G network such as communication security threats,
    signal propagation path loss, hardware complexity, etc. We have also discussed
    the possible solutions of such challenges and future research directions towards
    development of 6G wireless communication network. We expect that the new applications
    such as wireless brain–computer interaction, IoNT, CRAS, life critical communications,
    etc. will emerge in 6G to enhance the quality of our lifestyle. We hope that this
    work motivates more collaboration between researchers from these different areas.

    A. In a ten-year horizon, the 5G is expected to evolve to achieve the future 6G
    from concept to reality. Lately, various organizations have initiated 6G studies
    to support the information and communications technology (ICT) community and global
    information in studying the network capability for the year 2030 and beyond. For
    instance, China has initiated the “Broadband Communication and New networks” project
    aimed at 2030 and beyond. Recently, few countries have released pertinent research
    plans on future 6G mobile communication systems. Teams at New York University
    have started working on quantum devices and terahertz research, aiming to achieve
    1000 times faster transmit rates in 6G than those in 5G. In September 2017, the
    European Union initiated the 6G technologies-based three-year research project
    aiming to study next-generation terabit network’s channel modulation technologies,
    advanced channel coding, and forward error correction coding (https://futurecomresearch.eu).
    To meet the unpredictable and high demands of the future generation IoT, China
    in 2017 began to study and conduct research on the 6G system (www.china.org.cn).
    With the joint efforts of Nokia and the University of Oulu, the Academy of Finland
    defined an eight-year research program to conceptualize 6G in April 2018, named,
    “6Genesis”. Few countries and industries have started research on potential technologies
    6G technologies. For instance, South Korea Telecom (SKT) has initiated non-terrestrial
    and cell-free network techniques. The United States Federal Communication Commission
    (FCC) and some universities in the United States have initiated research on terahertz
    communication and sensing technology. A consortium of Defense Advanced Research
    Projects Agency (DARPA), International Business Machines (IBM), and Intel have
    focused their research on multiple high-frequency bands (140 GHz, 220 GHz, and
    340 GHz frequencies) for ultrafast-speed transmissions (https://spectrum.ieee.org)
    and Fraunhofer Institute, Heinrich Hertz Institute other partners from the industry
    have cooperatively launched research to develop a terahertz frequency network
    connection to achieve 400 Gb/s wireless data transmission speeds (https://www.networkworld.com).
    To gain insight into the performance of the 6G research, a sub-terahertz testbed
    for D-band (110–170 GHz) and G-band (140–220 GHz) is presented by Keysight Technologies
    ( https://www.keysight.com/us/en/resources.html). Keysight’s sub-terahertz testbed
    addresses the bandwidth and performance demands for 6G research. This demonstrates
    the research’s initializations on 6G and its technologies. Appendix B. The broad
    sub-branches of ML are supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. •
    Supervised Learning In supervised learning, the previous knowledge of input and
    their corresponding expected output is exploited, and the coefficients of intermediate
    stages are designed, to learn the required system behavior and carry out requisite
    operations. Examples of supervised learning structures are Artificial Neural Network
    (ANN), Supported Vector Machine, and -Nearest Neighbor, which are generally used
    where the nature of the problem is regression and classification type. • Semi-Supervised
    and Unsupervised Learning In semi-supervised learning, the only modicum annotated
    training data is available while most of the data is uncharacterized. Whereas
    there is no elucidated training data available in unsupervised learning, and available
    collection of input data samples are employed for system training with unavailable
    knowledge of desired system response. Semi-supervised and unsupervised learning
    structures are used where the nature of the problem is clustering and classification
    type. For example; maximum likelihood learning, Principal Component Analysis,
    and -Means Clustering, etc., are used where the nature of the problem is clustering
    and classification type. Unsupervised learning techniques can be utilized in a
    wide range of works related to feature extraction and classification, clustering,
    and distribution estimation. Applications like analysis of social networking trends,
    data mining, network state prediction, temporal and spatial data analysis, malware
    detection and classification, web resource ranking, and data analysis of phone
    applications at the network and user side. • Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement
    learning is acknowledged as a compromise between supervised and unsupervised learning,
    where pairs of training data and output are unavailable and previous knowledge
    of ideal system performance is employed for indirect supervision. Reinforcement
    learning is realized through computing an explicit output for particular input
    through adaptive conjunction with ideal behavior. It is based on a feedback performance
    indicator referred to as a reward. As shown in Fig. 24 the interaction with the
    environment, in reinforcement learning is continuous; where, first the state of
    the environment is observed iteratively, next, actions are taken to affect the
    environment, then, rewards are obtained from the environment and the new environmental
    state is observed. Reinforcement learning structures for example; Q-Learning,
    and Markov decision processes, are used where the nature of the problem is control
    and classification type. Download : Download high-res image (86KB) Download :

  description: 'The internet of things (IoT) is rapidly expanding and improving operations
    in a wide range of real-world applications, from consumer IoT and enterprise IoT
    to manufacturing and industrial IoT (IIoT). Consumer markets, wearable devices,
    healthcare, smart buildings, agriculture, and smart cities are just a few examples.
    This paper discusses the current state of the IoT ecosystem, its primary applications
    and benefits, important architectural stages, some of the problems and challenges
    it faces, and its future. This paper explains how an appropriate IoT architecture
    that saves data, analyzes it, and recommends corrective action improves the process’s
    ground reality. The IoT system architecture is divided into three layers: device,
    gateway, and platform. This then cascades into the four stages of the IoT architectural
    layout: sensors and actuators; gateways and data acquisition systems; edge IT
    data processing; and datacenter and cloud, which use high-end apps to collect
    data, evaluate it, process it, and provide remedial solutions. This elegant combination
    provides excellent value in automatic action. In the future, IoT will continue
    to serve as the foundation for many technologies. Machine learning will become
    more popular in the coming years as IoT networks take center stage in a variety
    of industries.'

    1 INTRODUCTION The rapid growth of IoT in past decades has witnessed the explosion
    of applications in a wide range of fields with respect to smart city [176], industry
    [34], agriculture [19], and so on. IoT thrives on a variety of wireless communication
    technologies, such as short-range wireless standards (e.g., Zigbee, Bluetooth)
    and cellular technologies (e.g., 4G, 5G). However, in the face of the future demand
    for tens of billions of IoT access, these legacy wireless technologies are limited
    by communication range and energy consumption. In this context, such long-range
    and energy-efficient communication demands have inspired the emergence of Low
    Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) as a new IoT new paradigm, which fills the gap
    of legacy wireless communication technologies (see Figure 1). Among which, LoRa,
    due to its open-source privilege (operating in the unlicensed sub-GHz ISM band)
    and low-cost Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices compared with other LPWAN
    technologies such as NB-IoT and SigFox, shows great potential in industry and
    research communities recently. Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Comparison with legacy wireless
    communication technologies. LoRa is a proprietary spread spectrum modulation technique
    on the basis of Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS), which is resilient and robust against
    interference and noise. Such modulation technique and a high sensitivity offered
    by LoRa enable receiving the potential weak signals at extremely low energy consumption,
    which provides significant link budget improvement to support a wide coverage
    [94]. LoRaWAN is a data link layer specification built on top of LoRa, defining
    the typical stat-topology network architecture and its bi-directional communication
    protocol. To date, LoRa networks have been deployed by 163 LoRaWAN network operators
    across 177 countries globally [76], widely distributed in various applications
    scenarios that require large-scale and delay-insensitive deployment [19, 21, 34,
    176]. In the research community, an intuitive fact is that nearly 1,000 papers
    involving LoRa in their contents were published during 2021 through Google Scholar
    hits for the “LoRa” keyword (see Figure 2).1 Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Number of papers
    with years through Google Scholar hits for “LoRa” and “LPWAN” keywords. Due to
    large-scale deployments and promising prospects of LoRa, extensive works on LoRa
    have been presented since its appearance. Accordingly, such fact motivated several
    survey papers [56, 85] on LoRa in the recent six years. In particular, some early
    surveys [22, 62, 146] gave an overview of LoRa with an emphasis of preliminary
    background and principle introduction, which laid a foundation for follow-up research.
    A small portion targeted specific areas such as testbed [103], simulator [32],
    security [114], and mesh topology [29]. Recently, several comprehensive surveys
    of LoRa [56, 85] were proposed. For example, Gkotsiopoulos et al. [56] focused
    on the network capacity from five main aspects, encompassing PHY layer characteristics,
    deployment and hardware features, transmission settings, MAC protocols, and application
    requirements. Li and Cao [85] gave a comprehensive and structured survey of LoRa
    from a two-dimensional taxonomy: networking layers (i.e., PHY, MAC, Link, and
    Application layer) and performance metrics (i.e., range, throughput, energy, and
    security). However, many LoRa methods typically do not show a clear boundary on
    the networking layer level but span multiple ones. In comparison with prior works
    (see Table 1), our survey presents two novel contributions. First, our survey
    covers various efforts made to LoRa comprehensively and up to date, which complements
    the previously published ones. Second, our survey summarizes and compares LoRa
    works from a new perspective. Figure 3 gives a taxonomy of our survey. Specifically,
    our article provides a comprehensive survey on LoRa from four-fold: LoRa analysis
    works and tools, LoRa communication studies in terms of Physical (PHY) and Media
    Access Control (MAC) layer, LoRa security vulnerabilities and countermeasures,
    and LoRa-enabled applications. The rationale behind the organization is that,
    since the advent of LoRa, early-stage studies focus on understanding and analyzing
    LoRa performance through various field studies or simulation tools. Afterward,
    as a networking technology, a large quantity of research efforts have been made
    to improve the performance of LoRa networks in communication. Meanwhile, with
    massive deployments of LoRa networks, security is receiving much attention. As
    LoRa tends to mature in a variety of common IoT applications, many works contribute
    ones beyond the scope of LoRa radio. Thus, such taxonomy provides a good fit for
    the cognition of the evolution of LoRa technology, which provides an aggregation
    of LoRa methodologies in different aspects and a new perspective for the research
    community. In particular, the four parts are specified as follows: Fig. 3. Fig.

    analysis works aim to investigate and interpret LoRa network performance in various
    environments, which can also serve the further exploration in various LoRa communication,
    security, and its enabled applications works. Specifically, these works include
    early-stage performance measurements and three types of conducted tools: analytical
    models, simulators, and testbeds. LoRa Communication. Many efforts have been made
    to target improving the performance of LoRa networks in communication, in terms
    of throughput, communication range, scalability, and energy consumption. These
    works give a focus on LoRa PHY and MAC layer, which can be divided into three
    categories: LoRa (de)modulation techniques, MAC protocols, and configuration settings.
    LoRa Security. Security is fragile but critical for any wireless communication
    technologies, receiving significant attention in vulnerabilities and countermeasures,
    coupled with PHY layer security methods. LoRa-enabled Applications. The wide deployment
    of LoRa networks has inspired a wide range of applications, including backscatter,
    sensing, integration with heterogeneous wireless technologies, and other applications.
    Based on that, comparisons of existing LoRa works (e.g., in Tables 6, 8, 11, 12,
    13), with brief summaries and insightful discussions, are also given. The remainder
    of the survey is organized as follows: LoRa preliminary, inclusive of its PHY
    and MAC layer, is introduced in Section 2. LoRa analysis works and different types
    of tools are reviewed in Section 3. Various LoRa communication studies are surveyed
    and compared in Section 4. LoRa security vulnerabilities and countermeasures are
    discussed in Section 5. LoRa-enabled applications in different fields are reviewed
    in Section 6. The challenges and potential future development of LoRa are discussed
    in Section 7, followed by the Conclusion in Section 8. Skip 2LORA PRELIMINARY
    Section 2 LORA PRELIMINARY Although LoRa has been extensively introduced in numerous
    papers, to make this article self-contained, we provide a brief preliminary of
    LoRa, together with LoRa PHY layer and LoRaWAN MAC layer. 2.1 LoRa Overview LoRa,
    standing for “Long Range,” is a proprietary spread spectrum modulation technique,
    while LoRaWAN is a data link layer specification built on top of LoRa. LoRa operates
    in the unlicensed sub-GHz ISM radio band, depending on the deployed regions (e.g.,
    863– 870MHz in Europe, 902– 928MHz in the USA), but also obliges to the duty cycle
    regulations (e.g., 1% in Europe). Compared with short-range wireless standards
    and cellular technologies, LoRa shows remarkable results in long-range transmission
    and ultra-low power consumption. Specifically, its coverage range is up to 15
    km (rural areas) and 5 km (urban areas), its device battery life is up to 10 years,
    and its data rate ranges from 0.3 to 37.5Kbps [22]. Some other properties, such
    as low cost of devices, concurrent reception capacity of gateways, and the resiliency
    of modulation attribute against fading, multipath, and Doppler effect compared
    to other wireless signals [89], also make LoRa compelling. It is noted that real-life
    deployed LoRa networks typically cannot obtain the optimal performance that LoRa
    promises, due to the deployment complexity and various interference. 2.2 LoRa
    PHY Layer LoRa PHY layer adopts a proprietary spread spectrum modulation technique
    derived from CSS with an integrated Forward Error Correction (FEC) mechanism [128],
    which offers substantial processing gains for link budget improvements and resiliency
    to multipath and interference. Figure 4 shows a LoRa packet structure, which consists
    of a preamble with 8 base up-chirps, a synchronization word with 2 base up-chirps,
    a Start of Frame Delimiter (SFD) with 2.25 base down-chirps, and payload data
    followed by Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC). Fig. 4. Fig. 4. LoRa PHY packet structure.
    In LoRa modulation, the frequency of chirps constantly varies linearly with time
    within the pre-defined available narrow bandwidth. Specifically, a base up-chirp
    is defined as one that linear sweeps from its initial frequency −BW/2 to BW/2
    , represented as C(t)= e j2π( k 2 t− BW 2 )t . LoRa modulation is performed by
    representing each bit of payload by multiple chirps with a shifted initial frequency
    f sym , thus the signal of a symbol is denoted as S(t, f sym )=C(t)⋅ e j2π f sym
    t [68]. As for the demodulation, the receiver performs the “de-chirp” operation
    where each received symbol is multiplied with a base down-chirp (i.e., the conjugate
    of a base up-chirp), denoted as S(t, f sym )⋅ C −1 (t)= e j2π f sym t [68], resulting
    in a single frequency tone. Then the receiver applies the Fast Fourier Transform
    (FFT) on the multiplication result, where the resulted one FFT peak indicates
    the initial frequency f sym . The configuration for a LoRa device is mainly specified
    by such parameters: Spreading Factor (SF), BandWidth (BW), Code Rate (CR), Carrier
    Frequency (CF), and Transmission Power (TP). Specifically, SF, ranging from 7
    to 12, represents the number of symbols per bit of payload. A higher applied SF
    incurs a lower data rate, longer propagation time, and more energy consumption,
    but provides better sensitivity and a wider transmission distance. Hence, devices
    located farther from the gateway require a higher SF due to the more link budget
    need, which provides increased processing gain but at the cost of a lower data
    rate. Besides, SFs are orthogonal (essentially quasi-orthogonal [128]), which
    allows transmission of signals modulated with different SF in the same channel.
    The BW is typically 125kHz , 250kHz , and 500kHz . And the CR, denoting the rate
    of the FEC code, can be set to 4/5, 4/6, 4/7, or 4/8, where a higher one offers
    more protection at the cost of increasing the air time. Then, the LoRa modulation
    bit rate R b can be calculated through R b =SF× BW 2 SF ×CR . Besides, LoRa band
    in distinct regions defines different multiple frequency channels, and CF is the
    center frequency of these channels. TP on a LoRa radio is restricted by the specific
    hardware, generally ranging from 2 to 20dBm [14]. Tuning the parameters above
    can achieve a tradeoff between communication range, data rate, and power consumption,
    which inspires plenty of configuration setting methods (see Section 4.3). 2.3
    LoRaWAN MAC Layer LoRa only defines the lower PHY layer in the communication stack,
    resulting in several available upper network protocols, among which LoRaWAN is
    the most popular networking protocol. It is noted that LoRaWAN is extensively
    regarded as a MAC protocol for LoRa; however, the LoRaWAN stack operates at the
    data link layer and does not define any channel access control scheme. LoRaWAN
    protocol mainly defines LoRa network architecture and its bi-directional communication
    protocol. As shown in Figure 5, the LoRaWAN network architecture is a typical
    star topology, mainly including end devices, gateways, network servers, and application
    servers. End devices (also called nodes, clients, points) equipped with various
    sensors are placed in the scenarios as data sources. Gateways (also called base
    stations) are the bridge between end devices and network servers. Network servers
    are the LoRa network controller taking charge of the management of devices and
    applications, while application servers provide the operation interface with users.
    Additionally, LoRaWAN defines three types of operation classes for end devices,
    i.e., class A(ll), B(eacon), and C(ontinue). Class A is the default one that all
    devices must implement, while B and C are the optional ones. Class A, where two
    receive downlink windows are created shortly after an uplink transmission from
    devices, is the most energy-efficient among these three ones. Apart from two receive
    slots, end devices add scheduled downlink ping slots in class B, triggered by
    synchronization beacons broadcasting from gateways. Class C, where end devices
    continuously keep listening when unless are transmitting (i.e., half-duplex),
    thereby is the most energy-consuming one. Choosing the optimal operation class
    can reduce energy consumption and meet the response time requirements of different
    application scenarios. Fig. 5. Fig. 5. LoRa network architecture. Additionally,
    LoRaWAN provides media access, Adaptive Data Rate (ADR), and security services.
    LoRaWAN MAC layer employs a default primitive ALOHA MAC protocol [49] that allows
    end devices to transmit as soon as they wake up, without channel detection and
    time synchronization. Besides, ADR is a vital mechanism of LoRaWAN, allowing end
    devices to be configured with different data rates dynamically according to network
    conditions. However, LoRaWAN does not give a definition of the ADR algorithm,
    hence resulting in many studies [81]. LoRaWAN provides security functions by relying
    on Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithms and two 128-bit unique session
    keys (i.e., NwkSKey and AppSKey) to complete data encryption, message integrity
    checking, and node authentication. The session keys can be obtained through two
    activation processes, i.e., Activation By Personalization (ABP) and Over-The-Air
    Activation (OTAA). Skip 3LORA ANALYSIS Section 3 LORA ANALYSIS Since the advent
    of LoRa technology, various LoRa performance analysis works have been ongoing,
    aiming to investigate and interpret the performance of LoRa networks in terms
    of throughput, communication range, scalability, and energy consumption. Specifically,
    these works include early-stage performance measurements and three types of conducted
    tools (i.e., analytical models, simulators, and testbeds). Analytical models are
    designed to give a mathematical explanation process for some specific tasks, such
    as link and energy analysis. Simulators are popular in theoretical method evaluation
    due to their convenience and low cost. Testbeds are utilized for the performance
    evaluation of the real LoRa network under different scenarios to explore its capabilities
    and limitations to provide a benchmark standard. To this end, we first give a
    summary of performance measurement works, then review corresponding analysis tools
    in this section. 3.1 Performance Measurements Some early performance measurement
    works conduct testbed experiments, perform simulations, build analytical models,
    or adopt their collaborations to explore LoRa-related performances in terms of
    LoRa radio [8], link condition [44], node energy consumption [89], network communication
    range [120], scalability [108], and so on. It is noted that analytical models
    are generally inevitable parts serving for testbed experiments and simulations,
    but testbed measurement is the most favored choice owing to its real and objective
    experimental results. Table 2 summarizes the classical performance measurement
    works, along with their corresponding conclusions. Table 2. Reference Year Experimental

    Measurement Works (PRR: Packet Reception Ratio, RSSI: Received Signal Strength
    Indication, SIR: Signal-to-Interference Ratio, SNR: Signal-to-Noise Ratio). Liando
    et al. [89] conducted various LoRa network performance measurements in a 3-gateway
    and over 50-node testbed. Specifically, they revealed: (1) the communication range
    in the line-of-sight (LOS) scenario is 10 km, while drops sharply to 2 km in obstacle
    blocking non-line-of-sight (NLOS) one under the settings of SF12 and PRR 70%;
    (2) the predicted node lifetime under different configuration settings ranges
    from 1.19 to 4.54 years; (3) multiple access performances in terms of SF and single-channel
    capacity, where the gateway capacity is 6,249 nodes with PRR 70%. Besides, they
    provided some insights on the enhancement of parameter optimization, MAC protocol,
    concurrent reception, and PHY layer based on their measurements. Xu et al. [177]
    investigated the LoRaWAN network performance in four types of multi-floor buildings,
    including LoRa large-scale and temporal fading characteristics, coverage, and
    energy consumption. They conclude that many factors, such as building materials
    and layout, influence the path loss greatly, and the temporal fading follows Rician
    distribution with its K-factors falls between 12 and 18dB . Tian et al. [152]
    released a large-scale dataset focusing on the network and link-level performance
    in a 21-node outdoor LoRa network for over four months. Specifically, the data
    features with three types of attributes, i.e., basic (time, SF, TP, etc.), connectivity
    and link quality (PRR, RSS, SNR), and environmental (temperature measured by nodes,
    weather condition, etc.) attributes. Besides, they provided evaluation scripts
    for data analysis and visualization. LoRa preliminary performance measurement
    works aim to understand the capabilities and limitations of LoRa networks, which
    have made a fundamental contribution to the follow-up research. Liando et al.
    [89] conducted large-scale deployment and measurement to comprehensively investigate
    the performance of LoRa networks in terms of range, energy, and capacity. Radio
    fading [177] and inter-SF transmission [44] also received considerable attention.
    Additionally, public datasets [152] provide a novel and labor-saving solution
    for research. However, the type of hardware and the diversity of deployment environments
    bring complexity to such measurement works. Furthermore, quantifying LoRa performance
    with the corresponding factors is a crucial and popular research trend. 3.2 Analytical
    Models An analytical model, i.e., a mathematical model with closed-form solutions,
    quantitatively represents the interrelationship of a set of parameters to describe
    a specific problem. A large number of methods pursue capturing the complexity
    of real-world deployment of LoRa networks to derive an accurate, interpretative,
    and general analytical model before solving various research problems such as
    optimal parameter assignments [53]. The existing analytical models mainly concentrate
    on the link and energy models, where network deployment, device configuration,
    and environmental factors are integrated into these models for LoRa link and energy
    analysis. Table 3 summarizes current LoRa analytical models. Table 3. Reference

    Link Models. A large body of work aims to understand the channel quality by analyzing
    the link conditions of LoRa networks, such as path loss [94], delivery ratio [157],
    and interference. In a single gateway scenario, Georgiou and Raza [55] leveraged
    a stochastic geometry framework to study link-outage conditions concerned with
    SNR and co-SF and revealed that the network scalability is susceptible to the
    latter one owing to the exponential degrading performance. Likewise, SNR threshold,
    co-, and inter-SF interference were studied in References [102, 166]. Several
    models [55, 166] only considered simple network topologies or make strict assumptions
    about the spatial network distribution, resulting in poor generality. Toro-Betancur
    et al. [157] proposed a general node-level delivery ratio model without any restrictions
    on network deployment or device configuration, which characterizes quasi-orthogonal
    transmission under many considerations such as capture effect, duty cycle, multiple
    gateways, and channel variation. Besides, several methods [12, 40] focus on the
    path loss modeling of LoRa networks. The path loss (also called path attenuation)
    refers to the power attenuation during the transmission, varying along with different
    land-covers on the path due to the radio reflection, diffraction, and so on. Chall
    et al. [40] adapted the most widely used free-space, log-distance, and multiwall-and-floor
    path loss models based on the empirical measurement results to derive their models
    in indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. Remote sensing techniques are
    utilized for land-covers analysis in References [37, 94]. Demetri et al. [37]
    proposed an automated link quality estimation method without on-site measurements,
    which can also be used for gateway deployment planning. Specifically, they first
    proposed a toolchain to recognize seven types of land-covers based on freely multispectral
    images from satellites, and then they presented an Okumura-Hata [107] model-based
    framework for expected received power estimation. Rather than the physical path
    loss model [40], Liu et al. [94] proposed a deep learning-based long-distance
    path loss estimation framework termed DeepLoRa, with an emphasis on the types
    and order of land-covers. Specifically, DeepLoRa divides the link into an ordered
    sequence of micro links with equal length and utilizes remote sensing images to
    identify the detailed land-covers of each micro-link. Then, DeepLoRa adopts a
    Bidirectional Long-Short-Term-Memory (Bi-LSTM) network to learn the path loss
    model. Energy Models. Energy consumption of LoRa nodes to complete routine data
    collection and transmission process is a key indicator for constrained LoRa networks.
    Thus, several studies [20, 89] proposed models to characterize the energy consumption
    of transmission or the nodes’ lifetime. Casals et al. [20] first defined the different
    states of the nodes from waking up to sleep in one transmission, then derived
    a series of energy models under various considerations concerning data rate, collision,
    un- and acknowledged transmission. Specifically, they modeled the node average
    current consumption of these different states, lifetime through the battery capacity
    divided by the current, and energy efficiency of data delivery through the real
    divided by the expected one. Bouguera et al. [16] deduced an energy model allowing
    for different settings of parameters and IoT scenarios by calculating and summing
    the energy consumption of inner sensor node elements in sleep and active operating
    modes. Liando et al. [89] modeled the energy consumption to quantify the lifetime
    of LoRa nodes via the testbed measurement across multiple chipsets. Specifically,
    they first captured the energy profile of the microcontroller unit (MCU) and LoRa
    transceiver using a monsoon power monitor under different parameter settings,
    then calculated the node lifetime by multiplying the single transmission cycle
    time duration and the supporting transmission cycle number of a specific battery.
    Besides, several models [36, 96] explored the possibility of energy harvesting
    of LoRa. Delgado et al. [36] first derived a battery-free LoRa node model involving
    energy harvesting system, circuit, and load models, then proposed a Markov model
    to characterize the uplink packet delivery ratio (PDR) and probability of receiving
    downlink packets, defined by parameters with respect to device configuration,
    application behavior, and so on. Finnegan et al. [46] explored the boundaries
    of the feasibility of ambient Radio Frequency (RF) energy harvesting for LoRa
    devices. Specifically, they first recombined the energy model of nodes from the
    sensing, networking, data processing, and other system tasks parts, then deduced
    the aggregated energy model by quantifying ambient RF power level and integrating
    the impacts of harvesting components including rectenna, power management unit,
    and storage device. In general, a reliable analytical model integrates principle
    characterization and interrelationship of parameters to reflect the internal law,
    which is significantly vital for further research in terms of quantitative analysis
    and performance evaluation. For link models, network configuration, SF quasi-orthogonality,
    and radio fading are typically common considerations. Remote sensing techniques
    [37, 94] provide a solution for measurement-free link modelling, which can be
    used for localization [91]. For energy models, the energy profiles under different
    inner units, states, and parameter settings are captured. Additionally, energy
    harvesting models shed light on some harvester designs [100]. However, strict
    assumptions, complex and long-term environmental variance will limit the deduction
    of general models. 3.3 Simulators A network simulator is a virtual tool to explore
    the system-level or link-level performance through the reproduction of communication
    interactions in the networks. It is typically composed of network configuration
    definition (e.g., topology, parameter, and propagation model), event simulation
    (e.g., uplink and downlink), and performance evaluation. Simulators are widely
    used in theoretical model evaluation when large-scale testbeds are not deployed
    or inconvenient to operate. Therefore, several open-source LoRa simulators have
    been proposed in recent years, especially used for LoRa network scalability and
    throughput evaluation. Table 4 presents current popular simulators designed for
    LoRa networks, along with their included features. Table 4. Simulator Year Envir.

    of LoRa Network Simulators (Topol.: Topology). Bor et al. [15] proposed a simulator
    termed LoRaSim based on their derived communication behavior model involving range
    and collision behavior considerations. Specifically, the range considers the configuration
    settings (i.e., received signal power, path loss, and sensitivity) to determine
    whether a packet is received or not, while the collision behavior determines the
    decoding under different conditions (i.e., CF, SF, timing, power). Magrin et al.
    [101] designed an ns-3 module for the LoRaWAN network performance simulation under
    the assumptions at both the link and the system level. Specifically, the link
    model contains a link measurement model abstracting the effect of such as propagation
    loss and fading, and a performance model determining transmission and interference.
    The system model includes SF and CF allocation tasks. Abeele et al. [159] built
    a physical error model through the baseband simulations over an Additive White
    Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel, together with LoRaWAN MAC protocol, for the proposed
    ns-3 simulator. Croce et al. [30] focused on the superposition of multiple LoRa
    radios from different SFs. Besides, several proposed simulators were designed
    with an emphasis on specific methods, such as ADR [45, 140] and MAC protocol [2].
    Marini et al. [106] proposed LoRaWANSim, a to-date simulator for the sake of completeness,
    which characterizes the LoRaWAN network behavior with respect to PHY, MAC, and
    network aspects. In general, a simulator is an efficient, convenient, and low-cost
    tool to evaluate the performance of LoRa networks. Many classic simulators have
    been proposed so far, including References [15, 30, 101], and LoRaWANSim [106]
    is the most comprehensive one to date. However, current simulators are not full-featured
    enough, owing to the focus on some specific kinds of tasks. Hence, developing
    full-featured simulators still deserves further efforts. In addition, the characteristics
    of the simulator indicate that it is generally suitable for the theoretical method
    evaluation, so the testbed can make up for it with regard to the evaluation objectivity
    and reality. 3.4 Testbeds A testbed is a real-life deployment platform containing
    complete network components, aiming at conducting controllable and reproducible
    experiments to obtain actual results via real-life deployments. Apart from private
    LoRa networks [49, 92], research communities have contributed to many public open-source
    testbeds for evaluation works. Current public open-source testbeds primarily include
    testbeds platforms [54] and endpoint prototypes [65]. Specifically, remotely accessible
    testbed platforms typically contain a complete network architecture for stand-alone
    instance spawning, including device management, programming, and web services.
    They enable researchers for remote application test and development, which resolve
    the problem of high-cost, time-consuming, and labor-consuming deployment and maintenance
    of a LoRaWAN testbed. Testbed endpoint prototypes provide a flexible and easily
    deployable solution in terms of heterogeneous networking protocol, inconvenient
    network (e.g., Ethernet, cellular), and power conditions. It is noted that both
    of them rely on a framework for device and service profiles management. Table
    5 lists current LoRa public testbed platforms and endpoint prototypes. Table 5.

    Testbed Platforms. Dongare et al. [38] proposed an open-source LoRaWAN network
    testbed platform termed OpenChirp, built upon LoRaWAN with the user management
    framework, application programming interfaces (APIs), and core services. In particular,
    OpenChirp is currently powering a hosted campus network, enabling users to spawn
    stand-alone instances with various services concerning device registration, data
    serialization and storage, and web access. Gao et al. [54] proposed LinkLab, a
    scalable and heterogeneous testbed with support for multi-user and multi-site
    remotely experimenting and web-based developing. Specifically, LinkLab is composed
    of the WebIDE, online compilers featuring incremental compilation and multi-user
    caching, and device management components with a unified naming mechanism. Likewise,
    FIT IoT-Lab [3] and FlockLab 2 [158] large-scale testbeds also support heterogeneous
    wireless nodes including LoRa, but they possess a limited number of nodes and
    are deployed mainly in indoor environments [151]. Testbed Endpoint Prototypes.
    Lone et al. [97] presented a framework for controllable and reproducible LoRa
    testbeds termed WiSH-WalT, which consists of a WiSHFUL unified interface for flexible
    radio and network settings and a WalT single-board computer for easy device deployment
    and operation monitoring. Hessar et al. [65] proposed the first Software-Defined
    Radio (SDR) platform named TinySDR to enable large-scale deployment and over-the-air
    programming. Specifically, TinySDR is composed of software radio, OTA programmer,
    and a power management system, supporting various research of PHY/MAC protocols,
    IoT localization, backscatter readers, and so on. Besides, TinySDR outperforms
    existing SDR platforms in terms of low power consumption and cost. The complexity
    of assembling the backbone infrastructure limits the development and availability
    of existing LoRa outdoor testbeds. To this end, Tian et al. [151] proposed an
    infrastructure-less LoRa testbed termed ChirpBox, which could be deployed in areas
    without the need of cellular or backbone infrastructure providing communication
    and power conditions. Specifically, all LoRa target nodes are equipped with a
    daemon used for orchestrating the node’s activities (e.g., execution of a test
    run, the collection of log trace) and a Firmware Under Test (FUT) for running
    tests. Target nodes are connected via a multi-hop network to the control node
    that serves as an interface with the user. Besides, they designed an efficient
    all-to-all multi-channel protocol-based concurrent transmission termed LoRaDisC
    to disseminate the FUT and test-run configurations. In general, current public
    open-source LoRa testbeds provide a flexible and low-cost solution for researchers
    to conduct controllable and reproducible experiments for real-life evaluation,
    presenting significantly important to the research community. The existing testbed
    platforms [3, 38, 54, 158] all built a well-defined framework, among which LinkLab
    [54] can support multi-user remote development featuring Web-based development
    and incremental compilation. However, the existing testbed platforms only possess
    a limited number of LoRa nodes and type of sensors (mainly including temperature,
    humidity, sound, acceleration, and light sensors), whereas FlockLab 2 [158] is
    also capable of achieving high-dynamic range power and logic timing measurements
    for the debug and trace. FIT IoT-Lab [3], FlockLab 2 [158], and LinkLab [54] testbeds
    support various heterogeneous IoT nodes in various places, while OpenChirp [38]
    is a LoRa-specific testbed, but is deployed in restricted campus areas with an
    unknown number of LoRa nodes. Early testbed platforms [3, 158] are generally more
    popular than the emerging ones [38, 54], due to their stable and mature operations.
    Besides, as for the programmable endpoint prototypes, TinySDR [65] provides large-scale
    deployments with ultra-low energy consumption manner and OTA solutions, which
    is also satiable for research with respect to backscatter, PHY/MAC protocol, sensing,
    and so on. Likewise, ChirpBox [151] offers an infrastructure-less solution, featuring
    firmware dissemination and log trace, which is hence recommended to be deployed
    in remote areas without communication and power conditions. Additionally, both
    possess a low cost of construction and the capability of concurrent reception,
    but require a battery supply where energy harvesting can be further considered
    [151]. However, current testbeds have some limitations with regard to hardware
    (limited number of nodes and sensors, single network topology), framework (limited
    functionalities), and user experience (complex operation). Hence, providing a
    large-scale, comprehensive, and human-machine friendly testbed is in great need.
    Skip 4LORA COMMUNICATION Section 4 LORA COMMUNICATION After fully understanding
    the performance of LoRa, a large number of studies have been devoted to enhancing
    its performance in communication. In this section, we review these studies from
    three aspects: modulation and demodulation schemes, MAC protocols, and configuration
    setting methods. Specifically, various LoRa modulation and demodulation schemes
    were proposed for the network throughput improvement on the basis of LoRa PHY
    layer CSS modulation and de-chirp demodulation. In addition, modified MAC protocols
    aim to handle multiple access problems without incurring collisions. Configuration
    settings refer to optimal determination of transmission parameter sets to rationalize
    the use of channel resources and achieve energy fairness across nodes. 4.1 Modulation
    & Demodulation As stated in Section 2.2, LoRa PHY layer adopts a spread spectrum
    modulation technique derived from CSS, possessing substantial processing gains
    and link budget improvements. With considerable modulation benefits, LoRa demodulation
    based on the de-chirp operation enables low-SNR [86] and collision [167] signals
    decoding, which also receives great attention. Consequently, extensive methods
    [61, 167] were proposed to expand the benefits of LoRa PHY modulation technique.
    4.1.1 Modulation. Recently, some modified modulation methods [27, 42] were proposed
    to leverage LoRa CSS properties or adopt a combination with other modulation techniques,
    aiming at increasing the modulation data rate without compromising its original
    performance. Traditional digital modulation is primarily based on the amplitude,
    frequency, and phase information of the carrier to form these particular parameters
    shift keying, including conventional ASK, FSK, PSK, along with their improvements
    or combinations. The essence of LoRa modulation is the frequency shift of the
    chirp, thus some LoRa modified modulation methods [13, 112] mainly try to carry
    extra data information in the LoRa symbols by combining with other modulation
    techniques to increase the data rate. Bomfin et al. [13] proposed a modulation
    method termed PSK-LoRa, which adopts PSK modulation to embed additional data in
    the phase shift of the transmitted chirps. Specifically, the information bits
    are divided into two groups, which determine the initial frequency and the initial
    phase of the LoRa symbol, respectively. Similarly, in Reference [112], LoRa symbols
    can start from any phase value with the help of the pulse shaping filter, such
    that extra data information can be encoded to the initial stage of each symbol,
    which is then recovered using a coherent receiver. It is noted that PSK can only
    be decoded under coherent demodulation, as no carrier component is in the PSK
    signal’s power spectrum. Such additional receiver design, along with timing and
    phase synchronization requirements, will increase the cost and degrade the battery
    life of nodes. Besides, some methods [42, 61] focus on elaborate LoRa signal orthogonal
    sets. In LoRa conventional CSS modulation, the linearly varying-frequency up-chirp
    spans the entire bandwidth, whose cyclic shift serves as a multi-dimensional space
    for the orthogonal signals. Elshabrawy and Robert [42] proposed an Interleaved
    Chirp Spreading LoRa (ICS-LoRa) modulation method, which creates a new multi-dimensional
    space from the interleaved version of nominal LoRa signals. Specifically, the
    proposed ICS interleaver block subdivides the given signal containing 2 SF S samples
    into four subintervals and simply swaps the samples of the two middle intervals
    of each signal. Such that ICS-LoRa can deploy all 2 SF S possible cyclic shifts
    of the interleaved base chirp signal to achieve interleaved chirp signal that
    carries one extra bit within each symbol. In addition, ICS-LoRa demodulation can
    also share this ICS interleaver block for simplification without any coherent
    demodulation requirements. To reduce the cross-correlation between generated and
    base chirps in ICS-LoRa, Hanif et al. [61] proposed a slope-shift-keying LoRa
    (SSK-LoRa) modulation method, which utilizes the linearly varying-frequency down-chirp
    to generate the second orthogonal basis set to increase the data rate. The improved
    modulation technique is promising, since it can carry more data in one transmitted
    symbol. Some studies [61, 112] have achieved the throughput gain from 11% to 33%
    of LoRa networks. However, the complexity of the transceiver design, the compatibility
    with COTS devices, and energy consumption issues still make this work challenging.
    4.1.2 Demodulation. Recently, plenty of LoRa demodulation studies were proposed
    to push the limit of LoRa capabilities in terms of single-source decoding and
    collision disambiguation. Single-source Decoding Methods. Single-source decoding
    methods aim to improve the performance of decoding signals from one specific source,
    mainly including low-SNR decoding [86], Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) [39],
    error recovery methods [104], and so on. Low-SNR decoding refers to the correct
    payload reduction of the received signals with an ultra-low SNR or RSSI. Such
    methods can break the decoding threshold of conventional LoRa and significantly
    improve the link budget to provide a wider coverage. The standard LoRa demodulation
    method performs the de-chirp operation to determine the SNR threshold, which is
    generally sub-optimal. To this end, Li et al. [86] proposed NELoRa, a Deep Neural
    Network (DNN) demodulator to decode ultra-low SNR LoRa signals by extracting fine-grained
    information embedded in LoRa chirps. Specifically, NELoRa transforms the extracted
    chirp symbols to dual-channel spectrograms containing phase and amplitude, which
    are then fed into the dual-stream DNN for demodulation. The first DNN stream performs
    the noise filter operation to obtain a masked spectrogram, while the second one
    is used for packet decoding. Tong et al. [154] proposed Falcon, which provides
    an available link for unreachable LoRa devices via making them selectively interfering
    transmissions of other devices (base signals) on the same channel. Specifically,
    a Falcon device overhears the channel using a CAD-based detection approach and
    synchronizes its time and frequency offset by a reception-based algorithm, then
    maximizes the base signal deformation by an adaptive frequency adjusting strategy.
    Additionally, several emerging methods [39, 93, 134] focused on the C-RAN design.
    Specifically, C-RAN is a centralized radio access network architecture based on
    cloud computing, whose core is to process the LPWAN PHY layer in the cloud. Hence,
    LoRa C-RAN architecture mainly transfers the incompetent PHY layer decoding tasks
    at the gateway to the cloud and exploits the spatial diversity gain for weak signal
    reconstruction. For example, Dongare et al. [39] proposed Charm, a LoRa C-RAN
    that pools and jointly decodes weak signals that cannot decode in any individual
    gateway into the cloud. In particular, the gateway introduces a hardware and software
    design to detect those signals much weaker than the noise floor by transforming
    the structure of the LoRa packet data symbol as resistant as the preamble. The
    cloud first adopts a phase-based time synchronization method, then exploits the
    timing and geographical location of the received signals to identify their sources
    (i.e., the combination of gateways) and collates such information to recover the
    transmitted data finally. Jointly decoding the multi-channel LoRa PHY layers in
    the cloud can improve the SNR of the radio signal but requires a higher bandwidth,
    which will then cause severe network congestion. To reduce the bandwidth, Liu
    et al. [93] proposed a compressive sensing-based C-RAN termed Nephalai, which
    leverages the sparsity of the PHY layer for signal compression and joint reconstruction.
    Specifically, Nephalai utilizes tailored dictionaries and measurement matrices
    for LoRa PHY layer compression, with which the adaptive compression ratios are
    chosen by considering SF and SNR. In all, LoRa offers substantial processing gains
    and link budgets to decode low-SNR signals. Thus, many LoRa low-SNR signal decoding
    methods adopt different methodologies to expand these advantages and improve network
    throughput. Among these, learning methods [86] can achieve a high upper limit
    of the SNR gain based on the representation learning of data samples, but possess
    a poor generalization for distinct settings. Besides, C-RAN architectures [39,
    93] mitigate the disadvantages of LPWAN in terms of narrow bandwidth and loose
    latency bounds. A full-scale distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
    system embedded in C-RAN can provide a solution for handling collisions from a
    large number of nodes [39]. However, C-RAN architectures have a high operating
    cost, short transmission distance, and insufficient security, thus inspiring further
    developments. Packets may be lost or destructed during transmission due to the
    varying channel and environment conditions. Thus, a payload recovery scheme [9,
    104, 143] is hence considered to provide the increasing gain and enhance network
    throughput. Marcelis et al. [104] proposed a data recovery coding scheme at the
    application layer termed DaRe, which applies fountain codes on a sliding window
    with a finite window. DaRe extends the frame with the parity check of randomly
    selected previous frames as the redundancy data, such that the receiver can decode
    all payload data when only subsets are received. However, this comes at the cost
    of increased transmission time. Balanuta et al. [9] proposed an Opportunistic
    Packet Recovery (OPR) approach, which exploits gateway spatial diversity and tracks
    packet RSSI value for error detection and leverages the Message Integrity Check
    (MIC) field information for error correction. Specifically, OPR collects and groups
    the corrupt packets across gateways instead of discarding them, then generates
    a candidate set of corrupt bits based on the spatial diversity and reception time.
    The generated candidate set is leveraged by the cloud to search through the possible
    valid CRC combinations, which results in a few packets for final filtering via
    MIC check. Additionally, decreasing clock rates can reduce the energy consumption
    of LoRa radio, but it is limited by the Nyquist sampling theorem that requires
    the clock rate to be at least twice the LoRa chirp bandwidth. To reliably decode
    packets sampled at the sub-Nyquist rate, Xia et al. [169] proposed LiteNap, which
    introduces downclocked operating mode for LoRa. They had two-fold observations:
    first, two under-sampled LoRa chirps suffer from frequency aliasing that causes
    demodulation ambiguity; second, radio hardware induces a constant phase shift
    to all modulated chirp after jitters, resulting in frequency leakage in the time
    domain. Based on these, LiteNap leverages such frequency leakage as a fingerprint
    to uniquely identify a LoRa chirp and extract the timing information. Besides,
    they proposed novel packet detection and synchronization strategies, along with
    the integration with LoRaWAN protocol. Collision Disambiguation Methods. The LoRa
    gateway has an extremely wide coverage of nodes, thus LoRa networks may be subject
    to pervasive and severe intra- and inter-network interference, especially when
    in a dense deployment scenario. Interference adversely affects the signal reception,
    coupled with the capture effect, which is a waste of air time and spectrum. This
    problem results in the demand to support concurrent transmissions or avoid collisions.
    Consequently, plenty of interference solutions were proposed, including PHY layer
    collision disambiguation algorithms [167, 168] to recover packet information and
    MAC protocols [49, 173] (reviewed in Section 4.2) to maximize the use of channel
    resources, which both do not conflict but collaborate with each other. Collision
    disambiguation refers to the separation and correct decoding of multiple collided
    signals at the receive side. As stated in Section 2.2, in demodulation, the LoRa
    receiver detects the packet preamble and SFD and divides the received signals
    into a series of windows. Then it performs the de-chirp operation in each window,
    where each symbol is multiplied with a base down-chirp. The resulted single frequency
    tone (i.e., an FFT peak in FFT bins) indicates the initial frequency. While in
    the case of collisions, signals from multiple nodes are superimposed at the gateway,
    which induces a distorted one, i.e., multiple peaks are obtained in FFT bins.
    To this end, the existing collision disambiguation methods mainly separate and
    divide the collided symbols to the transmitters based on the unique features (in
    time [162, 168], frequency [41], phase [167], and power [68, 165] domains) of
    each transmitter symbol and decode them individually. Table 6 summarizes the existing
    LoRa collision disambiguation methods. Table 6. Method Year Methodology Performance

    of LoRa Disambiguation Decoding Methods As the transmitted signal has a shift
    in time, frequency, and phase resulting from natural hardware offsets, Eletreby
    et al. [41] proposed Choir, which exploits such subtle frequency shifts to separate
    different signals, then tracks users to decode data finally. However, such hardware-induced
    frequency offset is hard to capture due to the background noise and frequency
    leakage. Hu et al. [71] proposed SCLoRa with adaptation to the dynamic environment,
    which exploits cumulative spectral coefficient integrating multi-dimensional information
    (frequency and power) under the considerations of channel fading and spectrum
    leakage. Xia et al. [168] revealed that the frequency of the LoRa symbol increases
    periodically, while the symbol edges of different interference transmissions are
    misaligned in the time domain. They presented FTrack, which separates collisions
    and recovers frames by leveraging such time-domain misaligned edges and signal
    frequency continuity. FTrack requires a sliding window per sample, resulting in
    a large computational overhead. In their follow-up work [167], besides using time
    and frequency features, they designed a Phase-based Parallel Packet decoder termed
    PCube for concurrent transmissions by leveraging the reception diversities of
    MIMO hardware. Specifically, Pcube first calibrates the frequency offset of the
    received signal to extract the correct frame timing of each packet based on the
    frame structure of the LoRa preamble and SFD. Then it measures the phases of all
    concurrent symbols and mitigates the impact of hardware-induced phase variance.
    Furthermore, Pcube extracts the air-channel phase of each symbol and groups symbols
    to corresponding packets. Some collision disambiguation methods [156, 180] are
    designed for low SNR situations. For example, Chen and Wang [26] proposed AlignTrack
    for low-SNR collision decoding, which aligns a moving window with different collided
    chirps to find the peak of the aligned chirps, and thus separates these frequency
    peaks to their belonging packets. Instead of chirp partition in References [155,
    156], AlignTrack leverages the entire chirps, such that the aligned chirp can
    induce the highest peak in the frequency and lowest SNR loss. Some methods [162,
    168] focused on the time-domain feature that is vulnerable to noise, falling short
    of decoding low SNR signals. To this end, more robust frequency features [155,
    156, 181] were utilized. Tong et al. [156] proposed CoLoRa for collision decoding
    based on the peak ratio of chirps. Specifically, CoLoRa first demodulates the
    collided chirps in multiple (usually misaligned) reception windows, thus each
    chirp can result in two peaks in two windows. Then CoLoRa leverages the finding
    that the peak ratio of chirps (the height of the latter divided by that of the
    former) in the same packet is identical to disentangle collided signals. To relax
    the restrictions of the reception window, Tong et al. [155] proposed NScale. Specifically,
    NScale leverages the non-stationary amplitude scaling down-chirp to translate
    the packet time misalignment into frequency features, thus can determine the distribution
    characteristics of the symbol segments in the window according to the peak height
    variation before and after scaling. Besides, they proposed an iterative peak recovery
    algorithm to resolve peak distortion. With the reception window shifting, the
    FFT peak heights of one chirp in multiple windows will be presented in a pyramid
    shape. So, Xu et al. [181] proposed Pyramid to achieve low-overhead real-time
    collision decoding, which separates packets via exploiting each “top” of the pyramid.
    Rather than matching symbols to transmitters, interference cancellation algorithms
    [135, 150, 162] are also applied. Wang et al. [162] proposed mLoRa, which iteratively
    decodes and then cancels part of the collision-free symbols. Similarly, Temim
    et al. [150] identified and decoded the strongest received signal, then reproduced
    its complex envelope and removed it from the received signal utilizing a conventional
    Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) algorithm. Shahid et al. [135] proposed
    a Concurrent Interference Cancellation (CIC) method. In particular, CIC first
    determines these symbol boundaries via preamble detection, then selects an Interference
    Cancelling Sub-Symbols Set (ICSS) with no common interfering symbol across all
    symbols. Finally, CIC adopts a spectral intersection operation to demodulate symbols
    via canceling out all interfering symbols. Current collision disambiguation methods
    have significantly ameliorated the concurrent transmission capability of LoRa
    gateways and alleviated serious collisions. Most of these methods [41, 156] achieve
    more than 3 × increment in throughput, and some [155, 156] give a focus on weak
    decoding of signals below −5dB . Fundamentally different with collided signals
    separation methods by leveraging signal features, SIC algorithms provide a novel
    solution. However, devising an effective and energy-efficient collision decoding
    method remains challenging in terms of accurate packet detection, optimal peak
    height search, and algorithm complexity. Specifically, the Carrier Frequency Offset
    (CFO) and inter-packet interference need to be combated first to avoid the wrong
    packet estimation [26]. Demodulating a low-SNR signal results in a poor peak height,
    coupled with accompanied sidelobes around. Besides, the reception windows (e.g.,
    alignment, length) also affect the peak height. Heavy algorithm complexity is
    impractical for resource-constrained LoRa networks, as a semi- or off-line decoding
    way will cause great delay, memory cost, and computational overhead at the gateway
    side. Overall, various demodulation methods leveraging LoRa PHY CSS properties
    and adopting advanced techniques have improved the network throughput and scalability
    to a large extent, which is a primary research focus in the research community.
    Irrespective of the remarkable results achieved, the complexity of the algorithm,
    cost of hardware and actual deployment, and the influence of multiple external
    factors (e.g., dynamic channel conditions, various environments) still require
    further study. 4.2 MAC Protocols MAC protocols refer to the methodology that allows
    multiple nodes in the networks to access a shared transmission medium. LoRaWAN
    employs a default pure ALOHA MAC protocol, whose basic idea is to send data without
    detection. It is simple and has no time synchronization requirements, making it
    suitable for resource-constrained LoRa networks. However, the network performance
    will degrade dramatically due to the inevitable interference restrictions when
    the number of transmissions increases greatly, thereby suffering limited scalability.
    To avoid severe collisions, plenty of MAC protocols were proposed recently, which
    can be divided into two classes: the contention [49] and schedule-based [2] ones.
    The contention-based MAC protocols are mainly those random access protocols such
    as Slotted-ALOHA and Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA), where all nodes keep
    listening to and compete for the shared medium for transmission. In the schedule-based
    ones, multiple nodes access the predetermined collision-free medium that is divided
    according to time (TDMA) or frequency (FDMA). Table 7 summarizes the existing
    MAC protocols. Table 7. Method Year Methodology Performance Contention-based Ihirri

    LMAC versions based on CAD: LMAC-1 using DIFS with BO, LMAC-2 by indirect channel

    of LoRa MAC Protocols 4.2.1 Contention-based MAC Protocols. Recently, plenty of
    LoRa contention-based MAC protocols were proposed, where the sender listens to
    the shared medium before transmission and transmits until the medium is free.
    The existing methods mainly include Slotted-ALOHA and CSMA ones. Slotted-ALOHA
    Methods. Slotted-ALOHA, a variant of ALOHA, aligns the transmissions to slot boundaries
    relying on the relative synchronization of nodes, which can reduce the interference
    and increase channel capacity. The general process is to divide the time into
    several identical time slices, where all senders access the channel synchronously
    at the beginning of the time slice and have to wait until the beginning of the
    next time slice before transmission in the case of an occurring conflict. As Real-Time
    Clocks (RTCs) have significant clock drift problems over time, Polonelli et al.
    [122] introduced a lightweight time synchronization method based on the timestamp
    and offset during one transmission and achieved a Slotted-ALOHA mechanism with
    random backoff to increase the channel capacity. Ihirri et al. [72] proposed a
    scalable Slotted-Aloha method by introducing a contention sequence code in the
    option field of the LoRa frame. Such code determines the priority of transmission
    and decreases iteratively. Beltramelli et al. [11] proposed a Slotted-ALOHA MAC
    protocol using an out-of-band synchronization based on FM-radio data system (FM-RDS)
    broadcasting, which could save energy and improve the capacity unlike an in-band
    synchronization strategy. Carrier Sense Multiple Access Methods. Slotted-ALOHA
    and TDMA protocols require clock synchronization that brings a burden to LoRa
    networks, while CSMA protocols provide an alternative solution without synchronization
    operation. Several studies [49, 173] have exploited CSMA or its variants (i.e.,
    Listen-Before-Talk mechanism [116]) on LoRa networks based on the Channel Activity
    Detection (CAD) feature. To address the issue of false negatives introduced by
    CAD during the transmission of the payload, Kouvelas et al. [80] proposed a CSMA
    variant termed p -CARMA, where nodes adaptively select an appropriate probability
    value of p for transmission using a heuristic approach when the channel is idle.
    In the system proposed by Xu et al. [173], the LoRa nodes exploit the residual
    energy to determine the effective preamble from the noise to avoid false awakening,
    and access to the channel via selecting CSMA-CA or dynamic adjustment duty cycle
    mechanism in the case of low or high traffic load, respectively. Gamage et al.
    [49] designed three modified LMAC versions to enable CSMA for LoRa networks based
    on the CAD feature. Specifically, LMAC-1 achieves the basic functionality of CSMA
    based on a Distributed Inter-Frame Space (DIFS) mechanism with a fixed number
    of CADs and a random back-off (BO) strategy. LMAC-2 achieves a balanced resource
    load through an indirect channel probing approach, which updates the knowledge
    regarding the channels’ crowdedness based on the CAD results during DIFS and BO
    processes. LMAC-3 receives a global view of channel loads via broadcasting periodic
    beacons by gateways. 4.2.2 Schedule-based MAC Protocols. Recently, LoRa schedule-based
    MAC protocols are also popular, where the sender transmits according to pre-assigned
    link resources. The existing schedule-based ones mainly focus on Time Division
    Multiple Access (TDMA) along with time slot scheduling strategies, and Frequency
    Division Multiple Access (FDMA) methods. Time Division Multiple Access Methods.
    TDMA protocols allow multiple nodes to use the same frequency for transmission
    in different time slots, thereby sharing the same transmission medium without
    incurring collisions. They also avoid the energy waste of over-listening and idle-listening
    to the channel, hence receiving much popularity. For example, Rizzi et al. [131]
    integrated Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) strategy with TDMA to enhance the
    network throughput and reliability. However, the synchronization strategy is missing.
    Piyare et al. [121] proposed an on-demand TDMA approach using low-energy wake-up
    radios, which, respectively, provides unicast and broadcast modes for node triggering
    and time slots allocation. Gu et al. [58] designed a TDMA-based LoRa multi-channel
    transmission control featuring an urgent ALOHA channel and negative acknowledgment
    (ACK), to achieve the one-hop out-of-band control plane for wireless sensor networks.
    For TDMA MAC studies, the critical problem is time slot scheduling/allocation.
    Haxhibeqiri et al. [63] relied on the network synchronization and scheduling entity
    (NSSE) as the central scheduler for the LoRaWAN network to schedule transmissions.
    Specifically, the node sends a request containing the traffic periodicity to the
    NSSE and receives a reply about the allocated time slots encoded in a probabilistic
    space-efficient data structure. However, some nodes may share the same slot with
    a certain probability, incurring collisions. Abdelfadeel et al. [2] proposed a
    fine-grained scheduling scheme termed FREE. Specifically, nodes are assigned with
    corresponding transmission parameters inclusive of SF, TP, and time slot, then
    perform bulk data transmission in the predetermined time slot. However, FREE resolves
    the collision problem but falls short of real-time transmission. Leonardi et al.
    [84] proposed RT-LoRa, a novel LoRa MAC protocol as an alternative of LoRaWAN,
    which can support real-time flow transmission. In RT-LoRa, the time slot duration
    is limited by minimal packet size as a lower bound and varies according to different
    SFs. Rather than relying on the centralized scheduler to allocate separate time
    slots for all nodes, Zorbas et al. [190] proposed TS-LoRa, a self-organizing time-slotted
    communication approach based on computing a hash algorithm mapping the nodes’
    assigned addresses into unique slot numbers. Additionally, the dynamic attitude
    of floating nodes incurs signal strength losses and packet errors compared with
    those deployed statically on the ground due to the polarization and directivity
    of the antenna. To this end, Wang et al. [164] proposed an attitude-aware link
    model along with a channel access method termed PolarTracker, which leverages
    the attitude alignment state of the node, then schedules the transmissions into
    best-aligned periods for better link quality. Frequency Division Multiple Access
    Methods. Similarly, FDMA protocols allow multiple nodes to transmit in different
    frequency channels of the shared medium simultaneously. As LoRa band in distinct
    regions defines different multiple frequency channels, FDMA-based studies are
    CF allocation methods in essence. Plenty of CF parameter allocation methods [52,
    129] were proposed recently. For example, Reynders [129] proposed a MAC layer
    protocol termed RS-LoRa, which employs a two-step lightweight scheduling based
    on the RSS at both nodes and gateways. Specifically, the gateway specifies the
    allowed TPs and SFs for each frequency channel via beacon broadcasting, while
    nodes specify their own ones. Gao et al. [52] proposed EF-LoRa to allocate frequency
    channels under the consideration of the randomness of LoRa MAC protocol. Xu et
    al. [179] proposed an adaptive MAC layer scheduler termed S-MAC, which predicts
    the sending times based on the periodic transmission characteristics of nodes
    and allocates frequency channels according to the SF parameter of the packet.
    In general, the existing MAC protocols have significantly ameliorated the severe
    occurrence of collisions to improve the network performance in capacity and scalability.
    However, it is also challenging to devise adaptive, effective, and energy-efficient
    MAC protocols. Classic Slotted-ALOHA methods adopt synchronization strategies
    mainly based on timestamp [122] and out-of-band radio. Nevertheless, the number
    of time slots required is fixed and cannot be adjusted arbitrarily, which can
    induce collisions (too many) or time slot waste (too few). The synchronization
    and slot scheduling will bring the cost of calculation and propagation transmission
    time. The CAD features of LoRa facilitate the CSMA-based methods, among which
    LMAC [49] achieves communication fairness across nodes on the basis a 2.2 × and
    2.4 × improvement in throughput and energy efficiency, respectively. CSMA-based
    methods have no requirements for synchronization, but impose additional energy
    for the over-listening and long-time continuous transmission detection operation.
    TDMA-based methods mainly focus on the efficient time slot allocation in centralized
    [2] and distributed [190] manners. They are inflexible, especially when the data
    packet size varies and network topology changes dynamically. Energy-efficient
    synchronization and feedback ACK problems require to be tackled. FDMA-based methods
    are CF allocation methods in essence, along with other parameters together. They
    lower the interference and are easy to implement, but may cause spectrum waste
    due to the existence of the guard-band. 4.3 Configuration Settings Configuration
    settings typically refer to the optimal determination of transmission parameter
    sets in terms of SF, TP, CF, and CR assigned to LoRa nodes or networks. Different
    transmission parameter sets resulting in different data rates and air time have
    a distinct effect over the network performance or functionality, such as throughput
    and energy consumption unfairness across nodes. For example, nodes far away from
    the gateway are tuned to use a larger SF to trade low data rate for long range,
    but resulting in longer transmission time and higher energy consumption. Hence,
    an effective network configuration setting method is crucial for the appropriate
    division of channel resources and enhancing the throughput and energy efficiency
    of LoRa networks. Specifically, the existing configuration settings methods [52,
    87] mainly achieve the optimal parameter sets determination of LoRa nodes according
    to the deployment topology, communication behavior, and channel conditions. The
    main process consists of three steps: first, taking the throughput and energy
    consumption/fairness as the optimization goal; second, formulating a system or
    link model based on the optimization problem; third, adopting specific optimization
    methods based on current system model. It is noted that the data rate of LoRa
    radio is defined by the combination of SF, BW, and CR, thus the ADR method is
    also regarded as the configuration setting category. Table 8 summarizes the existing
    LoRa configuration setting methods. Table 8. Method Year Parameter Problem Formulation

    Methods (S: Simulation, T: Testbed). SF Allocation Methods. Loubany et al. [98]
    formulated the throughput optimization problem under consideration of the capture
    effect and proposed an adaptive SF allocation algorithm via adjusting the SNR
    thresholds. Mu et al. [109] proposed a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)-based SF allocation
    method, containing an initialization and operation period. In the initialization
    period, nodes are set to utilize all SF configurations in a round-robin fashion,
    and the gateway creates a dataset containing link characteristics (i.e., RSS,
    SNR), SF configurations, and packet reception results. In the operation one, a
    KNN algorithm is adopted to select optimal SF under the given link conditions
    or to meet the application reliability requirements via voting threshold adjustment.
    Cuomo et al. [31] proposed a heuristic SF allocation algorithm termed EXPLoRA
    to improve the Data Extraction Rate (DER) and achieve air time fairness. Specifically,
    EXPLoRA first calculates the available SF list of each node based on the RSSI
    and the sensitivity of each SF and then utilizes an “ordered waterfilling” strategy
    to allocate the SF to balance the air time. Marini et al. [105] proposed a collision-aware
    ADR (CA-ADR) algorithm. CA-ADR first calculates the maximum number of nodes under
    specific allocated SFs based on the given packet success probability that considers
    the link-level performance and the collision probability and then determines the
    smallest available SF for each node based on the average received power. SF and
    TP Allocation Methods. Liando et al. [89] modeled the energy consumption of LoRa
    nodes for SF and TP allocation. Amichi et al. [5] formulated a joint SF and power
    allocation problem as the uplink short-term average rate modeling featuring SF
    quasi-orthogonality. Specifically, they achieved SF assignment sub-question under
    fixed TP via a low-complexity many-to-one matching algorithm and TP allocation
    under fixed SF via two types of constraints’ approximation. Abdelfadeel et al.
    [1] proposed a Fair Adaptive Data Rate (FADR) algorithm. Specifically, FADR derives
    a fair data rate distribution on the basis of DER across nodes, then adopts a
    genetic algorithm for the optimal SF distribution and adjusted TP within a safe
    margin. Li et al. [87] proposed a Dynamic LoRa transmission control system termed
    DyLoRa, which derives an energy efficiency characterization model based on transmission
    parameters including TP, SF, and SNR. In particular, DyLoRa gateway first extracts
    the average SNR of the last pre-defined number of data packets as an indicator
    of link quality, then traverses and inputs all combinations SF and TP with this
    average SNR to the prediction model for the optimal setting. CF, SF, and TP Allocation
    Methods. Reynders et al. [127] derived the optimal SF distribution under the constrained
    TP to minimize collision probability and also assigned nodes from long distances
    that possess large path loss values to different frequency channels to avoid near-far
    problems for fairness. In their further work [129], they proposed RS-LoRa, which
    employs a two-step lightweight scheduling. Specifically, the gateway specifies
    the allowed TPs and SFs for each channel, which are restricted by the RSS value
    and collision probability, respectively. Then, the nodes traverse to find a proper
    channel, among which nodes divided into one group choose similar parameters to
    alleviate the capture effect. Gao et al. [52] proposed EF-LoRa, formulating energy
    fairness issues as a max-min optimization problem and utilizing a greedy heuristics
    algorithm to allocate frequency channel, SF, and TP parameters. Specifically,
    EF-LoRa adopts a multiple-gateway system model considering various LoRa network
    features such as interference, the randomness of MAC protocol, and capacity limitation
    of gateways, to serve energy fairness optimization. However, EF-LoRa runs only
    once at the first time of network deployment. In Reference [142], they formulated
    user scheduling as a two-sided many-to-one matching problem with peer effects
    to achieve channel allocation and allocated SF via a heuristic algorithm. Then,
    they performed TP allocations under maximizing system and nodes’ minimal energy
    efficiency via lower bound approximation and sequential convex programming, respectively.
    Other Parameters Allocation Methods. Gadre et al. [47] proposed Chime, where the
    node sends one packet across multiple base stations at one frequency, and the
    stations can collaboratively determine the optimal frequency. Specifically, Chime
    first requires synchronizing distributed base stations to avoid the time-varying
    and long-lasting phase errors, then models the signals and disentangles different
    signal multipath. Finally, Chime recombines these separated signal components
    to estimate the optimal one. Bor et al. [14] proposed a simple link probing regime
    that traverses and approaches the optimal parameter configuration based on the
    measured PRR. Liu et al. [96] adopted a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model to
    formulate the harvested energy and channel conditions for energy harvesting-based
    LoRa networks. Besides, they proposed an efficient channel allocation algorithm
    (ECAA) based on a many-to-one matching game by enabling users to self-match properest
    ones and perform optimal TP allocation via solving the dynamic programming problem.
    Current methods mainly focus on static resource allocation, Gao et al. [53] proposed
    AdapLoRa, an adaptive allocation system for CF, SF, TP, and CR parameters based
    on the dynamic link conditions on the contrary. Specifically, AdapLoRa adopts
    a symbol-level fine-grained network model featuring the properties of enhanced
    error correction scheme and packet reception by multiple gateways to periodically
    estimate the network lifetime under different resource allocations and determines
    whether to perform this adaption through comparison with the threshold rather
    than always seeking the optimal setting. Park et al. [117] formulated the link
    performance as an energy per packet (EPP) model and then proposed an enhanced
    greedy ADR mechanism with CR adaptation termed EARN based on the aggregated load
    status for each SF and SNR. Besides, EARN exploits adaptive SNR margin to withstand
    the dynamic link changes. Apart from the aforementioned configuration setting
    studies at the node level, several methods aim at the network topologies and deployments
    at the network level, such as gateway planning [123, 144] and packet offloading
    [43]. Rady et al. [123] first adopted a K-means clustering-like method or a grid
    and spatial method to determine the optimal gateway location under the network-aware
    or network-agnostic gateway deployment, respectively. Then, they performed link
    allocation tasks, i.e., many-to-one mappings between node and gateway. Specifically,
    such tasks are conducted based on the minimal distance or the corresponding RSSI
    value under the unconstrained gateway capacity while using the integer linear
    programming (NP-complete) approach under the constrained one. Sun et al. [144]
    proposed a deleted greedy algorithm for optimal gateway number and location search
    for heterogeneous LoRa nodes and also considered SF allocations. In general, the
    existing configuration setting methods utilize network resources to the greatest
    extent based on the link conditions and network deployments, which greatly improved
    the network throughput, energy efficiency, and fairness. Such methods generally
    take the throughput and energy performance indicator as a starting point for problem
    formulation and modeling. Then, comprehensive and careful considerations of various
    effect factors are required, such as dynamic link characteristics and signal interference,
    along with their representation margin. Among these methods, SF, TP, and CF are
    the most-chosen parameters, which are mainly allocated based on the packet SNR
    and node distance information. However, the algorithm complexity, convergence
    time, and dynamic adaption deserve to be tackled for further improvements. Apart
    from the aforementioned methods on LoRa communication, other works have made contributions
    with respect to the network synchronization strategies [124], data forwarding
    schemes [25], different network topologies such as mesh [83, 115] and tree [149].
    Skip 5LORA SECURITY Section 5 LORA SECURITY With massive deployments of LoRa networks
    recently, the security and privacy issues are receiving great attention. Security
    requires the hardware, software, and data flow in LoRa networks are protected,
    and the whole system can operate regularly and continually. However, maintaining
    the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of LoRa networks faces
    severe challenges due to the openness of the transmission medium and the instability
    of the network structure. To this end, we survey LoRa security-related works,
    including vulnerability analysis and corresponding countermeasures, coupled with
    the emerging PHY layer security methods. 5.1 Vulnerabilities and Countermeasures
    The vulnerability is the weakness that an attacker can exploit to perform unauthorized
    actions, modify data, or make a system unavailable, while the countermeasure is
    the defense taken against such attacks. The self-explanatory importance of cyber
    security and the wide popularity of LoRa networks have stimulated the rapid development
    of the attacks and defenses designed for LoRa networks. The first step in conducting
    LoRa security is to understand the network security requirements. CIA Triad is
    typically used to describe the security of IoT applications: Confidentiality.
    Data is only authorized to legitimate parties, while not leaked to others. Integrity.
    Data is ensured not to be tampered or destructed during the period of transmission
    and storage, or can be discovered quickly after malicious use. Availability. Data
    can meet the standards for use when needed. Table 9 lists the common attacks to
    LoRa networks from the perspective of the violation of the CIA Triad, along with
    the proposed corresponding countermeasures. Table 9. Vulnerability Operation Countermeasure

    of LoRa Vulnerabilities and Countermeasures 5.1.1 Vulnerabilities. Studying network
    vulnerabilities shows significant importance, which can better serve the corresponding
    defenses. Thus, plenty of studies [6, 17, 18, 66, 184] have investigated the common
    attacks of networks, inclusive of replay, jamming, spoofing attacks, and so on.
    Besides, some vulnerabilities specific to LoRa networks [69, 137] are discovered.
    Hou et al. [69] revealed the existence of a covert channel using a modulation
    scheme orthogonal to CSS over LoRa PHY layer, which is transparent and covert
    to current security mechanisms. Specifically, they proposed CloakLoRa to embed
    hidden information into the covert channel utilizing Amplitude Modulation (AM),
    where the malicious attacker could decode the hidden data based on the RSS while
    the transmission between legitimate parties is not affected. There is a common
    belief that electromagnetic (EMG) covert channel is a common short-range attack,
    as EMG radiation is easily attenuated. However, Shen et al. [137] proposed a resilient
    EMG covert channel termed EMLoRa, which reshapes EMG radiation into LoRa-like
    chirps through AM, hence the receiver can decode and steal the sensitive data
    from a long distance. Specifically, EMLoRa enables three attacks in terms of wide-area
    data exfiltration, penetrating Faraday cage, and localization of air-gapped devices.
    5.1.2 Countermeasures. LoRa networks are vulnerable to kinds of attacks as investigated
    in References [6, 184], hence plenty of attack defense and prevention methods
    are proposed accordingly. Countermeasures against Replay Attacks. The replay attack
    refers to when the attacker sends a former eavesdropped packet intact (the receiver
    node has received before) to deceive the receiver. The attacker does not need
    to obtain the explicit raw data but replays some data packets to destroy the correctness
    of authentication, which burdens the link load and induces some specific former-packet
    effects. Traditional solutions include adding nounces, timestamps, session ID
    [178]. For LoRa, replay attack defense methods mainly focus on DevNonce and NwkSKey
    of the LoRaWAN packet header in the OTAA join procedure. DevNonce is a random
    number generated from nodes, while NwkSKey is the session key that changes every
    time the joining process is completed. Na et al. [110] proposed a replay attack
    scenario occurring in the join request transfer process and a token-based countermeasure
    against it accordingly. The random token is the first six bits of NwkSkey, which
    is used to be XOR-ed with the DevNonce and MIC fields of the join request packet.
    However, the problem of missing NwkSkey is ignored when the device resets. The
    network server needs to store all DevNonce values used in the previous joining
    process, such that requests from benign nodes will not be mistaken as replay attacks
    [153]. To this end, Kim and Song [79] defined the initial and non-initial join
    requests and checked the validity of NwkSKey of non-initial join requests and
    DevNonce of initial ones to prevent replay attacks. Since checking the DevNonce
    value only is not reliable [153], Sung et al. [147] also utilized RSSI and a hand-shaking
    technique to protect networks. Countermeasures against Jamming Attacks. Jamming
    attack, a subset of Denial of Service (DoS) attack, refers to deliberately disrupting
    or preventing legitimate communication based on malicious interference. Such attacks
    can be addressed by efficient intrusion detection/filtering, traffic analysis,
    and verification. Several methods [28, 68] were proposed for anti-jamming attacks
    for LoRa networks. Aras et al. [7] proposed three jamming attack techniques and
    a series of complementary countermeasures such as maximum use of channel hopping
    and real-time traffic analysis. Danish et al. [33] proposed a novel LoRaWAN-based
    Intrusion Detection System (LIDS) involving two LIDS algorithms, namely, Kullback
    Leibler Divergence and Hamming Distance, deployed on gateways to monitor the real-time
    traffic distribution for the comparison with those from baseline to prevent from
    jamming attacks. Synchronized jamming chirps will make packets not be decoded
    in the time domain, hence Hou et al. [68] proposed a prevention and error recovery
    method by leveraging the signal strength difference. With massive deployments
    of LoRa networks, Choi et al. [28] proposed a passive packet sniffing framework
    for MAC layer termed LoRadar. LoRadar cannot decode payload data but extracts
    a large number of parameter information and deployment statistics related to the
    link quality, which is utilized for jamming detection, RSSI-based device localization,
    and so on. Countermeasures against Other Attacks. Apart from the aforementioned
    studies, several other attack defense methods [57, 163] were proposed. Wang et
    al. [163] proposed a lightweight node authentication method termed SLoRa, using
    fine-grained CFO resulting from hardware imperfections and spatial-temporal link
    signature relying on positions of nodes, to prevent from various attacks such
    as spoofing, MITM, DoS attacks. Specifically, they proposed a CFO compensation
    algorithm adopting linear fitting for received up-chirps to mitigate the noise’s
    randomness and derived a conventional de-convolution operation-less link signature
    extraction scheme. However, SLoRa is insensitive to drift caused by weather and
    environmental conditions. Gu et al. [57] proposed a synchronization-free data
    timestamping approach based on the signal arrival time at the gateway due to the
    star topology of LoRa networks rather than multi-hop and high time accuracy requirements
    (µs level). This approach is vulnerable to the frame delay attack, so they designed
    a LoRaTS gateway to track the natural frequency deviation of the nodes based on
    the linear regression and least-squares methods. Further, they proposed a Pseudorandom
    Interval Hopping scheme to prevent from zero frequency bias attacks to maintain
    security. Besides, several key management schemes [60, 78] focus on the LoRaWAN
    key derivation, distribution, update, and destruction process to prevent from
    side-channel attacks. Overall, the existing vulnerabilities and countermeasures
    complement each other to make a significant contribution to the security of LoRa
    networks. In addition to attacks common to networks, attacks specific to LoRa
    specific networks are an open and trending research area, coupled with the combination
    with cross-technology. Covert channels [69, 137] have been proven as threatening
    attacks to LoRa networks, where there are no effective countermeasures against
    EMLoRa [137]. The existing countermeasures mainly focus on the packet header information
    [79, 110, 153], passive traffic analysis [7, 28], or authentication system [57,
    163] to improve the safety of LoRa networks. However, the effectiveness and energy
    efficiency of such security defense mechanisms are key factors that need attention.
    5.2 PHY Layer Security PHY layer security methods essentially exploit the physical
    characteristics of the wireless channel to achieve secure transmission. The traditional
    secure key establishment between two parties can be completed by Public Key Cryptography
    (PKC), but PKC schemes require a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and are computationally
    expensive. Another solution is the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) scheme, but it lacks scalability
    [178]. Thus, plenty of methods [50, 138] consider PHY layer features as a supplement
    or replacement of the upper-layer cryptography method for the consideration of
    network security. We divided them into two categories: PHY layer key generation
    and Radio Frequency Fingerprinting Identification (RFFI) methods. Table 10 summarizes
    the existing LoRa PHY layer security methods. Table 10. Method Year Methodology

    SHA: Secure Hash Algorithm). 5.2.1 Key Generation Methods. Key generation, also
    called key agreement or establishment, refers to the process of generating the
    same cryptographic key based on the PHY layer characteristic parameters (e.g.,
    RSSI, CSI, phase) of the wireless channel through common channels between two
    legitimate parties that have no prior secret. Its feasibility is mainly due to
    the characteristics of channel reciprocity, spatial variation, and temporal variation,
    which ensure the uniqueness and randomness of the generating keys. Channel reciprocity
    means that the channel characteristics between two communication nodes are almost
    identical. Spatial and temporal variation mean that the radio channels between
    two nodes vary with the location and the environment across time. Key generation
    is a promising technique to maintain secure communications for LoRa nodes recently
    [76, 133]. It generally includes the following four stages: channel probing, quantization,
    reconciliation, and privacy amplification. Two legitimate nodes send messages
    end-to-end and measure some kinds of channel features, mainly RSSI information
    for LoRa. The measured value is then converted into a string of key bits using
    different quantization methods. Reconciliation is for discarding or correcting
    the bit differences, and privacy amplification is designed for handling information
    leakage issues to the attacker. The feasibility of key generation of LoRa was
    first verified in Reference [174]. Zhang et al. [187] proposed a differential
    quantization method, which discards the RSSI value whose variation with the adjacent
    value is smaller than the set RSSI resolution against the measurement imperfection.
    LoRa-Key [175] is the first RSSI-based key generation method for LoRa, which employs
    several signal processing techniques (e.g., outlier detection, linear interpolation)
    to improve the key generation rate and a novel compressive sensing-based reconciliation
    approach to reduce the key disagreement rate. Rather than RSSI, Gao et al. [50]
    employed RegRssiValue ( RSS I r ) provided by LoRa transceivers for LoRa key generation.
    Specifically, RSS I r is the raw instantaneous strength estimation, which provides
    better channel estimation compared with RSSI and whose distributions produced
    by the legitimate parties are extremely similar. Furthermore, they adopted a random
    waypoint model to derive an optimal window size, which can balance the channel
    reciprocity and entropy. To further improve the correlation of channel measurements,
    Yang et al. [182] exploited the mean value of adjacent RSS I r (arRSSI) as a novel
    feature for key generation in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) scenarios. They also
    proposed a Bi-LSTM model for prediction and an autoencoder-based reconciliation
    method for mismatch correction. PHY layer key generation for LoRa could maintain
    the network security without the need for fixed infrastructure or secure communication
    channels. Also, it requires less storage and computing power compared to asymmetric
    cryptographic solutions. However, due to the characteristics of the low data rate
    and high energy efficiency of LoRa technology, the issues of low channel reciprocity
    and probe packet exchanging make key generation for LoRa challenging. Besides,
    spatial and temporal variations of the radio channel require multiple key establishment
    times for the LoRa nodes, which is not a long-term security mechanism. Additionally,
    current key generation methods are almost designed for two legitimate parties
    [50, 175]; group key generation among a large number of nodes is still an open
    problem [178]. 5.2.2 Radio Frequency Fingerprinting Identification Methods. Device
    identification is essential for IoT security to allow legitimate users to access
    the network while preventing malicious users. Recently, the emerging PHY layer
    RFFI technique uses features extracted from radio signals to uniquely identify
    devices. Its essence is to use the inherent tiny defects (e.g., inphase and quadrature
    imbalance, frequency/sampling offset) in the analog circuit of radio device hardware
    to generate a unique fingerprint of this device, which is impossible to imitate
    by adversarial devices. As hardware defects are interrelated and complex, hand-crafted
    low-dimensional features are often unable to generate distinguishable and high-level
    fingerprints effectively, machine learning algorithms are utilized to make up
    for this issue. RFFI generally includes two stages, namely, training and classification.
    In the training stage, the trainer performs feature extraction (e.g., IQ, CFO,
    spectrogram) after collecting enough data packets. Then, these features are fed
    into the classifier for training. While in classification one, after receiving
    the data packet and feature extraction, the classifier infers the identity of
    the device. As the pioneering work of LoRa PHY layer fingerprinting, Robyns et
    al. [132] proposed two per-symbol supervised machine learning models, i.e., a
    Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). These models
    process the entire signal instead of low-dimensional features of the local one
    to distinguish devices from different manufacturers. Besides, a zero-shot learning
    model was proposed to consider the unknown device cases. Differently, Jiang et
    al. [75] adopt the differential constellation trace figure as the feature and
    utilize an unsupervised method based on the Euclidean distance comparison. Gu
    et al. [57] designed a LoRaTS gateway to track the radio frequency biases of the
    nodes based on the linear regression and least-squares methods. Wang et al. [163]
    proposed SLoRa, an authentication method using fine-grained CFO and spatial-temporal
    link signature of different nodes’ positions. SLoRa collects and inputs CFO and
    signature features into an SVM model for training in the offline stage. Then,
    such features from the new node are inputted into the model for authentication
    in the online one. Al-Shawabka et al. [4] first collected a dataset containing
    LoRa waveform data from 100 bit-similar devices and then proposed a deep learning-based
    data augmentation technique termed DeepLoRa. Specifically, DeepLoRa focuses on
    three different representations, i.e., IQ, amplitude-phase, and spectrogram of
    the signal preamble or payload, as the input of the deep learning models. Besides,
    DeepLoRa generated and applied finite input response (FIR) filter taps to transform
    the original dataset, which acts as a data augmentation technique and increases
    channel diversity. Shen et al. [138] proposed a CNN taking the IQ, amplitude-phase,
    and spectrogram of LoRa signal as input, among which spectrogram achieves the
    best performance. Besides, they revealed that the drift of the instantaneous CFO
    will affect the classification results and degrade system stability. To this end,
    they proposed a CFO estimation and compensation algorithm, where a CFO database
    was generated to help the hybrid classifier use the estimated CFO to calibrate
    CNN’s softmax output. In general, RFFI methods rely on the hardware imperfection,
    where the derived fingerprint is unique to maintain the network security preventing
    from spoofing or counterfeiting attacks. Compared with traditional cryptography-based
    security solutions, RFFI methods do not impose additional computational burdens
    on devices for authentication. The existing RFFI methods [75, 138, 163] have achieved
    more than 90% identification accuracy due to the representation learning capability
    of deep learning models. However, they are not friendly to newly join-request
    legitimate devices, resulting in poor scalability. In addition, since most RFFI
    methods seek stable and discriminative features from the entire LoRa signal samples,
    using instantaneous features is still challenging. Apart from the aforementioned
    studies, several other studies [67, 90, 113] focused on blockchain-enabled LoRa
    networks for trust verification and security issues. Blockchain is a Peer-to-Peer
    (P2P) distributed and decentralized ledger technology. Its essence is a shared
    database that contains specific and verifiable records of each transaction, possessing
    the characteristics of non-counterfeiting, traceable, and transparent. Lin et
    al. [90] proposed the first conceptual blockchain-enabled LoRaWAN infrastructure
    design, which is built upon many LoRaWAN network servers that communicate with
    each other via P2P. Each network server is added the blockchain management components
    of packaging transaction, hashing broadcasting, verification, making and storing
    blocks to perform the message flow process. Niya et al. [113] proposed a blockchain-enabled
    LoRaWAN network based on Ethereum, an open-source, public blockchain platform
    supporting smart contracts to store data. Specifically, Ethereum Light Clients
    (ELCs) were deployed in the LoRa nodes or gateways for the data transmission to
    the application server. Hou et al. [67] proposed HyperLoRa, a blockchain-enabled
    LoRa system with edge computing ability. In particular, HyperLoRa possesses two
    ledgers in the central could and getaway to process the delay-tolerant application
    data with large size and the time-critical network data with small size, respectively.
    Besides, HyperLoRa utilizes edge computing technology to migrate the works of
    the join procedure and application packages processing from the network servers.
    Blockchain-enabled LoRa methods mitigate security risks and solve authentication
    problems, but are still immature. Skip 6LORA-ENABLED APPLICATIONS Section 6 LORA-ENABLED
    APPLICATIONS The wide deployment of LoRa has inspired a wide range of applications.
    In this section, we review these applications from four categories: backscatter,
    sensing, integration with heterogeneous wireless technologies, and other applications.2
    Specifically, backscatter refers to the passive reflection and modulation of incident
    RF signals for transmission. LoRa sensing captures the LoRa signal variance during
    propagation to achieve specific kinds of task sensing, such as respiration monitoring
    and localization. The integration with heterogeneous wireless technologies aims
    to explore their interoperability, which involves wireless co-existence (WCE)
    and cross-technology communication (CTC). Other applications, such as smart city,
    industry, agriculture, and healthcare, are reviewed at the end of this section.
    6.1 Backscatter Backscatter has been widely used in long-distance, low-cost communication
    systems such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags and commodity Wi-Fi
    access points. As the representative example, a RFID system typically relies on
    readers and tags, where the reader transmits high-power RF signals as queries
    and the tag responds by changing the antennas’ impedance. Another typical backscatter
    communication system is the ambient one, which does not require a dedicated signal
    source but explores the available RF signals nearby (e.g., RF or LoRa signals
    from active nodes), thus becoming the most energy-efficient and the lowest cost
    solution among them. LoRa backscatter [73, 141, 160] is becoming a promising technology
    recently, due to its high sensitivity and resilience against both in-band and
    out-of-band interference, Typically, a LoRa backscatter system consists of three
    parts: transmitters, receivers, and backscatter tags. When the transmitter sends
    excitation LoRa signals, a backscatter tag uses the on-board circuit (e.g., programmable
    logic units) to modulate RF signal (e.g., amplitude, frequency, phase) under a
    modulation mechanism (e.g., OOK), and then reflects the signal. The receiver captures
    the reflected backscatter signal and decodes the information. Table 11 summarizes
    the existing LoRa backscatters. Table 11. Method Year Excitation Signal Range

    As the pioneering work, Talla et al. [148] proposed LoRa Backscatter, which receives
    and utilizes the single tone transmitted by a single RF source to synthesize the
    CSS signal for decoding of the receiver. Specifically, LoRa Backscatter adopts
    a hybrid digital-analog backscatter design that uses the digital domain to create
    a frequency plan of a Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO) for the continuously
    varying CSS signal and then map it to the analog domain via a converter. In addition,
    a harmonic cancellation mechanism was proposed to improve spectral efficiency.
    Hessar et al. [64] proposed Netscatter to decode large-scale concurrent backscatter
    transmissions by using only one single FFT operation. In particular, they introduced
    a distributed CSS coding mechanism, where each concurrent node is assigned to
    a different chirp cyclic shift and utilizes OOK to transmit bits. They also considered
    the Near-far problem using power-aware and power-adaption methods and leaves gaps
    in cyclic shifts to be more robust in time synchronization among nodes. Instead
    of using dedicated single-tone RF as external excitation signals in References
    [64, 148], Peng et al. [119] proposed Passive LoRa (PLoRa), which modulates an
    ambient LoRa signal into a new chirp signal and shifts it into a different channel.
    Specifically, PLoRa is composed of a low-power packet detection circuit, a blind
    chirp modulation algorithm, and an energy management component. The packet detection
    circuit aims to reduce the sampling rate of the input signal and perform cross-correlation
    operation between input signals and the pre-stored preambles. The modulation algorithm
    is to generate FSK modulated baseband signal and multiply it with incoming LoRa
    chirp. To disentangle and demodulate the weak backscatter signal from the strong
    excitation signal, Guo et al. [59] proposed Aloba, which first detects ambient
    LoRa excitation signal using unique RSS pattern from other irrelevant signals
    or noise, then utilizes OOK to modulate the data and reflects to the receiver.
    The receiver decodes the carrier signal by leveraging the capture effect and transforms
    it into a constant sinusoidal tone, so the backscatter signal can be demodulated
    via tracking the amplitude and phase variation. To achieve ubiquitous backscatter
    connectivity, Katanbaf et al. [77] designed the first Full-Duplex (FD) LoRa backscatter
    reader. FD LoRa Backscatter consists of a single antenna hybrid coupler along
    with a two-stage tunable impedance network for carrier and offset cancellation,
    and a microcontroller for implementing the adaptive tuning algorithm. Since PLoRa
    and Aloba can decode a small number of concurrent backsacatter packets, Jiang
    et al. [74] proposed an ambient Passive and Parallel LoRa backscatter design termed
    P 2 2 LoRa. Specifically, P 2 2 LoRa shifts the ambient LoRa signal at a small
    certain frequency to modulate the data in the backscatter signal and concentrates
    the leaked energy in the frequency and time domain to improve its SNR. Then it
    utilizes a two-level parameter estimation method to reconstruct and eliminate
    the in-band excitation signal accurately and adopts a window-based method to eliminate
    the interference to perform parallel decoding. So far, current LoRa backscatter
    systems have significantly improved the communication range and throughput of
    LoRa networks at a low energy cost. Ambient excitation signals [59, 74, 119] get
    rid of the limitation of dedicated excitation signal source, low-power packet
    detection approaches [74, 119] achieve long-term deployment, parallel decoding
    [59, 64, 74] enables simultaneous communications among multiple nodes. However,
    the existing LoRa backscatter designs still face some challenges in terms of high-range
    packet detection, simple backscatter modulation mechanism at the tag side, out-of-band
    LoRa signal interference, and compatibility with COTS devices. 6.2 Sensing Wireless
    sensing is an emerging technology of acquiring information about a remote object
    and its characteristics using ambient wireless signals. The rationale behind wireless
    sensing is to capture the signal variance (e.g., phase, RSSI) of the wireless
    signal itself (e.g., RFID, Wi-Fi, LoRa) reflected from the targets with some specific
    movements. Compared with transitional wireless signals, LoRa possesses strong
    penetration capability to perform through-wall sensing tasks and long sensing
    range to fill the gap of Wi-Fi (3– 6m ), RF (3– 6m ), and acoustic (less than
    1m ) signals [185]. Thus, a large number of LoRa sensing methods [92, 185] were
    proposed recently. We review the existing LoRa sensing works, including respiration
    monitoring and localization. 6.2.1 Respiration Monitoring. Studies on LoRa-based
    respiration monitoring generally model the propagation and reflection of the LoRa
    signal, then adopt a series of signal processing techniques to quantify a mapping
    between specific signal variation (e.g., phase, amplitude) and the sensing goal
    (e.g., distance). Table 12 summarizes the existing LoRa respiration monitoring
    methods. Table 12. Method Year Sensing Model Methodology Antenna Array Through-wall

    Monitoring Methods (RPM: Respiration Per Minute). Zhang et al. [185] achieved
    real-time LoRa sensing for the first time, including through-wall fine-grained
    respiration and coarse-grained walking monitoring in the range of 25m . Specifically,
    they first derived a basic LoRa signal propagation model and utilized the ratio
    of received signals at two antennas to cancel out noise and eliminate the random
    signal phase shift. They further quantified the phase change of the signal ratio
    to capture the relationship with distances corresponding to target movements for
    sensing. Besides, they have conducted a comprehensive experiment concerning the
    impacts of the target, distance, and environment. LoRa radio suffers surrounding
    interference along with its long-distance communication, Xie et al. [170] proposed
    Sen-fence, which restricts interference from outside the created virtual fence
    to mitigate it. In particular, Sen-fence first forms a beam-shaped or spot-shaped
    virtual fence depending on the number of receiver, then maximizes the movement-induced
    phase variation by adding a newly static signal purely in software. Such static
    signal needs to meet the requirements of tuning the phase difference between the
    static and dynamic vectors to 180 ∘ and minimizing the amplitude of the composite
    signal. Finally, Sen-fence confines the phase within the virtual fence based on
    the search algorithm of the optimal static signal. However, Sen-fence requires
    the sensing area as prior knowledge and multiple receivers, which limits sensing
    in mobile scenarios. In their further study [171], they increased the respiration
    sensing range to 75 m, resulting from enlarging the target-induced phase variation
    and adopting a time-domain beamforming method combining signals with different
    timestamps to increase SNR. Jiang et al. [73] provided a cyclist respiration sensing
    method relying on OOK modulated LoRa backscatter signal termed Palantir, which
    consists of four stages of preprocessing, signal shaping, clustering, and sensing.
    Specifically, Palantir first demodulated the received direct path signal and backscatter
    one by exploiting the capture effect. Then, Palantir performed signal shaping
    to obtain the stable state samples, including amplitude shaping by leveraging
    a low-pass filter to resolve the problem of amplitude instability and baseband
    removal by conjugate demodulation and curve fitting to eliminate offset and drift.
    Then, Palantir adopts the dual clustering method to transfer the state samples
    from the I-Q coordinate system to the logarithm of the amplitude-phase coordinate
    system and performs cluster identification enabling consistent identification
    even if there is a global mismatch, which resolves the challenge of spectrum leakage.
    Finally, Palantir achieves sensing based on the derived phase difference between
    the vectors of the direct path signal and the backscatter one. To enable multi-target
    sensing, Zhang et al. [186] proposed a LoRa multi-antenna beamforming technology
    to separate the signals in the space domain. In particular, they constructed a
    “beam nulling” signal as a reference and divided beamforming signal of different
    directions with this beam-nulled signal, which can eliminate impacts of CFO and
    Sampling Frequency Offset (SFO) for synchronization-free between transceivers
    and not corrupt the signal amplitude or phase variation information. Moreover,
    they utilized the amount of phase rotation of the location-independent dynamic
    path signal rather than the composite signal to determine the chest displacement,
    thereby solving the location-dependent issue of the composite signal for respiration
    monitoring. Apart from respiration monitoring, the aforementioned methods also
    achieved walking [171, 185, 186] and gesture tracking [170]. In general, LoRa
    has greatly compensated for the short sensing range of conventional wireless signals
    and achieved great improvements. The existing methods [170, 185] mainly focus
    on the signal modeling and processing to capture the phase difference among multiple
    antennas to achieve fine-grained respiration monitoring sensing. Although backscatter
    signal [73] and beamforming technique [171, 186] provide new possibilities on
    range expansion and multi-target sensing, there still remain some challenges:
    Range. Sensing is more susceptible to channel quality compared with communication
    [73]. With range expansion, LoRa sensing systems will inevitably suffer from various
    and complex interference, remaining challenging to be resolved. Multi-target.
    Signals from multiple targets will be interleaved and superposed, so a higher
    complexity of the receiving antenna array and a more robust sensing model are
    required for sensing. Besides, target mobility will bring additional challenges.
    6.2.2 Localization. Target localization and tracking techniques primarily focus
    on four categories of information: Angle of Arrival (AoA) [92], Time Difference
    of Arrival (TDoA) [10], RSSI [91], and amplitude [24]. AoA-based methods leverage
    the phase difference of a signal arriving at multiple antennas for localization.
    The multipath can be effectively separated, but good resolution and accuracy require
    large-scale antenna arrays at the receiver side. TDoA-based methods achieved localization
    using the time difference of the same signal arriving at multiple gateways. High
    resolution can be achieved, but suffers from the measurement error and the limited
    bandwidth. AoA and TDoA methods generally require clock synchronization between
    transceivers. RSSI-based methods can be further divided into fingerprinting-based
    methods [91] and model-based methods [12, 82]. They are generally effective, but
    have poor resolution. Besides, the amplitude is utilized to deal with the multipath
    effect, which is simple and low-cost, but has poor accuracy due to signal attenuation.

    of LoRa Localization Methods Chen et al. [24] proposed a localization prototype
    termed WIDESEE, which consists of a reconfigurable antenna system, a data collection
    and antenna control system, and a target detection and localization system. Specifically,
    the antenna system integrates horn directional antennas and phased arrays for
    fast radiation mode switching and narrower beamwidth offering to further reduce
    interference. The data collection and antenna control system is built on single
    LoRa transceiver pair carried by a flying drone. WIDESEE exploits the power spectrum
    density (PSD) for target detection after vibration noise elimination using a low-pass
    filter, then extracts direction-related information from amplitude and isolates
    the target path from the interfering multipath to achieve localization sensing.
    Lin et al. [91] proposed SateLoc, a LoRa localization system based on the virtual
    fingerprints extracted from satellite images. Specifically, in the offline stage,
    SateLoc trains a Random Forest (RF) using satellite images associated with labeled
    land-cover types to generate an Expected Signal Power (ESP) map as a virtual fingerprinting
    for each gateway. In the online one, SateLoc produces a location likelihood distribution
    for each gateway based on its ESP map using the extracted RSSI and SNR from the
    received packets and adopts a weighted combination strategy for joint localization.
    Besides, μ Locate [111] designed a sub-centimeter sized multi-band backscatter
    system, together with the extracted phase information for microwatt-level localization.
    As the narrow bandwidth of LoRa incurs low-range localization resolution, several
    methods [10, 92] focused on the bandwidth expansion. Bansal et al. [10] proposed
    an Outdoor whitespace-band LoRa Localization (OwLL) method based on the TDoA transformed
    by the measured phase difference across antennas. Specifically, OwLL emulates
    wide bandwidth in a low-cost manner by frequency hopping over wireless spectrum
    in TV whitespace and ISM frequency bands, where an iterative maximum-likelihood
    algorithm is adopted to determine a small set of optimal frequencies hopped rather
    than all possible ones. After ensuring phase synchronization with reference to
    Chime [47], OwLL treats diverse spatial base stations as a virtual distributed
    array to mitigate the impact of signal multipath and utilizes a particle filter
    as well as the prior measured phase and TDoA to trilaterate LoRa clients. Liu
    et al. [92] proposed a super-resolution localization algorithm termed Seirios.
    In particular, Seirios utilizes a novel interchannel synchronization algorithm
    to increase the bandwidth, where ToneTrack [172] technique is for overlapped channels
    while a virtual intermediate channel response is generated as a bridge is for
    non-overlapped channels. Then, Seirios exploits both the original and the conjugate
    of the CSI measurements for AoA estimation based on the ES-PRIT algorithm [70]
    to further increase the capacities for multipath resolution, where the synchronized
    LoRa CSI value of multiple channels is obtained through the amplitude and phase
    comparison between the received symbols with the pre-defined training ones. In
    general, LoRa localization methods have achieved promising accuracy and resolution
    results and greatly expanded the range compared with Wi-Fi and RFID signals. The
    existing localization methods have attempted various features, such as amplitude
    [24], RSSI [91], angle [92], and time [10]. Among which, RSSI can achieve the
    longest range, but amplitude, time, and angle information can obtain higher resolution.
    Apart from attempting various features to expand the range, several studies [10,
    92] focus on the bandwidth expansion of LoRa to improve the resolution. However,
    some possible challenges may include: Synchronization-free and Multipath Disambiguation.
    The synchronization between transceivers guarantees the accuracy of AoA and TDoA-based
    methods, resulting in additional energy consumption. Multipath disambiguation
    addresses the problem of signal change in terms of the polarization mode, phase,
    and Doppler shift for better accuracy. Multi-target Sensing. Multi-target reflected
    signals will be inter-weaved, thus separating these signals under a limited channel
    bandwidth is challenging. Besides, concurrent transmission for multi-target localization
    deserves further exploration. Mobile Localization. Moving targets or gateways
    induce the complex multipath effect and signal attenuation, which deserves further
    study. 6.3 Wireless Co-existence & Cross-technology Communication The emerging
    paradigm of IoT has inspired the exploration of interoperability between LoRa
    and other heterogeneous wireless technologies. These works can be divided into
    two categories: Wireless Co-Existence (WCE) and Cross-Technology Communication
    (CTC). Table 14 summarizes the existing LoRa WCE and CTC methods. Table 14. Method

    of LoRa WCE and CTC Methods Wireless Co-existence Methods. WCE methods mainly
    rely on interference avoidance, detection, and cancellation to achieve the co-existence
    of different technologies. Recently, a new LoRa chip called SX1280 was proposed
    by Semtech that provides a possibility of LoRa radio operating at 2.4GHz frequency,
    resulting in a larger available bandwidth (from 500 to 1,600 kHz) and a faster
    data rate (from 21 to 70kbps ). In this context, LoRa packets may be severely
    damaged by Wi-Fi interference, so Chen et al. [23] proposed a weak signal detection
    method termed LoFi to achieve the co-existence of LoRa and Wi-Fi. Inspired by
    the physical phenomenon named Stochastic Resonance (SR), LoFi adds appropriate
    white noise that is capable of enhancing weak LoRa signals at specific frequencies.
    Specifically, LoFi first selectively transforms the frequency of a LoRa chirp
    into one particular small frequency and separates Wi-Fi signal to another frequency
    range to detect LoRa signals. Then, LoFi adopts a bandwidth-aware spectrum reservation
    method to adaptively reserve the spectrum for LoRa collision-free transmission
    according to the spectrum occupancy. Sun et al. [143] proposed a Partial Symbol
    Recovery (PSR) scheme to combat CT interference, including Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and
    Bluetooth. In the coarse-grained localization stage, PSR performs the maximum
    pooling and calculates the ratio between the dominant frequency component and
    the average after Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) operation. PSR identifies
    and recovers LoRa symbols based on this ratio in the fine-grained detection one.
    Besides, several methods [51, 188] paid attention to the combination of NB-IoT
    and LoRa technology. Zhang et al. [188] proposed an information monitoring system
    integrating NB-IoT and LoRa, which mainly relies on the designed main-nodes equipped
    with both radio modules to receive messages from LoRa sub-nodes and transmit them
    to the cloud server. Cross-technology Communication Methods. CTC mainly refers
    to exchanging instructions and data flow across two or more different technologies
    (i.e., the carrier and target ones), which exploits both (or all) of their advantages.
    Shi et al. [139] proposed LoRaBee to support CTC from LoRa to ZigBee unidirectional.
    In LoRaBee, the LoRa signal is adopted as the carrier with elaborate frequency
    tuning and payload encoding, and Zigbee can decode the packet by sampling the
    RSS value. Specifically, the main idea is to correlate (i.e., map) the data bytes
    in the LoRa payload with the generated RSS signature between the LoRa transmitter
    and ZigBee receiver and make both sides store this mapping. However, it is computation-inefficient
    and lacks scalability. Li et al. [88] proposed Symphony to support the CTC from
    Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and ZigBee to LoRa, along with a parallel decoding
    method. Specifically, BLE, ZigBee, and LoRa signals are modulated by Gaussian
    Frequency Shift Keying (GFSK), Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (OQPSK), and
    CSS to generate single-tone sinusoidal signals, respectively. The received samples
    are split, multiplied with correlation templates, then disentangled and decoded
    via performing FFT operation at the LoRa receiver side in turn. Shen et al. [137]
    proposed EMLoRa, which reshapes EMG radiation into LoRa-like chirps through AM.
    Liu et al. [95] presented XFi based on signal hitchhiking. Low-speed IoT (ZigBee,
    LoRa) data packets collide with (hitchhike) high-speed Wi-Fi ones in the overlapped
    spectrum, which can then be decoded by commodity Wi-Fi receivers. Specifically,
    XFi first reconstructs the IoT waveform with erased segments by analyzing the
    Wi-Fi payload and then utilizes the enhanced IoT decoder to reliably decode the
    reconstructed waveform through incorporating the signal erasure pattern with the
    IoT signal redundancy information. Current emerging WCE and CTC methods adapt
    to the unprecedented proliferation of heterogeneous wireless devices and make
    up for the shortcomings of another single technology by exploiting the advantages
    of the considerable communication range of LoRa. The existing WCE [23, 143] and
    CTC [88, 137] methods mainly focus on interference avoidance and signal approximation
    to the receiver waveform methodologies. Additionally, RSS mapping [139] and signal
    hitchhiking [95] provide novel solutions. However, these methods still leave room
    for improvement in terms of hardware design, network deployment, generality for
    other technologies, and security issues. Apart from the aforementioned LoRa-enabled
    applications, several methods focus on others, such as network aggregation [48,
    183], C-RAN [39, 93]. For example, LoRa network aggregation [48, 183], information
    retrieving on the basis of the selection and analysis of data in the network,
    receives popularity recently. Yang et al. [183] proposed an accurate, general,
    future-proof, and energy-efficient analytic framework for LPWAN termed Joltik.
    Joltik can calculate sensor data aggregation, utilize universal sketching for
    transmission, and support unforeseen metrics without additional energy overhead.
    Specifically, Joltik is built on universal sketching, which discreetly provides
    a smaller number of counters at the lower level for efficient storage, employs
    a compression scheme for reducing the communication cost, and eliminates updates
    of redundant counters for reducing the computational cost. Gadre et al. [48] proposed
    QuAiL, which enables coarse aggregation queries of sensing data across LPWAN (LoRa,
    NB-IoT) clients within one packet timespan, inducing spatial distribution, statistics,
    and machine learning types. QuAiL mainly relies on encoding the information in
    the energy of concurrent transmissions across clients and leverages this linear
    addition of powers of phase-asynchronous channels for different types of queries.
    Besides, QuAiL requires wireless impairment tackling (e.g., timing and frequency
    offsets, noise) for synchronization and involves security and privacy considerations
    using random power weights of clients. 6.4 Other Applications As LoRa networks
    possess the advantages of low power consumption and wide coverage, they have been
    widely used in various real-world IoT applications, summarized below: Smart City.
    Smart building and lighting [118, 176], public assets tracking [35], surveillance
    system [136], are deployed to better serve the city life. Smart Industry. Industry
    applications, such as smart grids [34], smart metering [161], and distributed
    measurement system [130], also receive much popularity. Smart Agriculture. LoRa
    is widely used in agriculture area, such as soil health monitoring [125], smart
    irrigation system [189], and precision agriculture [19]. Smart Healthcare. Besides,
    LoRa is utilized for healthcare monitoring [21] and against COVID-19 pandemic
    [126]. Skip 7CHALLENGES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS Section 7 CHALLENGES AND FUTURE
    DIRECTIONS In previous sections, we have reviewed extensive works developed for
    LoRa networks. Below, we provide researchers with challenges of existing works
    and potential future research directions in this domain. 7.1 Challenges LoRa Analysis.
    Extensive analysis of LoRa performance can help understand the capabilities and
    limitations of LoRa. Quantifying LoRa performance with the corresponding factors
    becomes an early and crucial work for further study. LoRa analysis tools also
    leave room for further improvements. The existing analytical models are mostly
    derived under strict assumptions. The major influencing factors need to be explicitly
    represented before combating various interference for devising accurate and general
    analytical models. Simulators offer a convenient way for experiment test and validation,
    but they are not full-featured enough. Developing large-scale public testbeds
    is challenging concerning network deployment, numbers of LoRa devices, types of
    sensors, remote development, and user experience. LoRa Communication. The performance
    of LoRa communication primarily relies on its PHY layer modulation and demodulation,
    MAC protocol, and configuration settings of nodes. The effectiveness and efficiency
    are of primary concern for LoRa communication studies. In particular, the transceiver
    modification, the compatibility with COTS devices, and additional energy consumption
    issues make improvements on LoRa modulation challenging. For demodulation, the
    complexity of the algorithm, synchronization requirement, and the impact of CFO,
    SFO, and inter-packet interference still require further study. It is also challenging
    to devise adaptive and effective MAC protocols, due to the inflexibility of contention-based
    and energy waste of schedule-based ones. Besides, different network deployment,
    various intra- and inter-network interference, dynamic link quality, and algorithm
    complexity are challenging for configuration settings methods. LoRa Security.
    Security and privacy are vital with the surging growth of LoRa networks, on the
    premise that LoRa is susceptible to various vulnerabilities. LoRa PHY properties
    have shed light on novel and powerful attacks that are difficult to combat, while
    the high power efficiency requirement also makes its countermeasures challenging.
    Additionally, although PHY layer security methods can maintain theoretically absolute
    security, non-robust characteristics limit the practicality. For example, the
    existing key generation methods generally allow occurring only two legitimate
    parties in a long-term probing period but not group ones. Discriminative instantaneous
    features and suitability for newly join-request legitimate devices are challenging
    for RFFI methods. LoRa-enabled Applications. Beyond the scope of LoRa networks,
    plenty of works have attempted various LoRa-enabled application designs inclusive
    of backscatter, sensing, heterogeneous technologies, and so on. These works have
    made promising progress and shown great potential in the research community, but
    also deserve further much-room exploration. For backscatter, ambient excitation
    signals, concurrent transmission capability, and demodulating weak backscatter
    signals from the strong superposed excitation signal are valuable and challenging
    factors. The major challenges of wireless sensing lie in effective feature extraction,
    robust signal model derivation, and comprehensive data collection. The generality
    is a long-term challenge for integration with heterogeneous wireless technologies.
    7.2 Future Directions LoRa Protocol Stack. As an emerging LPWAN technology, various
    efforts have been made on the protocol stack of LoRa, especially its PHY/MAC layers.
    The unique characteristics of LoRa PHY signals have been leveraged for collision
    disambiguation [167], sensing [186], and backscatter [74], which undoubtedly demonstrates
    the capability and potential of LoRa PHY layer. For further directions, novel
    modulation technology is a new way to break through the conventional theory for
    transmission performance optimization. Apart from leveraging LoRa PHY packet structure
    and chirp features in time and frequency domains, exploiting spatial [93] and
    reception [167] diversity gain, adopting deep learning networks [86] can break
    through some inherent limitations of LoRa conventional PHY decoding while ensuring
    the advantages of its weak and collision decoding ability. Cross-layer, cross-device,
    and cross-sensor sensing can provide multi-domain knowledge fusion for better
    sensing [99]. Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), focusing on joint-protocol
    design and time-frequency resource reuse, has been a hot research topic recently.
    Additionally, as LoRa only defines the lower PHY layer in the communication stack,
    upper network protocols can refine LoRa protocol stack with respect to MAC protocol,
    data/control plane, and so on. LoRa Network. In essence, LoRa is a communication
    technology to form wireless sensor networks featuring low energy consumption and
    long transmission distance. However, many network performance indicators, such
    as throughput, communication range, energy consumption, capacity, scalability,
    and security, deserve further consideration and enhancement. Apart from LoRa networking
    protocols, the aforementioned ones can be improved via link coordination and adaptability,
    network management, and so on. Link quality dramatically affects the extent of
    signal propagation’s attenuation (e.g., fading, path loss). Hence, channel diversity,
    adaptive transmission strategies, and opportunistic spectrum access deserve further
    improvements. The real-life deployed LoRa networks often present a large-scale
    complex architecture, which could be multi-topology, multi-hop, or heterogeneous
    networks. Therefore, network management can achieve resource allocation, load
    balance, device configuration, accounting, and security services. Among these,
    network aggregation [48, 183] on LoRa networks is an emerging way for information
    retrieving and accounting. Besides general security mechanisms, regular firmware
    updating via over-the-air for remotely deployed LoRa devices sheds light on network
    security. AI-empowered LoRa. Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a significant
    role in a wide range of research and industry fields [145]. The mainstream deep
    learning methods can learn implicit and fine-grained feature representations from
    the sample instances, render high accuracy and acceptable generalization, and
    avoid complex feature engineering. Data-driven deep learning methods on LoRa signals
    have achieved remarkable results and incredible purposes in signal demodulating
    [86], RFFI [138], and sensing [91]. Additionally, few-shot learning, un-/semi-supervised
    learning [145], federal learning, and embedded AI can be applied to LoRa technology
    to achieve different tasks. Thus, LoRa technology integration with AI is a worthy
    and broad future direction. Skip 8CONCLUSION Section 8 CONCLUSION LoRa is a crucial
    and promising LPWAN technology that gains significant research momentum over the
    past decades, thus inspiring extensive works. In this article, we give a comprehensive
    review of LoRa from four aspects, i.e., analysis, communication, security, and
    applications. Besides, several challenges and potential research directions have
    also been discussed. Although we have reviewed nearly 200 articles in this survey,
    the list of studies is far from exhaustive. Nevertheless, it covers the majority
    of recent achievements and directions. We hope that this survey will make it easier
    for researchers to identify research gaps and discover answers. Additionally,
    we would like to welcome all researchers to contribute to this intriguing field
    by expanding it and providing fresh insights. Footnotes 1 Due to the huge number
    of references about LoRa, this survey only focuses on the papers published at
    top conferences or journals, coupled with highly influential ones. Footnote 2
    Inspired by the LoRa survey [85], we continuously adopt “application” as the classification
    criterion of the references about backscatter, sensing, and integration with heterogeneous

    methodNeural networkKnowledge representationInfrastructure sectors 1. Introduction
    Artificial intelligence (AI) methods enable machines to learn and infer from large
    volumes of data (Ertel, 2017). As infrastructure systems become increasingly interconnected,
    complex and digitalised, AI will be crucial in providing and maintaining services
    that ever-increasing numbers of people depend upon every day (Luckey et al., 2021).
    However, as interest in AI continues to grow, research into its application to
    infrastructure systems remains largely siloed. Most papers focus on a specific
    problem in isolation, and the handful of review papers cover either a specific
    subset of AI methods (Suganthi et al., 2015, Veres and Moussa, 2019), or a specific
    infrastructure sector (Abduljabbar et al., 2019). This review looks at the extent
    of research into the use of AI in infrastructure systems, focusing on the economic
    infrastructure sectors of energy, water and wastewater, transport, and telecommunications,
    and the intersections between sectors. As interdependent systems, there is a clear
    benefit to reviewing infrastructure networks as a whole, recognising areas of
    overlap such as the water–energy nexus, electric vehicles, and vehicular ad-hoc
    networks (VANETs), and common challenges, such as supply and demand forecasting,
    inspection, and maintenance. Not only does this review seek to ascertain which
    AI techniques are popularly used in infrastructure systems, but to compare the
    maturity and depth of research across systems, in the hope that potential research
    gaps can be discovered, and potential solutions informed by existing work in other
    fields. 2. Method This paper adopts a systematic literature review approach in
    combination with a snowballing literature review method proposed by Wohlin (2014),
    which was applied to review papers or highly significant papers. Wohlin’s systematic
    literature review with snowballing was chosen over a sole database search-based
    review due to the interdisciplinary nature of the research area, which spans a
    range of sectors, making it challenging to formulate comprehensive search strings.
    This helped to overcome the additional difficulty of creating precise searches,
    with the risk of yielding many irrelevant or redundant papers (Wnuk and Garrepalli,
    2018). The systematic selection of a tentative starting set of papers was undertaken.
    Search terms are divided into two categories: AI terms and infrastructure terms.
    AI terms cover the range of subtopics within the field (Table 1). Infrastructure
    terms vary across systems, so these terms can be subdivided into the infrastructure
    systems of transportation, energy, water/wastewater and telecommunications (Table
    2). These terms were used for a primary search, the results of which informed
    the purposes chosen for discussion later in this paper. To ensure the key papers
    were covered for each purpose, a range of more general terms pertaining to purpose
    were applied to multiple infrastructure sectors as part of a secondary search
    (Table 3). The reviewed papers were categorised by AI method, infrastructure sector
    (or sectors), and purpose. Finally, an analysis framework, originally proposed
    by Sharifi for the assessment of smart city indicators (Sharifi, 2019), was selected
    and expanded for critical analysis of the selected papers. This enabled the literature
    to be evaluated against a set of criteria designed to account for various elements
    of planning, problem-solving, and implementation. A smart city framework was chosen
    as the basis of this analysis as this represents a complex system of interconnected
    sub-systems, spanning disciplines including engineering, governance, and politics.
    As infrastructure systems have both the same interconnected structure and interdisciplinary
    nature, a smart city perspective offers a solid foundation for analysis. Two further
    criteria were added to the original framework: comparison and vulnerability. The
    former covers the extent to which the reviewed work has compared alternative approaches,
    and the latter is concerned with the ability of the system to cope with failure.
    The inclusion of a comparison criterion was deemed necessary in order to recognise
    the wide range of AI models, particularly in machine learning. As linear systems,
    it is crucial that consideration is given to the ability of infrastructure systems
    to withstand failure events, justifying the addition of a vulnerability criterion.
    Initial searching combined each AI term with the sector-specific infrastructure
    terms. An expert in telecommunication systems was consulted in order to ensure
    domain-specific terminology was included. Search strings combining multiple infrastructure
    sectors were also used, to find papers covering overlaps in infrastructure sectors
    such as the water–energy nexus. The results of this initial search informed the
    infrastructure purpose terminology selected. In an additional step, the purpose
    terms identified from the primary search results were then used in a secondary
    search, where they were combined with AI terms in order to account for key papers
    pertaining to specific applications. Results were subject to title screening to
    ensure relevance. Further exclusionary criteria were applied, which removed those
    not written in English, those that fell outside of the scope of infrastructure
    systems, or those that explored algorithms outside of machine learning models.
    Papers were collated, and those concerned with the same infrastructure and purpose
    were assessed, with factors considered including date of publication, number of
    citations and number of comparative models studied. Papers were also labelled
    to identify those that could be described as review papers. Review papers and
    the most relevant and comprehensive of non-review papers were then subject to
    snowballing. Title screening of results established relevance, and a secondary
    abstract screening was sufficient to apply exclusion criteria in the majority
    of cases. Where this was not the case, the full paper was assessed prior to inclusion.
    Papers were screened by a number of criteria to ensure quality. The final number
    of papers included in this review is 186, of which 40 are considered to be review
    papers. Table 1. AI terminology. Artificial intelligence terms Artificial intelligence

    3. Artificial intelligence fields Alan Turing proposed his ‘Turing test’ to offer
    an operational definition of AI, stating that a truly intelligent system must
    be capable of matching human cognitive performance to an extent that a human interrogator
    cannot tell the different between human and machine when interacting via a teletype
    system (Russell and Norvig, 2002). In a ‘total’ Turing test, perception and physical
    abilities are tested alongside cognitive functioning. Each of the following components
    represents a field of AI that help to attain one or more of the Turing test’s
    goals: • knowledge representation, to store data • automated reasoning, to infer
    and make use of conclusions from the stored data • machine learning, to identify
    patterns and modify behaviour • computer vision, to perceive the environment •
    robotics, to interact with the physical environment • natural language processing,
    to communicate in human language While these components can describe attributes
    of an ideal intelligent computer system, they can also be considered topics in
    the field of AI research, each concerned with techniques that contribute to an
    element of system intelligence. There is significant overlap between fields, with
    automated reasoning inherently dependent on the knowledge base it reasons from,
    machine learning techniques – particularly convolutional neural networks – increasingly
    utilised in computer vision systems, and such vision systems often integrated
    into intelligent robots. Models which include both a reasoning and machine learning
    element, such as adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), are also growing
    in use. As the most widely adopted fields of AI in infrastructure research, machine
    learning and computer vision methods are reviewed below. The methods described
    in this section are not a comprehensive review of all techniques in machine learning
    and computer vision but rather the most common methods found in the body of work
    reviewed, as to provide context for further discussion. 3.1. Machine learning
    Machine learning is the process by which machines, able to access the necessary
    knowledge, can modify and adapt their actions to learn independently how to solve
    problems (Marsland, 2009). There are a large range of machine learning models,
    which generally utilise three widely recognised types of learning: supervised,
    unsupervised and reinforcement. Learning styles typically address how, and the
    extent to which, models are trained. 3.1.1. Learning types Supervised Learning
    In this type of learning, the system is trained using a set of examples with the
    desired responses provided (Li et al., 2017). Given sufficient training, which
    can take hours, days, or longer, the system can generalise in order to map inputs
    to outputs for new data sets. This can also be described as learning from exemplars
    (Marsland, 2009). Supervised learning models may require retraining to account
    for changes in their inputs over time. Unsupervised Learning Unlike in supervised
    learning, in unsupervised learning, the correct outputs are not provided alongside
    inputs. Instead, an unsupervised learning agent has to rely on its own ability
    to identify the embedded structures or patterns in inputs, so that those with
    similarities can be categorised together (Marsland, 2009, Li et al., 2017). This
    approach to learning typically aims to discover analogous input groups, a process
    known as clustering, or to establish the distribution of data within the input
    space, a statistical approach known as density estimation (Fernández Maimó et
    al., 2018). Reinforcement Learning In reinforcement learning, there are no pre-classified
    examples, but there is some form of long-term objective. An agent ‘experiments’
    with a system, and receives rewards or punishments based on these interactions.
    The agent tries different possibilities, optimising its behaviour over numerous
    iterations in order to maximise rewards and minimise punishments (Kubat, 2017b).
    While the agent is never explicitly given instructions as to how to achieve its
    goal, acting in ways that maximise the cumulative reward allows it to develop
    optimal behaviours, in as many iterations as needed (Li et al., 2017). In most
    cases, the longer a model is run, the more refined the solution will be. 3.1.2.
    Common machine learning models Although the specific details of a model’s architecture
    and algorithm vary for each individual case, there are a number of popular machine
    learning models that have established themselves as some of the best performing.
    Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a popular
    type of machine learning model that simulates the mechanism of learning in the
    human brain, which contains networks of billions of nerve cells. In ANNs, a neuron
    is a computational unit consisting of ‘dendrite’ inputs scaled with ‘synaptic’
    weights that affect the function computed at that unit, and an ‘activation’ internal
    state (Aggarwal, 2018b). Neurons exist in a network, forming a directed, weighted
    graph that is typically arranged in layers. The learning process occurs by modifying
    the weights and thresholds of the network to achieve accurate results. Although
    there are so many variations of ANNs in use today that it is impossible to cover
    all of them in detail, a few of the most popular model structures are outlined
    here. ANNs can be divided into two classes based on their general architecture:
    feed-forward and feed-back networks. Feed-forward networks are non-recurrent networks
    comprised of inputs, hidden layers, and outputs, where signals can only travel
    in one direction. Examples include multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and radial basis
    function (RBF) networks. Use cases in infrastructure research have seen MLP models
    employed to predict energy consumption (Azadeh et al., 2008) and for pollutant
    removal (Fan et al., 2018) in water networks. RBF networks have also been applied
    to water treatment (Fan et al., 2018). Conversely, feed-back networks permit signals
    to travel in either direction, owing to the inclusion of feed-back loops. In feed-back
    networks, also called recurrent neural networks (RNNs), neurons can be connected
    in any possible format, which can account for dependencies between neurons. Popular
    RNNs are echo state networks (ESNs), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.
    Interesting examples in infrastructure have seen ESNs applied to demand forecasting
    in water networks (Xu et al., 2019b), while LSTM networks can be found in a range
    of forecasting applications, where they have been used to predict energy use (Bedi
    and Toshniwal, 2019), telecommunication traffic (Alawe et al., 2018) and accident
    risk in transport networks (Ren et al., 2018), to give just a few examples. Another
    type of ANN, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been widely used for image
    classification and object detection purposes. This particular application of AI
    can be described as computer vision and is covered separately. Support Vector
    Machines (SVMs) Support vector machines (SVMs) are popular machine learning models
    widely used in classification and regression tasks, although used most extensively
    for the former. When applied to regression tasks, SVMs may be described as support
    vector regression (SVR). SVMs work by mapping input vectors into a high dimensional
    feature space and finding an optimal hyperplane to classify the data. The dimension
    of the feature space is dependent on the number of input features (Cortes and
    Vapnik, 1995). The SVM algorithm seeks to maximise the margin between data points
    and hyperplane, which it does using a loss function named hinge loss. SVM-based
    approaches have been used in energy demand and price forecasting (Ahmad et al.,
    2014, Ghoddusi et al., 2019), for routing in vehicular networks (Zhao et al.,
    2016), and to assess and improve quality and security in telecommunication systems
    (Wang et al., 2016, Mata et al., 2018, Musumeci et al., 2019). Decision Trees
    (DTs) and Random Forests (RFs) Another technique that has been applied to both
    classification and regression tasks is decision trees (DTs). In decision trees,
    inputs begin at a root node, where a specific attribute is tested, with the result
    dictating the branch down which the unit is sent. This process is repeated, with
    different tests at each node, until a terminal, or ‘leaf’, node is reached (Kubat,
    2017a). Regression trees, which are applied to continuous variables, obtain leaf
    node values from the mean response of regional observations. However, the leaf
    node values of classification trees, which deal with categoric variables, are
    the mode of regional observations. Random Forest (RF) models consist of large
    numbers of DTs operating as an ensemble. Building units using random feature selection
    results in low correlation between the trees, limiting the spreading of errors
    between them (Breiman, 2001). RFs have seen wider exploitation than DTs in infrastructure
    systems, where they have been applied to quality of experience (QoE) prediction
    (Casas et al., 2017) and anomaly detection (Gulenko et al., 2016) in telecommunication
    networks, price prediction (Xu et al., 2019a) and pollutant removal (Fan et al.,
    2018, Ye et al., 2020) in water systems, and behaviour prediction in transport
    (Koushik et al., 2020). K-means Clustering One of the most common unsupervised
    learning tools is k-means clustering, which assigns inputs to a cluster based
    on the distance from cluster centroids in order to maximise similarities within
    groups (Kubat, 2017c). In infrastructure, k-means has been used in telecommunication
    routing (Saravanan and Ganeshkumar, 2020) and for behavioural prediction in transportation
    modelling (Koushik et al., 2020). 3.1.3. Deep learning Deep learning is a relatively
    new branch of machine learning, describing computational models composed of multiple
    processing layers that learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction
    (LeCun et al., 2015). While the first deep learning algorithms and architectures
    were developed in the 1960s and 1970s, massive advances in computer hardware are
    responsible for the deep learning revolution of the past ten years. In practice,
    deep learning applies specifically to ANN models, although architectures can show
    significant variation. Deep ANNs are any that contain multiple hidden layers.
    Examples of deep neural networks include Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), autoencoders,
    LSTM and CNNs. The depth of these networks allows very complex functions to be
    learned. Models such as DBNs and autoencoders often include an unsupervised pre-training
    stage, which capture the main variations in inputs and can yield better generalisation
    (Erhan et al., 2010). Capable of handling problems with very large quantities
    of data, deep learning has proven to be very successful at tackling particularly
    complex problems, such as image classification, natural language processing, and
    speech recognition. However, deep learning is not without drawbacks. Large datasets,
    in addition to the increased computational complexity of deep ANNs, can result
    in longer training and run times, which are of particular concern for real-time
    applications. 3.2. Computer vision Computer vision is concerned with learning
    the relationships between an observed image data and aspects of the world, such
    as the 3D structure or the object class, and exploits this knowledge to make new
    inferences from new image data (Prince, 2012). Both biological and computational
    vision systems require several basic components: a radiation source, a camera,
    a sensor, a processing unit, an actor. A complete computer vision system uses
    these to cover a range of processes from image construction to formulating a response
    to perceived actions (Jahne, 2000). Traditional methods in computer vision have
    utilised feature-based approaches such as scale invariant feature transform (SIFT),
    speeded up robust features (SURF), features from accelerated segment test (FAST),
    Hough transforms and geometric hashing, sometimes in combination with machine
    learning classifiers. While these tools still have a place in computer vision,
    the adoption of deep learning methods has transformed this field (Mahony et al.,
    2020). In recent works, deep learning often underpins the design of the processing
    unit in computer vision systems. The most dominant tool used in the processing
    stage of computer vision systems is the CNN. CNNs are biologically inspired networks
    which are widely used for image recognition, classification, object detection,
    and localisation (Aggarwal, 2018b). Although developed in the 1980s, it was the
    development of graphics processing units, which vastly reduced run times, in the
    2000s that saw CNNs take off in popularity. CNN architecture is designed for grid-structured
    inputs with strong localised spatial dependencies. The convolutional layer utilises
    kernel elements, which are 3-dimensional structural units, to abstract an image
    to a feature map in order to extract high-level features such as edges. Each layer
    of a CNN is 3-dimensional, with a spatial extent and a depth corresponding to
    the number of feature maps in that layer (Aggarwal, 2018a). 4. Sectoral analysis
    The use of AI varies between each of the economic infrastructure sectors: energy,
    water and wastewater, transport and telecommunications. This section reports on
    the use of AI methods in each sector and each pair of sectors, the latter recognising
    the increasing blurring of sectoral boundaries. 4.1. Energy In the energy sector,
    AI tools have been extensively applied to demand forecasting (Almalaq and Edwards,
    2017, Bedi and Toshniwal, 2019, Robinson et al., 2017, Kalogirou, 1999, Ghanbari
    et al., 2013), especially at residential and building level (Mocanu et al., 2016,
    Ahmad et al., 2014, Wang and Srinivasan, 2017, Mat Daut et al., 2017). Further
    applications include price forecasting (Ghoddusi et al., 2019) and demand side
    management (Macedo et al., 2015). Facilitating energy use reduction is of increasing
    concern in this sector, and methods ranging from efficiency-centred ontologies
    (Tomic et al., 2010) to natural language generation of consumer advice reports
    (Conde-Clemente et al., 2018) have been utilised for this purpose. Much of the
    rest of the work in the energy sector focuses on generation systems, where many
    of the most developed applications pertain to renewable energy infrastructure
    (Kalogirou, 2001). Robotics shows significant potential as an aid in the oil,
    gas and nuclear sectors, but the machines used to date remain limited in their
    autonomy (Shukla and Karki, 2016a, Shukla and Karki, 2016b). In renewable energy
    systems, there has been increasing use of AI in supply forecasting. Key elements
    of this include meteorological forecasting, where ANN and fuzzy logic techniques
    are popular (Suganthi et al., 2015, Li et al., 2017, Mellit and Kalogirou, 2008),
    and solar tracking, which often utilises computer vision tools (Carballo et al.,
    2019). Artificially intelligent methods of inspection and structural health monitoring
    for renewable energy assets have also been investigated (Bose, 2017). 4.2. Water
    and wastewater AI methods have been utilised throughout water networks, from initial
    water treatment through to distribution and consumer-related challenges. At the
    supply end, much of the research has been concerned with water quality (Chau,
    2006) and pollutant removal (Fan et al., 2018), in both standard and wastewater
    treatment (Granata et al., 2017, Ye et al., 2020, Zhao et al., 2020, Li et al.,
    2021). Machine learning methods have also been utilised in desalination, where
    they can have implications for plant design (Al Aani et al., 2019). From an end-usage
    perspective, a range of machine learning techniques, including ANNs, RFs, SVMs,
    k nearest neighbour, regression trees and DBNs, have been applied to water demand
    forecasting (Antunes et al., 2018, Xu et al., 2019b, Franklin, 2008, Adamowski
    et al., 2012) and price forecasting (Nguyen-ky et al., 2018, Xu et al., 2019a)
    across a range of geographic scales. 4.3. Transportation The transportation sector
    has seen perhaps the most variation in tasks to which AI has been applied (Abduljabbar
    et al., 2019, Veres and Moussa, 2019). Looking at transportation networks as a
    whole, a number of knowledge representation systems, many ontology-based, have
    been proposed (Bouhana et al., 2015), while recent research into how the public
    interact with transport systems from a behavioural perspective, including transport
    mode selection, has benefited from a range of machine learning techniques (Koushik
    et al., 2020). Although it has been recognised that traffic flow and accident
    prediction can be utilised for a variety of urban transportation systems (Zhang
    et al., 2017, Doğan and Akgüngör, 2013), much of the remaining work in this sector
    has focused on individual modes of transportation. Regarding road vehicle usage,
    a range of machine learning methods have been applied to traffic (Jiang and Zhang,
    2019, Veres and Moussa, 2019, Xie et al., 2020) and accident forecasting (Doğan
    and Akgüngör, 2013, Ren et al., 2018, Abduljabbar et al., 2019, Veres and Moussa,
    2019), as well as for navigational tools (Veres and Moussa, 2019). Similar tools
    have also been utilised in demand forecasting (Yao et al., 2018, Rodrigues et
    al., 2019) and destination prediction for taxi services (Veres and Moussa, 2019).
    Researchers have sought to apply AI to identifying and mapping road networks (Ekpenyong
    et al., 2009), whilst computer vision-based approaches to monitoring traffic infrastructure
    have been proposed (Šegvić et al., 2010). In-vehicle and roadside sensors have
    the potential to provide more data on road networks than ever before, and deep
    learning methods are likely to play a significant role in the development of an
    intelligent transport network, with CNNs used in object detection, localisation,
    and classification for a variety of applications (Sirohi et al., 2020). Work on
    the development of self-driving cars has seen massive interest in recent years,
    and automated reasoning (Rehder et al., 2019), machine and deep learning (Kuutti
    et al., 2021), and computer vision have all been utilised in what is primarily
    a robotics-based challenge (Abduljabbar et al., 2019, Ma et al., 2020b). The application
    of AI in transport has not been limited to the roads. Though robotics, and specifically
    unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), demonstrate much potential in the monitoring
    of railway assets, many are still reliant on a significant level of human interaction
    (Flammini et al., 2016). Deep learning tools, however, have proven themselves
    effective at fault diagnosis in high-speed rail (Yin and Zhao, 2016), which is
    expected to grow in popularity as a mode of travel. While most other work in public
    transport has primarily focused on traffic flows or choice of transportation method
    (Veres and Moussa, 2019, Koushik et al., 2020), bus networks have been the subject
    of individual research, which focuses largely on scheduling issues (Mendes-Moreira
    et al., 2015). 4.4. Telecommunications Machine learning methods are seen as highly
    significant for the success of the next generation of wireless networks (Li et
    al., 2017, Jiang et al., 2017, Kibria et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2020, Shafin
    et al., 2020). Research has covered a variety of network types, with some works
    covering the more general ‘cellular’ or ‘wireless’ networks, and others focusing
    specifically on software-defined networks (SDNs) (Amaral et al., 2016, He et al.,
    2017), optical networks (Mata et al., 2018, Musumeci et al., 2019), 5G (Li et
    al., 2017, Alawe et al., 2018, Le et al., 2018), and the cloud (Gulenko et al.,
    2016). As in other infrastructure sectors, telecommunications has seen machine
    learning utilised in traffic and demand forecasting (Mastorocostas and Hilas,
    2012, Mastorocostas et al., 2016, Balaguer et al., 2008, Zhang and Patras, 2018,
    Le et al., 2018), with recent work focused on deep learning approaches (Huang
    et al., 2017, Alawe et al., 2018). Another common application of machine learning,
    where all learning types have been employed, is in routing (Barbancho et al.,
    2007, Sharma et al., 2018, Mao et al., 2017, Mao et al., 2018, Sendra et al.,
    2017, Vashishth et al., 2019, Kato et al., 2017, Tang et al., 2018, Yu et al.,
    2018, Pei et al., 2018), where effective solutions can help reduce latency. From
    a consumer perspective, quality of both transmission and overall experience are
    very important in telecommunication networks. Assessing customer experience and
    network quality, which can be dependent on factors including latency, jitter,
    loss rate and image or video definition, are active areas of research, utilising
    a range of machine learning classifiers (Casas et al., 2017, Samadi et al., 2017,
    Mata et al., 2018). The design of traffic clustering techniques that factor in
    quality of service (QoS) has also been suggested (Wang et al., 2016). The loss
    of customers to rival providers is termed ‘churn’, and the accuracy of several
    machine learning methods in predicting this occurrence has been compared (Vafeiadis
    et al., 2015). Security is a critical concern in telecommunications, especially
    in wireless and SDNs (Lv et al., 2021). A spectrum of machine learning approaches
    have been used in anomaly detection (Mata et al., 2018, Musumeci et al., 2019,
    Gulenko et al., 2016, Fernández Maimó et al., 2018), identifying denial-of-service
    (Meti et al., 2017, Polat et al., 2020, Hussain et al., 2021, Ahuja et al., 2021)
    and intrusion attacks (Song et al., 2017, Abubakar and Pranggono, 2017, Tang et
    al., 2016), and selecting an appropriate response (Ashraf and Latif, 2014). Due
    to the increasingly wireless nature of telecommunications, it is possible to provide
    dynamic networks that utilise UAVs as mobile base stations. Although not yet widespread,
    it is anticipated that interest in this area will continue to grow, and research
    to date has looked at how to deploy UAVs effectively (Zhang et al., 2018). 4.5.
    Energy and water A range of AI techniques have been applied at the water–energy
    nexus, which describes the intersection of water and energy systems (Zaidi et
    al., 2018). Hydropower, the generation of electricity by directing water through
    a turbine, sits at this nexus as an example of water use for energy applications.
    Unsupervised k-means clustering has been utilised in modelling the distribution
    of hydropower facilities and nearby land cover to estimate system evaporation
    (Grubert, 2016), while the supervised technique of SVM has been used to analyse
    the division between hydropower and irrigation in worldwide reservoir usage trends
    (Zeng et al., 2017). On a consumer level, there are many systems that both utilise
    water and require energy, such as dishwashers, washing machines, and showers.
    Research has used SVMs to classify such water end-use events on a residential
    scale (Vitter and Webber, 2018). 4.6. Energy and transport Energy demand forecasting
    for transportation has received less attention than equivalent forecasting for
    buildings, although researchers have recognised its importance in the decarbonisation
    of cities. Machine learning techniques such as ANNs and ANFIS allow both transport
    and socio-economic indicators to be considered when predicting future demand (Geem,
    2011, Al-Ghandoor et al., 2012, Murat and Ceylan, 2006, Pamuła and Pamuła, 2020).
    AI tools have been applied to electric and hybrid vehicles, the numbers of which
    are rapidly growing worldwide. Deep reinforcement learning has been shown to improve
    energy efficiency in individual units (Qi et al., 2017), while research at network
    level has focused on routing, charging point selection, and integration of electric
    vehicles into the smart grid (Rigas et al., 2015), all of which can benefit from
    some level of local demand forecasting (Saputra et al., 2019, Lan et al., 2021).
    At the vehicle-grid intersection, minimising energy peaks can be done through
    load balancing, congestion pricing, and market selling and purchasing strategies.
    4.7. Water and transport Though an area of minimal research, it has been recognised
    that water and transportation systems are not unconnected. In particular, abnormally
    intense periods of rainfall have the potential to cause significant disruption
    to rail and road transportation networks. This is an argument in favour of monitoring
    water levels in lakes and reservoirs, to which ANN methods have been applied (Buyukyildiz
    et al., 2014). 4.8. Energy and telecommunications Recent work in telecommunications
    has begun to recognise the significance of efficient energy usage in communication
    systems. Machine learning tools have been applied to energy-efficient resource
    allocation in cloud networks (AlQerm and Shihada, 2017), and research on utilising
    UAVs to provide dynamic networks has prioritised low energy usage (Zhang et al.,
    2018). 4.9. Transport and telecommunications VANETs, which facilitate dynamic
    wireless connections between vehicles, sit at the intersection of transport and
    telecommunications. As in other telecommunication networks, machine learning has
    been utilised in VANETs for routing (Lai et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2016, Tang
    et al., 2019, Saravanan and Ganeshkumar, 2020) and security (Zhang and Zhu, 2018,
    So et al., 2018). AI tools have also been used to improve VANET efficiency in
    the context of enhanced road safety, with k-means clustering utilised to improve
    safety at congestion points such as intersections (Taherkhani and Pierre, 2016).
    4.10. Water and telecommunications The research in this area is largely limited
    to flood prediction and mitigation, where the ‘Internet of Things’ wireless sensor
    network (WSN) has been combined with ANNs to predict flooding events (Mitra et
    al., 2016) and communicate warnings for those at risk (Bande and Shete, 2017).
    There remains an absence of work utilising AI to predict, assess, or mitigate
    the effects of flooding on telecommunications infrastructure. 5. Purposes The
    reasons for investigation and adoption of AI methods include system provision
    (of network capacity), forecasting, routing, monitoring and security, and improving
    the quality of resources or services. This section reviews the main purposes across
    infrastructure sectors to which AI methods have been applied. 5.1. System provision
    AI tools have been used to assist in the delivery of infrastructure systems, both
    in the sense of adding to generation capacity through the creation of additional
    supply sites, and in facilitating the provision of new independent networks. 5.1.1.
    Site selection In the oil and gas sector, comprehensive review papers have discussed
    the potential of robotics in exploration and site selection (Shukla and Karki,
    2016a, Shukla and Karki, 2016b). Research regarding applications has, to date,
    been limited to establishing the capabilities of UAVs (Tisdale et al., 2009) and
    autonomous underwater vehicle (AUVs) (Hiller et al., 2012), and although these
    machines are becoming increasingly autonomous, there remains work to be done on
    developing truly intelligent robotics in the field of site exploration. However,
    robotics is not the only category of AI to be used by the energy industry in the
    site selection process. The use of fuzzy logic in renewable energy systems has
    been reviewed (Suganthi et al., 2015), with the authors finding that this form
    of automated reasoning has been widely used to assess the suitability of potential
    solar (Charabi and Gastli, 2011, Charabi and Gastli, 2013, Gunderson et al., 2015,
    Wu et al., 2014), wind (Machias and Skikos, 1991, Aydin et al., 2010, Yeh and
    Huang, 2014, Azadeh et al., 2014), biomass (Ayoub et al., 2007, Yılmaz Balaman
    and Selim, 2014), and hybrid renewable energy (Aydin et al., 2013) plant locations.
    Fuzzy logic is particularly appropriate to this application due to its ability
    to capture heuristic reasoning among individuals. This allows fuzzy models to
    combine energy generation forecasting with environmental, economic, and socio-political
    variables to account for factors such as job creation and social acceptability
    in the selection process (Yılmaz Balaman and Selim, 2014). Fuzzy logic has also
    been employed for site selection of transportation infrastructure, albeit to a
    much lesser extent. For example, an integrated fuzzy logic and multicriteria decision
    model approach has been employed to identify potential sites for car parking infrastructure
    (Farzanmanesh et al., 2010, Sasan et al., 2018) and for electric vehicle charging
    stations (Guo and Zhao, 2015). This limited body of work demonstrates how other
    infrastructure systems could benefit from the flexibility of fuzzy logic as a
    decision-making tool for site selection. 5.1.2. Dynamic network creation In the
    field of telecommunications, recent work has proposed the use of UAVs as mobile
    aerial base stations, providing a wireless network for cellular users. As communication
    networks transition to 5G, UAVs can offer a dynamic approach, intelligently positioning
    themselves to offer an efficient and cost-effective service. Machine learning
    approaches have been explored to facilitate effective network provision through
    UAVs. In one example, a machine learning framework based on a Gaussian mixture
    model (GMM) has been utilised to predict network congestion for the purpose of
    deploying UAVs in a way that minimises power usage for mobility and transmission
    (Zhang et al., 2018). 5.2. Forecasting 5.2.1. Supply Supply forecasting covers
    the use of AI to predict the capacity of infrastructure systems, and by extension
    their ability to meet expected demand. Both automated reasoning and machine learning
    tools have been applied to supply forecasting in the energy sector. Fuzzy logic,
    ANNs, SVMs, regression, time series, RFs, deep learning, and hybrid models have
    all been used to predict meteorological variables and associated power outputs
    in renewable systems (Suganthi et al., 2015, Zaidi et al., 2018, Zahraee et al.,
    2016, Lin et al., 2020, Alizamir et al., 2020). Solar radiation, wind speed, and
    rainfall forecasting allow researchers to assess the energy generation potential
    of current and prospective solar, wind, and hydropower energy sites (Zaidi et
    al., 2018, Zhen et al., 2020, Ahmad and Chen, 2020). A fuzzy logic model has also
    been used to estimate the potential electricity output of biomass plants based
    on their inputs at a regional level (Tan et al., 2012). Outside of renewables,
    an ANN-based approach outperformed traditional methods in forecasting oil, gas,
    and water production rates for a hydrocarbon reservoir (Negash and Yaw, 2020).
    5.2.2. Demand AI methods, dominated by machine learning, have been incredibly
    widely used in demand forecasting for infrastructure systems. Table 4 summarises
    the machine learning techniques applied to demand forecasting in each paper reviewed.
    Numerous papers and several review papers have examined the use of machine learning
    in energy demand forecasting. The majority of work to date has taken a supervised
    learning approach, likely due to the large amounts of available historic data,
    with ANNs and SVMs the most common methods (Kalogirou, 1999, Raza and Khosravi,
    2015, Wang and Srinivasan, 2017, Ahmad et al., 2014, Mat Daut et al., 2017, Ghoddusi
    et al., 2019, Geem, 2011, Khwaja et al., 2020, Ahmad and Chen, 2020). Recent work
    has explored deep learning for energy forecasting (Bedi and Toshniwal, 2019, Almalaq
    and Edwards, 2017, Hafeez et al., 2020, Yang et al., 2020), with evidence suggesting
    it outperforms standard machine learning methods (Mocanu et al., 2016). Forecasting
    has been attempted across a range of temporal and geographical scales, from 30
    min ahead to annual projections (Azadeh et al., 2008) and from household to regional
    levels (Bui et al., 2020, Johannesen et al., 2019, Robinson et al., 2017, Pham
    et al., 2020). Limited work has also looked at forecasting transportation energy
    demand (Geem, 2011, Murat and Ceylan, 2006, Al-Ghandoor et al., 2012, Pamuła and
    Pamuła, 2020). Many of these machine learning techniques have also been applied
    to water demand forecasting, with ANNs again dominating among chosen methods (Franklin,
    2008, Zaidi et al., 2018). Comparative studies have shown ANN-based approaches
    capable of achieving greater accuracy in water demand prediction than other machine
    learning systems (Adamowski et al., 2012, Antunes et al., 2018). A recent paper
    has sought to apply deep learning to this task, which yielded promising results
    in hourly urban water demand forecasting (Xu et al., 2019b). Demand forecasting
    in telecommunications can be split into two categories: traffic and churn forecasting.
    Regarding the former, machine learning and automated reasoning have been used
    to forecast call volume in a university network through a recurrent fuzzy-neural
    model (Mastorocostas and Hilas, 2012, Mastorocostas et al., 2016), while ANNs
    have been utilised to predict incoming requests in call centres (Balaguer et al.,
    2008) and to forecast traffic in telecommunications networks (Zhang and Patras,
    2018). Gaussian process regression and online Bayesian moment matching are other
    approaches which have been applied to online flow prediction, for the purpose
    of efficiently routing large traffic flows (Poupart et al., 2016). Much of the
    recent work in the field of telecommunications has focused on the application
    of machine learning to forecasting in 5G networks (Le et al., 2018), with deep
    learning increasingly common in this field (Huang et al., 2017, Alawe et al.,
    2018). Customer churn describes the movement of consumers away from a given supplier,
    and there has been significant utilisation of machine learning for churn forecasting
    in the telecommunications industry. An SVM-based approach has shown the highest
    accuracy of common machine learning methods (Vafeiadis et al., 2015). The transportation
    sector has seen machine learning applied to traffic, destination, and mode choice
    forecasting (Veres and Moussa, 2019), each a factor in anticipating network demand.
    ANNs have been used to predict traffic flows in road networks (Ma et al., 2020a)
    and combined with deep learning to predict citywide car, taxi, and public bike
    share traffic flows (Abduljabbar et al., 2019, Yao et al., 2018, Jiang and Zhang,
    2019, Zhang et al., 2017, Gu et al., 2020, Xu et al., 2020, Cui et al., 2020,
    Chen et al., 2021, Du et al., 2020, Xie et al., 2020). In addition, a deep learning
    approach that uses ANNs to combine textual and time-series data has attempted
    to forecast taxi demand in areas with large-capacity public events by incorporating
    contextual explanations for taxi use (Rodrigues et al., 2019). Taxi systems have
    also been the subject of work on destination prediction, where ANNs, in the form
    of MLPs and CNNs, have proven effective for multi-scale trajectory and destination
    forecasting (Lv et al., 2018). In aviation, an LSTM-based model was able to predict
    air traffic well despite anomalies in traffic control (Gui et al., 2020). It is
    worth noting that the application of forecasting can be very time-sensitive, and
    so the run time of machine learning techniques is a significant factor to consider
    in the feasibility of these solutions. Finally, mode choice prediction has been
    used to gain an understanding of the factors influencing individuals’ transport
    choices. A range of machine learning tools have been applied to this problem,
    but comparative studies find an RF classifier gives the greatest accuracy (Koushik
    et al., 2020, Jahangiri and Rakha, 2015). Results have found journey length to
    be the most important variable in transport mode selection, although climate was
    also found to contribute significantly (Hagenauer and Helbich, 2017). Table 4.

    methods have been used in energy price prediction (Lu et al., 2019, Jahangir et
    al., 2020), a thorough review has found ANNs, SVMs and genetic algorithms (GAs)
    to be the most popular (Ghoddusi et al., 2019). While the forecasting of crude
    oil and electricity prices dominates the work in this field, it was found that
    a handful of papers predict the prices of other energy commodities such as fuelwood,
    natural gas, and carbon prices using machine learning (Lu et al., 2020). Deep
    learning has only seen widespread use in the projection of electricity prices,
    remaining relatively unexplored in the crude oil equivalent. ANNs (Nguyen-ky et
    al., 2018) and RF regressor models (Xu et al., 2019a) have been utilised to predict
    water trade prices for Australia’s Murray river basin and the western United States
    respectively, enabling participants to make more efficient decisions in the face
    of uncertain asking and offering prices. 5.2.4. Safety In the transportation sector,
    machine learning methods have also been applied to the forecasting of road accidents
    and casualties (Abduljabbar et al., 2019), as well as the severity of incidents
    (Veres and Moussa, 2019). ANNs have proven the most effective of the methods trialled,
    with one example exploring how railway development policy would impact highway
    casualties (Doğan and Akgüngör, 2013). Further work has used an LSTM-based deep
    learning model for predicting traffic accident risk based on data from Beijing,
    China (Ren et al., 2018). 5.3. Routing The machine learning methods used for routing
    in the reviewed papers have been summarised in Table 5. A range of machine learning
    methods have been applied to telecommunications routing, the process of selecting
    paths to send data packets within or across networks (Wang et al., 2018, Mao et
    al., 2017, Zorzi et al., 2015). Optimal routing processes minimise delays and
    improve QoS. In WSNs, a routing protocol using an unsupervised ANN in the form
    of a self-organising map (SOM) has performed favourably when compared to existing
    routing methods, especially in scenarios with high levels of node failure (Barbancho
    et al., 2007). In opportunistic networks, where link performance is subject to
    high variability, ANNs and DTs have been successfully applied to routing (Sharma
    et al., 2018), although more recent work has claimed a GMM approach outperforms
    existing machine learning tools (Vashishth et al., 2019). Deep learning has also
    been applied to routing in both wired and wireless networks, where several supervised
    and reinforcement learning methods have been shown to reduce delays and improve
    throughput (Kato et al., 2017, Tang et al., 2018). Recent developments in the
    field of telecommunications have seen a move away from hardware-based networking,
    with a new software-based approach offering greater automation by de-coupling
    the control and data planes. Reinforcement learning has been the favoured tool
    in recent work on routing in SDNs (Sendra et al., 2017), often in combination
    with deep learning architecture (Mao et al., 2018, Yu et al., 2018). An alternative
    supervised deep learning approach has been applied to SDN routing in order to
    minimise end-to-end delay in virtual network function selection (Pei et al., 2018).
    VANETs are an instance of telecommunications being used in the development an
    intelligent transport system. These wireless networks connect moving and stationary
    vehicles, allowing exchange of information between vehicles and infrastructure
    in order to facilitate the safe, efficient and environmentally conscious flow
    of traffic. A variety of machine learning approaches have been applied to routing
    in VANETs, including supervised ANN and SVM methods (Tang et al., 2019, Zhao et
    al., 2016), an unsupervised K-means approach (Lai et al., 2015), and deep reinforcement
    learning (Saravanan and Ganeshkumar, 2020). Machine learning has also been applied
    to the routing of vehicles in transportation networks. For urban road traffic
    routing, GPS data has been used in combination with an end-to-end deep learning
    approach to attempt to apply the knowledge of experienced drivers when determining
    route selection (Veres and Moussa, 2019, Li et al., 2019). Routing in transport
    can be extended to include technologies that facilitate the independent navigation
    of autonomous vehicles. This is an emerging area of research which often combines
    machine learning and robotics to enable safe movement of vehicles. To date, most
    of the work in this field is at agent, rather than system, level (Yang et al.,
    2019, Ma et al., 2020b). Deep learning, and deep reinforcement learning in particular,
    has been effectively applied to lateral and longitudinal control systems in autonomous
    vehicles, where the self-optimising nature of such techniques makes them well
    suited to dynamic road environments (Kuutti et al., 2021). In the shipping sector,
    fuzzy logic can support dynamic decision making for autonomous navigation through
    international shipping routes (Wu et al., 2020). Table 5. Machine learning methods

    included. ○ Indicates that a given method was utilised by the paper, while ● indicates
    the best performing method where multiple techniques were applied to the same
    problem. T and C correspond to transport and telecommunications respectively.

    and security This topic covers the use of AI for the purpose of maintaining a
    safe and effective infrastructure network. This includes inspection and preventative
    maintenance and extends to fault and hazard detection and response. 5.4.1. Inspection
    and monitoring In various infrastructure sectors, robotics has been utilised for
    inspection purposes. This has proven especially beneficial in the energy sector,
    where inspections can be necessary in hostile environments, but many systems are
    still heavily reliant on human operators. In the oil and gas industry, robots
    have been used for years for the inspection of assets (Shukla and Karki, 2016a,
    Shukla and Karki, 2016b), but utilising their full potential requires a greater
    level of autonomy. Other AI methods can aid robots undertaking inspections. For
    example, machine-learning-based computer vision can be integrated into UAVs to
    identify, map out and monitor electrical infrastructure. However, while computer
    vision has been applied to vegetation detection in electrical infrastructure,
    it is potential to detect defects in cables or insulation remains undeveloped
    (Mirallès et al., 2014). Independent of robotics, machine learning has been applied
    to structural health monitoring of infrastructure. Examples of methods that can
    be applied in a range of infrastructure systems include computer vision-based
    crack detection in steel structures and a deep learning approach to dealing with
    anomalies in sensor data (Bao et al., 2019). RFs and DT algorithms have shown
    high effectiveness in predicting anomalies in wind turbine function, informing
    preventative maintenance strategies (Hsu et al., 2020). Utilising both machine
    learning and automated reasoning, an ANFIS has been applied to health monitoring
    of a full wind energy generation system, with the author suggesting a similar
    approach may be effective for photovoltaic or other generation systems (Bose,
    2017). An interesting use of computer-based monitoring has been employed to identify
    abnormalities in a water distribution network. An ANN has been trained using a
    continually updated historic database to build a probability density model for
    future flow profile, while a fuzzy inference system compares latest observed flow
    values with predicted flows. Major discrepancies generate an alert, which was
    found to correspond with confirmed pipe bursts in 44% of trial cases (Mounce et
    al., 2010). In water systems dependent on a network of sensors, such as those
    used to determine water quality indicators in wastewater systems, faulty sensors
    are not uncommon, and can cause significant data quality issues. An LSTM deep
    learning technique has used for automatic fault detection in wastewater sensors,
    correctly identifying faults in over 92% of cases (Mamandipoor et al., 2020).
    AI has been utilised for safety monitoring in transport networks, where a computer
    vision-based approach has been explored for traffic infrastructure inventory creation
    and assessment (Zhang and Zhu, 2018). Results indicate that it is possible to
    achieve at least semi-automated inspection of road signage. The stability of tunnelled
    roadways has been assessed using machine learning tools, with a hybrid ANN and
    particle swarm method proving most effective (Zhang et al., 2020). Deep learning
    has been applied to fault detection for high speed rail, where a DBN consisting
    of stacked restricted Boltzmann machines outperforms ANN and k nearest neighbour
    methods in automated fault diagnosis (Yin and Zhao, 2016). As the use of high-speed
    rail spreads around the world, deep learning shows great potential as it has the
    capacity to deal with massive amounts of unsupervised data. 5.4.2. Security and
    hazard detection While inspection and monitoring covers damage to networks from
    general wear and tear, the use of AI for security and hazard detection purposes
    deals with the protection of infrastructure systems from potentially destructive
    hazards or deliberate attacks. The machine learning methods applied to this purpose
    in the reviewed papers have been summarised in Table 6. In telecommunications,
    network security is a major consideration and has been the subject of a large
    volume of research in recent years (Lv et al., 2021). In SDNs, a spectrum of machine
    learning techniques including ANNs, SVMs, DTs, RFs, k nearest neighbour and Naïve-Bayes
    classifiers have been applied to the detection of denial-of-service and intrusion
    attacks, as well as to identify vulnerable nodes and select an appropriate responses
    to threats (Song et al., 2017, Abubakar and Pranggono, 2017, Meti et al., 2017,
    Nanda et al., 2016, Polat et al., 2020). Deep learning tools have also been employed
    for security purposes in SDNs. For example, a supervised deep neural network approach
    has been used in intrusion detection (Tang et al., 2016), and various deep learning
    techniques have been shown to be highly accurate for multi-vector denial-of-service
    attack detection (Hussain et al., 2021, Ahuja et al., 2021). The use of machine
    learning in optical networks has been reviewed, with Bayesian and cognition-based
    methods among those applied to anomaly detection, and supervised SVM, ANN, RF,
    and DT techniques used in failure management (Mata et al., 2018, Musumeci et al.,
    2019). Cloud computing allows on-demand access to computer system resources without
    direct active management by the user, often available to a large network of consumers.
    A selection of machine learning algorithms have been reviewed for anomaly detection
    in cloud infrastructures including primarily DT-based algorithms, as well as an
    RF classifier, Bayesian methods and an SVM-based approach (Gulenko et al., 2016).
    Ten-fold cross-validation was undertaken, which found that all algorithms were
    able to predict anomalies with relatively high precision and recall measures,
    although this can be diminished when aging effects are considered. For 5G mobile
    network architecture, where unpredictable traffic fluctuation is to be expected,
    a deep learning approach consisting of a DBN layer and separate LSTM recurrent
    network layer has been designed to detect anomalies and recognise patterns of
    cyberattacks (Fernández Maimó et al., 2018). This two-layer approach has demonstrated
    an ability to self-adapt in real-time, based on the volume of network flows. Table

    assess and improve water quality at various stages of the water treatment cycle
    (Chau, 2006). The bulk of work to date is concerned with water treatment facilities,
    which includes plants dealing with surface water, ground water, and wastewater.
    Accurate assessment of incoming water quality is critical to designing effective
    water treatment facilities. As accurate and thorough sampling is not always possible,
    machine learning tools have been applied to the forecasting of water quality indicators.
    ANN-based techniques have been applied to the prediction of numerous water quality
    indicators, with dissolved oxygen, temperature, and biological and chemical oxygen
    demand among the most common variables assessed (Chen et al., 2020a). Looking
    at other machine learning methods, support vector regression has proven more effective
    than a regression tree approach to predicting key wastewater quality indicators
    across a range of drainage basins, though both were found to give robust predictions
    (Granata et al., 2017). The value of fuzzy logic in quality assessment has also
    been established, primarily in fresh water systems (Chau, 2006). Finally, a hybrid
    approach combining DTs and a shallow CNN has been effective in analysing the pollutant
    levels of industrial wastewater (Chen et al., 2020b). Once water has entered a
    treatment facility, it is critical that operators know decontamination methods
    are effective. A range of machine learning approaches have been widely utilised
    in water and wastewater treatment for the purpose of modelling pollutant removal,
    where nutrients, heavy metals, and persistent organic pollutants are some of the
    most common contaminants (Zhao et al., 2020, Al Aani et al., 2019). While ANN-based
    methods dominate, techniques such as SVMs, RF, ANFIS, and deep learning have also
    been successfully utilised, and hybrid methods that combine ANNs with other machine
    learning approaches have shown high accuracy and robustness (Fan et al., 2018,
    Bhagat et al., 2020). Another application of ANNs in water treatment is the modelling
    of membrane performance, where membranes are barriers that block certain substances
    from passing through, as part of the water cleaning process. This can assist with
    treatment plant design. ANNs have shown high levels of accuracy when predicting
    membrane efficiency under a range of operating conditions, showing the greatest
    superiority over classical methods at high concentration levels. ANNs have also
    been utilised to identify factors affecting fouling, which is the process of particle
    deposition on or in a membrane, leading to performance degradation (Al Aani et
    al., 2019, Li et al., 2021). In wastewater treatment, the activated sludge process
    uses aeration and a biological floc composed of bacteria and protozoa to treat
    contaminated water. Machine learning approaches have been employed to assist in
    the understanding of this ecosystem, identifying some functional features that
    are crucial to the effective adaptation of activated sludge bacteria to the wastewater
    treatment bioreactor environment (Ye et al., 2020). ANN-based models have proven
    reliable in predicting the efficiency of desalination technologies, which are
    concerned with the removal of salt from surface water, groundwater, or wastewater.
    Most work to date has focused on utilising such models to assist in the control
    of desalination plants (Al Aani et al., 2019). 5.5.2. Quality of service For telecommunication
    companies, providing a high QoS is critical for preventing customer churn. AI
    has been applied in the assessment of consumer QoE, as well as to improve network
    quality in a variety of ways. Supervised machine learning has been applied to
    QoE assessment for smartphone users in cellular networks. Key performance indicators
    incorporated user-reported data on experience and accessibility with QoS traffic
    measurements, to quickly and accurately predict end-user satisfaction. A range
    of classifiers were considered, with RF and DT-based models outperforming SVM,
    ANN, and Naïve Bayes approaches (Casas et al., 2017). A QoS-centred approach to
    classification of traffic flows in SDNs has been proposed, with an SVM-based classifier
    assigning QoS classes to traffic flows through a semi-supervised machine learning
    approach. Key factors such as delay, jitter, and loss rate were used to assign
    a QoS class, which the authors suggest using to efficiently re-route elephant
    flows (Wang et al., 2016). To predict quality of transmission (QoT) in optical
    networks, case-based reasoning, SVM, and RF methods are among the machine learning
    methods that have been utilised (Mata et al., 2018). An ANN approach has achieved
    high levels of accuracy with microsecond response time, facilitating dynamic network
    operation (Samadi et al., 2017) Fog computing seeks to position resources at the
    network edge, between the data source and cloud, to bring them closer to the end
    user and improve network efficiency. A fuzzy clustering algorithm has been proposed
    for an unsupervised machine learning approach to selecting fog nodes in a 5G network,
    with the aim of reducing system latency (Balevi and Gitlin, 2017). 6. Discussion
    This section reflects on the review findings and evaluates these using an existing
    analysis framework developed from a review of smart city assessment papers and
    their indicators. 6.1. Review papers Of the 186 papers in this review, 40 were
    considered to be review papers as they survey or give an overview of existing
    research on AI in an area of infrastructure. While most are concerned with the
    present state of the art, some look ahead to predict future challenges and opportunities
    in their field (Jiang et al., 2017) . Many of the review papers deal with a particular
    subsector rather than a full sector of infrastructure. For example, reviews have
    been undertaken pertaining specifically to solar energy within the energy sector
    (Mellit and Kalogirou, 2008) and optical networks within telecommunications (Mata
    et al., 2018, Musumeci et al., 2019). It is also noted that some review the use
    of AI only for a specific purpose, such as forecasting (Raza and Khosravi, 2015,
    Almalaq and Edwards, 2017). Nonetheless, the existence of a body of work that
    seeks to surmise the progress of AI in the field of infrastructure indicates the
    extent of development in this area. The distribution of review papers also highlights
    the sectors, purposes, and subcategories of AI that have been the subject of the
    greatest degree of research, and those areas that lack significant study. Fig.
    3 shows the review papers that focus on the field of machine learning, as well
    as various subcategories of machine learning. This represents a significant majority
    of review papers, with those absent from this selection focusing instead on robotics
    (Shukla and Karki, 2016a, Shukla and Karki, 2016b, Yang et al., 2019), or computer
    vision (outside of CNNs) (Mirallès et al., 2014). The infrastructure sector with
    the most existing review papers is energy, followed by telecommunications. Only
    two papers were identified as sitting at the overlap between sectors, which were
    concerned with energy and water, and energy and transport. Download : Download

    machine learning methods With numerous machine learning tools available, and further
    subtypes of each, the justification for selecting one method over another is not
    always immediately evident. Table 7 presents the most common machine learning
    methods utilised in infrastructure systems and discusses the characteristics of
    each. Examples are drawn from various sectors to demonstrate how the traits of
    a given method contribute to its suitability for the desired application. Table
    7. Characteristics of machine learning techniques. Method Strengths Weaknesses
    Example of effective use ANN ANNs are a versatile approach to solving complex,
    non-linear problems (Aggarwal, 2018c). ANNs can be fault tolerant, and so are
    able to solve problems despite some failure elements on the network. After training,
    an ANN is able to produce an output even if presented with incomplete data (Mat
    Daut et al., 2017). ANNs are a black box approach, and thus the structure of an
    ANN cannot provide insight into the function being approximated. ANNs require
    training, which can be time-consuming, and their effectiveness can depend on access
    to sufficient quantities of training data. ANNs can require re-training over time
    (Mat Daut et al., 2017). ANNs can suffer from overfitting and local minima issues
    (Ghoddusi et al., 2019). ANNs have been applied to short-term energy load forecasting,
    where they have outperformed traditional methods due to the highly nonlinear characteristics
    of short-term prediction. Able to approximate functions regardless of non-linearity
    and without prior knowledge of functional form, ANNs also perform consistently
    across variation in time intervals (Raza and Khosravi, 2015). Deep learning The
    problems where deep learning outperform traditional machine learning techniques
    are those involving very large quantities of data. Deep learning has proven to
    be very successful for high-dimensional datasets with very noisy data problems,
    such as image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition
    (LeCun et al., 2015). As a large quantity of data is typically required to train
    deep networks, problems where limited data is available may be unsuitable for
    this approach. Working with large datasets, in addition to the increased computational
    complexity of deep ANNs, often results in longer training and processing times,
    which are of particular concern for real-time applications (Aggarwal, 2018d).
    Deep learning requires a higher standard of hardware than many other methods.
    As with most machine learning techniques, deep learning is a black box approach.
    Deep learning has been shown to improve upon conventional open shortest path first
    (OSPF) protocol for packet routing in telecommunications. With network traffic
    becoming increasingly complex, deep learning offers a smart strategy that is capable
    of considering multiple network parameters, outperforming traditional routing
    methods that consider only a single network parameter. Deep learning techniques
    can reduce overall packet loss rate and average delay per hop (Mao et al., 2017).
    SVM While both ANN and SVM can solve the nonlinear problems, SVM only requires
    a small quantity of data to do so Mat Daut et al. (2017). SVM methods are able
    to effectively handle data with both high degrees of uncertainty and heterogeneity.
    SVM classifiers typically run at good speeds (Ghoddusi et al., 2019). SVM is a
    black box approach, so the intrinsic relations between inputs and outputs cannot
    be completely known. SVM has limited tolerance for noisy data or data with missing
    values, and can be susceptible to overfitting (Ghoddusi et al., 2019). SVM methods
    have performed consistently well in load and demand forecasting for the energy
    sector. In many energy forecasting scenarios, SVM techniques have consistently
    yielded lower mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values than other machine
    learning methods, including ANNs (Mat Daut et al., 2017). The focus on empirical
    risk minimisation, rather than the “expert rules” learning technique of ANNs,
    enables SVM models to achieve accurate load forecasting in a relatively short
    time (Hong, 2009). RF RFs are a versatile method, able to handle binary features,
    categorical features, and numerical features. There is very little pre-processing
    that needs to be done for RFs. The data does not need to be rescaled or transformed.
    RFs are able to handle noisy datasets, as well as those with missing values (Ye
    et al., 2020). RFs do not suffer from overfitting, and are the fastest tree-based
    technique (Ghoddusi et al., 2019). RF is another black box approach. RF’s execution
    time, though typically low, can significantly increase with large volumes of data
    (Song et al., 2017). RFs for large datasets can also take up large amounts of
    memory. RFs outperformed numerous other machine learning classifiers in the modelling
    of travel mode choice. The high accuracy of tree-based ensemble classifiers indicates
    that the flexibility which is obtained by combining multiple trees is particularly
    useful for modelling transport choice. The dominance of RF over other tree-based
    classifiers can be attributed to the larger diversity among the learned trees
    of RF, which is a result of the RF’s procedure for randomised splitting at nodes
    (Hagenauer and Helbich, 2017). K-means K-means is a scalable, rapid, and simple
    learning algorithm, able to handle large quantities of data (Taherkhani and Pierre,
    2016). The simplicity of K-means comes at the cost of high sensitivity to initialisation
    — the user must provide a number of clusters without necessarily knowing what
    an effective number of clusters will be. K-means can also struggle with clusters
    of a ‘non-convex’ nature (Kubat, 2017c). K-means clustering has been effectively
    applied to data congestion control in VANETs. A closed-loop congestion control
    strategy utilised K-means to cluster the messages, with a control unit then determining
    parameters for each cluster, which are sent to vehicles stopped at intersections.
    This approach outperforms numerous existing methods, reducing packet loss ratio,
    average delay, and collision probability. This strategy also increased average
    throughput and packet delivery ratio considerably (Taherkhani and Pierre, 2016).
    6.3. Analysis The structure of this analysis is based on a framework proposed
    by Sharifi, which consists of 11 qualities with associated evaluation criteria
    (Sharifi, 2019). This framework is concerned not only with innovative solutions,
    but effective implementation, which is often dependent on recognising the interconnections
    between systems and the interdisciplinary nature of work in cities and infrastructure
    (Szpilko, 2020). Two additional criteria, comparison and vulnerability, have been
    added to the original framework in order to align the analysis with AI in infrastructure.
    Table 8 outlines how each criterion relates to infrastructure systems, as well
    as the extent to which each is satisfied by the overall body of research covered
    by this paper. Criteria with limited coverage would benefit from greater consideration
    in future research in this field; this is explored more in a later section on
    further work. Where possible, examples of a paper that meets the description of
    the criterion to a high degree are provided, as are examples which show a low
    level of sophistication in regard to a criterion, but do not neglect it entirely.
    Table 8. Analysis framework (Zhang and Zhu, 2018, Yeh and Huang, 2014, Casas et
    al., 2017, Lv et al., 2021, Rodrigues et al., 2019, Alawe et al., 2018, Doğan
    and Akgüngör, 2013, Ekpenyong et al., 2009, Lu et al., 2019, Guo and Zhao, 2015,
    Zaidi et al., 2018, Antunes et al., 2018, Mocanu et al., 2016, Wu et al., 2020,
    Samadi et al., 2017, Aydin et al., 2013, Balevi and Gitlin, 2017, Gu et al., 2020,
    Ye et al., 2020, Vashishth et al., 2019, Meti et al., 2017, Yin and Zhao, 2016).
    6.3.1. Comprehensiveness There are examples of work in the field of infrastructure
    that consider a spectrum of influencing variables, with site selection research
    yielding some of the best. One example, investigating wind farm location, applied
    a total of 28 evaluation criteria across six dimensions: safety and quality, economy
    and benefit, social impression, environment and ecology, regulation, and policy
    (Yeh and Huang, 2014). Another example is the site selection of electric vehicle
    charging stations, which also made use of fuzzy logic and considered 11 sub-criteria
    within economic, social, and environmental sectors (Guo and Zhao, 2015). In contrast,
    much of the work on forecasting considers only historical data of the same kind.
    While this will reflect a number of indicators, the research does not seek to
    identify them or quantify their contribution or significance. This means that
    should economic, social, environmental or other factors fluctuate outside of the
    range of what was experienced in training data, forecasts maybe be inaccurate.
    While systems with large volumes of training data will be less susceptible to
    fluctuations outside of the training range, this method, seen often in demand
    forecasting, remains limited in comprehensiveness. An exception is transport energy
    demand forecasting, where a variety of socio-demographic indicators have been
    considered, including vehicle ownership levels and fuel prices (Geem, 2011, Al-Ghandoor
    et al., 2012, Murat and Ceylan, 2006). One area that shows significant range in
    variable comprehensiveness is network routing. While some approaches seek to optimise
    a single variable, typically network congestion or delay (Tang et al., 2019),
    other work has incorporated 12 inputs, including buffer occupancy and success
    ratio (Sharma et al., 2018), and sought to account for multiple noise parameters
    (Barbancho et al., 2007). 6.3.2. Stakeholder engagement Engagement through participatory
    approaches in infrastructure AI research has been scarce, with only a handful
    of instances discovered. Participatory approaches have been extended to include
    consultation with stakeholders in this context. A paper trying to assess QoE in
    telecommunication end-users combined a passive monitoring tool with a feedback
    application in participants’ smartphones. In total, around 700 instances of feedback
    were recorded, which helped to establish relationships between QoE and several
    other performance indicators, such as length of session (Casas et al., 2017).
    This approach shows significant potential and could be incorporated in customer
    churn prediction, which is heavily linked to user experience. Other examples of
    stakeholder engagement have been limited to consultation for the purpose of evaluating
    social indicators, such as consulting local residents during wind farm site selection
    (Yeh and Huang, 2014). 6.3.3. Context-sensitivity Many techniques explored in
    this paper have been applied to particular contexts, as the complex nature of
    tools such as machine learning often makes then unsuitable to broad circumstances.
    Several papers have chosen to frame their findings in a context-specific way through
    the use of case studies (Azadeh et al., 2014, Aydin et al., 2013, Xu et al., 2019a,
    Zhang et al., 2017), although it is worth noting that often no adaptation has
    been done to the method, rather a specific dataset has been used. The best examples
    of context-sensitive research in this field incorporate context at the method
    level. In one case, time-series data was combined with textual data for taxi demand
    prediction in event areas. The authors utilise online information regarding event
    scheduling at venues within the study area, recognising that this is likely to
    influence local taxi demand (Rodrigues et al., 2019). 6.3.4. Strategic needs Despite
    the high relevance of many strategic plans to infrastructure systems, minimal
    research to date has taken a strategic viewpoint. Much of the work covered in
    this review could be used to inform policy or strategy, rather than the inverse
    of research being informed by strategy. A contributing factor may be the discrepancies
    in geographic scale, with a substantial quantity of research focused on specific
    applications or individual systems at a local level, while strategic plans often
    take a broader approach and deal with significant geographic areas and/or multiple
    systems. That is not to say that opportunities do not exist to incorporate strategy
    in this type of work. In one example, an effort was make to predict the impact
    of railway development policy on road casualties in Turkey (Doğan and Akgüngör,
    2013). Though not aligned with any stated strategic goal, a substantial body of
    recent work in telecommunications pertains to the widespread transition towards
    5G (Li et al., 2017, Fernández Maimó et al., 2018, Alawe et al., 2018, Le et al.,
    2018, AlQerm and Shihada, 2017, Balevi and Gitlin, 2017). 6.3.5. Uncertainty management
    While supervised machine learning has proven its effectiveness in a wide range
    of applications, other approaches may be needed to deal with the increasing uncertainty
    that comes with larger and more interconnected systems (Qi et al., 2017). Treating
    uncertain indicators as fuzzy parameters allows them to be considered alongside
    more concrete variables, with the probabilistic nature of this approach allowing
    levels of uncertainty to be considered. This has been effectively applied to variables
    in the selection of sites for assets such as wind turbines (Azadeh et al., 2014)
    and car parks (Sasan et al., 2018). Where uncertainties are in outputs, unsupervised
    learning can assist in identifying relationships and clusters in a given dataset
    without prior knowledge of any links between data. This has been exploited for
    numerous infrastructure applications. Reinforcement learning is an inherently
    iterative approach, thus lends itself well to dealing with uncertainty, and has
    seen increased uptake in recent years. Applications have included improving energy
    efficiency in vehicles (Qi et al., 2017) and routing in telecommunication networks
    (Yu et al., 2018). 6.3.6. Interlinkages and interoperability As infrastructure
    networks can be considered a ‘system of systems’, interlinkages are an important
    part of infrastructure research. However, possibly due to the high level of subject-specific
    research and the limited extent of research that is broad in nature, the body
    of work in this review is very restricted in its consideration of interlinkages
    and interoperability. The limited recognition of relationships and dependencies
    between systems is evident in a review of the water–energy nexus (Zaidi et al.,
    2018). Despite this nexus representing a significant overlap in systems, few papers
    sit in this region, and those that do are often very subject-specific, and thus
    typically deal with a narrow range of indicators. Perhaps the only other significant
    area of interconnectivity research is the junction of energy and transport, where
    several papers have looked at the energy demands of transport (Geem, 2011, Al-Ghandoor
    et al., 2012, Murat and Ceylan, 2006), and other have considered the integration
    of electric vehicles into the smart grid (Rigas et al., 2015). 6.3.7. Temporal
    changes As one of the most extensively researched purposes, forecasting of various
    variables has been studied across a wide range of temporal scales and resolutions.
    Illustrating the temporal scalability achieved by research to date, one paper
    predicting energy consumption at building level was able to produce forecasts
    for 15 min, hourly, daily, weekly, or yearly intervals, at resolutions ranging
    from one minute to weekly, using 47 months of sampled data (Mocanu et al., 2016).
    In different sectors, forecasting across a span of several years is not uncommon.
    Additional temporal elements to consider are training and operating speeds, which
    are particularly pertinent to real-time applications. Papers addressing time-sensitive
    tasks should explicitly consider their method’s run time, in addition to accuracy,
    as an indicator of performance. While the trade-off between complexity and running
    speed warrants consideration, it is worth noting that improvements in hardware,
    bandwidth, data transmission speeds, and cloud computing make the adoption of
    AI more feasible than ever (Stojanovic et al., 2019). 6.3.8. Flexibility The vast
    majority of models can be adapted to a range of conditions, provided adequate
    training data is available. A change in conditions may include a new geographic
    location, increased or decreased significance of input variables, or changing
    relationships between input variables. Flexibility goes hand in hand with feasibility
    for machine learning, as computational expense increases with the complexity of
    the model. In terms of scalability, the forecasting undertaken by machine learning
    tools for infrastructure purposes has spanned a range of geographic areas. For
    example, energy demand has been estimated both at building level (Robinson et
    al., 2017, Mocanu et al., 2016) and for the whole urban area of Sydney (Johannesen
    et al., 2019). Research in the field of telecommunication networks, which are
    increasingly moving away from hardware and towards software-defined architectures,
    recognises the need to consider scalability in a range of applications (Zorzi
    et al., 2015), including intrusion detection (Zhang and Zhu, 2018, Abubakar and
    Pranggono, 2017), QoT (Samadi et al., 2017) and traffic forecasting (Alawe et
    al., 2018). It is worth noting that other areas of AI face different issues with
    flexibility and scalability. In knowledge representation, for example, structuring
    large quantities of concepts, relationships, and interdependencies is a significant
    challenge. 6.3.9. Feasibility Machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning
    methods requiring large datasets, have the potential to be very computationally
    expensive. While model accuracy is important, run-speed, especially as compared
    to alternative techniques, is often also a very significant factor (Bui et al.,
    2020). While a few papers allude to such reasons as justification for selecting
    one method over another, feasibility is rarely considered beyond this, with no
    research reviewing the feasibility of a proposed method in a systematic or quantitative
    sense. While feasibility can include financial viability, applications dealing
    with physical infrastructure can often experience other concerns. In the selection
    of renewable energy sites, for example, exposure to energy source and appropriate
    ground conditions are crucial for providing adequate energy generation, while
    public support can be key to getting projects approved. These variables can be
    quantified, and included as inputs in the site selection process (Aydin et al.,
    2013). As regards technical feasibility, one of the core requirements of machine
    learning systems is access to sufficient training datasets. 6.3.10. Presentation
    and communication As journal or conference papers were selected for this review,
    the quality of written communication was high across the board. A range of figures
    and graphs were used to aid understanding, with comparative studies often using
    graphical methods to highlight the differences between different models or techniques
    (Casas et al., 2017). As mentioned earlier, a substantial number of papers also
    used case studies to demonstrate their findings. 6.3.11. Comparison The papers
    reviewed, particularly those that fall into the category of machine learning,
    encompass a large range of models, many of which seek to outperform traditional
    methods. In order to demonstrate a solution is effective, many papers have either
    compared their work against existing models or set out to find the best method
    out of several contenders, using variables such as accuracy, speed, and sensitivity
    to judge performance (Casas et al., 2017, Hagenauer and Helbich, 2017). An important
    caveat to this is that comparative indicators have been overwhelmingly technical
    in nature. While this is a valuable gauge of ability, there are also economic
    indicators, such as set-up and operating costs, and planning or governance concerns,
    such as compliance with regulations and the ease of training others to use a model,
    that, while beyond the scope of many engineering papers, must be considered if
    there is to be widespread uptake of these methods in government and industry.
    It is worth recognising that, in order for comparison to be accurate, the dataset
    being used should be as similar as possible for each model and of a substantial
    enough size to be representation. The vast majority of papers attempting comparison
    give each method an identical dataset, which can span significant geographic and
    temporal ranges. Examples include forecasting for entire cities or regions (Ren
    et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017), and accident prediction based on years, or
    even decades, of data (Murat and Ceylan, 2006). 6.3.12. Vulnerability The vulnerability
    of infrastructure systems concerns their susceptibility to both deliberate attacks
    and a variety of accidental causes of failure. As detailed earlier in this review,
    numerous papers have applied AI to the purpose of security. The field of telecommunications
    has been at the forefront of this research, utilising a range of machine learning
    tools in the detection of intrusion attacks, network anomalies, and denial-of-service
    attacks (Meti et al., 2017, Abubakar and Pranggono, 2017, Tang et al., 2016).
    While papers concerned with non-deliberate system failure are often less explicit
    in their discussion of vulnerability, it could be reasoned that there are far
    more variables contributing to accidental failure, making the breadth of this
    research much greater. There are specific instances of research focusing on non-deliberate
    failures, including the use of machine learning techniques for fault diagnosis
    in high-speed rail (Yin and Zhao, 2016). The fact that supervised machine learning
    techniques rely heavily on access to comprehensive training data is important
    in the discussion of vulnerability. The question of how to react to rare events,
    which occur so infrequently that their presence in existing data is sparse, is
    one that is crucial to the prevention of potential system failure. Several papers
    have approached this by teaching a model the normal state of a network and setting
    a threshold beyond which behaviour is considered abnormal and flagged (Ashraf
    and Latif, 2014). Other techniques have begun to be developed (Veres and Moussa,
    2019), although more work in this area would be beneficial, particularly outside
    of the field of telecommunications. 6.3.13. Action-oriented approach While a number
    of papers have presented frameworks (Bedi and Toshniwal, 2019, Wang et al., 2016),
    and others have offered case studies as practical examples (Xu et al., 2019a,
    Azadeh et al., 2014), no papers reviewed in this work have included a formal action
    plan for system-wide implementation. It is worth noting, however, that much of
    the research described in this paper has been conducted in very specific fields
    or on small scales. Therefore, while findings may well be relevant to those creating
    action plans, they are not typically of a large enough scale to warrant the proposal
    of a plan independently. 6.3.14. Summary Infrastructure systems are inherently
    complex, and so it is promising that elements contributing to complexity – uncertainty
    management, interlinkages, vulnerability, and flexibility – have all been developed
    to some extent in the reviewed work. This provides a strong foundation upon which
    researchers can build, to progress the implementation of AI across increasingly
    complex networks in towns and cities. It is evident that some of the beneficial
    characteristics of AI are reflected in the areas in which the literature is well
    developed. Perhaps the best example is reinforcement learning which, as a technique
    designed to learn the optimal strategy from interaction with an environment, is
    inherently very specific to context (Kubat, 2017b). It should also be noted that
    the significant majority of literature reviewed sits within the bracket of engineering
    or computer science. It can be argued that this contributes both to the strengths
    seen in this analysis and the areas in which there are gaps. Many of the solutions
    presented value a strong quantitative performance, demonstrating this over a range
    of geographic and temporal scales, at various degrees of granularity. There have
    been very effective attempts to incorporate numerous quantitative variables in
    models which have been outperformed traditional methods in many measurable ways.
    While this represents a significant strength, it is in the areas where it is more
    difficult to obtain such neat, measurable results, that the literature is less
    developed. The sections of analysis where performance is more qualitative – stakeholder
    engagement, strategic planning, feasibility, and action-orientated approach –
    are typically of greater concern to those in planning, business, governance, and
    policymaking. While engineers can offer accurate and effective solutions, it requires
    the co-operation and insight of those in other sectors to bring AI from research
    into large-scale, interconnected projects in the real world. In addition to limited
    consideration of non-engineering sectors during the design stage, the technical
    knowledge required to create and sustain AI-based solutions presents a significant
    barrier to implementation in many areas of industry. It has been noted that investment
    in people, skills, and processes is necessary for the widespread uptake of AI
    (Stojanovic et al., 2019). These gaps highlight the importance of collaboration
    with other disciplines, such as economics, planning, and politics, in order to
    include all of the perspectives necessary to design comprehensive solutions and
    achieve effective implementation of AI. 7. Further work This work was limited
    in scope to economic infrastructures. Further work could broaden this definition
    of infrastructure to explore the use of AI in, for example, solid waste, finance,
    agriculture and food networks, or in social infrastructures such as healthcare,
    education, arts and culture. This work also identified limited research at the
    intersections of different infrastructure sectors, something which could be further
    explored in future work. The criteria identified as having limited coverage in
    Table 8 would benefit from further consideration in future research. For example,
    having identified a gap in literature that takes an action-orientated approach,
    future work could seek to bring together the findings of research covered in this
    paper to suggest areas where it can inform action plans and guide policy. This
    could look to bridge the gap between research in this field and the governance
    of infrastructure systems. Similarly, this research recognises that, while technical
    developments in AI have led to significant improvements in the accuracy of solutions,
    there remains a lack of focus on the feasibility of potential interventions. Future
    work may wish to explore the possibilities and limitations of AI in infrastructure
    systems through this lens, perhaps by exploring the financial, technical, and
    regulatory requirements of implementing AI-based techniques in different geographies
    and economies. 8. Conclusion This paper reviews the applications of AI across
    the economic infrastructure sectors of energy, water and wastewater, transport,
    and telecommunications. The main purposes to which AI has been applied are system
    provision, forecasting, routing, monitoring and security, and quality assessment
    and improvement. AI methods are increasing in popularity and capacity, with deep
    learning and CNNs examples of recent developments in this field. The application
    of AI to infrastructure is also likely to continue to grow as infrastructure systems
    becoming increasingly instrumented and digitalised, providing data for AI tools.
    Most of the existing research in infrastructure utilises machine learning methods,
    with other branches of AI explored less extensively. It is worth recognising that
    many applications of machine learning employ supervised learning and require access
    to some degree of historical data. The availability of such data may account for
    differences in research across sectors, with machine learning widely applied to
    forecasting of energy demand, but less so to water or transport demand. Although
    supervised learning methods dominate, unsupervised and reinforcement learning
    approaches have seen greater utilisation in more recent works, and the new field
    of deep learning has proven effective in instances concerned with large volumes
    of data. Sensor networks are beginning to be recognised as a potential architecture
    for intelligent infrastructure systems through the ‘Internet of Things’. However,
    if they are to see widespread use, further research in knowledge representation
    will be needed. Ontologies and semantic approaches have been proposed, but rarely
    incorporated into larger artificially intelligent systems. Robotics is another
    branch of AI that is yet to be fully exploited in infrastructure. While the potential
    of fully autonomous robots in several infrastructure environments has been identified,
    existing robots in reported infrastructure research are largely short of autonomous.
    Some of the most exciting examples of intelligent robots in infrastructure to
    date incorporate computer vision or machine learning techniques, and other sectors
    could benefit from research into inspection of water and electrical infrastructure
    by AUVs and UAVs respectively. While research covered in this review ranges in
    comprehensiveness, AI techniques such as fuzzy logic allow input variables with
    uncertainties to be incorporated into the various indicators included in comprehensive
    papers. The dependence of many machine learning tools on the training data available
    means that, provided sufficient data is available, they can be adapted to suit
    a range of temporal scales, geographic areas, and network sizes. The data-driven
    nature of such tools also allows for a context-driven approach, with case studies
    often used to demonstrate effectiveness. Where research is lacking, however, is
    in incorporating broader infrastructure targets. Minimal work has sought to account
    for strategic goals in the problem formulation stage, while no work to date has
    put together a structured action-plan based on its findings. Though AI has been
    effectively applied to a number of highly specific purposes, there remains work
    to be done to incorporate it into an interconnected systems approach. AI methods
    will have a valuable role to play in the burgeoning fields of distributed intelligence
    and the ‘Internet of Things’. Knowledge representation will prove significant
    as sensors from a wide range of networks will need to be structured within a complex
    and interconnected knowledge base. As sensor networks provide increasing volumes
    of data, edge networking is an attractive solution to scalability concerns, with
    machine learning methods able to convert vast amounts of data into small packets
    of information for transmission (Garofalo et al., 2020). AI techniques can reason
    from data provided by sensor networks in the absence of human operators, which
    can contribute to the development of autonomous anticipatory and self-healing
    networks. Such capabilities can massively improve network resilience under growing
    uncertainty and are needed if interconnected systems are to effectively respond
    to the pressures of increasing populations, digitalisation, and complexity. CRediT

  description: Wireless sensor network (WSN) is frequently being used for increasing
    the data collection and monitoring critical parameters. Major challenge in WSN
    design is achieving the better energy efficiency and latency considering the dynamic
    sink location. Lots of research has been done for improving the performance of
    WSN systems in wide range of applications. Prime goal of this paper is to evaluate
    the performance of WSN routing under the grid-based dynamic sink locations. Later
    the performance of various existing critical protocols is compared to route data
    over centralized server. Various applications of WSNs are tabulated along with
    the sensor utilization. The paper contributed in three passes. Initial contribution
    of this research is to identify the issues and limitations of present WSN communication
    technologies. The paper contributed to present a case study to discover the implications
    of dynamic sink routing for building protocol to extend network's lifetime. The
    effectiveness of several clustering-based WSN routing algorithms is first compared
    in this paper. After that, the protocol with the longest network life is put to
    the test under a grid-based dynamic sink routing scenario. The significance of
    clustering-based protocols for improving lifetime of the network is evaluated
    as case study. The clustering-based energy efficient protocol like low energy
    adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) and its different variants, PEGASIS, SEP,
    DEC, their variants, and so on, are compared in this paper. Various performance
    metrics like network delays, throughput, latency, energy consumption and network
    lifetime are defined for studying routing protocols. Significance of dynamic sink
    locations performance is evaluated for Enhanced Distributed Energy Efficient Clustering
    (EDEEC) protocol. Overall paper covers and reviewed many critical design aspects
    for WSN networks.

    PDF TOOLS SHARE Summary Wireless sensor network (WSN) is frequently being used
    for increasing the data collection and monitoring critical parameters. Major challenge
    in WSN design is achieving the better energy efficiency and latency considering
    the dynamic sink location. Lots of research has been done for improving the performance
    of WSN systems in wide range of applications. Prime goal of this paper is to evaluate
    the performance of WSN routing under the grid-based dynamic sink locations. Later
    the performance of various existing critical protocols is compared to route data
    over centralized server. Various applications of WSNs are tabulated along with
    the sensor utilization. The paper contributed in three passes. Initial contribution
    of this research is to identify the issues and limitations of present WSN communication
    technologies. The paper contributed to present a case study to discover the implications
    of dynamic sink routing for building protocol to extend network''s lifetime. The
    effectiveness of several clustering-based WSN routing algorithms is first compared
    in this paper. After that, the protocol with the longest network life is put to
    the test under a grid-based dynamic sink routing scenario. The significance of
    clustering-based protocols for improving lifetime of the network is evaluated
    as case study. The clustering-based energy efficient protocol like low energy
    adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) and its different variants, PEGASIS, SEP,
    DEC, their variants, and so on, are compared in this paper. Various performance
    metrics like network delays, throughput, latency, energy consumption and network
    lifetime are defined for studying routing protocols. Significance of dynamic sink
    locations performance is evaluated for Enhanced Distributed Energy Efficient Clustering
    (EDEEC) protocol. Overall paper covers and reviewed many critical design aspects
    for WSN networks. 1 INTRODUCTION The data on wireless sensor network (WSN) are
    forwarded through multiple nodes, through a gateway. The data are connected to
    other communication networks like cellular and web. Most of the existing WSN applications
    use the static sensor nodes. These sensor nodes gather data and communicate to
    sink nodes. The sink node is having responsibility to transfer these data to the
    further network. There are certain applications where it is possible to use the
    dynamic sink nodes. This paper presents the demonstration of the effects of dynamic
    sink over the network performance. The sink location is varied as per the grid-based
    locations and the performance is evaluated to find out the optimum routing and
    energy performance. The main motivation behind of designing the dynamic sink-based
    routing protocol is that the probability of change in topology due to addition
    of nodes or link failure in scable network scenario. The dynamic sink is useful
    in such cases. In recent times, WSN is extensively used for Internet of Things
    (IOT) based applications to provide global coverage. The major advantage of IOT-WSN
    is its global area coverage.1, 2 But the only concern is that these applications
    required availability of Wi-Fi connectivity for uses. Scalability and the wide
    coverage are major concern while designing the WSN for IOT uses. There is less
    work reported for designing scalable energy efficient IOT-WSN designs. Routing
    is the major research field for WSN design since around 70% of network energy
    is consumed during thus phase. There are two major requirements of any routing
    protocols. (1) Routing must be designed correctly such that all information packets
    reach to desired destinations. (2) Routing algorithms must be simple and capable
    of minimizing the network overheads. The major motivation behind routing protocols
    design is to improve the heterogeneity perforce of the algorithms, so that protocols
    can be efficiently used for the IOT networks with highly heterogeneous environment.
    Due to heterogeneous nature of sensor nodes, clustering is fusible to improve
    the performance. Clustering based methods3 minimizes energy consumption by efficient
    design of cluster formation, cluster head (CH) selection, and data transmission
    methodologies. Kandris et al.3 have presented the very brief survey of clustering
    based WSN routing protocols for improving the energy efficiency. In recent years
    WSNs attract researchers more due to its wide applications namely, in environment
    monitoring,1 dynamic sink location application in WSN,2 structure health monitoring,
    smart cities surveillance,3 weapon sensors for ships, military power control and
    intelligence, targeting systems, industrial automation,4 and precision agriculture
    (PA)5.6 Lakshmi et al.6 have presented the good study of the various IOT sensors
    utilization for improving the productivity of the PA in India. Their main fuscous
    was to study designing of energy efficient routing protocol for IOT uses. Verma
    et al.7 have presented the IOT based applications to secure digital locker designs.
    They have demonstrated the good use of IOT technology for securing the digital
    lockers. Thus, it is clear from the above discussion that IOT has wide scope and
    there is high time to research on IOT performance improvement. Scalability, heterogeneity
    reliability, energy efficiency, and security are the major concerns while designing
    the routing protocols for the IOT based WSN design. IOT is future generation technology,
    and it is expected that in the future, more sensors node will be accumulated to
    the network, thus routing protocol for IOT use must be dynamic. In the IOT based
    WSN due to energy constraints there is always a risk of topology change and network
    architecture is dynamic. The above applications are chosen here as they cover
    the huge range of the sensors and are directly associated to the wealth, health,
    and security of human life. These ranges of WSN applications are exponentially
    growing in last decade. There is huge range of sensors used for the different
    control and monitoring applications in all of these mentioned sectors. This paper
    is focused to cover various technical aspects and challenges required to design
    the WSN networks. Various abbreviations for the current paper are presented in

    Ratio 1.1 Contribution of work The major contributions of the paper are as follows.
    Since efficiency and range of WSN primarily depends on the sensor utilization
    and routing methodology. Therefore, this paper contributes to identify the challenges
    and limitations of existing works of WSN communication technologies5-16 and designing
    energy efficient routing protocols based on brief survey. As a major contributions
    paper presents the case study to identify the effects of dynamic sink locations
    for designing protocol for prolonging network life. The paper first compares the
    performance of various clustering based WSN routing protocols. Then protocol with
    the best network life is tested over grid based dynamic sink scenario. Major challenges
    in WSN designs achieving higher accuracy, energy efficiency and with the prolonged
    life of WSN applications specific to IOT design along with future scope are discussed.
    The paper also presets scope for open future research. 1.2 Significance of survey
    There are huge verities of WSN methodologies exist in the literature. Therefore,
    it is of great significance to preset the challenges and limitations of these
    methods. Three major significances of paper are as follows: In the first part
    of the paper, various WSN communication technologies are reviewed used for short-
    and long-range communications addressing challenge and limitations. In second
    part, special separate review is presented for the IOT as an emerging technology
    to design low cost WSN solutions to real time problems. Increasing network traffic
    consumes more energy for routing the information. Finally, in the third part the
    paper presents survey of energy efficient design for WSN routing protocols designed
    with better latency, for improving network lifetime and identifying excising limitations.
    It is observed that with increasing node density it is efficient to use grid based
    dynamic sink-based routing. As Enhanced Distributed Energy Efficient Clustering
    (EDEEC) performs better in terms of energy distribution. The paper addressed the
    significance of preferring the EDEEC protocol over other clustering approaches.
    To justify the statement performance comparison is presented as case study for
    dynamic sink scenario. 1.3 WSN applications Summary of wide range of WSN applications
    including IOT networks and sensors utilizations are given in Table 2. The sensors
    mentioned in this study cover the huge range of applications but only most frequent
    and relevant applications are shortlisted in Table 2. Most widely used IOT application
    fields of the WSN are given in Figure 1. Therefore, from Table 2 it is clear that
    there is vast scope of WSN in different crucial applications where humans cannot
    be there for whole time. Even there are some applications where humans cannot
    even stand. Different application needs separate set of sensors, thus may need
    different communication technologies also. There are certain applications of the
    WSN recently have motivated the uses of dynamic sink as explored by the Ahmad
    et al.2 These applications of dynamic sink include healthcare monitoring systems,
    monitoring seismic activities, enemy surveillance, and monitoring systems. TABLE

    Frequently used Internet of Things (IOT) applications of the wireless sensor network
    (WSN) networks at a glance Faheem et al.8 has presented the good review of smart
    Grid communication technologies used in WSN designs. They have proposed various
    routing and standards to establish the communication among the sensor nodes utilized
    to design the smart grids based WSN networks. 1.4 Sensors used in WSN There wide
    verities of the sensors have been used in WSN literature as presented in Table
    2 for physical parameter monitoring. Air quality sensors are used for the environmental
    monitoring and pollution control. Temperature sensors are widely used for applications
    like Industrial automation and control, home automation and appliances, forest
    management, and environmental monitoring. The most frequently used cost-effective
    sensors modules compatible to various interface boards are presented in Figure
    2. These sensors cover almost all rage of the applications given in Table 2. The

    modules used for measuring and monitoring the moisture, temperature, humidity,
    and the air quality respectively. These sensors are widely used for the environmental
    monitoring and widely for the smart agriculture application. FIGURE 2 Open in

    these sensors cover the wide range of WSN applications. 2 COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES
    FOR WSN WSN has become an industry for modern data communication and seeking cost
    effective technology solutions for improving the production rates and enhancing
    the WSN standards. The classification of the broad WSN based on short range hardware
    and long-distance connectivity technologies used for sensor node designing and
    communication options as given in Figure 3. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Classification of the Internet of Things (IOT) based wireless sensor network (WSN)
    technologies There are various technologies including Bluetooth, BLE, RFID, Zigbee,
    LoRa and GSM to be interfaced to IOT network for data connectivity. WSN have been
    implemented in various applications using different communication technologies.
    Shafi et al.17 have presented a good study of the sensor network and various communication
    technologies used in Precision Agriculture application. Hughes et al.18 have designed
    a WSN application for noise monitoring system using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
    communication technology. They have reported the maximum transmission with BLE
    up to 15 m. BLE offers very low 2.69-mW power consumption at approximate 2.8-V
    supply thus is energy efficient. Wixted et al.19 have presented the description
    of the LoRa (Long Range) and its version LoRA-WAN with working and testing method
    for WSN implementation. Due to its low power consumption and wide range of coverage
    LoRa offers advantage over its other cutting-edge technologies. Only limitation
    is its low bandwidth of 433 MHz. Bertoldo et al.20 have analyzed the feasibility
    of the public transport network using the LoRa module. They suggested LoRa as
    the ad-Hoc network solution in urban areas. In Zareei et al.21 Wibree is used
    which consumes ultra-low power like Bluetooth. As Bluetooth extension Wibree offers
    maximum data rates of 1 Mbps up to 5- to 10-m distances at the 2.45-GHz band.
    Wibree compared to Bluetooth does not opted frequency hopping for interference
    avoiding. It offers the variable-packet lengths instead of fixed length. Wibree
    is also implemented with AES (Advanced Encryption standard) security algorithm.
    But it is not applicable to many industrial applications due to short range. Bingqing
    and Zhixin22 have compared the performance of the two wireless communication technologies
    as ZigBee and the HART for application in sensors network. The application was
    WPAN at IEEE-802.15.4 the ZigBee has used but for industrial applications of WPAN
    the HART is used. Sheu et al.23 have explained the application of the 6LoWPAN
    protocol in the end-to-end use of WSN application. Efficiency of the any WSN network
    depends on the efficiency of the communication technology being used; thus, it
    must be carefully selected. The summary of communication technologies is given

    literature it is mentioned that, technologies like Zigbee and LoRa techniques
    consumes less power and have significant range for utilizing in the WSN parameter
    monitoring application. But these technologies are not suitable for the long-range
    connectivity; options are Wi-Fi or GSM. 3 CHALLENGES OF WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS
    In addition to the common issues of mobility in WSN, network disconnection, limited
    power supply, and so on, the sensor network has many other distinctive challenges.
    These challenging issues have been sequentially addressed in this section: Limited
    Communication Capability: The WSN in most of consumer uses has a limited communication
    bandwidth even it is dynamic in nature, and this limits the communication coverage
    to 10–100s of meters only. The major issue is whenever load is higher due to bandwidth
    limitation communication of sensor frequently disconnected. The sensor disconnected
    may lead the network to be offline for long time. Maintaining the communication
    and connectivity to complete quality transmission of the sensor data with available
    limited bandwidth is one of open research challenge. Limited Power and Energy
    of WSN: The sensor gets power from the batteries and thus power is extremely limited.
    Any sensor of WSN becomes dead often due to low source energy. As there is limited
    work over the battery power optimization therefore more emphasis is to design
    an energy efficient WSN. This is a serious challenging issue of current sensor
    networks. One field of research is wireless charging of transceiver power supplies
    of the WSN to fulfill the connectivity of sensor networks Prakash and Saroj.32
    Sensors transmit information more power than performing calculations. The power
    required to sense transmission of 1-bit information is sufficient to perform 3000
    calculation instructions. How to save energy and maximize life cycle of WSN network
    in the process is still a challenge. Limited computing power: Sensor nodes in
    WSN networks have an embedded processor and memory. These sensors have the computing
    power to do some information processing. However, because of limited capacity
    and ability of the embedded processors and on-board memories, the ability to manage
    sensors is also limited. The utilization of the large number of sensors with limited
    available computing power for collaborative and distributed information processing
    is also still challenging. The network is dynamic: The nature of the sensor networks
    is extremely dynamic. The sensor node is the object of interest, and the data
    observer within the WSN network may be mobile phones, and new nodes frequently
    join or existing nodes may fail. Thus, the WSN network topologies changes dynamically,
    and routing pathway between the sensor, the apparent object, and the observer
    may also changes. Networks must be reconfigurable and capable of self-tuning.
    Large-scale distributed triggers: Many WSN systems require controlling the physical
    evident sources or objects Viz. temperature control. Thus, numerous sensors consist
    of controlling software''s and devices. The network control devices and software
    are termed as trigger. Designing many dynamic trigger-based management systems
    are still a very challenging problem of research. 4 STUDY OF IOT BASED WSN NETWORKS
    An IOT can be considered as network of sensing devices, which can communicate
    the information acquired from field of concern and communicate it through WSN
    to cloud server. Aggregation of data in IOT such as WSNs is very important, because
    in IOT we have different type of data fetched from different sources and much
    amount of energy is required in order to send the sensed data.33-35 Our work in
    this section is to review the WSN parameter monitoring at physical layer of the
    IOT networks. Second layer is network layer most important for communication setup
    and is responsible for routing. The prime goal at this layer is to design the
    energy efficient reputing protocol for soil sensing. The third layer is platform,
    which is cloud for IOT here. Finally, data in the network comes on the application
    layer which sensors parameter monitoring is taken care. Various state of art research
    has been done in the field of the IOT by using the cellular mobile communication
    technologies36-40 like Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G, and 5G. Ahmed et al.37 have studied various
    IOT based smart environments and the respective research challenges. They have
    considered the research in the field of various environments such as smart city,
    smart home, smart grids, smart industries, and smart health. They have used the
    cellular wireless communication protocols for 3G, 4G, and satellite communication
    technologies. Various IOT security and privacy issues are also evaluated. Krasniqi
    et al.38 have used the IOT for the smart autonomous and connected vehicles for
    the automotive applications. The DSRC and 5G, communicating technologies are sued
    for communication between cars and the infrastructures. Rani et al.39 have designed
    a protocol for the application of the IOT in the multimedia technologies. A cross
    layer protocol for IOT Multimedia Networks called IOMT is proposed and performance
    is evaluated based on the response time and the energy efficiency. They stated
    that response time should be less and energy efficiency must be higher. Many IOT
    networks have been designed for the agriculture specific applications41-45 abrogated
    here as Agriculture IOT (AG-IOT). Overall, the AG-IOT communication technologies
    can be used either for IOT sensor nodes or for the data over IOT network as shown
    in Figure 4. The communication via sensor nodes is short range and network needs
    to use long range communication. FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Classification
    of Internet of Things (IOT) communication technologies An overview of IOT technologies
    is presented especially for agriculture applications. Section have reviewed communication
    technologies and summarized that commonly used communication technologies are
    Sigfox and LoRa. Survey of the IOT in WSN is presented in Table 4. The range of
    the communication device, operating frequency, and WSN performance measures are
    used. The review of the IOT based sensors network are summarized in Table 4. It
    can be observed from the table that the LWPA is the widely used technology for
    long distance and used for the applications like smart city, and the smart agriculture
    and 5G cellular communications. The response time, data rates and the range of
    communications and cost are the major deciding factor for selection of the suitable
    IOT communication technology. TABLE 4. Summary of IOT based sensors networks Author

    Role of the data aggregation routing is to combine the data coming from different
    sensing units and transmit over the network.53, 54 Data aggregation also responsible
    to eliminate redundancy, reduce the number of transmission and by this way saves
    the energy.55 Clustering is frequently used method for increasing the energy efficiency
    of the WSN network. The aggregation protocol that is based on clustering in WSN
    maximize overall network lifetime by minimize the communication. The clustering
    put down the direct transmission to the base station (BS) by data aggregation
    as well as reduces the energy consumption by reducing the transmitting length.53
    The prime concern of the study is to address challenges in various clustering
    based WSN design and evaluating the performances of WSN, where WSNs are recognized
    as an efficient tool to collect and process data. 5.1 With or without aggregation
    There are many advantages of sung the aggregation in WSN design some of the advantages
    are addressed in Table 5. TABLE 5. Benefits of using aggregation in WSN design
    Concerns Without aggregation With aggregation Advantages This is applicable for
    all environments. The simple linear program can be used to solve the routing problem.
    The aggregation decreases the amount of data transmission. Disadvantages The energy
    consumption is higher due to large Number of transmissions. In aggregation to
    remove duplicate data energy consumption increases. In some cases, the aggregation
    and Clustering may be failed. Challenges Without aggregation there is a possibility
    of creation a cavity near the sink node. Chances of data losses also possible
    with high volume transmitted data. There is a different compression rate for different
    applications. Timing protocols Also required to maintain the order of asleep sensor
    nodes for energy conservation. It can be observed that energy conservation and
    lifetime improvement is the major concern of data aggregation in WSN. Although,
    there are chances of failures and increasing energy consumption in clustering
    and aggregation therefore it is required to design an energy efficient routing
    protocol. Therefore, designing energy efficient (EE) WSN is an open challenge,
    and WSN design is considered in two passes: (1) First, it is required to design
    energy efficient routing protocols so that overall life of the network can be
    improved. (2) Design an efficient sensor for monitoring the desired parameter
    according to the application needs. In this survey, various protocol literatures
    were studied to provide the direction to develop an energy efficient routing protocol.
    Existing protocol comparative analysis is also given that compare different clustering-based
    aggregation and protocols. There has been lot of work done to improve the energy
    and data aggregation efficiency of WSN networks. 5.2 Routing methodologies The
    routing methodologies based on network architecture and aggregation is classified
    as shown in Figure 5. Primarily routing protocols are classified as Flat, Hierarchical,
    Location based, Chain based, and Tree based. This paper describes the brief reviews
    the hierarchical routing methods and that too specific to clustering based approaches
    as marked be red color in the figure. FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Wireless sensor network (WSN) routing protocol methodologies and classification
    5.2.1 Flat method In this type of network, all sensor nodes attached with each
    other to do the sensing task. The query message is broadcasted to all the sensor
    nodes by the BS. The nodes which are related to query, transmit the data to the
    BS. Multi-hop path is used to transfer the data so the network delay is high.
    One limitation of this flat network architecture is that data aggregation is performed
    only in specific region near the sink node. This leads to faster discharge due
    to calculation overhead. One more problem is that if failure occurs at sink node,
    then overall network setup-go down.55 5.2.2 Hierarchical approach In this network,
    the task of routing depends on the CHs. The energy is saved by using clustering
    that minimize the energy consumption, increase the lifetime and scalability in
    sensor-based networks. In a cluster other sensor node sends the data to the CH
    that aggregate the data.55 5.2.3 Hierarchical clustering-based aggregation In
    this architecture the network allocates CH that is responsible for data aggregation.
    This method effectively reduces the energy consumption in the large WSN area.
    Low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) is a most popular cluster-based
    aggregation protocol. In LEACH protocol when CH fails, the node with higher energy
    is selected from the network to play the role of CH. There are various versions
    of the LEACH like EE-LEACH are provided that increase the lifetime of the network
    and decrease the energy consumption.56 LEACH-MAC,57 HEED,58 clustering in WSN
    algorithm59 are focused on energy efficient cluster-based routing. 5.2.4 Hierarchical
    chain-based aggregation In this network architecture, each and every sensor node
    of WSN is associated to its neighbor sensor nodes. To select the leader TOKEN
    method is used. It is beneficial over LEACH algorithm problem by reducing the
    overhead calculation of dynamic Clustering. The PEGASIS60 protocol is based on
    hierarchical chain-based routing. The SEP61 designed for election probability-based
    heterogeneity awareness. DEC62 are Distributed Energy Clustering based routing
    protocol. 5.2.5 Location based approach In this type of network method the global
    positioning system (GPS) is used to identify the location of wireless sensor nodes,
    based on that the task of aggregation is performed.63 To reduce the energy consumption
    the non-active nodes always be in sleep mode. SPAN protocol belongs to in this
    category. 5.2.6 Tree-based method In such type of network the task of data aggregation
    is done by creating data aggregation tree. This reduces the number of data transmission
    and increase the life of WSNs. The Center at Nearest (CNS), Shorter Path Tree
    (SPT), and Greedy Incremental Tree (GIT) are based on tree network protocol.64
    5.2.7 Hybrid approach In this type of method combination of different data aggregation
    techniques is used. For example, HADA is a hybrid data aggregation method using
    the I-LEACH is the improved method of LEACH that decreases the energy consumption.65
    5.2.8 Probability based There are various protocols uses the probability of nodes
    selection for routing. Wang et al.66 have presented WSN for soil monitoring for
    parameters namely, humidity and Soil Water Temperature (SWT). They have designed
    the sensor nodes placed under the fully underground conditions to collect the
    soil parameter measurements. These wireless nodes deliver the collected data wirelessly
    to the relay nodes placed above the ground. Relay node forwards the data to base
    node. They have used the probabilistic protocol architecture. 5.3 Survey of WSN
    routing protocols Parmar et al.67 have presented a good survey of the clustering-based
    protocol called LEACH. They have presented various improvements over the basic
    LEACH for the WSN uses including S-LEACH, R-LEACH, and LEACH-SM. A LEACH is a
    routing protocol defined as Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy and is used
    frequently for the WSNs. This protocol is used for conserving the energy (a) via
    aggregation and (b) through the adaptive clustering. It is found earlier that
    static clustering is inefficient for most of the cases thus it is required to
    design an efficient dynamic clustering method capable of adopting the environmental
    conditions. The main reasons to use network protocols are as follows: A node within
    the network dies and is no longer useful when its battery supply dies. A use of
    protocol permits us to slightly increase the nodes lifespan by allowing minimizing
    the energy that required transmitting data. Thus, it is required to develop the
    efficient protocol algorithm by using minimum energy concept. HE Bin and Hongtao68
    presented an energy optimization technique for the WSN. They have shown how the
    energy can be optimized in the WSNs. They used the Dijkstra shortage path algorithm
    for determining the optimal sequence of the transmission distance from the source
    nodes and sink nodes. But the method seems to be bit slow and conventional. Chagas
    et al.69 have proposed a method to localize a scheme for WSN using A-NN and the
    Genetic Algorithms (GAs). They proposed a WSNs design using A-NN as the artificial
    machine learning tool and GAs is opted for selecting the most suitable ANN structure
    but the method was too lengthy and was not feasible for real time applications
    like soil monitoring. Javaid et al.70 has developed an enhanced distributed energy-efficient
    clustering EDEEC protocol for heterogeneous WSN networks. In this paper, they
    proposed a novel clustering-based routing technique for heterogeneous WSNs. The
    method dynamically changes the probability of the CH election and therefore more
    efficient to Parmar et al.67 Smaragdakis et al.61 has proposed a Stable Election
    Protocol (SEP) in order to cluster the WSN. This method perfumes efficiently for
    clustering networks. Georgios Smaragdak is has proposed the first SEP, considering
    the heterogeneous clustering. Here node energy is assigned based on the weighted
    election probability. This method works efficiently for clustering the networks.
    Aderohunmu and Deng71 have proposed a modified clustering method using extended
    SEP protocol using three-tier architecture. They have improved the performance
    of the basic SEP protocol by introducing the intermediate nodes layer. Jagadeesh
    et al.72 have purposed to design n version of SEP using multi CH selection MCH-SEP
    approach. Method significantly performs better than the basic SEP. Sharma and
    Tiwari73 compared the performance of the SEP and the LEACH routing protocols.
    Singh et al.74 have designed a modified method for SEP protocol extension. There
    method was modification in terms of using the k means clustering for CH selection.
    Method significantly increases the performance over the SEP and E-SEP protocols.
    Aderohunmu et al.75 have first time designed the Distributed Clustering protocol
    for Energy Efficiency improvement called DEC. It was stated that DEC performs
    better than the SEP and LEACH protocol in terms of latency. But in terms of overall
    network life DEC died fasterthe major challenge in scalable WSN design is energy
    efficiency. The Distributed Energy Efficient Clustering (DEEC),76 Developed Distributed
    Energy Efficient Clustering (DDEEC)77 are the examples of heterogeneous networks.
    In this protocol describe the network model, that Assume there are N sensor nodes,
    which are uniformly distributed within an M*M square area which is intended too
    scalable. 5.4 Comparative study of the existing work In this section the summary
    of the comparative performances of the existing WSN routing protocols are presented
    in terms of network lifetime, latency, and heterogeneity. Performance comparison
    is shown in Table 6 for various clustering-based routing protocols. It can be
    observed from the table that E-DEEC protocol with distributed energy efficiency
    works better than the other stat of art protocols although there is greater scope
    of improvement in the performance as obtained in extension of SEP protocols in
    recent times. It is expected to improve the performance of the E-DEEC can be improved
    by increasing the concept of multi-level node distribution patterns. TABLE 6.

    the designing of scalable routing protocol for WSN. Zhong et al.86 have designed
    a scalable WSN network for downward protocol for the application in the field
    of the IOT. They presented a framework for the opportunistic source routing (OSR)
    for the downward routing for large scale scalable WSN. They have adopted the Blooms
    filter for the improvement in scalability of OSR method. El Khediri et al.87 have
    designed and reviewed the improved clustering-based method using the K-means clustering
    for WSN routing. Nandan et al.88 have designed an algorithm of several path-based
    routing implemented for the scalable WSN network. They have improved the efficiency
    of clustering-based routing for improving the performance for scalable WSN. They
    have addressed the major scalable WSN routing challenges as follows: Power Limitation:
    WSN node has limited battery power. Thus, for scalable routing the node battery
    power must be efficiently utilized. Congestion Issue: In a scalable WSN traffic
    density is large this causes the issue of node congestion and must be considered
    during routing. Capacity: Transmitting capacity of the nodes is limited due to
    bandwidth limitation. Sandhya and Sengottaiyan89 have presented the scalable framework
    for WSN routing protocol design, Sah and Amgoth90 have provided design the WSN
    using the cross-layer architecture based parametric evaluation. They have also
    presented the review of the various WSN attack methodologies also. Singh and Rishiwal91
    have addressed the issue of the scalability in the WSN routing protocols. They
    have evaluated the performance of the number of nodes versus CH counts for the
    different routing protocols under the network scalability. They have considered
    the dead nodes, CH counts, and FND as the evaluation parameters for maximum 1500
    rounds and varied number of nodes up to 1000. Paper gives good insight of WSN
    scalability. Elsmany et al.92 have presented the analysis of different variants
    of the LEACH protocol for the scalable energy efficient WSN routing. Shukla et
    al.93 have presented the three scenarios of WSN performance considering static
    nodes, dynamic nodes and scalable energy efficient protocol (SEEP) for the different
    routing protocols. They proposed that scenario 3 with SEEP performs better where
    the node is free to move within different zones. But as per the observation for
    the DEEC protocol SEEP approach performances are negative and have to be improved.
    Yadav and Kumar94 have presented an improvement in the scalability of the I-DEEC
    protocol. Maitra and Roy95 have presented the survey of the various MAC protocols
    for the comparative study of the WSN networks. Singh et al.96 has presented the
    new approach of heterogeneous energy efficient routing protocol using DEEC. Vançin
    and Erdem97 have designed a threshold balancing based TBSDEEC routing protocol
    for improving the heterogeneity of the network. They showed that proposed method
    is more energy efficient comparatively. But when the first node died all other
    nodes died faster thus last node died is relatively low. Khan et al.98 have designed
    the Hybrid DEEC based routing protocol for improving the energy performance of
    scalable WSN networks. Sheenam99 have designed the Gateway based DEEC multi-hop
    routing protocol called G-DEEC for WSN to increase Energy performance. Singh and
    Rishiwa100 designed a scalable routing algorithm in order to increase the network
    lifetime and energy efficiency for WSN. Similar contributions are presented in
    previous citations.101-103 7 IOT BASED ROUTING PROTOCOLS STUDY In this section
    a specific study of recent large scale and IOT networks based routing protocols
    are discussed. The routing protocols works at the network layer and is responsible
    for minimizing the network overhead during data sharing. Major concern in the
    IOT based protocols is to manage heterogeneity of sensors nodes within the network.
    El-Sayed et al.104 has proposed distributed clustering-based protocol for enhancing
    the lifetime of IOT network by improving the heterogeneity. The large-scale network
    is considered with wide network field area. Thus, this section presets a survey
    of specific work done for IOT based routing protocols. The IOT based future scopes,
    challenges, and limitation of WSN and routing protocols are tabulated in Table

    of dynamic sink location based WSN protocols for routing Implementing real time
    IOT Dynamic sink WSN routing Reducing consumption of energy, and speed of mobile
    sink is major challenge Maintaining the hot-spot limitation 8 CASE STUDY OF DYNAMIC
    SINK The major contribution of this paper is to find out the optimum dynamic movement
    of the single sink over the network field for improving the routing performance
    of the WSN. There are many ways of the sink mobility are possible as a specific
    case the static network is considered under the single sink mobility. In this
    paper as a case study the effects of the dynamic location of single sink is evaluated
    over static WSN network. The nine different sink locations as are considered as
    a grid shown in Figure 6. FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The dynamic
    sink locations considered in this study for evaluation The sink locations are
    considered as [(25,25), (25,50), (25,75), (50,25), (50,50), (50,75), (75,25),
    (75,50), (75,75)]. For the study, single sink with dynamic grid-based location
    is considered to find the optimum routing protocol. Performance of DEC, E-SEP,
    and EDEEC protocols are evaluated under the assumptions of given dynamic sink
    locations. The flow chart of the proposed dynamic sink-based routing evaluation
    is shown in Figure 7. It can be observed from Figure 7 that the method varies
    the sink location and evaluates the performance based on the mentioned sink locations.
    For the performance evaluation the EDEEC protocol is preferred as it is already
    observed that it performs better in terms of energy distribution. FIGURE 7 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Flow chart of the proposed dynamic sink Enhanced Distributed
    Energy Efficient Clustering (EDEEC) routing methodology 8.1 Mathematical modeling
    EDEEC protocol Enhanced DEEC based routing protocol is preferred for modeling
    the routing problem. Model introduced concept of Residual Energy (RE) and along
    with the two tire probabilities of normal, advance, and supper nodes. The EDEEC
    introduced the probabilities distribution by introducing an additional third tire
    as supper nodes. The number of advance nodes, supper nodes, and normal nodes counts
    are given as follows: (1) (2) (3) Probabilities of the CH selection corresponding
    to the Normal, advance and supper nodes are (4) (5) (6) The sink location is defied
    dynamically as (7) where and are the grid locations and is the number of sink
    location. For = 50 nJ/bit energy model as Referred by Priya81 to transmit number
    of bits, energy is defined as follows: (8) (9) where = d is the Euclidian distance.
    Initially, the performance of the existing routing protocols are compared in terms
    of the number of alive nodes plotted with respect to number of rounds for the
    assumption of static 100 nodes and 5000 rounds in Figure 8. FIGURE 8 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Performances of existing routing protocols for number of alive
    nodes with respect to number of rounds for 100 nodes and 5000 rounds All these
    protocols are clustering based protocols and are the variant of the Basic LEACH
    protocol and used for IOT applications. In recent times lot of work was proposed
    in literature to improve their lifetime performance.62, 72, 81 Thus, the paper
    first compares the lifetime performance of these protocols for WSN design to identify
    the best one in terms of network life time. Then dynamic sink performance is tested
    over the best lifetime protocol. It can be clearly observed from Figure 9 that
    EDEEC protocol performs much better in terms of the prolonged life of network.
    It is because approximately 50% nodes are alive up to 3000+ rounds with EDEEC
    protocol. While the DEC protocol network died faster once the first node is died.
    And performance of E-SEP protocol is also good under 2000 rounds comparatively.
    Therefore, this paper is focused to evaluate the dynamic sink location-based routing
    for the EDEEC protocol. FIGURE 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Number of alive
    nodes for the dynamic sink location for 100 nodes and 5000 rounds plotted for
    the Enhanced Distributed Energy Efficient Clustering (EDEEC) protocol It is clear
    from Figure 9 that varying sink location significantly affect the lifetime performance
    of WSN routing EDEEC protocols. The sink location at center of field or network
    with [0.5x, 0.5y] corresponding to sink 5 gives the better lifetime compared to
    all other cases. But during the intermediate rounds using the dynamic sink is
    advantageous to enhance the overall energy performance of routing WNS designs.
    Such as after 3600 nodes the sink 7 location performs the prolonged WSN lifetime
    performance. While during the intermediate rounds from 1400 to 2100 rounds the
    sink location 3 performs better as mentioned in Figure 9. This is much clearly
    observed from Table 8 where results are given for the First node died (FND) half
    node died (HND) and the Last Node died (LND) are compared for the EDEEC protocol
    for all 9 sink location. Best performance are shown by the red color marks in
    Table 8 for all categories. It can be observed and concluded from Table 8 that
    sink 5 perfoms better with 1017 nodes for FND and sink 3 performs second best
    with 1990 nodes for HND. Sink 7 performs best for HND, and sink 9 performs best
    for LND. The transection of the sink locations are clearly mention in Table 8
    as red color data. The performance of network routing is compared based on the
    FND and LND respectively shown in Table 7. Based on the evaluation the proposed
    dynamic sink movement path selected for the optimum WSN network performance is
    shown in Figure 10, where 1, 2, and 3 respectively represent the transaction of
    sink location at 1400, 2000, and 3600 rounds. TABLE 8. Evaluation of the lifetime

    dynamic sink movement path selected for the optimum wireless sensor network (WSN)
    network performance These sink trisections are considered corresponding to the
    evaluation of the number of alive nodes as shown in Figure 9 above The sink trisections
    lead to better network life and energy Especially during the middle phase of number
    of rounds between 14,400 and 36,000 rounds in between. The optimum sinks selection
    for evaluating the enhanced and stable energy and lifetime of the WSN networks
    is shown in Algorithm 1. As another case study the number of packets sent to BS
    are shown in Figure 11. Numbers of packets sent to the BS are plotted for the
    different dynamic sink location for 100 nodes and 5000 rounds. It can be seen
    from the figure that the sink location with {0.5x, 0.5y} out performs over other
    sink locations thus it is concluded from Figure 11 that using the dynamic sink
    location may leads to an assumption to number of packets transmitted may be reduced.
    In addition, the numbers of dead nodes are plotted for dynamic sink locations
    respectively and Figure 12. FIGURE 11 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Number
    of packets sent to the base station (BS) for different dynamic sink location for
    100 nodes and 5000 rounds FIGURE 12 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Number of
    dead nodes for the different dynamic sink''s location for 100 nodes and 5000 rounds
    It can be observed that energy efficiency of the network is inversely proportional
    to the number of dead nodes. The Sink 5 with location at center of network out
    performs over other locations but trisections of sink at location 1400, 2000,
    and 3600 rounds with minimum dead nodes is also justified from Figure 12. 9 PARAMETRIC
    SUMMARIES OF PROTOCOLS The comparison of the First node died (FND), 50% node died
    (HND), and the complete nodes died (LND) is given in graphical form in Figure
    13. The existing performance of the various routing protocols based on clustering
    are presented in Figure 13. FIGURE 13 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparative
    summaries of network lifetime achieved by existing clustering-based protocols
    It can be observed the in terms of the network life or LND the Distributed clustering
    based DEEC protocols performs better than other state of are protocols like LEACH,
    SEP, and DEC. Among all the protocols the EDEEC protocol performs significantly
    better in terms of life time. The lifetime is achieved three times greater in
    the EDEEC protocol compared to DEEC as shown in Figure 13. And compared to z-SEP
    the lifetime of EDEEC is 1.5 times more as observed in Figure 13. Thus, this paper
    proposes to improve latency performance of EDEEC protocol in future works. Significant
    improvement is observed by the EDEEC, in terms of measured HND and the LND over
    other protocols. Similarly, the performance comparisons of the various variant
    of the DEEC protocols are given in Figure 14. The DEEC is selected based on the
    comparison in previous Figure 13. EDEEC offered around 5 times improvement over
    DEEC for LND and around 3 times improvement in terms of FND. This was the main
    motivation for selecting the EDEEC protocol for case study of dynamic sink scenario.

    variant of Distributed Energy Efficient Clustering (DEEC) protocols 10 OPEN ISSUES
    AND CHALLENGES This paper presents study of various applications of sensors and
    routing protocols used in WSN design and issues and scope are identified. The
    major open issues for the recent WSN research are sequentially being addressed
    by providing survey in terms of certain questions. The open issues are considered
    for IOT-WSN based on the parameters consideration for measuring quality of service
    (QOS), recent applications of large area networks, designing of low energy clustering
    based WSN, designing a node clustering algorithm based on varying distance measures,
    based on optimization techniques, and at last scalability issues. Cluster of these
    open issues are given in Figure 15 and are sequentially addressed in this section.
    FIGURE 15 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Cluster of most essential open issues
    in Internet of Things wireless sensor network (IOT-WSN) What are recent applications
    of large area networks There are certain recent advanced applications of the WSN,
    which are not yet explored more. Rathi et al.114 has presented some grid-based
    routing application of the WSN. There is significant scope of work is possible
    in this direction. Katiyar et al.115 have stated that one of the most important
    concerns in next-generation networks is mobility. As WSNs become more important
    components of the future Internet, new models that facilitate mobility of these
    nodes must be investigated as open challenge. Omeed et al.116 have presented the
    various routing algorithms for the multicast routings. In the recent IOT based
    WSNs the multicast routing is a still challenge. Shakya et al.117 have pretested
    the future inclination of various WSN applications in underwater, underground,
    mobile and terrestrial WSN. The major issue in underwater WSN is to handle the
    large delay and higher node failure rate. The underground WSN (UG-WSN) suffers
    from the higher sensors cost. In these UGWSN has l sink node in addition is placed
    on the ground to forward data from sensors nodes thus these WSN needs additional
    battery backups. According to Rojina the multimedia WSN required more bandwidth
    and consumes higher energy. Sensors installed over unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)
    are examples of the mobile WSN used for surveillance purpose are not yet explored
    much. Bulbul et al.118 have presented a thorough examination of WSN''s upcoming
    tendencies in the realm of smart grids. Electric power generation, monitoring
    and measuring, power distribution, fault tolerance, or other applications may
    be included. Bholo et al.119 highlight the numerous security and privacy techniques
    that are employed in applications of the healthcare data management. What are
    QoS measures The QoS is described in terms of the many design parameters that
    are used to assess network performance. Raut et al.120 have discussed the many
    aspects that influence the QoS of WSN network architecture. The quality of service
    is primarily determined by resource limits, such as energy, memory, transmit power,
    and bandwidth. As a result, the majority of research is focused on increasing
    the efficiency of these restrictions. The changing nature of network topologies
    affects QoS as well. Other aspects to consider while measuring the QoS include
    real-time traffic, node deployment types, and data transmission redundancy. Various
    parameters as delay, overheads, throughput, and network life and energy efficiency
    are responsible to represent QoS of the WSN routing protocols, Hingoliwala and
    Swain121 have presented various QoS measures used in the Routing protocols for
    WSN. The major QoS parameters used by the various WSN routing protocols consider
    in this study are shown in Table 9 and Figure 16. In the table delay block is
    related to time delay, and packet delivery ratio (PDR). TABLE 9. Recent QoS parameters

    parameter frequency in Table 8 Energy minimization issues The increasing size
    and deployment of the sensors networks it has become essential to design the energy
    minimization and optimum energy utilization techniques for WSN. Carlos et al.128
    have proposed three methodologies for energy minimization of WSN. These methods
    include techniques like energy-balancing, energy conservation, and energy-harvesting
    techniques as energy sharing as latest methods. Sharma and Kakkar137 have presented
    the recent review of the energy harvesting techniques. They have proposed deployment
    of solar panels for the energy harvesting and node recharging. Alsharif et al.138
    have proposed the energy harvesting techniques for the WSN design. They have divided
    the energy harvesting based services as solar panels based, based on wind energy,
    electromagnetic and thermoelectric methods. Modified distance measures techniques
    There are certain methods that proposed to change calculations of distance between
    nodes for minimizing the energy uses and thus in turn improve the network lifetime.
    Abdulai et al.139 proposed a modified shortest distance determination between
    nodes for improving the EE of the WSN. Normally, the Euclidian distance is used
    for measuring the distance between nodes and Chourey and Khan140 has proposed
    a modified absolute distance measure for increasing the speed and minimizing energy
    uses for energy aware routing protocols. It is suggested that absolute distance
    makes the routing faster. Although is approximate distance measure. Shi et al.141
    long back have proposed the modified distance and direction based greedy routing
    algorithms. Panchal and Singh142 recently proposed FCM based energy aware routing
    based on CH selection approach. The Euclidian distance between BS and the cluster
    centroids are used for the residual energy estimate. Wang et al.143 have considered
    the multi hop distance-based case of the energy aware routing using traffic models
    in WSN. There algorithm addressed open issue of using information table and neighbor
    table simultaneously for routing. Thus, it is found that still there is a lot
    of scope to improve distance-based routing performance. Secure WSN There are huge
    WSN deployment taken place in recent times makes it essential to address the data
    security issues in the WSN. Saibabu et al.144 has addressed threats and security
    issues in the IOT-WSN. Most of the online security methods required higher energy,
    and thus lightweight online detection designs are open issue. The dimension reduction
    in multi-variate data, cost of the identification methods, dynamic data changes
    in distributed are prime research issues in secure IOT-WSN''s. G. Saibabu additionally
    addressed the issues like integrity and data authentication using encryption standards
    (viz., AES, and SHA-256), key management is also another open issue. Saini et
    al.145 have presented good survey of the various security attacks in WSN. It is
    stated in Huanan et al.146 that discard and selective based forwarding, attacks
    over sink nodes, direction, or mis-direction, are all examples of network layer
    attacks. Patil and Chen147 have presented the various security issues in WSN for
    IOT uses. They added issues like access control and fault tolerance. Hari and
    Singh148 and Bangash et al.149 suggested opting better solutions required for
    addressing the security, privacy, power, computational capabilities, and scalability,
    availability of the data, integrity, and authentication of data in the WSN system.
    Deployment issues Harmony search-based deployment algorithm is being opted by
    Al-Fuhaidi et al.150 for increasing the overall coverage of the heterogeneous
    sensor network applications. They compared performance with genetic based deployment
    is achieved using the meta-heuristic algorithm. Priyadarshi et al.151 addressed
    various challenges of WSN deployment issues. The coverage and connectivity issues,
    deterministic, and random node deployment, and issues in centralized and decentralized,
    Traffic Aware deployment approaches are addressed. Network Scalability Issues
    According to Dhage et al.,152 scalability is one of the key principles for more
    efficiently constructing and evaluating big, complex, independent, autonomous,
    and heterogeneous systems that collaborate. Sharmin et al.153 have designed ant
    colony optimization based scalable routing for WSN design. Dogra et al.154 compared
    the clustering-based routing protocols for the scalable WSN application. Vipin
    et al.155 have proposed a scalable memory efficient approach for key management.
    Artificial intelligence (AI) issues Certain recent routing and WSN designs have
    used the AI based optimization techniques for improving the EE and network lifetime.
    Various machine learning methods have also been designed for improving the throughput
    of the WSN systems. Chu-hang et al.156 have designed the clustering-based routing
    protocol using GA. Prakash et al.157 and Jong et al.158 have presented the machine
    learning based classification techniques for the energy improvement of routing
    protocols, Abbasi et al.159 proposed to the various architectures for the Internet
    of Vehicles (IoV) application of WSN. Recent concept of Swarm Intelligence160
    and AI161 are still an open challenge for the WSN systems performance improvement.
    The neural network based fuzzy approach is proposed for improvement in Varun et
    al.162 But these techniques may lead more energy consumption and inaccuracy or
    delay also memory management is also an issue. 11 FUTURE SCOPE In the future the
    open issues can be considered for the WSN designs by researcher''s community.
    Major issues for future scope are the scalability of the IOT network in near future
    considering the dynamic sink scenario. Thus, it is highly required to design the
    efficient routing problems considering the large scale WSN for future generations.
    Modified distance measures may be expected to design for improving the execution
    time for WSN transmissions. Energy harvesting techniques can be employed during
    WSN deployment, in addition the energy aware node heterogeneity can be considered
    for the routing performance improvement. Performance improvement in region or
    grid based distributed clustering is still a scope for future research. Secure
    design of the WSN is also expected to explore in future. Congestion and N/W traffic
    issues are relatively less explored in past. The optimization techniques viz.
    particle swarm optimization (PSO), or GAs can be studied for better EE. The major
    challenge for future scope is designing the highly heterogeneous WSN routing protocol
    for supporting the IOT networks can help to improve the WSN performance Machine
    Learning (ML) can be designed for considering dynamic sink WSN routing challenges.
    All the work is primarily focused toward energy minimization in WSN. 12 DISCUSSIONS
    AND FINDINGS It is observed that most widely used WSN applications are in environmental
    monitoring, health care and precision agriculture. Lots of research has been done
    to designing an efficient routing protocol for the WSN. As the energy performance
    of the network depends of the power efficiency of the nodes. It has been observed
    that if nodes are heterogeneously distributed then the energy efficiency may be
    improved. Most of the energy is consumed during data transmissions or routing.
    Thus, it is required to improve the energy performance of these networks. The
    open challenge is to design fast and efficient node model creations and creating
    network architecture for evaluating the effect on energy utilization. It is an
    open challenge to evaluate energy performance of routing protocols under the different
    parametric conditions for improving the energy efficiency of WSN. Minimizing and
    managing energy consumption of the IOT-WSN is open field of research. As IOT has
    wide coverage range, it is challenging to implement the recent protocols in IOT
    networks. Tiwari eta al.163 discussed various advantages and limitations of WSN
    systems compared to terrestrial networks. They concluded that WSN deployment is
    still costlier. They stated that applying encryption systems to WSNs such security
    mechanisms such as encryption may introduce the delay and packet loss. Ibrahim
    et al.164 has stated that designing the security methods is challenging as they
    required being light weight and energy efficient too. The security methods based
    on the swarm intelligence and the ML needs to be evaluated for energy efficiency.
    Dheyab stated that memory and power resource limitation is a big challenge for
    sensor nodes in large scale WSN designs. Various routing challenges are addressed
    in previous works.165, 166 Various next generations IoT based emerging applications
    are addressed by the Khan et al.167 as shown in Figure 17. FIGURE 17 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Emerging next generation Internet of Things (IoT) networks It
    is an open challenge to design the clustering based scalable protocols to large-scale
    networks. Distributed Clustering based protocols can improve heterogeneity and
    energy efficiency of WSN. Another open issue is designing the secure routing protocol
    using the encryption standards as referred by Rady et al.113 The major challenge
    in WSN design is maintaining the heterogeneity of the network nodes. If heterogeneity
    is more than network nodes are alive for longer time. It is observed that when
    all remaining nodes having the similar residual energy then WSN died faster and
    loses the heterogeneity. In heterogeneous WSN networks, efficient selection of
    the CHs is a challenging field of research. A node becoming CH in WSN has to aggregate
    data from the cluster nodes (CNs) and transmit to the sink. In the last decades
    many modified versions of the distributed energy efficient based routing protocol
    algorithms have been designed for improving the network energy performance. But
    it is still required to increase the network lifetime. It is observed that the
    response time, data rates, and the range of communications and cost are the major
    deciding factor for selection of the suitable IOT communication technology. There
    are few researchers worked over the large area networks with the increased field
    dimensions but scalability of the network is also required to consider while designing
    the routing protocols. 13 CONCLUSIONS Paper presents a survey of IOT-WSN based
    on utilization of communication technologies, and used routing protocols. Paper
    has addressed various limitations of existing works, challenges and open issues
    for recent WSN research. Various WSN approaches are surveyed and corresponding
    QoS parameters are identified. Issues like data security, WSN deployment and the
    Energy minimization are presented. More emphases are provided to hierarchical
    clustering-based routing designs. It is concluded that it is highly required to
    design the energy efficient solutions for the scalable large area WSNs. The major
    contribution of the paper is to design the optimum path for the dynamic sink locations
    for improving the efficiency of the WSN routing protocols. The major conclusion
    is that changing the location of the sink may improve the energy performance of
    the WSN routing protocols. Paper proposes three dynamic transactions in the sink
    location during 5000 rounds. The parametric evaluation is presented for the designing
    the routing protocols. Based on the comparison the major conclusion of the paper
    is that out of all the protocols the EDEEC protocol performs significantly better
    in terms of lifetime. But it is still required to improve the latency performance
    and the heterogeneity of the protocol in the future. Finally, significant scope
    of research is noted for improving the performance of DEEC based protocols under
    the scalable IOT environment. Open Research REFERENCES Citing Literature Volume35,

    BY 4.0 Keywords: temperature; relative humidity; Internet of Things (IoT); indoor
    climate 1. Introduction The measurement of humidity and temperature helps us determine
    the system’s behavior in a wide variety of applications. For this reason, these
    physical variables are among the most used in multiple applications in very different
    work areas, such as health [1,2], electronic circuits [3], precision agriculture
    [4], milk production [5], or climate change [6]. Within the measurements that
    we perform in the environment, there are two main fields: the outdoor [7], that
    is, the measurement that is performed outside any structure built by man, and
    the indoor [8,9] measurement, which is performed inside a building. Indoor measurement
    is an area that has attracted interest in recent years with the modernization
    of systems for indoor temperature control (cooling or heating) [10]. For example,
    in places where the temperature is not controlled and there is a continuous transit
    of people who inhabit the area, such as offices, gyms, event halls, or residential
    buildings, the works using temperature and humidity are focused on comfort studies
    [11,12,13,14,15]. In these places, the cooling or heating systems are turned on
    and off at the convenience of the people living in the space, doors and windows
    can be opened, or computer equipment can be used with different computational
    intensities altering the internal microclimates and, therefore, the comfort of
    the people. In this work, the measurements were carried out in an office environment
    of the Control and Robotics Systems Laboratory, with doors and windows opened
    without control and with occasional air conditioning turned off. In places where
    strict temperature and humidity control is needed, such as in food warehouses,
    research can be focused on understanding the microclimates produced by the heterogeneous
    distribution of air inside the warehouse [16]. There is usually no significant
    human intervention in temperature-controlled sites for long periods, maintaining
    a low temperature and humidity variation. The storage of museum pieces is also
    in temperature- and humidity-controlled spaces because these two physical variables
    strongly impact the deterioration of some museum pieces [17,18]. De La Salle Museum
    of Natural Science conserves an extensive collection of stuffed animals, insects,
    reptiles, birds, and mammals exhibited on a rotating basis in the different exhibition
    rooms of the museum. Still, they are preserved in humidity- and temperature-controlled
    storage most of the time. In this storage, the doors are opened for cleaning personnel
    and curators. The different storage shelves and the contact of museum walls with
    the outside of the building generate different microclimates. For this reason,
    this work can be interesting for researchers in indoor microclimates with controlled
    temperatures and humidity [19,20,21]. Many state-of-the-art studies use the Intel
    Berkeley Research Lab dataset [22] for the application of algorithms proposed
    to process data acquired with real-time wireless sensor networks (WSN). In these
    works, classical processing techniques are used as in [23,24], machine learning-based
    approaches as in [25,26,27], or both types of algorithms as in [28]. The dataset
    described in this article contains the information about the indoor temperature
    in °C and relative humidity in %𝑅𝐻 , acquired for two months with twelve Xiaomi
    Mijia sensors at the laboratory of Control Systems and Robotics, and the storage
    room of the De La Salle Museum of Natural Sciences, both of the Instituto Tecnológico
    Metropolitano, Medellín—Colombia. The devices used for the acquisition are low-cost
    and have a calibration certificate from a Metrology Laboratory accredited by the
    National Accreditation Body of Colombia (ONAC). This dataset provides the timestamp,
    the measured variables, and floor plans with the sensors distribution of the deployed
    WSN. In addition, the data description presented in this article provides additional
    information about the sensors, the deployed sensor network, and the sampling.
    The installation of these sensor systems implies space adequacy, the researchers’
    knowledge of concepts of the Internet of Things (IoT), sensor networks, and embedded
    systems. Having data available to serve as a basis for researchers interested
    in digital signal processing and machine learning prevents them from deploying
    the sensor networks [29,30,31]. This work was chosen using wireless sensors using
    Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and a single gateway to read all sensors’ temperature
    and humidity measurements [32,33,34]. This configuration avoids having an embedded
    system for each sensor to store the data and the need to have multiple power supply
    points. The setup presents the delays inherent to communication, i.e., there is
    no constant sampling period, but this is typical of IoT system implementations,
    where factors such as cost, energy savings, and reading multiple devices to a
    single gateway are crucial. The dataset presented in this work can contribute
    to studies on the behavior of sensor networks using BLE to develop techniques
    used in IoT [35,36]. For this work it is considered that the weather in Medellin,
    Colombia, has a negligible variation throughout the year and has no climatic seasons
    due to its location near the Equator. In this work, the measurement was performed
    for one month at each site, considering that the external weather factor in the
    city does not present significant changes. The set of sensors used is the same
    in the museum and the laboratory, so it was, therefore, necessary to acquire the
    data in two different months. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,
    we present the acquisition devices, the description of the measurement area, and
    the description of the dataset organization. The aspects related to the sampling
    and the analysis of some examples of the data acquired on specific dates in the
    laboratory and the museum are shown in Section 3. Finally, conclusions and future
    work are drawn in Section 4. 2. Materials and Methods This section describes the
    devices used in the wireless sensor network (WSN) deployed, the measurement areas,
    and the dataset organization. 2.1. Acquisition Devices Twelve temperature and
    humidity sensors, Xiaomi Mijia model LYWSDCGQ/01ZM, were used for data acquisition.
    These BLE devices are powered by an AAA battery that can last up to one year,
    according to the specifications of the manufacturer. The devices were calibrated
    in a Metrology Laboratory of the ITM accredited by the National Accreditation
    Body of Colombia (Organismo Nacional de Acreditación de Colombia—ONAC). The sensors
    calibration was performed using a Fluke 2626-H sensor as a reference measurement
    instrument. The environmental conditions under which the calibration was performed
    are between 19.30 °C and 20.50 °C for the temperature and between 56.4 %𝑅𝐻 and
    60.5 %𝑅𝐻 for the relative humidity. The calibration range for temperature is from
    15° to 40° and for relative humidity from 30 %𝑅𝐻 to 70 %𝑅𝐻 . The calibration summary
    of the temperature sensors is shown in Table 1 and the calibration summary of
    the relative humidity sensors is shown in Table 2. Table 1. Calibration summary
    of the temperature sensors. Table 2. Calibration summary of the relative humidity
    sensors. The data from the twelve sensors are collected using a LoPy4 development
    board as BLE gateway. Each sensor reports the measurements, and the values are
    read by the LoPy4. The values of timestamp, temperature in °C, and relative humidity
    in %𝑅𝐻 are added in a new line of the corresponding file, separated by comma.
    There is one file for each of the sensors and all twelve files are stored on the
    SD card of the development board. The general diagram of the deployed network
    is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. General diagram of the deployed network. 2.2.
    Description of the Measurement Areas The laboratory of Control Systems and Robotics
    of the Instituto Tecnológico Metropolitano size is 1350 cm by 620 cm. It has a
    single entrance, which is not airtight and is made of tempered glass. The room
    is distributed in two zones separated by a door in tempered glass and a division
    formed by a drywall in the lower part and tempered glass in the upper part. In
    the larger area are the workplaces and in the smaller area mainly the laboratory
    equipment. The air conditioning system has three branches, two of which have their
    outlet in the area of workplaces and the other in the area of equipment. The air
    conditioning control system is located in a technical room adjacent to the laboratory,
    for which the access door is located outside the laboratory. The control system
    is configured with a temperature set point ranging between 18 °C and 20 °C. The
    deployed network is distributed in nine nodes inside the laboratory, near the
    workstations, and three nodes outside the laboratory. One of the external nodes
    are in the technical room and two are in the hallway. The distribution of the
    sensors is shown in Figure 2. The external nodes were placed in order to have
    a reference of the temperature of the technical room and ambient temperature of
    the external area of the laboratory. Figure 2. Floor plan with the distribution
    of the sensors at the laboratory of Control Systems and Robotics of the Instituto
    Tecnológico Metropolitano. The De La Salle Museum of Natural Sciences was founded
    in 1913 by the De La Salle Brothers. It is committed to preserving, researching,
    and disseminating the cultural and natural heritage of the Antioquia region in
    Colombia. The zoological collection consists of 18,955 specimens, including amphibians
    and reptiles, birds, insects, crustaceans and arachnids, mammals, shells and molluscs,
    microorganisms, fish, and invertebrates. The anthropological collection contains
    elements that are more than 500 years old, made up of pre-Hispanic ceramics with
    a total of 383 pieces. Additionally, the museum has 89 ethnographic objects ranging
    from ceremonial costumes to bows, arrows, and distinctive clothing of different
    indigenous cultures in Colombia. Other collections in the museum include geology
    (2504 pieces), palaeontology (1009 pieces), history (89 historical objects), and
    botany (644 specimens). The museum keeps the specimens and pieces of the collections
    that are not on exhibition in a storage room with controlled temperature and humidity.
    The room has a size of 1000 cm × 1600 cm and is full of cabinets for the storage
    of the specimens. There are cabinets placed along the walls and a larger one in
    the center of the room. In the latter, sensors were placed at the top and inside
    the cabinet (ID 1, 2, 3). The ID 12 sensor was placed outside the room in an environment
    without temperature and humidity control. The room has a humidifier where the
    ID 11 sensor is located and has air conditioning inlets on the wall next to the
    ID 7 and 8 sensors (see Figure 3). Figure 3. Floor plan with the distribution
    of the sensors at the storage room of De La Salle Museum of Natural Sciences of
    the Instituto Tecnológico Metropolitano. 2.3. Description of the Dataset Organization
    The dataset consists of a total of 4,164,267 values. The data are organized in
    two folders named October and November, according to the month in which the data
    were acquired. The data were collected under everyday operating conditions, at
    the laboratory from 1 to 31 October 2019, and at the museum from 1 to 30 November
    2019. Each folder contains twelve files in text format, corresponding to each
    sensor. Each file contains an average of approximately 58,300 values of each variable.
    In the files, the first column corresponds to the timestamp, the next column corresponds
    to the relative humidity measurements, and the last column corresponds to the
    temperature measurements. The values in the rows are separated by commas. The
    dataset is available in Mendeley Data repository, and can be downloaded in a 17
    MB ZIP file from [37]. The dataset files information is presented in Table 3.
    The sensor ID allows to identify the location of the sensors according to the
    distributions shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. The MAC addresses of the sensors
    are shown in the second column. The filename of the file associated with each
    sensor is shown in the third column and it corresponds to the MAC address with
    the pairs of digits ordered in reverse order. Table 3. ID, MAC, and filename of
    each sensor. 3. Temperature and Relative Humidity Dataset This section presents
    some aspects related to the sampling and the analysis of some examples of the
    data acquired on specific dates in the laboratory and the museum. 3.1. Sampling
    Times The acquisition system used in this work, which resembles the commercial
    acquisition methodology, presents physical challenges due to changes in the propagation
    medium of the signals that are common in real applications. For this reason, the
    dataset is also useful for the development of processing algorithms at the edge
    or post-processing, to mitigate some of these drawbacks derived, as we said, from
    electromagnetic propagation problems and connected with the use of sensors and
    low-cost systems that make the applications economically achievable. Given the
    above acquisition conditions, there is no defined sampling period for the acquisition
    performed. Sampling times can be obtained from the timestamp information of the
    collected data. In order to provide more information about the sampling, Figure
    4 shows histograms, taking as reference the sampling time for each of the sensors
    in the November measurement. Ninety-nine percent of the sampling times were ordered
    from lowest to highest value to eliminate outliers corresponding to high sampling
    times. The red line shows the fit to a Weibull function, where it is observed
    that the reliability of the sampling time is clustered in the lower part of the
    distribution. Figure 4. Histograms of the sampling time of the sensors. The red
    line shows the fit of the data to a Weibull distribution with 99% confidence interval.
    Sensor ID: (a) 1, (b) 2, (c) 3, (d) 4, (e) 5, (f) 6, (g) 7, (h) 8, (i) 9, (j)
    10, (k) 11, and (l) 12. The general description of the sampling times of the sensors
    is shown in Table 4. For the sensor network deployed in the museum storage room,
    some very high 𝑡 𝑠 𝑚𝑎𝑥 values are presented. However, from the histograms in Figure
    4 and the 𝑡 𝑠 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 column, it is inferred that these values occurred rarely. Table
    4. Sampling features of the dataset: number of samples (NS), minimum sampling
    time ( 𝑡 𝑠 𝑚𝑖𝑛 ), the maximum sampling time ( 𝑡 𝑠 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ), and the average sampling
    time ( 𝑡 𝑠 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 ). 3.2. Examples of Temperature and Humidity Data The analysis
    of some examples of the data acquired on specific dates in the laboratory and
    the museum is presented below. In Figure 5, the plots of temperature data acquired
    on 2 October in the laboratory are shown. It is shown that during most of the
    day the sensors located inside the laboratory have a similar behavior. However,
    some sensors have close values depending on the area of the laboratory in which
    they are located. In addition, when there is an abrupt change in the temperature,
    all sensors report a close value. These changes generally occur when the air conditioning
    system is turned on or off. Figure 5. Temperature data acquired in the LSCR on
    2 October. Sensors with ID 1 and 10 generally indicate the lowest temperature
    values. The sensors with ID 2, 3, and 4 show very close values in the morning.
    In the afternoon, sensor 2 has a value of approximately one degree below sensors
    3 and 4. Finally, in the evening, sensor 4 indicates a value higher than 1 degree
    above sensors 2 and 3. These sensors show values that are slightly above sensors
    1 and 10. Sensors with ID 5, 6, and 7 show close values for the whole day, which
    are usually higher than the values of sensors 2, 3, and 4. The sensor with ID
    8 shows the highest temperatures in the morning and the evening, which makes sense
    because it is located 80 cm higher than the other sensors. It should also be noted
    that this sensor is located above the laboratory access door. Of the sensors external
    to the laboratory, the sensors with ID 11 and 12 have a similar behavior and provide
    information on the ambient temperature. The sensor with ID 9 has the smallest
    temperature variation range and its value is the closest to the temperature set
    point. In Figure 6, the plots of relative humidity data acquired on 2 October
    in the laboratory are shown. Although the inverse relationship between the two
    variables is evident, there are some differences in relation to the behavior of
    temperature. For example, the values indicated by sensor 6 in the morning are
    below the values of the other sensors located in the laboratory, which have values
    close to each other. A similar behavior is observed at night, with the difference
    in the slight increase of humidity indicated by sensor 10. Figure 6. Relative
    humidity data acquired in the LSCR on 2 October. In Figure 7, the plots of temperature
    data acquired on 20 October in the laboratory are shown. This date is a non-working
    day because it is a Sunday, and the air conditioning was off all day. It is observed
    that the temperature changes inside the laboratory are smooth. It is also observed
    that, except for sensor 8, the sensors in the laboratory present close values.
    Before 06:00 h and after 18:00 h, a significant relationship between sensor location
    and measured temperature can be observed. The behavior observed in Figure 5 for
    the sensors inside the laboratory is preserved, where sensors 10 and 1 show the
    lowest values, followed by sensors 2, 3, and 4. Then, with a slightly higher temperature
    value, are the sensors 5, 6, and, 7. Finally, sensor 8 shows the highest temperature
    values, close to 0.5 °C difference. Figure 7. Temperature data acquired in the
    LSCR on 20 October. In Figure 8, the plots of humidity data acquired on 20 October
    in the laboratory are shown. It is observed that the changes in the values of
    humidity inside the laboratory are smooth. Most of the sensors in the laboratory
    indicate close values of humidity, while sensor 6 reports values that are below
    the average of the other sensors. External sensors show a wider range of variation
    and more pronounced changes. Figure 8. Relative humidity data acquired in the
    LSCR on 20 October. In Figure 9, the plots of temperature data acquired in the
    museum storage room on 20 November are shown. It is observed that the sensors
    with ID 1, 2, 3, and 5, which are located inside the central cabinet, present
    a similar behavior and with close values. The sensors with ID 4, 9, and 10, which
    are located above the cabinets, have a similar behavior, with sensor 4 having
    a value of approximately 0.5 degrees less than the other two sensors. The sensors
    with ID 7 and 8, which are located above the cabinets and near the air conditioning
    system outlet, indicate the lowest values. In most cases, we observed the relationship
    between the temperature measurements with the temperature changes indicated by
    the sensor with ID 12, which is located outside at the entrance of the storage
    room. The sensors with ID 6 and 11 indicate the values with the smallest variation.
    Figure 9. Temperature data acquired in the museum storage room on 20 November.
    In Figure 10, the plots of humidity data acquired in the museum storage room on
    20 November are shown. It is observed that there is a greater variation in the
    measurements provided by the sensors during the first 9 h of the day. Similar
    behavior is observed at the end of the day. The measurements of sensor 11 show
    a different behavior from the other sensors, although their values are close.

    4. Conclusions In this paper, the description of a dataset with the measurements
    of indoor temperature and relative humidity, acquired for two months with twelve
    Xiaomi Mijia sensors at the Instituto Tecnológico Metropolitano, Medellín—Colombia,
    is presented. The WSN deployed in this work for data acquisition presents physical
    challenges due to changes in the propagation medium of the signals that are common
    in real applications. For this reason, the dataset is useful for IoT researchers
    to develop processing algorithms at the edge or post-processing, to mitigate some
    of these drawbacks derived. In addition, data acquisition can be time-consuming,
    and having data to serve as a basis for researchers interested in digital signal
    processing and machine learning saves them from deploying sensor networks and
    focusing on algorithms implementation and evaluation. This dataset provides the
    timestamp, the measured variables, and floor plans with the sensors distribution
    of the deployed WSN. The data description presented in this article provides information
    about the sensors, the deployed sensor network, and the sampling, which can be
    useful for the use and analysis of the data. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    Abstract With the rapid growth of population and the increasing demand for food
    worldwide, improving productivity in farming procedures is essential. Smart farming
    is a concept that emphasizes the use of modern technologies such as the Internet
    of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance productivity in farming
    practices. In a smart farming scenario, large amounts of data are collected from
    diverse sources such as wireless sensor networks, network-connected weather stations,
    monitoring cameras, and smartphones. These data are valuable resources to be used
    in data-driven services and decision support systems (DSS) in farming applications.
    However, one of the major challenges with these large amounts of agriculture data
    is their immense diversity in terms of format and meaning. Moreover, the different
    services and technologies in a smart farming ecosystem have limited capability
    to work together due to the lack of standardized practices for data and system
    integration. These issues create a significant challenge in cooperative service
    provision, data and technology integration, and data-sharing practices. To address
    these issues, in this paper, we propose the platform approach, a design approach
    intended to guide building effective, reliable, and robust smart farming systems.
    The proposed platform approach considers six requirements for seamless integration,
    processing, and use of farm data. These requirements in a smart farming platform
    include interoperability, reliability, scalability, real-time data processing,
    end-to-end security and privacy, and standardized regulations and policies. A
    smart farming platform that considers these requirements leads to increased productivity,
    profitability, and performance of connected smart farms. In this paper, we aim
    at introducing the platform approach concept for smart farming and reviewing the
    requirements for this approach. Keywords: smart farming; precise agriculture;

    1. Introduction According to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO) [1], food production should increase by 70% due to the expected growth in
    the world population by 2050. This population growth requires increasing productivity
    using solutions that consider resource shortage and farm profitability [2]. Employing
    information communication technology (ICT), smart technologies, in addition to
    the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence
    (AI) have led to digitalization in farming called smart farming. Smart farming
    is considered to be the fourth revolution in farming [3,4]. By managing inputs,
    such as fertilizers, pesticides, and animal feed, a smart system can help farmers
    to reduce waste, employ less workforce, decrease overall costs, and to reach a
    more sustainable environmental impact to achieve higher productivity [5,6]. According
    to the Market and Markets report, USD 13.8 billion was dedicated to the global
    smart farming market in 2020. Due to farmers’ needs to increase yields, improve
    livestock production, and reduce management costs to meet the growing demand for
    food, smart farming should experience rapid growth to USD 22 billion by 2025 [7].
    In a smart farming scenario, large amounts of real-time and high-resolution data
    are generated from remote and automated sensor systems. The data can represent
    different aspects of farming, including but not limited to livestock, crops, soil,
    and the environment [8]. The data range from time series to spatial images, human
    experiences, and observations collected via mobile smartphone applications [9].
    Such data can be analyzed to filter out invalid or wrong data [2] and to compute
    personalized recommendations for a farm to improve productivity [10]. Different
    modern technologies can be utilized for data generation and data analysis in digital
    agriculture. IoT, AI, and cloud computing are examples of technologies that have
    recently been widely used in smart farming [11,12]. Although data-driven solutions
    have provided various benefits in agriculture, data integration, processing, and
    usage processes and protocols are still prominent challenges that need to be addressed
    [13]. Some of these challenges are limited awareness and knowledge of digitalization
    [14], lack of standardization and suitable management to cope with fragmented
    and heterogeneous data [15], lack of high-quality data and proper analysis [16],
    privacy and security challenges in an entire smart farming ecosystem [17], and
    lack of compliance with uniform regulations and policies [18]. A unified solution
    that considers the requirements in various stages of the data processing lifecycle
    can address various issues in digital agriculture. Such a solution enhances awareness
    regarding the needs and requirements of different data sources, technologies,
    processes, and protocols (including policies). This solution assists the actors
    in smart farming ecosystems to provide their services and products to other parties
    in a more usable format. Moreover, this approach increases food safety, production,
    and sustainability by providing transparent and trustable data about every stage
    of the food chain. In addition, a unified solution provides an excellent opportunity
    for building decision frameworks to aggregate data from diverse sources and to
    provide high-quality data-driven services. This approach also facilitates data
    sharing and multiparty cooperation in farming applications, and thus, increases
    productivity and reduces resource waste. In this paper, we suggest the platform
    approach as a unified solution that facilitates cooperation in smart farming applications.
    Furthermore, this approach enforces relationships between farmers and system providers
    to track crop cycle information, livestock, and dairy production in a secure manner
    for their decisions and data management. In recent years, several platforms have
    been proposed for smart farming applications. SmartFarmNet [2] is an IoT-based
    platform that has been developed by a multi-disciplinary Australian team to automate
    the collection of environmental, irrigation, fertilization, and soil data. This
    platform integrates IoT devices, such as sensors, actuators, and cloud servers
    for storing and analysis of collected data. The presented results in the paper
    showed that SmartFarmNet was capable of providing near real-time query responses.
    Moreover, the authors demonstrated that increasing the number of sensors had a
    negligible impact on the performance of the system, therefore, the proposed platform
    was scalable. Mehdi et al. [19] proposed Smart Farming Oriented BigData Architecture
    (SFOBA), a platform for big data processing that provided real-time processing
    on acquired data from smart farm systems and devices. In this study, the authors
    utilized the Star Schema Benchmark dataset [20] to show how the proposed platform
    could finish multidimensional queries on 40 million rows of data in less than
    one second. Clements et al. [21] developed an interactive digital tool that collected
    data from different sources such as the Key Indicators Mapping System (KIMS) and
    the Key Indicators Database System (KIDS) both provided by the Food and Agriculture
    Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The developed tool provided information
    regarding livestock production, disease prediction, as well as provided the rules
    for risk assessment at the country level. Another field in smart farming is smart
    dairy farming which aims to utilize modern smart technologies to satisfy the increasing
    demand for quality dairy products, to reduce consumed resources, and to decrease
    the ecological footprint [22]. Taneja et al. [23] proposed SmartHerd, a platform
    enabling data-driven dairy farming by analyzing available data and providing controls
    for farmers and other stakeholders. This platform has been deployed in Waterford,
    Ireland, and was developed to gather and analyze data regarding dairy cattle.
    The presented platform is designed to keep working when the internet connection
    is lost. The generated data in this platform are stored locally and are shared
    on a cloud infrastructure when the internet connection is available. Most of the
    proposed platforms in smart farming have focused on a specific aspect of smart
    farming such as crop production recommendations [2], big data technologies [19],
    data transformation [19] reliability [24], and business model [6]. With the increasing
    need to collect, integrate, analyze, and manage large amounts of data generated
    at farms, effective farm data processing continues to be a major hurdle for the
    adoption and success of digital agriculture solutions. Despite the need, the existing
    studies have not provided a holistically designed approach by considering different
    requirements for smart farming applications. To fill this gap, in this paper,
    we propose a design thinking approach, which we refer to as the “platform approach”,
    for smart farming data processing. This approach encourages consideration of six
    core requirements when designing, implementing, and testing smart farming solutions.
    These requirements are interoperability of data, processes, and technologies;
    reliability to ensure that a data source is valid and available; scalability in
    terms of the capability of the platform to be extended to larger applications;
    real-time data processing to enable timely access to data and services; protection
    of infrastructure and smart farming assets (privacy and security); and finally,
    compliance with policies and regulation. The proposed approach facilitates cooperation
    among different parties in smart farming ecosystems and enables these actors to
    make the most use of available data sources. The rest of this paper is organized
    as follows: In Section 2, the core components of data processing in smart farming
    systems are described; in Section 3, we discuss the challenges and requirements
    in smart farming systems; then, in Section 4, we investigate the main requirements
    and related solutions in a smart farming platform; finally, in Section 5, we conclude
    the paper with a summary of the platform approach and some future insights. 2.
    The Core Components of Data Processing in Smart Farming Systems To improve smart
    farming data processing through the integration of various systems, in this paper,
    we propose the concept of the platform approach, which is a design approach for
    data processing. The smart farming platform approach allows farmers, researchers,
    technology providers, and all other stakeholders to have a standard and reliable
    solution to collect and share information, resources, and experiences to improve
    the productivity and performance of smart farming solutions. We demonstrate an
    overview of the main components of smart farming data processing in Figure 1 in
    five main layers. This abstract platform can shed light on the components of the
    smart farming application platform, defining the main tasks and core components
    for data processing in these systems. Figure 1. Smart farming components that
    facilitate integration, processing, and use of farm data. According to Figure
    1, in the data acquisition stage, data are collected from diverse sources, such
    as farmers, sensors, and satellites, as well as external databases such as weather
    and climate data. The collected data from these different sources can be in different
    formats that are not compatible to be stored in a unique database. In addition,
    some collected data may contain incomplete data, missed values, outliers [25],
    and anomalous instances [26]. To address these problems, in the data preparation
    stage, best practices for data preprocessing can be used to prepare data for further
    analysis. These practices include standardizing data to a predefined format, identifying
    and deleting duplicated data, handling the gaps in generated data, and validating
    data sources and contents. Additionally, the collected data from different sources
    can be stored in a common infrastructure and can be integrated with other data
    sources that are collected from diverse smart farming systems. These methods assist
    in ensuring data consistency, completeness [27], and accuracy [28]. The components
    in the second and the third layers are highly correlated, and many of the smart
    farming data processing functions can be assigned to both layers. The data processing
    layer components are the brains of smart farming [29]. Mathematical modeling,
    statistical methods, or AI methods are used to analyze and extract knowledge from
    farm data. Machine learning (a branch of AI) consists of intelligent techniques
    to make automated decisions with limited human involvement. Machine learning can
    perform rapid optimizations, classifications [30], predictions, and recommendations
    and add value to the entire system [31]. For instance, SomaDetect Inc. of Fredericton
    [13], utilizes machine learning for identifying individual cows. This system also
    monitors the cows to detect disease symptoms through data collected from sensors
    at milking stations on dairy farms. As another example, AirSurf-Lettuce is an
    open-source analytic platform that uses machine learning to categorize iceberg
    lettuces to improve the actual yield and crop marketability before harvesting
    [32]. Model deployment in the context of machine learning refers to the application
    of generalizing a model to predict new items in the system. Prediction is according
    to estimating the outcomes for unseen data that can help to provide predictions.
    For example, the growth prediction in plants helps farmers to decide about harvest
    time and plan for the required workforce. Forecasting is a kind of prediction
    about the future using time-series data. An example of forecasting in smart farming
    is weather forecasting using temporal information to plan for irrigation [33].
    The decision-making stage includes system monitoring, rule management, and model
    metadata management to provide the results and recommendations through the deployed
    model. Metadata (data about data) is provided to establish a common understanding
    of the meaning of data. For example, the available metadata about automatic milking
    devices can help farmers to use the proper estimators to predict the milking duration.
    These data can help smart farming actors such as farmers and growers during the
    decision-making process. Some examples are decisions about disease prediction,
    pesticide control, and water management. In the last stage of smart farming applications,
    end-users, i.e., farmers, farming service providers, agriculture researchers,
    and governments access the system results through services. System monitoring
    can audit the entire system and provide feedback to optimize the predictors and
    to improve decision making. In addition, rule management can check the compliance
    of decisions against available rules. Since trustworthiness is a core requirement
    to ensure system adoption and use, it is necessary to consider security and privacy
    concerns in all communications and end-to-end in the platform. Moreover, the data
    workflow should comply with the available policy and regulations in smart farming.
    Application programming interfaces (APIs) are common methods for the integration
    of different components and resources (e.g., data sources, legal processes, and
    policy protocols) in a platform approach. 3. Challenges and Requirements in Smart
    Farming The platform approach suggests designing smart farming services using
    platform structures that can be integrated through APIs or other methods to build
    effective, reliable, and robust systems. This approach is also aimed at providing
    a common understanding and semantics among smart farming actors to collaborate
    in data-sharing practices and cooperative service provision. In Section 2, we
    presented an abstract overview of such a platform as well as the main components
    of data processing in smart farming systems. In this section, we discuss the challenges
    in smart farming applications and convey the major requirements that any agricultural
    platform should have to address these challenges. In agriculture, data are highly
    heterogeneous for different reasons such as type, format, and intent of data,
    different protocols of devices, and the methods of collecting data. For example,
    poultry stakeholders are interested in monitoring the daily behavior of birds,
    such as their movement and feeding patterns, to predict the possibility of a disease
    outbreak in the early stages. A major challenge in such an application is combining
    heterogeneous data collected from different sensors in smart poultry farms. In
    addition to collecting and processing data, aggregating diverse data among various
    farms can improve the prediction outcome. However, lack of interoperability among
    data, technologies, and data processes is a significant barrier to reaching this
    goal. A similar challenge may arise when farmers aim to equip their farms with
    new IoT devices. As devices from different technology providers do not follow
    a unique protocol, this limitation restricts farmers from adding new digital tools
    and devices to their smart farming network. In the context of smart farming, interoperability
    refers to the ability of two or more different systems, services, and components
    (i.e., software components and IoT devices) to be able to work together to exchange
    information, facilitate processes, integrate technology solutions, and comply
    with policies and legal requirements. There are four categories of interoperability
    including semantic/data interoperability, technology or system interoperability,
    operational interoperability, and legal interoperability [34]. For data/semantic
    interoperability, the entities should mutually agree on the meaning, content,
    and context of data exchange and use [35]. Interoperability improves the flexibility
    of smart farming networks as well as enables farmers to collaborate through data
    sharing and enhance their farm practices. An important aspect of interoperability
    is standardization. In the context of data processing, without mechanisms to take
    data from diverse sources of digital agriculture solutions, it would be extremely
    resource based and time-consuming to make the most use of data. Using processes
    and best practices that convert data and information to harmonized formats is
    critical to enabling data sharing and integration practices and collaborative
    decision making. Alongside interoperability in smart farming devices and systems,
    controlling data reliability is a major requirement in a smart farm platform.
    Data reliability, sometimes referred to as data quality, is defined as the extent
    to which the data and its source are trustworthy, unfailing, authentic, genuine,
    and representative of the problem [36]. Reliability can be evaluated at different
    levels, such as on-farm and off-farm levels. From an on-farm point of view, it
    is essential to make sure the data generation is valid and stable. A smart device
    that is physically damaged, or an issue in network connection might lead to invalid
    and unstable data generation. From an off-farm perspective, a smart farming platform
    should ensure the farmers that the data and algorithms are valid and trustable.
    Data quality issues are also likely to arise in the integration process as the
    quality of all data sources cannot be verified [37,38]. Wrong decisions originating
    from unreliable data in decision-making processes cost agricultural businesses
    billions per year [39]. Scalability is another requirement that should be considered
    while designing a smart farming platform [40]. Scalability in smart farming refers
    to the adaptability of a system to increase the capacity, for example, the number
    of technology devices such as sensors and actuators, while enabling timely analysis
    [41]. Shortcomings of scalability in a smart farming architecture, in the context
    of data processing, would lead to weak system performance. For instance, integration
    with other devices and applications may not be possible if scalability requirements
    are not embedded by design. It has been recommended to consider the possibility
    of growth in size and diversity of applications of smart farming systems from
    the initial stages of system design [42]. As an illustration, consider a large
    poultry production that owns farms in different locations. This company needs
    a platform to build a scalable business by integrating the supply chain from feed
    to hatcheries and poultry farms to distribution [43]. These poultry farms may
    have different sensors and acquire various types of technologies to collect data
    in sizes, formats, content, and complexities [17,44]. The company should be able
    to expand data processing, network bandwidth, and other computation resources
    to be able to utilize data collected in these farms. If this need for resource
    growth is not considered in the design of the system, the company cannot easily
    expand their system to process and use other data sources. Platforms for smart
    farming should consider scalability as a core requirement to enable growth and
    future needs for integration. Moreover, in smart farming systems, we need fast
    and accurate decisions and actions. Thus, we need platforms that enable farmers
    to deliver proper actions at the right time. Real-time data analytics is defined
    as the ability to analyze large volumes of streaming data when they are created
    or stored [45]. For instance, in the case that a farmer decides to sell their
    products or buy supplies, a long waiting time for getting access to data and making
    decisions might lead to losing a bargain, or incorrectly offering an estimation
    originated from outdated data. Real-time processing is an approach to capture,
    process, and export data promptly [46,47]. Furthermore, real-time data processing
    enables smart farming actors to take proper decisions at the right time which
    leads to minimizing risks and undesirable consequences [48]. A smart farming platform
    can also facilitate real-time processing as a requirement for reinforcing farming
    practices and preparing farmers against unexpected circumstances [45]. To achieve
    real-time data processing, it is also necessary to collect the data in real time.
    The results acquired based on analyzing old data can cause inaccurate decisions,
    while real-time data facilitates real-time decisions and actions [46]. Similar
    to any other smart platform, a smart farming platform should bring security and
    privacy to the core of attention and provide sufficient protection mechanisms.
    Modern technologies form an ecosystem in which connected devices are accessible
    remotely, allowing adversaries to plan cyberattacks. The attackers might aim to
    steal information or carry out disruptive actions on the smart farming systems
    [49]. For example, Yang et al. illustrated how adversaries used IoT devices in
    IT infrastructure to compromise security [4]. As an illustration, a malicious
    actor can get access to a farm’s data using an unsecured smart device and steal
    information about the products, financial decisions, and future plans. The intruder
    can also damage the products and equipment. Because of the availability of diverse
    data sources in smart farming systems, including personal and business data, privacy
    is another paramount concern. Smart farming systems should provide mechanisms
    to ensure security requirements and data protection. These practices must protect
    data end-to-end and in different data processing stages, from data collection
    to data-driven service provision. Regulations for agricultural practices affect
    the design and development of smart farming technologies. For instance, farmers’
    concerns about data sharing and privacy have been discussed in recent studies
    [50,51]. Farmers are not convinced that the available policies to protect their
    intellectual property, business profit share, and privacy are sufficient. There
    are also concerns about the lack of compliance with privacy best practices and
    farm data agreements by the technology providers [52]. To address these concerns
    and build trust, there is a need to establish standards and best practices that
    mandate the rights and responsibilities of different actors in smart farming systems.
    There is also the need to set standards for data-sharing practices and to apply
    policies to determine accountability and penalties in the case of possible disputes.
    Other regulations related to food safety, supply chain management, disease monitoring,
    and other applications can also impact agriculture data management and processing.
    These policies can be renewed to be applicable to new and emerging agri-food needs
    and technologies. Policy requirements can be embedded into technologies for monitoring,
    compliance, and sustainability purposes. In summary, as is demonstrated in Figure
    2, we recommend consideration of a platform approach that facilitates six requirements
    for smart farming data processing. These requirements enable seamless integration
    of data, system, and processes with the end-user in mind. They include interoperability
    to provide compatibility among different components of the platform; real-time
    processing to generate fast and accurate information for decision making; scalability
    that enables the platform to extend the entities and resources; reliability to
    assure accessing valid and up-to-date data; ensuring security and privacy to preserve
    the system safety and confidentiality; and, finally compliance with the related
    policies and regulations in smart farming. A platform that satisfies all these
    requirements can enhance farming practices, and therefore, can increase productivity,
    profitability, and performance while decreasing resource waste. Figure 2. Platform
    requirements for data processing. 4. Requirements, Discussion and Solutions In
    Section 3, we recommended six major requirements to be considered in the design
    of smart farming platforms. We suggest that these requirements are necessary for
    any platform that aims to provide fast and robust services in a smart farming
    ecosystem. In the following, we investigate these requirements and the solutions
    to address them in the platform approach. 4.1. Interoperability Currently, there
    is an extensive number of digital solutions including software tools and services
    that are used in smart farming. This growing trend has resulted in the generation
    of heterogeneous data from multiple protocols and communication technologies with
    different formats and semantics. However, data generated by precision farming
    tools are not portable and cannot be integrated among smart farming systems. Interoperability
    among technical software tools, hardware, or processes/protocols is relatively
    limited often because of the lack of established standards [53]. Interoperability
    requirements cut across various components of smart farming technologies (Figure
    1) from collecting data with varying accessibility rules, data integration across
    multiple sectors/devices, and data processing and protection regulation for data
    governance and data access. Interoperability can be viewed from legal, organizational
    or operational, semantic, and technical dimensions [34]. Legal interoperability
    involves ensuring the integration of smart farming platforms under various legal
    frameworks including food policies, privacy policies and procedures, and data
    agreements, to enable data exchange. In a smart farming system, data could be
    combined from various sources, resulting in integrated datasets. This integration
    should be performed in accordance with the farm data agreements. To address legal
    interoperability requirements in smart farming, the RDA-CODATA principles can
    be used [34]. These principles are: facilitating the authorized access to and
    re-use of data, deciding who has access to and is responsible for the data, managing
    the legal interests, explaining the rights clearly, and promoting harmonization
    of rights in the data. These principles can be embedded into the farm data processing
    platform and integration can be enabled through application programming interfaces
    (APIs). Organizational interoperability is concerned with agricultural actors’
    capacity to accept and utilize services from other organizations to collaborate
    effectively [54]. This is dependent on the degree to which farms’ processes, responsibilities,
    and roles are harmonized toward shared objectives and strategies in the agricultural
    systems to make services more accessible, easily identifiable, and user focused.
    To address the organizational interoperability requirements, farm business processes
    and exchanged data need to be integrated, aligned, and documented using a commonly
    agreed modeling method [55]. Semantic interoperability ensures that the precise
    meaning and format of the shared data are understood and preserved. In existing
    smart farming ecosystems, data are collected from fragmented systems in varying
    formats and meanings. To tackle the lack of semantic interoperability in data
    processing, it is necessary to describe all data elements by developing vocabularies
    and schema to ensure that all communicating agricultural parties understand the
    data in the same way. The solutions for improving semantic interoperability in
    smart farming are standardization, metadata, and connecting each data variable
    to a common language, in the form of taxonomies and ontologies [56]. Semantic
    interoperability issues in smart farming data processes can be solved by using
    standardized languages such as agroXML [57] which is an XML dialect for describing
    farm production processes as well as the real-world objects required in conducting
    these processes. For semantic interoperability enhancement, a smart farming application
    can leverage metadata that describes original data, allowing the user to make
    the best decision possible about how to use it. Metadata is generated to add meaning
    and context to data values and to establish a common understanding of the meaning
    and semantics of the data. Metadata enables correct and proper use and interpretation
    of the data by the owners and users [58]. Furthermore, it also enables farm machines
    to comprehend data by offering models and eliminating ambiguity [58]. For example,
    in the modeling and simulation of a decision support platform in smart farming,
    there is a need for a method to detect conflict between system components and
    concepts of the model. Metadata is used to address the interoperability of such
    systems by capturing information about model concepts which allows software agents
    to reason in an unambiguous and machine-readable form [59]. Data interoperability
    is considerably resolved in smart farming when metadata is standardized, and common
    language definitions are used. Such standards are defined and promoted by standard
    agencies such as the International Standards Organisation (ISO) [60]. The Agricultural
    Information Management Standards (AIMS) [61], the Agricultural Metadata Element
    Set (AgMES) [62], and Agrovoc [63] are three notable metadata initiatives in the
    agriculture area [53]. Moreover, ontologies and taxonomies can enable better interoperability
    by allowing data to be linked at the semantic level. Taxonomy aids in the interpretation
    of relationships between data entities and the categorization of data [64]. Ontology
    explains the structural complexities of databases as well as the semantic relationships
    among data variables collected in databases [10]. Several ontologies such as FoodWiki,
    Agrovoc, and FoodOn have been proposed to extract the semantics of food and agricultural
    data to share and reuse agriculture knowledge. In addition, sensor ontologies
    such as sensor node ontology [65], and sensor-data ontology [66] are used for
    semantic interoperability of data collected from IoT devices. The goal of these
    ontologies is to identify essential elements of sensor data and to model resources,
    services, and geographical data to ease data access for users. Another aspect
    of interoperability is technical interoperability, which refers to the capacity
    of two or more technical agricultural platforms, infrastructures, services, or
    protocols to easily integrate and enable process and data flow [54]. This concept
    is fundamental to software and hardware compatibility. For example, interoperability
    is required among farm machines, software, IoT devices, and sensors. If the data
    processing modules do not recognize the data format collected by the combined
    harvester, the IoT will be of little use in terms of assisting decision making.
    Technical interoperability often can be satisfied by selecting and implementing
    the proper software and/or internet interface (API) and protocols, as well as
    standardized content encodings for transmission [67]. Technical interoperability
    could be satisfied by creating a decentralized network of existing systems to
    enable the exchange of data in smart farming processes. Each system could be independent
    and built upon its own technical infrastructure. The ATLAS initiative is one of
    the projects that developed such an open technical interoperable network involving
    stakeholders from diverse agricultural domains by using open technical specification.
    This project aims to provide a distributed service-oriented platform that enables
    some tasks such as watering management, soil management, and behavioral analysis
    of livestock. This framework involves all actors in the food chain, enhancing
    the process from farm to fork. Interoperability is made possible by data standards
    that allow the sharing and exchange of data. In the absence of standardization
    of data, processing data from heterogeneous and incompatible sources is challenging
    and often inefficient. Data standardization is a key step toward data interoperability
    to promote data quality, data sharing, data reusability, and to optimize data
    usage. The standardization process of data, processes, policies, and concepts
    is critical in ensuring all types of interoperability. This goal may be realized
    by well-defined and well-established protocols and regulations that facilitate
    the integration of multiple data sources and external knowledge-based services
    given by stakeholders and partners. Due to the complexity of data standardization,
    data harmonization [68] can be used as an alternative solution. Data harmonization
    is the process of merging different data sources into an unambiguous, integrated
    entity record to be used in the system and to feed the processes of a system [69].
    The main difference between data standardization and data harmonization comes
    from the level of strictness in standards. On the one hand, the aim of data standardization
    is to make the data clear and consistent. It should be “clear” to ensure that
    data can be easily understood by individuals who are not involved in data processing,
    and consistent to ensure that relevant data can be recognized using common terms
    and formats. Data harmonization, on the other hand, is the process of merging
    different data sources into an unambiguous, integrated entity fromat to be used
    in the system and to feed the processes of a system [69]. 4.2. Reliability Reliability
    is a crucial foundation for designing data-driven services across smart farming
    ecosystems. The reliability of data-driven systems depends on effective processes,
    data, and technologies [70]. As a major requirement, reliability should be considered
    in all stages of smart farming, from data acquisition to data preparation and
    model building. Reliability can be considered from different aspects such as data
    reliability and technology reliability. The main components of data reliability
    are data consistency, data completeness [27,71,72], and data accuracy [28]. Consistency
    as the main component of reliability [2] refers to keeping data concepts, value
    domains, and formats unchanged. Changes to farm data might take place while processing,
    moving through networks, or sharing between applications [28,72]. Data completeness
    is about the availability of all necessary data for decision making [72]. In other
    words, the deficiency of a component should not impact the accuracy and integrity
    of data [28]. Data completeness in smart farming does not mean that all data attributes
    must be present; rather, important data attributes and optional ones need to be
    decided for selection. Accuracy refers to the extent to which recorded data reflect
    the true state of source information [28,73]. The values stored by a precision
    agriculture system may be inaccurate or wrong. This issue can be due to unreliable
    or broken sensors, lost information, and failed transmissions [74]. The inaccurate
    data can lead to a risk of missing events and hard interpretations [74]. In addition
    to data reliability, smart farming platforms require robust and reliable technologies
    such as high speed and reliable internet connection [75]. The physical safety
    of IoT devices for precision agriculture systems should be ensured in different
    environmental conditions to avoid communication failures. IoT data analytics should
    process data accurately and reliably to enable decision-makers to react quickly
    to emerging issues and changing conditions [76]. Because agricultural data cover
    a wide range of heterogeneous and unstructured sources, simple ratios can be used
    to measure the percentage of data elements that meets specific rules [77]. To
    manage information structure in a database, Blake et al. [78] suggested using
    parsing techniques. Using this method, the quality of sensor data, as an example,
    was calculated by comparing it with data coming from multiple reference sensors,
    existing historical data, or an alternate data source. There are, however, several
    challenges to using this approach. For example, the quality of the reference sensors
    is not always guaranteed, historical data might not be available, and there might
    be additional costs using alternate data sources. Performing some tests and preprocessing
    on the aggregated data from sensors and other sources is recommended to raise
    data reliability in smart farms. For example, outlier detection can help to detect
    faulty devices or discern the unreliable data exchanged with other farms. 4.3.
    Scalability Scalability is another requirement that should be considered in a
    smart farming platform. Scalability refers to the ability to increase available
    resources and system capability without the need to go through a major system
    redesign or implementation. As an illustration, in Figure 1, we can increase the
    capacity for data processing by increasing the cloud resources in the second layer
    and computation resources in the third layer. The challenges related to scalability
    in smart farming fall into two categories: capacity and performance [79]. Scaling
    capacity refers to the ability to add new nodes or resources to the system [41].
    Scaling performance is the ability to improve performance or to keep the performance
    identical while expanding capacity. The fundamental bottleneck that may affect
    system performance may be caused by different deployment configurations of various
    components [80]. Other challenges of scalability are identity management and access
    control, security [81], privacy [44], governance, and fault tolerance [81]. Since
    farming data generation is rapidly increasing every day, such data are too large
    to be stored on a single node. A fundamental solution to address this need is
    distributing data collection mechanisms across multiple nodes. For instance, Zhou
    et al. [82] employed Hadoop to process and store 1.44 million data records for
    daily temperature monitoring. Since most smart farming data are small files that
    lead to many small files, Hadoop cannot be effective without a distributed system
    equipped with a high-performance computing system. To address this problem, the
    Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) has been designed to process large (and
    small size) datasets. Using cloud computing technology in a smart farming platform
    is another solution that can address scalability challenges related to capacity
    due to flexible and robust data collection, management, and processing capabilities
    [83]. Cloud computing provides a high level of flexibility by providing remote
    services for monitoring and managing farm data. Moreover, these services can provide
    on-demand storage and computation resources with no need for on-farm hardware
    installation [84]. The data stored in the cloud systems are usually distributed
    in the data storage platforms supported by backup mechanisms. The data-driven
    services are finally offered by web services accessible through diverse tools,
    including laptops, tablets, and smartphones in the last stage of smart farming
    tasks, as shown in Figure 1. SmartFarmNet [2] is an example of a scalable platform
    that utilizes cloud computing technology to provide a scalable solution for smart
    farming. Despite several benefits of employing cloud technology in smart farming
    systems, the challenges such as latency, security, and privacy issues in transferring
    a large amount of data to the cloud are still persistent. To address these issues,
    the use of edge computing at the network’s edge has been recommended [78,85].
    Edge computing is a technology that aims to process data at the edge of the network,
    near the source of the data in order to reduce the transmitted data to the cloud
    servers, as well as to decrease the workload on the centralized cloud computing
    servers. In addition, edge computing can leverage the scalability of cloud computing
    resources by taking advantage of both cloud and edge computing and decreasing
    the volume of data transfer. Having an edge-based ecosystem with the right APIs
    and tools to integrate various data sources can ensure the availability and real-time
    processing for users. An example of using edge computing in agriculture is the
    platform Zamora-Izquierdo et al. [24] who proposed another real-world platform
    that utilized edge technology to handle the issues in hydroponics farming. This
    platform was implemented in Spain to evaluate the water consumption and procedures
    related to tomato cultivation. Digital tools also have been used in livestock
    production and health management. Although edge computing increases scalability
    in a system, it increases concerns regarding the heterogeneity of the utilized
    devices in a network. Because this technology utilizes diverse software and hardware
    products in different layers of the network, the performance of the system is
    highly correlated with the compatibility of the used components. Ning et al. [86]
    discussed the heterogeneity issues in edge computing and the solutions to address
    this problem. 4.4. Near Real-Time Data Processing and Decision Making Similar
    to many other emerging real-world applications, smart farming applications need
    real-time processing of streaming big data [87,88]. Real-time data lead to real-time
    decisions and actions [48]. In a smart farming system, making fast and accurate
    decisions is a major goal. To achieve this goal, we need mechanisms to collect
    and process the diverse available data sources in real time. These data are generated
    by different technologies including but not limited to IoT, robotics, drones,
    climate forecasting services, and smartphones. SFOBA [19] is a platform for big
    data processing which provides real-time processing in many domains of agriculture.
    This platform integrates different data sources, data modeling, and software products
    to provide real-time data analysis in farming applications. Al-Thani et al. [89]
    investigated the set-up process for the use of a drone in monitoring sheep livestock.
    They also used image processing and ML models in a real field application. With
    the massive number of pictures from drones and new computer vision and deep learning
    models, it is possible to predict diseases and pests through greenhouses and farms.
    These technologies also can be used to estimate plant traits in real time [90].
    For example, in the autonomous greenhouse, it is possible to develop a model to
    estimate the leaf area, dry weight, and fresh weight of the lettuce [91]. Real-time
    data lead to real-time decisions and actions [48]. For example, agile actions
    can be carried out in sudden changes in operational conditions or other circumstances
    such as weather changes and disease prediction alerts. In addition, the use of
    IoT, cloud computing, remote sensing, biotechnology, and robotics is increasing
    in smart farming [48], transforming traditional into smart farming. These technologies
    can establish the networking of machines and control farm activities automatically
    and in real time [92]. As discussed, storing data at intermediate points at the
    “edge” of the network rather than always at the central server or data center
    leads to faster data processing and a shorter response time critical for real-time
    processing [93]. To analyze the large agriculture data collected from fields and
    reveal hidden patterns of interest from them, there is a need to develop forecasting
    models such as disease, pests, and yield prediction models. Machine learning models
    that were mostly used in the prediction include artificial neural network, support
    vector machine, and logistic regression [76]. These algorithms can be integrated
    with data analytics tools such as Map-Reduce and Spark for real-time analysis
    and better performance [19,76]. Utilizing edge computing provides another opportunity
    for data processing which is federated learning that can address a major concern
    in data processing for smart farming, which is data sharing. Many farmers prefer
    to keep their data private, decreasing their motivation to participate in collaborative
    learning activities. Alternatively, utilizing federated learning, the learning
    model is distributed to the edge nodes without sharing the farms’ data with a
    central unit in the system. This approach reduces data privacy concerns and encourages
    farmers to participate in cooperative learning processes. 4.5. Security and Privacy
    Security and privacy mechanisms are important requirements that should be considered
    throughout a smart farming platform [4]. There are several solutions to secure
    a smart farming platform against adversaries. Trust management is one of the mechanisms
    that can enhance the security and privacy of data in a smart farming platform.
    It enables a service provider to evaluate the trustworthiness of the actors in
    the system and to set some restrictions on the activities of low-trustable parties.
    AgriTrust [94] is a trust management approach designed for smart farming applications.
    This framework monitors the interactions in the system and updates trust metrics
    such as credibility, robustness, and reliability through time. Using this approach,
    smart farming devices broadcast their feedback on each transaction to the network,
    therefore, this feedback can be utilized by the trust management framework for
    trustworthiness evaluation. Another mechanism for security enhancement in smart
    farming is access control which is a mechanism to consider the policies and agreements
    to handle requests and access permissions. These permissions can be granted based
    on the roles and attributes or agreements. For example, Chukkapalli et al. [95]
    proposed an Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) in Smart Farming. ABAC utilizes
    policies that combine different attributes from different sources, including user,
    data, device, and environment, and provides fine-grained, flexible access management.
    In this study, the authors modeled a smart farming ecosystem with different agriculture
    sensors for temperature and soil monitoring, tractor and truck movement controls,
    as well as labor management, and presented a mechanism to handle access requests
    to data and devices. In smart farming scenarios, data are collected in the field
    and usually transferred to on-premise or cloud storage servers [96]. Different
    technologies are used for data transfer in agriculture, including Wi-Fi and cellular
    networks. To protect data from adversaries in the transfer stage, encryption is
    a common technique. For this purpose, the data are encrypted before transmission
    and then decoded at the destination. Wen Xue et al. [97] presented an encryption
    method for agricultural information systems. This method builds secure communication
    among users, farmers, and cloud servers. The statistical results in the paper
    showed that the presented method reduced the needed time for encryption as compared
    with other available methods. Another encryption method for smart farming applications
    was introduced by Ametepe et al. [98]. This study proposed a hybrid method combining
    two different cryptographic approaches, and then tested the presented method on
    a crop monitoring system. A platform for smart farming can leverage the mentioned
    solutions, including trust management, access control, and encrypted data transmission
    to ensure that security and privacy during all stages of smart farming procedures,
    as shown in Figure 2. Another state-of-the-art technology that can be used for
    enhancing security and privacy in smart farming is the blockchain. This technology
    has been used in some agriculture applications and could reshape smart farming
    ecosystems in the future. Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger that keeps
    the records of all previous transactions in a system [99]. In addition, this technology
    enables automatic procedure execution using smart contracts. A smart contract
    is a computer program that can be deployed on a blockchain platform to run some
    procedures automatically without human intervention [29]. In recent years, blockchain
    technology and smart contracts have been widely used in different smart farming
    applications, including trust management [100,101], water management [102,103],
    food traceability [104], and supply chain [105,106]. 4.6. Regulation and Policies
    Considering the available regulations and practices in agriculture, a mechanism
    for compliance with these rules is beneficial in a smart farming platform. The
    regulations related to smart farming cover different aspects of agriculture, including
    but not limited to, food security, biosecurity, climate change, and data governance.
    In the following, some of these regulations in different jurisdictions are briefly
    reviewed. The European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) [107] is a unified
    policy across Europe to support farmers and to improve agricultural productivity.
    This policy aims to improve the farming economy, address concerns regarding climate
    changes, and manage natural resource consumption. In smart farming applications,
    the policy supports technical progress to enhance agriculture productivity as
    well as reduce ecological footprints. Another objective for the CAP is to control
    the availability of supplies and to ensure that the prices of products are reasonable
    for both producers and customers. Another widely used regulation under the European
    Union’s jurisdiction is the European Union (EU) Code of Conduct on Agricultural
    Data Sharing by Contractual Agreement [108]. The Committee of Professional Agricultural
    Organizations (COPA) and the General Confederation of Agricultural Cooperatives
    (COGECA) published this code of conduct in 2020. This code mainly focuses on non-personal
    data collected on farms and leaves the personal data to be treated under other
    regulations. The code indicates that due to the nature of collected data in agriculture,
    it is impossible to define data ownership in the same way as physical objects
    and it suggests using different levels of rights. Therefore, the key step from
    this code’s point of view is a contract that determines the rights of all parties
    to protect their sensitive information, while all permissions related to data
    collection, access, and utilization are needed to be approved by the data originator.
    To evaluate the compliance of a product or service with this code, a checklist
    consisting of fifteen questions has been provided by the publishers. These questions
    specify the collected data and the rights to share, access, and use these data.
    In addition, several regulations related to smart farming are used in the U.S.
    jurisdiction. An example is the U.S. agricultural policy [109] which covers different
    aspects of agriculture such as trade, insurance, rural economic growth, bioenergy,
    and organic farming. This policy aims to support U.S. farmers, to enhance the
    productivity of the farming process, and to reduce negative environmental impact.
    Generally, in a five-year cycle, the farm acts are updated to govern agriculture,
    food, and rural development programs. In the context of smart farming, this policy
    considers different technologies such as GPS, computer mapping, guidance systems,
    and variable-rate technology [110]. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) [111]
    is another law related to smart farming in the USA. This act aims to enhance food
    safety and to prevent foodborne illness and has seven major rules ensuring responsibility
    and accountability of different parties that work in the agricultural sections.
    Different tools have been provided by the U.S. government to facilitate product
    tracing, build food defense plans, and create food safety plans. Another regulation
    related to smart farming in the U.S. jurisdiction is the Privacy and Security
    Principles for Farm Data (PSPFD) [112]. It was established by the American Farm
    Bureau Federation (AFBF) in 2014. The principles under this regulation are mostly
    around data ownership, consent, and disclosure. To ensure compliance with PSPFD,
    the AFBF has developed the Ag Data Transparency Evaluator. This tool assesses
    contracts among agriculture stakeholders against the principles provided in the
    PSPFD, and if the procedure is successful, the contract gets an Ag Data Transparency
    seal that informs the parties that it has been approved. Despite the efforts on
    regulations related to big data in smart farming, there are still some gaps in
    this field. One of the issues is the lack of comprehensive and unified regulations
    for agriculture data, while the available practices and a code of conduct are
    not compulsory. To make the most use of sources in digital agriculture, a smart
    farming platform needs to provide mechanisms ensuring compliance with available
    policies in smart farming. A smart farming platform should encourage the parties
    to trust the services provided and participate in collaborative practices that
    enhance the performance of data processing systems in agriculture applications.
    5. Conclusions Smart farming provides the agricultural industry with diverse data-driven
    services which improve different applications from farm to fork. These services
    benefit from a large amount of available data in smart farming ecosystems. However,
    a major challenge in smart farming information processing is consistency and compatibility
    among the utilized technologies, procedures, and protocols. To address this issue,
    in this paper, we suggest the platform approach which is a design thinking approach
    that encourages different actors in a smart farming ecosystem to facilitate collaboration
    among different services by following some requirements. Moreover, we suggest
    six requirements for a smart farming platform, including interoperability, real-time
    data processing, scalability, reliability, security, and compliance with farming
    regulations. Such a platform can enhance the available services in the agriculture
    industry by enabling collaboration among different service providers. Furthermore,
    such a platform facilitates data-sharing practices by reducing security and privacy
    concerns and providing a trustable environment for agriculture data holders. Currently,
    a major limitation to developing such a framework is the lack of unified protocols
    and standards, and more effort from technology providers and policymakers is needed
    to address this issue. In future work, we aim to develop and implement a sample
    of the proposed framework. To this end, we plan to utilize the available software
    and hardware products that follow similar protocols, and therefore, are compatible.

    Digital technology has the potential to eradicate extreme poverty and food insecurity
    to the majority of smallholder farmers in the world. This paper aims to identify
    knowledge gaps on digital technology for sustainable agriculture and assess their
    availability to smallholder farmers worldwide. The particular case of Tanzania
    receives special attention. We conducted an extensive literature search from relevant
    databases for review. The advanced digital technology in agriculture, mostly used
    by large scale farmers, significantly contributes to sustainable agriculture.
    However, the existing digital services for smallholder farmers lack sustainability
    in the agriculture context and hardly meet the needs for a comprehensive set of
    services in a complete farming cycle. In most developing countries, Tanzania case
    included, digital technology and services respond to a challenge at a particular
    stage of the farming process or to a specific value chain. Based on this literature
    review, we identify inequalities among large and small farmers, as well as environmental
    challenges caused by ICT itself. To conclude we provide suggestions for improvements
    for smallholder farmers: developing a digital platform that addresses smallholder
    farmers’ challenges in a complete farming cycle, bringing together the stakeholders
    at a country level, in order to achieve sustainable agriculture and support adoption
    of cutting-edge digital technology. These suggestions will be the starting point
    for future research. Keywords: digital technology; sustainable agriculture; smallholder

    Tanzania 1. Introduction The application of digital technologies in agriculture
    may eradicate extreme poverty and hunger in a yet constantly growing population—from
    2019 to 2050 the population will increase by 2 billion people [1]. In recent years,
    digitization has changed the way the society performs its social-economic activities
    particularly due to increased interconnections through the internet and affordable
    digital devices creating a global digital ecosystem [2]. Digitization is increasingly
    becoming an essential tool of production, business and services to recover the
    society from unexpected novel corona virus pandemic that has brought devastating
    impact on the social, economic and environmental aspects [3]. The use of digital
    technology has proved useful in various sectors worldwide, such as Malaysian industries
    [4], healthcare [5] or manufacturing [3]. In the agriculture sector, digital technology
    has increased profitability, enhanced the quality of the products and somehow
    preserved the environment [6]. The current “Industry 4.0 digital transformations”
    apply advanced technology in the agricultural field for a more precise and real-time
    decision making in farming activities [7]. This new era of digital technology
    in agriculture uses knowledge from different disciplines, which include information
    science, computer and software engineering, environmental science, remote sensing,
    geographical positioning systems (GIS), crop and soil science and global positioning
    systems (GPS) [8]. The farm management system uses modern technologies such as
    artificial intelligence (AI), sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT), satellite
    images to collect data, big data and machine learning, contributing to higher
    productivity and profitability in this sector [6]. However, most small and medium-sized
    farmers cannot afford to adopt such modern technology for sustainable agriculture,
    which is contrary to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) principle
    of “leaving no one behind” [9]. Smallholder farmers generate enormous employment
    and income worldwide while producing over 70% of the world’s food needs [10].
    In Tanzania, the agriculture sector is the backbone of the economy with 26.7%
    of the GDP, employing more than 80% of the population, and women constitute 60%
    of the farm workforce [11,12]. Many scientists and organizations have used different
    approaches to enable digital technology by smallholder farmers to increase productivity
    and income. Efforts include developing mobile and online services that allow smallholder
    farmers to access various services such as weather information, farming information
    and knowledge, market information, and reliable buyers for their products [13,14].
    According to Boyera and Grewal [15], and Gray et al. [16], digital technology
    and digital farmers profiling platforms for smallholder farmers could help farmers
    access essential services and improve productivity. However, despite all those
    efforts, the sustainability of these projects remains a significant challenge
    for achieving sustainable agriculture [10]. Furthermore, the application of digital
    technology requires the study of the value chain to meet the needs of services
    in the context of the farmer ecosystem. This paper is part of a larger research
    project to harness digital technology for sustainable agriculture in Tanzania,
    which aims to identify knowledge gaps on digital technology and services available
    to smallholder farmers and sustainability in agriculture. Moreover, it suggests
    digital solutions for smallholder farmers towards sustainable agriculture in developing
    countries. The subject aligns with the United Nations SDGs, such as eradicating
    poverty and hunger, sustainable cities and communities, climate action and reducing
    inequality [9]. Developing new digital comprehensive artifacts could solve the
    existing problems of digital exclusion of smallholder farmers, such as access
    to credit, farming knowledge, farm inputs, government services and control, and
    the market for their products [17,18,19,20]. Responsible agriculture actors could
    adopt the artifact according to their country context. Therefore, this review
    addresses the following questions: What digital technology and services are available
    to support the agriculture sector? What is the relationship between digital technology
    and sustainable agriculture? How do smallholder farmers fit in? What is the state-of-the-art
    use of digital technology and services by smallholder farmers in Tanzania? What
    challenges need to be addressed in relation to the above questions? The last question
    concerns the future research agenda and will be further developed in a subsequent
    publication. In this paper we focused on digital technologies and services in
    agriculture, with a specific emphasis on smallholder farmers and sustainability.
    We organized this paper as follows. Section 2 describes the authors’ methods to
    select papers for this review. Section 3 reviews related works that answer the
    above first three questions, which guides this review. Section 4 responds to the
    fourth question; it analyzes and synthesizes gaps regarding the availability of
    digital technologies and sustainable agriculture (as defined in this paper) to
    smallholder farmers. Section 5 concludes with a summary of the review and suggests
    future work. 2. Research Methods We used PRISMA guideline in this study [21],
    which is a standard protocol and an evidence-based framework for doing systematic
    review studies. We conducted an extensive literature search based on a complex
    query in the Web of Science (WoS), IEEE Xplore and related databases (Food and
    Agriculture Organization, Google Scholar and Research4Life). The aim was to find
    and review the latest literature in digital technology and sustainable agriculture
    in relation to smallholder farmers. The researchers combined the following keywords
    using the Boolean operators (“AND” and “OR”) and parentheses during the search:
    digital technology, ICT services, smart farming, precision agriculture, digital
    farmer profiling, smallholder farmers and sustainable agriculture. The final search
    string was “(‘digital technology’ OR ‘ICT services’ OR ‘precision agriculture’
    OR ‘smart farming’ OR ‘digital farmer profiling’) AND ‘sustainable agriculture’
    AND ‘smallholder farmers’”. However, the search string could not yield good results
    to FAO database due to type and differences in functionality. We conducted a search
    in October and November 2021, obtained and imported a total number of 1981 articles
    to Mendeley Desktop reference manager software (https://www.mendeley.com, accessed
    on 4 October 2021). We applied exclusion criteria to the obtained results to identify
    relevant papers in digital technology, smallholder farmers and sustainable agriculture.
    We restricted the obtained results to the year of publication from 2015 to 2021
    to get the latest articles in the subject area. We filtered out duplicated papers
    (using duplicate function in Mendeley software), articles without full text and
    not written in English. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) modern digital
    technologies in agriculture (e.g., smart farming, digital farmer services) including
    the sustainability components (economic, environmental and sustainability of the
    ICTs infrastructure and resources) and (ii) availability of the technology to
    smallholder farmers. Finally, we selected a total of 36 articles: 24 articles
    on global literature (21 for recent digital technologies and sustainable agriculture,
    three on general digital service platforms developed for smallholder farmers)
    and 12 for the Tanzanian case. We separately searched the literature in the Tanzanian
    case in local repositories (Sokoine University of Agriculture Institutional Repository),
    WoS and Google Scholar. In this search, we did not limit the literature by the
    year of publication to obtain more detailed background information in the country’s
    ICTs and smallholder farmers’ services. We obtained 18 articles from local repositories
    for analysis as the result of the complex query “digital technology” OR “ICT services”
    AND “smallholder farmers” OR “agriculture” AND “Tanzania”. We selected 12 articles
    for the review after filtering five articles which were similar to articles from
    Google Scholar and WoS, (see Table 1). Table 1. Reviewed literature under PRISMA
    guideline. 3. Results We present the results of this paper in response to the
    research questions. First, the results of the digital technology and services
    available to support the agriculture sector worldwide. Second, the results of
    the relationships between digital technology and sustainable agriculture, focusing
    on smallholder farmers inclusion in digital transformation. Furthermore, we re-defined
    sustainable agriculture in the context of this paper to address the identified
    gaps in existing literature. Finally, the results of the Tanzania case current
    status in the use of digital technologies in agriculture and challenges towards
    sustainable agriculture. 3.1. Digital Technology and Services in Agriculture For
    a long time, the agriculture sector has embraced new technologies to increase
    production and profitability while improving the environment. The Organization
    for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines digital technologies
    as: “ICTs (information communication technologies), including the Internet, mobile
    technologies and devices, as well as data analytics used to improve the generation,
    collection, exchange, aggregation, combination, analysis, access, searchability
    and presentation of digital content, including for the development of services
    and apps” [22]. Farmers use digital technologies in different domains of agriculture
    (summarized in Table 2). These domains include digital technology for farm management,
    financial services, market services, and farming knowledge and information services.
    Additionally, some digital platforms provide all essential services to farmers
    in the farming ecosystem. Many ICTs projects for farmers at the country level
    offer solutions to a particular farming problem, mainly for a specific value chain.
    Table 2. A summary of digital services for farmers. 3.1.1. Farm Management The
    current industry 4.0 digital transformation in agriculture integrates IoT, cyber-physical
    systems, AI, Big Data, Machine Learning and Cloud computing with agricultural
    machinery [45]. It is more common to precision agriculture whereby innovative
    ICT solutions and IoT components such as sensors monitor spatial and temporal
    variability in farm production [7,46]. Site-specific farm management provides
    an understanding of soil and crop characteristics unique to each field, thus enabling
    farmers to apply farm inputs (such as irrigation, fertilizers, pesticides and
    herbicides) in small portions where needed for the most economical production
    [47]. Controlled farm inputs increase farm productivity and profitability and
    conserve the environment, promoting sustainable agriculture development [48].
    Precision agriculture and smart farming rely on data management to make valuable
    decisions. The embedded digital technology components can be categorized into
    three phases: (1) data collection (IoT), (2) data management and analysis, and
    (3) decision making and variable rate technology (actuation) [6]. Data Collection—IoT
    IoT in agriculture uses sensors—devices used to collect data from the field for
    easy monitoring of the crops and other digital tools to collect essential data
    for profitable decision-making in farming [6]. The sensors are mounted in the
    mobile farm machinery or fixed in the field, such as a local weather station.
    For instance, Kilin [23], used a network of automated stations in the vineyards
    to detect areas affected by pathogens for site-specific application of pesticides.
    The stations collect real-time data such as airborne particles, temperature and
    relative humidity of the air and soil, solar irradiance, spores, and leaf humidity.
    AI is then used to analyze the spatio-temporal heterogeneity data based on optical
    particle counters (OPC) to identify areas affected by the pathogen (i.e., Plasmopara
    viticola) [23]. The results allow farmers to apply pesticides in specific field
    zones leading to cost-effective, healthy products and environmentally friendly
    farming practices. Saiz-Rubio [6], classified sensors into three: remote sensing,
    aircraft, and proximal sensing. Remote sensing, most often satellites, has been
    an essential tool for collecting field data in smart farming. The satellites used
    to provide agricultural data include WorldView 2 and WorldView 3 multispectral
    satellite sensors using Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI) standard
    [24,49]. Furthermore, the European Sentinel 2 satellite system, which gives access
    to 10 m 4-band multispectral data for “NDVI imagery of soil and water, covers
    the Earth every 10 days; the American Landsat satellites provide spectral data
    from the Earth each 16 to 18 days” [6,49]. Aircraft sensing, usually “remotely-piloted
    aircraft (RPA) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)” such as drones, capture field
    data at a closer distance of up to 100 m, contrary to the order of 700 km of satellites
    [2]. Although aircraft sensing is expensive and requires high skills to generate
    quality field data, they are flexible and reach field areas where other equipment
    cannot. Proximal sensing is the latest technology based on “autonomous ground
    systems”, promising new agriculture transformation [2]. According to Saiz-Rubio
    [2], in comparison to remote and aircraft sensing, proximal sensing monitors the
    crop in the ground at less than 2 m between a crop scanned and sensor. The payload
    of sensors is placed in ground vehicles that move around the field to collect
    accurate and quality data from the crops. Proximal sensing allows a real-time
    application, such as applying fertilizer where needed and spraying herbicides
    and pesticides where weeds or pests have been detected [25]. Robotic technology
    in farming is another area of interest and part of proximal sensing where unmanned
    ground vehicles (UGV) collect data and manage various farm activities [26]. The
    farmers use UGVs for soil analysis, seeding, transplanting, harvesting and crop
    scouting. Thus, UGVs allow a continuous field data collection process to monitor
    crop status and growth conditions [50]. VineRobot and Vinescount, funded by the
    European Commission, are examples of robotic technologies in smart farming that
    monitors vineyards by collecting data from the vines’ canopy and creating water
    and nutrition status maps [6]. Industries manufacturing agricultural tools are
    also producing scouting robots. For example, Rowbot Systems LLC of USA introduced
    a multitask robotic platform to map crop growth zones, apply fertilizer and other
    related tasks [27]. Another example is the robot Oz the autonomous weeding and
    seeding [51]. Data Management and Analysis A digital system receives data from
    different IoT devices and helps generate meaningful information for production.
    Large scale and commercial farmers use farm management information systems (FMIS)
    to acquire data, store, analyze and manipulate data in precision and smart farming.
    FMIS enables farmers to manage various farming activities from the initial planning
    stage to harvest and record important information of the performed activities
    [28]. Farmers can extract information such as field maps to determine crop and
    field conditions necessary for actions related to minimal use of resources, compliance
    with standards, and quality of agriculture production. There are different FMIS
    on the market (most are proprietary) with various features to manage farm generated
    data. The systems manage farm operations based on data acquired and processed
    automatically for planning, monitoring, supporting decision-making and keeping
    valuable records [29]. Hrustek [7], mentioned that FMIS records critical information,
    including “harvests and yields, profits and losses, farm task scheduling, weather
    prediction, soil nutrients transport and field mapping”. A few examples of FMIS
    are ADAPT, Agrivi, Agroptima, Farmleap, owned mainly by companies from developed
    countries. More advanced FMIS provides early warning, financial management and
    integrates other actors such as input suppliers and product distributors. Decision-Making
    and Variable Rate Applications Farmers need to decide on the vast volume of collected
    data, considering different field parameters. Managing such complex data manually
    is difficult, time-consuming and possible for ineffective decision-making. [7].
    Hrustek [7], added that farmers could use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
    learning to support decision-making in agriculture through available big data.
    Wolfert [30], argued that agriculture has many areas for applying different AI
    technologies. For instance, Giusti and Marsili-Libelli [31] developed a decision
    support system (DSS) based on fuzzy logic to manage irrigation considering the
    soil characteristic and type of crop. Additionally, Bazzani [52] developed a decision-support
    system (DSS) that analyzes short- and long-term availability of water based on
    soil type, machinery and irrigation systems. Furthermore, Rupnik et al. [32],
    developed AgroDSS cloud-based DSS that allow farmers to upload data or integrate
    with FMIS through an application programming interface (API) to get different
    output decisions such as farm pest management. The variable rate technology (VRT)
    has made it possible for the decision to be made autonomously. According to Hrustek
    [3], actuation is the execution of activities in the field following decision
    making from collected data. VRT includes robots used to perform different farm
    activities (farm preparation, planting, pest and weed control, fertilization,
    harvesting) previously conducted by human labor or conventional farm machines
    [24,31]. The variable-rate device receives commands from a computerized DSS. It
    performs various farming tasks such as applying fertilizer, pesticides and herbicides
    in the specific field zones where needed (real-time applications) and harvesting
    [53]. A few examples of VRT machines include the automated yield monitoring system
    II (AYMS II) made of unique “eye” color cameras and real-time kinematics-GPS for
    wild blueberry harvesting [54]. A sensor-based variable rate nitrogen fertilizer
    (VRNF) measures nitrogen with a multispectral sensor and fertilizer spreader mounted
    on a tractor, for real-time application conforming to the measured nitrogen in
    the crop [33]. The CLAAS VRT is used to apply nitrogen fertilizer, compatible
    with the “ISARIA” sensor [7]. VRT increases production and preserves ecological
    balance through efficient farm inputs, i.e., less crop fertilizer and chemicals
    [55]. Figure 1 presents the three main categories of smart farming data life cycle.
    Figure 1. Smart farming data life cycle inspired by Saiz-Rubio and Rovira-Más
    [2]. 3.1.2. Financial Services Smallholder farmers face the challenge of access
    to financial services affecting agriculture production and income of many rural
    communities in developing countries [17]. Digital technology is an essential tool
    for improving access to finance and the commercialization of smallholder agriculture.
    A study on the awareness and use of m-banking (mobile banking) shows that most
    smallholder farmers in Kenya use the technology to access finance for agriculture-related
    activities [34]. Kirui [34], concluded that m-banking enables smallholder farmers
    to access investment capital for purchasing quality seeds, farm machinery, fertilizer
    and pesticides, leading to increased production and income. The Association for
    People of Haryana (AFPOH) is an ICT-based agriculture initiative in India that
    enables most smallholder farmers to access finance for improved agriculture [35].
    Different countries embrace digital technology to allow the commercialization
    of smallholder agriculture as poverty alleviation and food security strategy.
    Furthermore, agriculture insurance is an essential service for smallholder farmers.
    The farmers normally encounter various production and market risks which lower
    their income and ability to produce year after year. Hess and Hazell [36], mentioned
    natural disasters such as extreme droughts, floods, hurricanes and pest outbreaks
    are common risks for smallholders. The risks cause severe impacts in economic
    development which leads to extreme poverty. In the past, governments and organizations
    designed several insurances to help small farmers towards sustainable agriculture.
    However, agricultural stakeholder and organizations considers index-based agricultural
    insurance as more effective for smallholder farmers in developing countries [37,38].
    Still, majority smallholder farmers particularly in Africa have no access to insurance.
    For instance, approximately 650,000 farmers have access to insurance in Africa
    out of around 40 million smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan African alone. [36].
    The current trend of climatic change requires financial investment for agriculture
    transformation, including increasing availability and access to credit and insurance
    by smallholder farmers [56]. 3.1.3. Knowledge and Information Services Dissemination
    of agriculture information and knowledge is a critical move towards improved farming.
    Most smallholder farmers lack farming information and knowledge, so they rely
    on friends, family, and experience, resulting in low production [57]. Access to
    data in a complete farming cycle, from farm preparations, inputs, finance, harvesting
    and market of the products, creates high value in the commercialization of smallholder
    agriculture. Ali et al. [39], examined the critical information needs of farmers
    in Pakistan and developed a digital solution to deliver weather forecasts, pesticides
    and fertilizer information. E-agriculture initiatives in India emphasize disseminating
    information to most rural smallholder farmers through ICT, including management
    information systems, knowledge management systems and expert systems [35]. Sanga
    et al. [58], developed an information dissemination system to enable smallholder
    farmers to access critical farming information and knowledge from experts, bridging
    the gap of extension services through ICT. Scientists and organizations have developed
    mobile applications to disseminate different crops and livestock information.
    For instance, Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) has
    produced more than fourteen mobile applications for crops and livestock to help
    farmers access information and adopt modern farming techniques for increased production
    [40]. 3.1.4. Market Services Most large scale farmers use advanced FMIS, which
    provide linkage to critical services, including the market [42]. For instance,
    we can mention the combination of different methodologies to design information
    integration in the Netherlands for information sharing that supports the food
    supply chain—a movement of food into various stages from farmers to consumers
    and movement of money paid for the food by the consumers back to the farmers via
    the same steps in the reverse direction [59]. Wolfert et al. [59] argue that big
    data in smart farming is appealing as farmers can either be part of the closed,
    proprietary systems or of an open, collaborative system. A proprietary system
    is a highly integrated system of stakeholders bounded by terms and conditions.
    In contrast, with “open, collaborative systems” farmers are free to choose any
    stakeholder as business partners in a food supply chain. In either of the two
    (closed or open) scenarios, the food supply system enables farmers to exchange
    information with other actors in a supply chain (two-way traffic), harnessing
    essential knowledge for production based on consumer needs and other factors in
    the supply chain. Smallholder farmers face the challenge of market access for
    their products [42,60]. Intermediaries force farmers to sell their products at
    a low price, resulting in unprofitable production. Thanks to ICT, smallholder
    farmers can access market information and participate in better-paying agricultural
    production. Market access is one of the critical components in e-agriculture initiatives
    in India. Rural farmers are linked to the market and get fair prices, improving
    income and sustainable life [35]. ICT related cases in Africa include “eSoko”
    in Ghana, “Tru Trade” in Uganda and “mFarming” in Kenya, Ghana and Tanzania [43].
    These programs address the challenge of access to market information and fair
    price for smallholder farmers’ products. Furthermore, Nigeria’s “E-Wallet Scheme”
    enables smallholder farmers to access subsidized inputs through mobile phones.
    Meanwhile, “E-Krishok and Zero Hunger” in Bangladesh and “Farmes’ Advisory Information
    System” in Tanzania provides extension services to farmers, mainly advising farmers
    on farm input products [41,42,43,58,61]. These and many other related efforts
    not included in this paper are promising ICT initiatives for smallholder farmers
    access to the market. 3.1.5. e-Government Services in Agriculture Governments
    play a fundamental role in developing any economic sector, including agriculture.
    For a long time, most governments have provided various services in agriculture,
    most often through extension agents responsible for linking with farmers [62].
    However, several limitations to using extension agents include the difficulty
    of reaching the many smallholder farmers scattered throughout the rural areas,
    the inability to deliver multiple agriculture services to farmers and the high
    involved costs [63]. Governments have a central role of monitoring, controlling
    and bringing together agricultural stakeholders for services deliverance at a
    single access point; thus, promoting digital technology for sustainable agriculture
    at a country level. OECD [22], mentioned that ICT promotes government transparency
    and accountability to the community. Therefore, e-government provides opportunities
    for the government to deliver multiple, coordinated and timely services under
    one roof through a network of agricultural actors. Ntaliani et al. [64] assessed
    the potential of e-government in the agricultural sector which suggests that government
    should use the e-government model to offer services to farmers and rural communities.
    The Indian government, through the ministry of agriculture, supports various ICT
    programs for smallholder farmers to access essential services such as farm inputs,
    financial services, subsidies and market for increased production and income [35].
    3.1.6. Digital Farmer Profiling Platforms and Services Apart from precision agriculture
    and smart farming, many ICT services provide isolated solutions packages to farmers’
    needs. Digital farmer profiling is a business model developed in the past few
    years to provide essential solutions to smallholder farmers’ needs. The platform
    service manages farmers’ data based on blockchain technology to allow farmers
    to share their data with other stakeholders (such as credit and insurance companies)
    [16]. Digital farmers profiling seems promising in service delivery to the smallholder
    farmers. Studies in Africa, Asia and Latin America show how digital farmers profiling
    enables smallholders to access essential services such as financial services and
    marketing of their products [10,15,65,66]. Service providers manage the data (for
    a fee) on behalf of other actors, including the farmers. Despite the long debate
    over who owns the data (between service providers and farmers), Grameen Foundation—as
    experienced experts in the farmer profiling platform business model, has stated
    that sustainability of the project is a significant challenge once the project
    fund ends [16]. In addition, Boyera and Grewal [15] concluded that each country
    and value in the crop or livestock chain would have its approach to implementing
    a farmer profiling platform. 3.2. Digital Technology and Sustainable Agriculture
    According to Bhakta et al. [53], Giray and Catal [67], sustainable agriculture
    refers to agricultural practices that ensure long-term increased farm production
    and farmers’ income while protecting the environment. Precision agriculture and
    smart farming present a high level of sustainability using the most cutting edge
    technology to control farm inputs such as fertilizers, irrigation, herbicides
    and pesticides [6]. Farmers apply farm inputs to only parts of the field that
    need, thus improving product quality, reducing input cost, increasing productivity,
    preserving the environment, and achieving economic and environmental sustainability
    [7,67]. Social sustainability in agriculture results from economic and ecological
    sustainability, whereby, refers to the availability of enough food for all people,
    animals, and plant species in the world [7]. Literature on sustainable agriculture
    mainly focuses on agricultural operations and business models for increased profit
    while minimizing the use of agrochemicals to promote a healthy environment and
    higher production quality. The new “fog computing model” is useful for a clean
    environment in smart agriculture. Unlike cloud computing, the fog computing model
    reduces carbon emissions through energy-efficient digital hardware and renewable
    energy resources since data are processed closer to where it is collected [68].
    In addition to previous sustainability approaches, this paper focuses on the fundamental
    component of sustainable agriculture in the digital era: the sustainability of
    infrastructures and resources that support digital agriculture services for smallholder
    farmers. Thus, this paper categorizes sustainable agriculture into three main
    topics: (i) sustainability of the infrastructure and resources offering digital
    services, (ii) economic sustainability—long-term increased productivity and profitability,
    and (iii) environmental sustainability—conservation ecology and minimizing ICT
    pollution through green computing (Table 3). Table 3. Sustainable agriculture.
    The literature review provides current status digital technology for sustainable
    agriculture, services available for smallholder farmers and Tanzania’s case. Most
    established digital services for smallholder farmers lack environmental sustainability
    and sustainability of the infrastructure and resources that support the services.
    Some of the services in developing countries propose charging farmers and other
    beneficiaries to achieve sustainability of the services. For instance, the farmer
    profiling platform business model suggests that service providers receive revenue
    through interest paid on credit by farmers, commission on farm inputs and fees
    charged from buyers of the farm produce [16]. Although the model may achieve sustainability
    of the digital services, the burden cost is primarily on farmers, limiting the
    economic sustainability of individual farmers and farmers’ organizations. Table
    4 presents the availability of general digital transformations and agriculture
    sustainability to smallholder farmers. Table 4. Digital services, smallholder
    farmers and agriculture sustainability. 3.3. Digital Technology and Tanzanian
    Agriculture The Tanzanian government has consistently supported smallholder farmers
    and the agriculture sector. Since the 1960s, the government introduced 16 National
    Agriculture Input Voucher Systems (NAIVS) for farmers to access and use modern
    farm inputs (seeds and fertilizers) through contracted agro-dealers for improved
    production and income [70]. However, due to lack of government control, cheating
    and fraud, contracted agro-dealers sell the subsidized inputs at full market price,
    leading to deficient programs’ impact on farmers [71]. Indeed, since the adoption
    of ICTs in the national development plans in 2003, many ICTs related projects
    have been conducted to address various challenges in the agricultural sector.
    Generally, the target areas are agricultural information dissemination by agricultural
    research institutions (ARIs) and extension services to farmers and farmers organizations
    (FOs) [13,14]. The increased use of mobile technologies also triggered projects
    on mobile farm services such as Global System for Mobile Association (GSMA) “Mobile
    for Development” projects and mobile applications to support farmers in different
    value chains [14], mobile application for poultry farmers [72], and mobile decision
    support systems [73,74]. Furthermore, the design of farmers digital advisory service
    called “Ushauri” to provide access to context-specific information from extension
    agents increases capabilities in decision-making and adaptation to changing environments
    [75]. These digital services don’t meet the needs of a farmer’s entire ecosystem;
    nor are they sustainable, as some of the mentioned services don’t exist due to
    lack of sustainability plans or because farmers do not use the service. Digital
    technology intervention could attenuate the challenges and improve smallholder
    farmers’ access to services for increased production and income. Table 5 presents
    the summary of existing digital artifact solutions and services addressing some
    challenges of farmers in Tanzania. Table 5. A summary of digital services to farmers
    in Tanzania. Despite all the efforts, smallholder farmers in Tanzania still face
    many challenges in accessing services from other actors in a farmer ecosystem.
    Challenges include access to credit [19,76], substandard agricultural inputs from
    uncertified agro-dealers [77,79,80], unfair market prices due to the involvement
    of middlemen and lack of government oversight [14,60,81,82]. 4. Discussion This
    paper emphasized the digital technology and services in agriculture, focusing
    on the smallholder farmers’ participation in sustainable agriculture. So far,
    similar to other sectors such as manufacturing industries, agriculture sector
    is undergoing major digital transformations through the application of cutting-edge
    digital technologies. Inequalities: It is also important to note that digital
    transformations in agriculture are highly characterized by digital inequalities
    between large- and small-scale farmers, and between high-income and low-income
    countries. Governments, researchers, organizations and other stakeholders need
    to address factors leading to digital inequalities for smallholders to engage
    into sustainable agriculture. Sustainable agriculture by smallholder farmers require
    digital solutions for solving common challenges, which need strong commitment
    and collaboration among agricultural stakeholders at a country level, and then
    the adoption of advanced digital solutions such as precision technology. Technology
    advancements create possibilities for solving many social-economic challenges
    that the world faces. Smart agriculture is the latest technology that uses the
    most advanced tools and software such as remote sensing, big data, IoT, information
    systems, AI, decision support system (DSS) and variable rate application (VRA)
    in farm management [6,7,53]. However, these digital advancements in agriculture
    are not equally available around the globe due to different social-economic factors.
    While developed countries are fast-moving in cutting-edge agricultural technologies
    (agriculture 4.0), developing countries are lagging, leading to low production
    and environmentally unfriendly practices [83,84]. Some of the developing countries
    are making steps towards precision agriculture. For instance, Bangladesh’s online
    fertilizer recommendation system (OFRS) enables smallholder farmers to efficiently
    apply fertilizer for sustainable agriculture production [44]. A review study shows
    opportunities for adopting precision agriculture by smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan
    Africa (SSA). Nevertheless, these technologies are mostly experimental and mainly
    used by large-scale commercial farms in few SSA countries [85]. ICT—an environmental
    concern: The uneven adoption of new technologies in agriculture affects more than
    one billion smallholder farmers worldwide, which the FAO considers the world’s
    largest food producer by 70% [16]. Nonetheless, precision agriculture is challenged
    by the environmental sustainability issues caused by ICT. Therefore, green computing—“maximizing
    the efficiency of computing resources and minimizing environmental impact” [86],
    could be more useful to smallholder farmers due to its reduced costs and economic
    and environmental sustainability. The most established digital agriculture services
    have sustainability issues and exclude smallholder farmers. Challenges: Despite
    the promising developments in technology, digital services in agriculture are
    yet to achieve complete sustainability. As the latest digital transformation,
    precision agriculture lacks the component of green computing, causing environmentally
    unfriendly practices. Precision agriculture is also poorly adopted by farmers,
    especially in developing countries, leaving most smallholder farmers behind in
    sustainable agriculture, in addition to the fact that, in general, small farms
    produce proportionally more greenhouse gas emissions than very large ones [87].
    Furthermore, ICT infrastructure and resources sustainability are fundamental components
    for long-term agricultural production and profitability. Profiling platform: A
    digital farmer profiling platform business model was recently designed to enable
    smallholder farmers’ access to different services for increased production and
    income [10,15,16]. The model could achieve economic sustainability, but service
    providers charging smallholder farmers directly and indirectly for infrastructure
    and resources sustainability affect farmers’ profit margins. Lack of government
    participation in the model could lead to unsolved smallholder farmers challenges
    to some countries where government, for example, should control market price and
    subsidies to targeted poor farming communities. Digital farmer profiling also
    lacks environmental sustainability components. Summary: Many large-scale farmers
    such as commercial farmers, wholesalers, traders and exporters have long invested
    in the use of ICT with well-developed farm inputs and market functions. For instance,
    precision agriculture uses advanced technology such as farm management information
    systems (FMIS), social networks and other complex customer and farm management
    systems [42]. Therefore, large-scale farmers are not often confronted with the
    sustainability of ICT infrastructure and resources as they cooperate in the business
    plan for investment. Digital services for smallholder farmers usually are established
    by the stakeholders such as the government, donors, commercial service providers,
    scientists and public–private partnerships; thus, the modality requires a proper
    mechanism for sustaining the infrastructure and other resources supporting the
    services. Furthermore, the literature places more emphasis on economic and less
    onenvironmental sustainability. Engineers should also prioritize green computing
    when developing digital services for ecological sustainability in agriculture.
    The current digital technology systems in smart farming use cloud computing model
    to manage voluminous data through data centers. However, the data centers are
    highly wasteful in terms of expenses, energy consumptions and carbon emissions
    [88]. Furthermore, ICT hardware has an immense effect on the environment throughout
    its life cycle. The manufacturing phase involves using rare earth metals extracted
    under unfavorable environmental practices, which causes water, soil and air pollution,
    with high energy consumption in the use phase and e-waste produced in the final
    phase [89]. The cloud computing model commonly used in precision agriculture has
    also an immense negative impact on the environment due to carbon emission from
    data centers that host massive data [68]. To achieve the component of environmental
    sustainability, engineers propose using energy-efficient hardware, using renewable
    energy such as solar and wind, recycling e-waste and designing new tools such
    as cooling systems and datacenters with minimal impact to the environment [86,89,90,91].
    We acknowledge the environmental impact of solar panels in their production and
    disposal phases; however, our focus is on the usage phase. 5. Conclusions 5.1.
    Literature Summary This article provides an overview of the current status of
    digital technology and services available in agriculture sector, their contribution
    to sustainable agriculture and relationship to smallholder farmers. The digital
    technology varies from simple mobile and web-based applications, mostly for smallholders
    to complex autonomous, information and cyber-physical systems used by large scale
    farmers. Digital transformation seems promising and changing all aspects of life
    in different disciplines, leading to new business models, services and products.
    The use of digital technology in agriculture may solve the challenge of food insecurity
    in yet a constant population increase in the world. The literature analysis has
    shown that sustainable agriculture is a reality through digital technology and
    services. However, the cutting-edge digital technology in agriculture (smart farming)
    is not accessible to smallholder farmers who, despite their small size, produce
    over 70% of the world’s food. The existing digital models for smallholder farmers,
    including the Tanzanian case, lack vital components of sustainable agriculture.
    They mainly address the needs of smallholder farmers at a particular stage of
    a farming cycle, such as farm preparations. Furthermore, the services are primarily
    for a specific country and crop value chain; examples are Tanzania (Table 5) and
    Kenya’s KALRO mobile applications for different crops and livestock. We found
    that the literature relates sustainable agriculture more with the precision technology.
    However, is it always needed, especially real-time precision agriculture, or sustainability
    can be achieved with other means? For instance, smallholder farmers are often
    reluctant in adopting precision technology even in developed countries [92], where
    management differs greatly between large and small farms. Perhaps establishing
    advisory services specifically for smallholder farms can be more efficient than
    using precision technology that communicates directly with the producer. Indeed,
    we believe that if smallholder farmers can access financial services (credit and
    insurance), quality farm inputs, subsidies, advisory services and market, they
    can increase production and profitability, adhere to environmentally friendly
    farming practices hence sustainable agriculture. Therefore, organizing agriculture
    stakeholders (including the government) at a country level and developing digital
    solutions that address common challenges of smallholder farmers could lead to
    sustainable agriculture and adoption of precision farming in developing countries.
    The limitation of this study is emphasized in identifying smallholder challenges
    towards sustainable agriculture in Tanzania case and proposing digital solutions.
    The needs of smallholder farmers may differ among countries and could need a thorough
    study to adopt the proposed digital solutions in a particular country’s context.
    Additionally, the study focused more in crop farming, thus, did not cover digital
    technologies used for instance in livestock management. 5.2. Towards a Comprehensive
    Digital Platform for Sustainable Agriculture in Smallholders Farms In the future,
    we plan to design and implement a digital platform for smallholder farmers to
    access all essential services (subsidies, credit, insurance, government services,
    market and farming information) under one roof. The platform will address the
    needs of smallholder farmers in a complete farming cycle—from farm preparations,
    farm inputs, harvesting and post-harvesting activities by consolidating agriculture
    stakeholders at a country level. The platform will also adhere to all critical
    components of sustainable agriculture, namely the sustainability of digital infrastructure
    and resources offering the services, economic and environmental sustainability.

    Agriculture is a broad term referring to occupations concerned with the cultivation
    of soil for producing crop and raising livestock to provide food, wool, and many
    other products. Human civilization has been significantly influenced by the advancements
    in agricultural practices. Shift from foraging to farming during Neolithic era
    improved nutrition, increased life-span, and decreased workload of human. History
    suggests that most powerful civilizations of world has well-developed and established
    agriculture sector. Agriculture supports human society not only by providing food
    and raw material for industries but also by providing employment. In current scenario,
    agriculture embraces more prominence than earlier times due to ever-increasing
    population and dwindling natural resources. According to Food and Agricultural
    Organization (FAO) the global population will reach nearly 9.6 billion people
    by 2050 (FAO 2009). Feeding such a huge population will require an increase of
    about 70% in agriculture output worldwide (Zhang et al. 2018). Last few decades
    have also seen decrease in total agricultural land. In 1991 total cultivated agricultural
    land was around 19.5 million square miles which accounted for about 39.47% of
    the earth surface. The cultivated land decreased to 18.6 million square miles
    (nearly 37.73% of the earth surface) by 2013 (World Bank 2016). Thus, agriculture
    sector is facing a formidable task of increasing production with less available
    agricultural land. Additionally, future of agriculture sector is also challenged
    by climate change. The change in climate is believed to adversely affect crop
    production and health of livestock (Arora 2019). Change in global temperature,
    water availability pattern, soil erosion, and frequent outbreak of disease and
    pest is expected to decrease overall agriculture output in coming decades. Such
    an extraordinary increase in the production under limited land resource and challenges
    from climate changes can only be achieved by modernization and intensification
    of agricultural practices. Intensification of agricultural practices with traditional
    approaches has significantly increased the environmental footprint of agriculture.
    Extensive use of water, fertilizers, weedicides, herbicides, pesticides, and changes
    in land use practice has raised several environment-related concerns (Lampridi
    et al. 2019). Current trend indicates that agriculture sector can achieve formidable
    target of feeding rapidly increasing global population in sustainable manner by
    embarrassing Industry 4.0 technologies, application, and solution. Industry 4.0
    or fourth industrial revolution helped in achieving higher level of operational
    efficiency and productivity by use of contemporary smart technologies. Farms that
    choose to be technology-driven in some way or other exhibited several advantages,
    such as saving money and labor, having an increased production or a reduction
    of costs with minimal effort and producing quality food with more environment
    friendly practices (Zhang et al. 2018). Díez (2017) advocated that larger use
    of smart farming services is vital not only for improving a financial condition
    of farmers but also to meet the food needs of an expanding population. Smart farming
    encompasses modern technologies like computer mapping, guidance, and variable-rate
    equipment during cultivation, harvesting, and post-harvest processing. Smart agriculture
    technologies apply input whenever and wherever required (Saiz-Rubio and Rovira-Más
    2020). This enables food production in a sustainable manner. Hence, smart agriculture
    is seen as promising strategy to accomplish future demand on sustainable pathway.
    Smart technologies have enabled precision agriculture feasible for progressive
    farmers. Contrarily, traditional agriculture practice employs inputs throughout
    the field in predetermined manner, thus resulting in wastage of resources and
    extra expenditure. The United State Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported
    that corn farm following precision agriculture incurred 163 dollars per hectare
    higher profit than for non-adopters (Schimmelpfennig 2016). The success of precision
    agriculture relies on systems that generate data in farms. The information generated
    on farms is then transferred and processed in such a way to make proper strategically
    and profitable operational decisions (Tzounis et al. 2017). Internet of Things
    (IoT)-based technologies have aided agriculture to generate, transfer, and process
    such a big amount of valuable information (Zhang et al. 2018). The modern agriculture
    sector is expected to be highly influenced by the advances in IoT technologies
    (Saiz-Rubio and Rovira-Más 2020). The new philosophy centered on agricultural
    data has been referred with several names like Agriculture 4.0, Digital Farming,
    or Smart Farming. Smart Farming was born when telematics and data management were
    combined to the already known concept of Precision Agriculture, thus improving
    the accuracy of operations (Saiz-Rubio and Rovira-Más 2020). Agriculture 4.0 is
    based on precision agriculture principles with producers using systems that generate
    data in their farms, which will be processed in such a way to make proper strategically
    and operational decisions. Internet of Things (IoT) in an agricultural context
    refers to the use of sensors and other devices to turn every element and action
    involved in farming into data (Tzounis et al. 2017). According to estimation nearly
    10–15% of US farmers are using IoT solutions on the farm across 1200 million hectares
    and 250,000 farms (Saiz-Rubio and Rovira-Más 2020). According to a research report
    on smart agriculture market, it is expected to grow from USD 13.8 billion in 2020
    to USD 22.0 billion by 2025 at compound annual growth rate of 9.8% (Smart Agriculture
    Market 2020). As seen in Fig. 1, there is a continuous increase in the number
    of publications with the term “Smart Agriculture” and “IoT” along with the term
    “Agriculture” in the scientific literature. These highlight the importance and
    growing interest of researchers in IoT-based technologies for empowering smart
    agriculture. Fig. 1 Increase in the number of publications related to “Smart Agriculture,”
    “IoT,” and “Agriculture” as seen in Science Direct (www.sciencedirect.com) Full
    size image In present scenario, the demand of IoT-based agriculture technologies
    has increased significantly, particularly in developed countries. Research institutes
    and industries are making efforts to satisfy the future needs of farmers through
    the development of IoT-based agriculture technologies. The main purpose of this
    chapter is to demonstrate how IoT-based technologies has modernized agriculture
    sector. The present chapter introduces readers to the concept of IoT applications
    in agriculture as well as discuses current trends and future challenges of IoT-based
    agriculture technologies. Evolution of Agriculture Agriculture has evolved through
    ages with aim of increasing the agricultural yield and reduces human labor. Beginning
    of agriculture can be dated back to about 22,000 years ago when man learned to
    collect wild fruits as food. Archaeological evidences suggest that various crops
    were cultivated as earlier as 9500 BC (Hillman 1996; Walsh 2009). The demand for
    more foods to feed ever-increasing population has propelled agriculture evolution
    from traditional to more sophisticated form. During course of evolution agriculture
    has moved on from Agriculture 1.0 to Agriculture 4.0 (Fig. 2). Traditional agriculture
    also referred as Agriculture 1.0 was entirely dependent on manpower and animal
    forces. Agriculture 1.0 was labor intensive with low output and involved usage
    of simple tools (Zhai et al. 2020). Fig. 2 Evolution of agriculture from Agriculture
    1.0 to Agriculture 4.0 Full size image Invention and improvement of steam engine
    during nineteenth century not only brought about progressive influence on various
    industries but also become force for second agriculture revolution. Agriculture
    2.0 involved usage of agriculture machineries and synthetics agrochemicals. Agriculture
    output in terms of efficiency and productivity increased tremendously in Agriculture
    2.0 as compared to Agriculture 1.0. However, improved agriculture output was also
    accompanied by several harmful effects such as environment pollution, destruction
    of ecological environment, wastage of natural resources, and excessive consumption
    of powers (Zhai et al. 2020). The twentieth century saw the rapid development
    in computer technology and robotics resulting in third agriculture revolution.
    Agricultural machines with robotics and computer programs became more efficient
    and intelligent. In Agriculture 3.0, precision and intelligence of agricultural
    machines reduced use of agrochemicals and wastage of natural resources leading
    to more productive agriculture (Zhai et al. 2020). Previous few years have seen
    integration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) with traditional
    agriculture. This integration has resulted in fourth agricultural revolution designated
    as Agriculture 4.0. Implementation of recent technologies like Internet of Things
    (IoT), Cloud Computing (CC), Remote Sensing (RS), Artificial Intelligence (AI),
    Machine Learning (ML), and Big Data Analytics (BDA) has brought about advances
    in agriculture through development of Smart Farming practices (Zhai et al. 2020).
    Agriculture 4.0 is based on principles of monitoring, recording, collecting, and
    processing on field data for making suitable and strategically operational decisions.
    Traditional farming required farmers to visit the fields, check the condition
    of their crops, and make decisions based on their experience or seek suggestion
    from experts. It is estimated that on an average farmers spent 70% of farming
    time in monitoring and understanding the crop status instead of doing actual field
    work (Saiz-Rubio and Rovira-Más 2020). Traditional approach of manually monitoring
    and managing large farm is not feasible, particularly under labor force limitations.
    Future agriculture must develop and rely on technologies that can impart efficiency
    and sustainability under limited workforce. IoT empowered smart farming technologies
    have potential to provide practical solution to future needs. SMART Agriculture
    Smart farming or Smart agriculture is promising concept of contemporary agriculture
    sector that aim to minimize waste and enhance productivity by use of advance supplementary
    technologies (Saiz-Rubio and Rovira-Más 2020). Present agriculturist and policy
    makers consider smart farming as a green technology approach as it reduces ecological
    footprint in comparison to traditional farming practices (Navarro et al. 2020).
    Implementation of advance information and communication technologies has improved
    the quantity and quality of agriculture products while optimizing the human labor
    requirements and using fewer natural resources. Smart farming monitors and analyzes
    environmental conditions (such as growth status, soil status, irrigation water,
    pest, fertilizers, and weed management) for optimizing various input processes
    (Doshi et al. 2019). Smart farming uses hardware and software to record the data
    and give valuable insights to handle all on-farm activities (Fig. 3). IoT are
    important hardware for proper functioning of Smart farming. IoT-based smart farming
    enables real-time monitoring, recording, diagnosis, decision making, and accordingly
    appropriate activities in farms (Fig. 4). Fig. 3 Important components of smart
    farming Full size image Fig. 4 Important events in IoT-based smart farming cycle
    Full size image Generally, IoT-based system consist of input and output interface
    for sensors, interface for connecting to the Internet, interface for memory and
    storage, as well as interface for audio or video. Demand for technology-driven
    smart farming has increased in recent past particularly after wide acceptance
    and recognition by progressive agriculturists. There are several commercially
    available IoT solutions for smart agriculture (Table 1). Table 1 Some renowned
    IoT solutions used in agriculture Full size table Internet of Things (IoT) The
    Internet of Things (IoT) is considered as one of the big technological revolution
    of the present world. IoT-based technologies are expected to touch the life of
    entire human race directly or indirectly (Doshi et al. 2019). The IoT allows things
    to be controlled from distance via an existing network infrastructure, thus creating
    possibility for direct amalgamation between the physical world and computer-based
    systems. Utilization of IoT-based technologies in several sectors (like manufacturing
    industry, healthcare, transportation, communications, homes, and agriculture)
    has reduced inefficiencies and improved the performance. The phrase “Internet
    of Things” (IoT) was first coined by British innovator Kevin Ashtonin in 1999
    to describe the network of physical devises that are connected to Internet for
    exchanging data (Ayaz et al. 2019; Tzounis et al. 2017). Since its conception,
    IoT has improved a lot by embracing various empowering techniques such as wireless
    sensor networks, cloud computing, big data embedded systems, security protocols
    and architectures, communication protocols, and web services. Basically, the IoT
    is assembly of three layers, namely, the perception layer, the network layer,
    and the application layer (Fig. 5a). The three-layer architecture defines the
    basic idea of IoT but it is not always sufficient in achieving desire results,
    hence several researchers have included finer aspects and added more layers to
    architecture of IoT (Kumar and Mallick 2018). The five-layer architecture of IoT
    includes perception layer, transport layer, processing layer, application layer,
    and business layer (Fig. 5b). The role of perception layer and application layer
    of five-layer architecture is same as that of three-layer architecture (Tzounis
    et al. 2017). Fig. 5 IoT solution architecture that includes (a) three layers
    and (b) five layers Full size image The perception layer is physical layer consisting
    of sensors for sensing and gathering information from environment (Chen and Yang
    2019). This layer has technologies such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID),
    Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), and Near Field Communications (NFC). RFID technology
    is considered as the first and the most suitable example of interconnected “Things.”
    RIFD uses electromagnetic waves to automatically identify and track tags attached
    to the objects. RFID tags hold data in the form of the Electronic Product Code
    (EPC). The RFID readers triggers read and manipulate a large number of tags, thus
    allowing object identification, tracking, and data storage on active or passive
    tags. Active tags are powered by embedded power supply consisting of battery.
    Passive tags do not require embedded power supply as it is powered by energy from
    interrogating radio waves of RIFD readers (Welbourne et al. 2009). A typical WSN
    is equipped with sensing and computing device, radio transceivers, and power components
    for monitoring and recoding the physical condition of the environments. Data collected
    by hundred thousands of sensors are organized at central location. Sensor nodes
    of WSN communicate among themselves using radio signals. NFC is a set of communication
    protocols used for communicating between two electronic devices over a very short
    distance of 4 cm or less. NFC enables a low-speed connection with simple setup
    to bootstrap more-capable wireless connections. NFC devices can act as electronic
    identity documents and keycards (Tzounis et al. 2017). The transport layer constitutes
    the second layer in five-layer IoT architecture. This layer transfers the data
    collected by sensor from the perception layer to the processing layer and vice
    versa. This layer uses network protocols to enable communication between the perception
    layer and the processing layer. Network protocols are employed to construct wireless
    communication between sensor nodes and application layers. Each protocol has distinctive
    characters, such as the working range, data exchange rate, and power consumption.
    Based on distinct features network protocols can be grouped into short range,
    cellular networks, and long range (Fernández-Ahumada et al. 2019). Short-range
    network protocols allow communication over short distances and hence are applied
    for the communication between devices that are located close to each other. Bluetooth,
    ZigBee, and Wi-Fi are good examples of short-range protocols. These protocols
    have high data transmission rate and low power requirement. Cellular networks
    like GPRS and 3G enable long distance communication with high transmission rate.
    However, licensing cost and high power consumption sometimes creates hurdle for
    extensive application (Mekki et al. 2019). Long-range network protocols allow
    communication over very long distance. LoRaWAN and Sigfox are good examples of
    long-range network protocols (Fernández-Ahumada et al. 2019). These protocols
    have a low power consumption as well as low data transmission rate. Long-range
    network protocols are considered suitable when a small amount of data has to be
    transferred over very long distances (Navarro et al. 2020; Fernández-Ahumada et
    al. 2019). The network layer constitutes the second layer in three-layer IoT architecture.
    This layer is concerned with transmitting and processing of sensor data. Data
    collected by wireless sensor nodes are communicated to neighboring nodes or a
    gateway and further forwarded to remote infrastructure for storage, analysis,
    processing, and dissemination through network layer (Gubbi et al. 2013). Communication
    protocols formulate over wireless standards, such as 802.15.4, help the device
    networking, and fill the gap between the Internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes.
    Such protocols include ZigBee, ONE-NET, Sigfox, Wireless HART, ISA100.11a, and
    6LowPan. Recently, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), LoRa/LoRaWAN, DASH7, and low-power
    WiFi have also been reported to perform efficiently in network layer (Suhonen
    et al. 2012; Tzounis et al. 2017). The processing layer is also known as the middleware
    layer of five-layer IoT architecture. It stores, analyzes, and processes enormous
    amount of data coming from the transport layer. This layer can handle and provide
    a diverse set of services to the lower layers. It utilizes numerous technologies
    such as databases, cloud computing, and big data processing modules (Tzounis et
    al. 2017). Modeling information by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning
    for the development of decision support systems and automation of agriculture
    process has brought about true value of precision farming (Navarro et al. 2020).
    The application layer is responsible for delivering application-specific services
    to the user. This layer is regarded as the most important layer as it facilitates
    the realization of the IoT-based smart farming (Tzounis et al. 2017; Navarro et
    al. 2020). The business layer handle the whole IoT system, including applications,
    business and profit models, and users’ privacy. Major Equipment and Technologies
    Enabling IoT-Based Smart Farming IoT-based smart farming has been made possible
    by use of several equipment and technologies. This section discusses some major
    equipment and technologies that have contributed toward realization of smart farming.
    Wireless Sensors Wireless sensors are the most important part of smart farming
    equipment. Almost every part of advance agricultural tools and heavy machineries
    contain wireless sensors for gathering on site information. Depending upon the
    application requirements, there may be following major type of sensors, namely,
    acoustic sensors, field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based sensors, optical
    sensors, ultrasonic ranging sensors, optoelectronic sensors, airflow sensors,
    electrochemical sensors, electromagnetic sensors, mechanical sensors, mass flow
    sensors, Eddy covariance-based sensors, soft water level-based (SWLB) sensors,
    light detection and ranging (LIDAR), telematics sensors, and remote sensing (Ayaz
    et al. 2019). Acoustic sensors function by quantifying the change in the noise
    intensity as the tool containing these sensors interact with other materials such
    as seeds and soil particles. It has been used successfully for monitoring and
    detection of pest (Ayaz et al. 2019). Gasso-Tortajada et al. (2010) have used
    novel acoustic sensor for classifying different seeds varieties using sound absorption
    spectra. Acoustic sensors are preferred especially in portable equipment as it
    provides low-cost solutions with fast response (Ayaz et al. 2019). Field-programmable
    gate array (FPGA)-based sensors are being used in smart agriculture due to their
    flexibility of reconfiguration. It has been employed for measuring real-time plant
    transpiration, irrigation, and humidity (Millan-Almaraz et al. 2010). FPGA-based
    sensors utilization for agricultural purposes is in infancy stage primarily due
    to limitation issues such as size, cost, and power consumption. These sensors
    are not suitable for continuous monitoring systems as they have high operational
    power requirement (de la Piedra et al. 2012). FPGA-based sensors have potential
    to offer satisfactory solutions in smart agriculture once it overcomes aforementioned
    limitations. Optical sensors use light reflectance phenomena for measuring various
    soil parameters. These sensors test soil parameters such as organic content, moisture,
    color, and mineral composition by reflecting light of different electromagnetic
    spectrum on samples. The changes occurring in reflected wavelength help to quantify
    various parameters. Molina et al. (2011) have reported use of integrated optical
    sensors with microwave scattering for characterizing olive grove canopies. Fluorescence-based
    optical sensors have been used for supervising the fruit maturation (Pajares 2011).
    Ultrasonic ranging sensors are often considered better than several other sensors.
    These sensors have low cost, ease to use, and ability to become part of diverse
    applications. It has been used for monitoring tank, crop canopy, and measuring
    spray distance (Dvorak et al. 2016). Combination of camera and ultrasonic ranging
    sensors has been employed for the detecting weeds in the crop field (Pajares et
    al. 2013). Ultrasonic sensors detect height of plants while the camera determines
    the weed and crop cover. Optoelectronic sensors are known to distinguish between
    different plant types. It helps to identify weeds, herbs, and other unwanted plants
    among crops. Andújar et al. (2009) have used combination of optoelectronic sensor
    and location information to map the weed distribution in maize crop field. Optoelectronic
    sensors can also be employed for mapping vegetation area as it can differentiate
    between plant cover and soil through reflection spectra. Airflow sensors are capable
    of measuring various soil characteristics by pushing a predetermined quantity
    of air into the ground at a prescribed depth. It has been used to determine soil
    air permeability, soil moisture content, and soil types. It can perform measurements
    at a singular fixed position or over long range in the mobile mode (García-Ramos
    et al. 2012). Electrochemical sensors are widely used in smart agriculture for
    soil test automation. Standard chemical analysis of soil is expensive and time-consuming
    process. However, application of electrochemical sensors can easily substitute
    these tests by determining various chemical characteristic of soil such as salinity,
    pH, and macro and micro-nutrients of the soil (Cocovi-Solberg et al. 2014). Electromagnetic
    sensors record electrical conductivity and transient electromagnetic response
    to adjust rate of applications in the authentic situation. These sensors determine
    various properties of soil by measuring the capability of soil particles to conduct
    or accumulate electrical charges. Yunus and Mukhopadhyay (2011) had demonstrated
    that electromagnetic sensors can be applied to determine residual nitrates and
    organic matter in the soil. Mechanical sensors are widely used to determine soil
    mechanical compaction. These sensors enter through the soil and record the force
    experienced by strain gauges (Hemmat et al. 2013). Soil compaction knowledge aids
    farmers to determine the tillage requirement. Mass flow sensors have been used
    to determine the yield by measuring the amount of grain flowing through combine
    harvester. Sensing mass flow for determining the crop yield has been used extensively
    in IoT-based smart farming. Yield monitoring systems apart from mass flow sensors
    also contain several other modules, like the grain moisture sensor, data storage
    device, and software to analyze the recorded data (Ayaz et al. 2019). Eddy covariance-based
    sensors measures exchange of gases, water vapors, and energy between surface of
    the earth and atmosphere. The sensors based on this technology can quantify exchanges
    of carbon dioxide, methane, or other gases, and energy between agriculture field
    and atmosphere (Kumar et al. 2017). These sensors are preferred over other sensors
    due to its ability to measure continuous flux over large areas with high precision.
    Soft water level-based (SWLB) sensors are used in agriculture sectors to describe
    hydrological behaviors of catchment area. These sensors measure rainfall and stream
    flows by determining water level and flow (Crabit et al. 2011). SWLB has helped
    agriculture sector by enabling efficient and effective irrigation, thus reducing
    the wastage of water. Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) is method used to measure
    distance. It has been used in a range of agriculture applications, such as land
    mapping and segmentation, determining soil type, monitoring soil erosion and soil
    loss, and yield forecasting (Ayaz et al. 2019; Montagnoli et al. 2015). These
    sensors operate by illuminating the target with laser light and then measure the
    reflection from targets. Difference between laser return times and wavelength
    is used to make digital three-dimensional representation of targeted site (Ayaz
    et al. 2019). Telematics sensors help in telecommunication between two places.
    In agriculture-based application telemetry sensors have been employed for communicating
    between two vehicles. These sensors collect data from remote location and inform
    farmers on how the components of machine are working. These sensors also record
    location and travel routes of operating machines. Telematics sensors-based technologies
    have enabled farmers to record and store all information related to farm operations
    automatically (Ayaz et al. 2019). Remote sensing-based technologies has enabled
    researcher and farmers to monitor on field crop, forecast yield dates, model and
    forecast yield, identify weeds and pests, and map land degradation. These sensors
    capture and store the geographic information. Information collected by remote
    sensors is further analyzed, manipulated, managed, and presented as spatial or
    geographical data (Ayaz et al. 2019). Argos-sensor is a well-known example of
    remote sensor-based technology. It is a satellite-based sensor system for collecting,
    processing, and distributing environmental data from fixed and mobile platforms
    worldwide (Rose and Welsh 2010). IoT-Based Tractors Tractors are farm vehicles
    used for imparting power and traction to mechanized agricultural task like tillage.
    Demand for tractors has increased with decrease in rural labor resource. It has
    been reported that an average size tractor can work 40 times faster at less expenses
    than traditional farm labor (Ayaz et al. 2019). Different agriculture equipment
    manufacturers are continuously adding advance features to tractor for fulfilling
    the farm requirements. Several manufacturers have added automatic-driven and Cloud-computing
    capabilities to advance tractors. Manufacturers are working on to commercialize
    self-driving tractors. The main benefit of self-driving tractors is their ability
    to make very precise turns without the physical presence of driver. Self-driving
    tractors offer precision with reduced errors that are mostly unavoidable when
    a human controls the machinery (Ayaz et al. 2019). Harvesting Robots Harvesting
    is the last and most critical phase of crop cultivation. It has significant influence
    on crop quality and quantity. Some crops are harvested once while some others
    crops are picked several times after plants have reached a certain stage. Harvesting
    crop at the correct time in a proper manner is very important for obtaining optimum
    return from cultivated crops. Early or late harvesting generally reduces quality
    and quantity of crops. Labor are predominantly required for harvesting crops.
    However, labor shortage is hampering several agriculture functions significantly.
    According to Ayaz et al. (2019), there is decline in crop production annually
    due to labor shortage. United States Department of Agriculture reported that costs
    of wages and labor may range something between 14% and 39% of total cultivation
    cost (Ayaz et al. 2019). Considering the importance of this stage and labor issues,
    farm experts and managers believe that use of agriculture robotics will ease the
    labor pressure and provide the freedom to harvest as per desire (Ayaz et al. 2019).
    Recent decades have seen automation of harvesting process by use of sensitive
    robots that can detect shape, size, color, and localization of fruits (Zujevs
    et al. 2015). Harvesting robots require sophisticated sensors capable of accumulating
    accurate information of particular crop and fruit. In real field scenario, the
    task of detecting the right target is not simple as most of the fruits are partially
    or fully hidden among leaves and branches (Bac et al. 2017). The successful automation
    of harvesting process employ computer vision, image processing, and machine learning
    techniques. As different fruits vary in shapes, sizes, and colors, researchers
    are designing and developing specific robots for specific crops (Zujevs et al.
    2015). SW 6010, Octinion, SWEEPER robot, and FFRobot are some of the leading harvesting
    robots being used for crop harvesting. FFRobot is harvesting robots employed for
    harvesting tree-based fruits like apples. It has capability to pick up to 10,000
    fruits per hour. SW 6010 and Octinion are able to collect strawberries. SWEEPER
    robot is employed to harvest peppers. Another automated strawberry harvester Tektu
    T-100 is an all-electric rechargeable harvester that can run silently with zero
    emission inside the poly-tunnels (Ayaz et al. 2019; Defterli et al. 2016). Communication
    in Smart Agriculture Smart farming is heavily dependent on accurate and timely
    communication and reporting the information to stakeholders. The real purpose
    of smart agriculture can only be achieved by firm, reliable, and secure connection
    among various participating objects. Successful implementation of IoT in agriculture
    sector on a large scale can be achieved only after providing a suitably large
    architecture for communication. Deciding upon the means of communication is influenced
    by several factors like cost, coverage, energy consumption, and reliability. Currently
    several communication modes and technologies are employed in smart agriculture,
    depending on the availability, scalability, and application requirements. Cellular
    communication through 2G, 3G, 4G, or 5G, ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth, and Sigfox has
    been used successfully to communicate in smart agriculture. Cellular communication
    modes from 2G to 5G have been used for communicating information or data. However,
    availability of appropriate cellular network in rural region is a major concern
    worldwide particularly in developing and underdeveloped countries. Data transmission
    via satellite can overcome aforementioned problem. The cost of communication via
    satellite is very high thus making it unsuitable for small- and medium-sized farms.
    The choice of communication mode is also determined by the application requirements.
    Farms employing sensors that operate with low data rate but work continuously
    for long periods require long battery life. Such farms often consider relatively
    a new range of Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN). Several research consider
    LPWAN a better solution for cellular connectivity, due to long battery life and
    a wider connectivity range at reasonable rates (2 to 15 USD per year) (Beecham
    Research 2016). Several short-range and medium-level communications are also being
    used in mesh networks for communicating information (Zulkifli and Noor 2017).
    In a mesh-network based communication system, sensor nodes collect data and transmit
    it to the gateway located in the same area. The gateway then sends collected data
    via WAN network to the farm management system. The ZigBee technology has emerged
    as the new standard for superior wireless technology in agriculture communication.
    The ZigBee hardware uses physical devices to offer a low cost accomplishment.
    Depending on the application requirements the devices based on ZigBee protocol
    uses three logical device types, namely, ZigBee coordinator, ZigBee Router, ZigBee
    End Devices (Oliveira et al. 2017). The ZigBee network uses three different topologies,
    namely, Star, Tree, and Mesh (Fig. 6). Star topology is simplest of all topologies.
    It consists of a ZigBee coordinator and few ZigBee End Devices. All end devices
    are connected directly to coordinator (Fig. 6a). In the star topology, ZigBee
    coordinator is accountable for initiating, maintaining, and controlling the entire
    end devices on the network. Tree topology consists of coordinator, few routers,
    and end devices (Fig. 6b). Router serves as extension for network coverage. End
    devices can be connected to coordinator or router. Mesh topology consist of one
    coordinator and several router and end devices (Fig. 6c). It is also referred
    as Peer-to-Peer network. This topology has capability to find alternate path to
    destination, in case node fail to communicate, hence also known as self-healing
    topology. Fig. 6 Different topologies used for supporting the ZigBee networks:
    (a) Star, (b) Tree, (c) Mesh Full size image ZigBee can play vital role especially
    in the greenhouse environment where usually short-range communications are required.
    Data collected by sensors enable real-time monitoring of various parameters. Data
    collected by sensors is transferred through ZigBee network to end server. For
    the applications like irrigation and fertilization, ZigBee modules are networked
    for communication. For example, in drip irrigation, soil content like moisture
    is monitored. Further, SMS is forwarded to the farmer to update about the field
    data where GSM is required at long distance or Bluetooth module can help at the
    shorter distances. Bluetooth is a wireless communication standard for connecting
    small-head devices over shorter distances. It is used in several smart farming
    applications as it is easy to use, utilize less power, and have low cost. Hong
    and Hsieh (2016) successfully tested Bluetooth and PLC (programmable logic controller)
    with ICS (integrated control strategy) for controlling irrigation timing depending
    upon soil moisture content to carry out smart irrigation. Advanced form of Bluetooth
    commonly known as Bluetooth Smart or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has been used
    in sensors devoted to monitor moisture, ambient light, and temperature in open
    field conditions as well as under protected cultivation area. LoRa wireless technology
    offers LPWAN connectivity between the wireless sensors and the Cloud as it is
    a long-range and low-power platform. Sensors based on LoRa can be used in smaller
    devices for consistent monitoring. LoRa signals have capability to penetrate thick
    and insulated objects, hence allowing coverage over larger network area. As compared
    to several network platforms, LoRa-based network have longer lifespan with little
    maintenance. Jedermann et al. (2018) successfully tested LoRa-based networks platform
    in apple storage warehouse for monitoring temperature and airflow with packet
    rate of more than 96%. Sigfox is wireless network connectivity services employed
    to connect low-powered objects that emit small amounts of data continuously. This
    wireless network connectivity service uses narrowband or ultra-narrowband technology.
    It offers high level performance as several sensors can transmit data at the same
    time (Lavric et al. 2019). Smartphones Smartphones are important part of present-day
    lifestyle. Recent advances in the smartphone industry have resulted in sharp decrease
    in price thus making it affordable for small farmers. Cellular communication is
    the key technology in rural areas. Mobile phones are important mode of communication
    within farming community. It can be easily used to contact or update farmers in
    the rural setting. With flexibility and functionality (such as the camera, GPS,
    microphone, accelerometer, and gyroscope), smartphones have tremendous potential
    to participate in IoT-based smart farming (Table 2). Table 2 Some of the smartphone-based
    sensors used for various agriculture applications Full size table Realizing the
    tremendous potential of Mobile-phone-based agriculture services, IT professionals
    are developing mobile apps to fulfill various needs of farmers (Alfian et al.
    2017). In recent years researchers have developed several Mobile phone-based agriculture
    services, particularly in developing countries like Cameroon, China, Turkey, India,
    Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, Mali, Uganda, and Zimbabwe to address local farmers issues
    (Pongnumkul et al. 2015). Table 3 summarizes some important smartphone-based application
    for farmers. Table 3 Some important smartphone applications used for various agricultural
    purposes Full size table Cloud Computing Cloud computing offers on-demand various
    services (like data storage, server space, database networking, and software)
    through the Internet. It is a popular choice for people as it offers cost saving,
    high speed, efficiency, performance, and security. Cloud computing is named so
    because the information accessed by individual is present remotely in the virtual
    space. It has supported smart farming applications by two means. Firstly, it offers
    space for collection and storage of information transmitted from remote sources.
    Secondly, it allows processing of collected information and displaying the results
    to the users. Hiring Cloud-based services in smart farming has several opportunities
    but with few challenges. Smart farming uses vast range of sensors with its own
    data format and semantics. Also the most of the decision-support systems utilized
    in smart farming are application-specific. Thus, the Cloud-based decision-support
    system has to handle the diversity of data and their formats as well as configure
    these formats for diverse function. AgJunction developed an open Cloud-based system
    for gathering and disseminating the data from different precise agriculture controllers.
    Fujitsu proposed Akisai-Cloud for increasing the food supply chain in future by
    focusing on food and agricultural industries. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Smart
    Farming UAVs are aircraft without human pilot on board. These aircraft are controlled
    by remote control or autonomous control unit fitted with sensors. UAVs are more
    commonly known as drones. Massachusetts Institute of Technology considered agricultural
    UAVs as green-tech tool for smart farming. Agricultural UAVs has been utilized
    to address several farm-related issues. It provides farmers with luxury of collecting
    precise data from large areas without much labor. Collected data can be further
    processed and analyzed to draw valuable information. UAVs fitted with high-resolution
    cameras and precise sensors have been used for monitoring plant growth on an individual
    plant-level. The application of UAV technology in smart farming has been successfully
    employed for weed detection and management in crop field of sugar beet, paddy,
    sunflower, and cotton. UAV technology has been applied to monitor wheat breeding
    in large trial, monitor key developmental stages of winter wheat, detect plant
    stress, predict as well as estimate grain yield and pest monitoring. Faiçal et
    al. (2014) used an algorithm to self-adjust UAV route during spray in crop field
    to reduce waste of pesticide and fertilizers. UAV-based system has also been used
    to detect and chase away birds from cultivated fields by producing sounds. Application
    of IoT in Smart Agriculture The IoT-assisted agricultural operation mainly has
    three stages, namely, data collection, cloud-side data analysis, and decision-making.
    Data are collected with on field sensors or remote sensors or UAVs. Collected
    raw data are filtered and processed by data analysis tool to draw valuable information.
    The filtered information is converted to critical information by data mining and
    machine learning tools. Information analysis with specific factors such as crop
    state, soil, and environment condition allows decision-making. Appropriate application
    of IoT in smart agriculture has allowed control of all agricultural operations
    such as field preparation, seeding, irrigation, fertilization, pest control, and
    harvesting (Fig. 7). Fig. 7 Architecture of IoT-based agriculture technology Full
    size image Irrigation Water is crucial input for good agriculture production and
    maintaining food security. Irrigation is the process of artificially applying
    water to the crops for fulfilling water requirements. Farmers generally depend
    on wells, ponds, lakes, canals, tube-wells, and even dam for irrigation. According
    to an estimate, agriculture sectors use more than 70% of all freshwater globally
    (FAO 2019). Competition for water resource particularly for agriculture sectors
    is expected to increase in near future due to population growth, urbanization,
    and climate change. Future agriculture sector demands judicious and precise use
    of water in irrigation. The IoT has been more widely used in agriculture for executing
    precision irrigation. The system uses wireless sensor network (WSN) along with
    in-field sensors to monitor plant water requirement. Sensors present in the field
    measures temperature and humidity from air, soil, and canopy. Data recorded by
    sensors are fed into network gateway. The gateway can be accessed via Internet
    wirelessly by use of technologies such as 4G LTE mobile communication network
    at relatively low cost. The data transmitted can be received by subscribed web
    services on the cloud. The information gathered from farmland and other source
    (like weather station and satellite imaging) are analyzed to decide on irrigation
    index value for each site on farmland. These results are transmitted back to network
    gateway and further forwarded to irrigation controller present on the field. Irrigation
    controller utilizes results to manage precise irrigation (Zhang et al. 2018).
    Specifically developed web application can enable farmers to access all data and
    results, as well as make adjustments in irrigations. Lorvanleuang and Zhao (2018)
    reported development of IoT-based automated irrigation system that used smartphone
    to capture and process image of soil near root zone of crop. Rawal (2017) reported
    development of automated irrigation system capable of monitoring and maintaining
    the desired soil moisture content through automatic watering system. Control unit
    was developed with Microcontroller ATMEGA328P on arduino uno platform. Soil sensors
    present in the field measure and maintain appropriate quantity of water so as
    to avoid over or under irrigation (Rawal 2017). Fertilization Fertilizers are
    natural or synthetic material that can provide essential nutrients to crop plant
    for proper growth and development. The current agriculture practices depend heavily
    on fertilizer application for increasing the production of food, feed, fuel, fiber,
    and other plant products. Continuous cropping exhaust soil from essential nutrients,
    hence a regular replenishment of nutrients is necessary in order to maintain the
    fertility of the soil so as to maintain or improve the quality of the harvest
    (Zhang et al. 2018). Depending upon the requirement nutrients can be grouped into
    major and minor nutrients. Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) are
    important primary major nutrients. Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), and Sulfur (S)
    are secondary major nutrients. Boron (B), Chlorine (Cl), Cobalt (Co), Copper (Cu),
    Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Molybdenum (Mo), and Zinc (Zn) are minor nutrients.
    The amount of fertilizer required is influenced by various factors such as crop
    type, soil type and soil absorption capability, product yield, fertility type,
    fertilizer utilization rate, weather condition, and climate condition (Ayaz et
    al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2018). Application of fertilizer in excess amount adversely
    affects the environment by depleting the soil quality, deteriorating ground water
    resource and contributing to the climate changes across the globe. Adverse effect
    of fertilizer can be reduced by precise application of fertilization. Precise
    fertilization is relatively complicated as compared to precise irrigation. The
    main hurdle in precise fertilization is determination of fertilizer requirement
    in soil patches and supplying nutrient accordingly. Remote sensing and IoT approaches
    have helped in estimating fertilizers requirement at particular site with acceptable
    accuracy and minimum labor. Normalized Differences Vegetation Index (NDVI) has
    been used for estimating crops health, vegetation vigor, density, and soil nutrient
    assessment. NDVI is estimated from satellite images or images from UAV or IoT
    ground stations. NDVI value is used to generate the site-specific fertilization
    index map. Fertilizer is applied with automated agriculture machines and vehicles
    in accordance to the fertilization index map (Zhang et al. 2018). Crop Disease
    and Pest Management Yield loss due to disease and pest is one of the serious problems
    of agriculture sector. According to FAO (2019) nearly 20% to 40% of global crop
    yield are lost annually due to pest and diseases. Agriculture 3.0 saw application
    of large amount of agrochemicals like pesticides, fungicides for overcoming losses
    due to diseases and pest. Globally more than two million tons of agrochemical
    is used annually. Most of these agrochemicals are harmful to living organisms.
    Use of IoT-based system allows cultivators with real-time monitoring, modeling,
    and diseases forecasting. Traditionally, diseases and pest management include
    application of agrochemicals at particulars stage of crop or pre-prescribed time
    irrespective of infection. The effectiveness of crop disease and pest management
    system depends on the sensing, evaluation, and treatment strategies. First stage
    of IoT-based crop disease and pest management system is to collect real-time crop
    physiological and pathological data. Image processing is most commonly employed
    for acquiring physiological and pathological data. Image can be obtained from
    on field sensors or remote sensing devices installed on aircraft or satellite.
    Data obtained from remote sensing system has higher efficiency and comparatively
    less cost as compared to on field sensors. On field sensors enable more function
    as compared to remote sensing system. On field sensors can be used to monitor
    and collect data from every corner of field throughout the cultivation period
    (Zhang et al. 2018). IoT-based system has been employed to develop automated pest
    traps. IoT-enabled pest traps capture, count, and characterize pest. Information
    collected by automated traps is then uploaded to cloud for analysis (Ramalingam
    et al. 2020). Data collected by crop disease and pest management system are sent
    and stored at central management system. The center processes and analyzes data
    or image using sophisticated models and algorithms to provide functions like pest
    identification, diseases identification, behavior of pest, and recommendations
    from experts. Early warning and suitable interventions can be suggested to the
    farmer from the central managing system in various ways such as text messages
    or emails. Information obtained from central system are also utilized in precision
    farming to precisely apply diseases treatment and pesticide using automated spray
    or unmanned aerial vehicles or automated variable rate technology. Use of advance
    robot enabled with multispectral sensing devices, precision–spraying, can locate
    and deal with the problem. Several IoT technology systems have been successfully
    used in smart farming for monitoring various aspects of crop production. Zhang
    et al. (2014) developed IoT system for monitoring diseases, pest, and weeds in
    field crops of wheat. The system also has capability to diagnose and predict diseases,
    pest, and weeds of wheat. Depending upon data analysis, the system can provide
    recommendation to farmers (Zhang et al. 2014). An IoT system developed by Lee
    et al. (2017) predicted diseases and pest by utilizing model based on correlation
    information. This IoT system helped farmers to control diseases and pest by judicious
    usage of pesticides and fungicides. Yield Monitoring, Forecasting, and Harvesting
    Yield monitoring is the means of analyzing quality and quantity of harvest. Grain
    mass flow, moisture content, and harvested grain quantity are some important parameters
    analyzed during yield monitoring. Accurate yield monitoring helps in estimating
    crop performance and deciding on the future course of action. Yield monitoring
    is the important part of smart farming as it not only helps in deciding on the
    time of harvest but also inform about the quality of yield. Yield quality depends
    on several internal and external factors. Genetic composition of the crop is an
    important internal factor influencing yield quality. Nutrient availability, good
    quality pollination, photoperiod, and sufficient pollination are some external
    factors influencing yield quality and quantity. With globalization of agriculture
    sector, the demand for good quality fruits has increased tremendously in recent
    times. Moreover, good quality fruits must reach right market at right time for
    harnessing maximum profit. Consumers prefer fruits with attractive external features
    like fruit size, color, aroma, and texture. All these attractive features of fruit
    can be achieved only if fruits are harvested at right time and maintained under
    appropriate post-harvest care. Crop forecasting is an art to predicting the yield
    and production before the harvesting period. Forecasting is done after taking
    into account the current status of crop plant. Forecasting of crop yield helps
    farmers to decide on near future plan. Predicting yield quality and maturity time
    is critical in decision making and deciding on the harvesting time. Yield quality
    and maturity time prediction take into account the data collected during various
    development stages of fruit. Fruit color, size, texture, and appearance are some
    important parameters that are considered for predicting right harvesting time.
    It must be noted that right harvesting time helps to maximize the crop quality
    and quantity. It also offers an opportunity to accordingly adjust the post-harvest
    management strategy. Harvesting is the last but most crucial stage of agricultural
    process. Proper harvesting at right time can make a great difference. Farmers
    must know the right time for crop harvesting as it is essential for drawing real
    benefits from crops. Farm area network (FAN) helps in real-time monitoring of
    the whole farm and deciding on the harvesting time. A yield monitoring system
    can be installed on harvester combine and linked with the mobile app FarmRTX.
    Mobile app displays live harvest data and uploads it automatically to web-based
    platform of the manufacturer. Mobile app FarmRTX can also generate high-quality
    yield maps. These maps can be shared with any agriculture experts. Farmer also
    has option to export information and analyze them on other farm management software.
    Manfrini et al. (2015) estimated the production and quality of yield by monitoring
    fruit growth on apple trees. The group considered the fruit growth as the most
    fundamental and appropriate parameter for determining the progression of the crop.
    Torbick et al. (2017) used satellite imagining for monitoring rice crop yield
    in vast areas. Satellite imagining allows monitoring of large area and thus aids
    in estimating yield of large farms. Such method can also be useful in estimating
    yield of entire state or country. Sentinel-1A Interferometric images were used
    to map the rice crop yield and intensity in Myanmar (Torbick et al. 2017). Color
    (RGB) depth imagining has been used to track the different fruit conditions in
    mango and papaya farms (Wang et al. 2017). Multiple optical sensors have been
    employed successfully to monitor the shrinking of papayas particularly during
    drying conditions. Protected Cultivation Protected cultivation is a process of
    growing crops in controlled environments. Green house farming is a good example
    of protected cultivation. Green house cultivation is more intense than open farm
    system, hence requires relatively more monitoring and controlled farming operations.
    There are cloud-based IoT solutions used for monitoring and controlling various
    operations in green house. High-precision monitoring of green house has been made
    possible by IoT-based technologies. Sensors present in the green house collect
    data. These data are uploaded to a cloud infrastructure by Internet facility.
    Collected data are analyzed with well-evaluated equations and crop and climate
    models to provide grower with valuable information. Depending upon the information
    grower may take better decisions or get early warnings. Online precise irrigation
    scheduling for greenhouses (OpIRIS) was developed on the basis of well-evaluated
    scientific knowledge. OpIRIS uses web application for communicating with long
    distance sensors installed in the greenhouses. The system has climate sensors
    and machinery for regulating fertigation. Sensors robotically sense drainage sample
    and transfer data to the infrastructure. The data is processed and employed to
    precisely predict the crop water requirement and notify growers about when to
    irrigate and volume of nutrient solution to apply. Tong-ke (2013) developed automate
    irrigation system for green house with agricultural information cloud and a hardware
    combination of IOT and RFID. The system was able to achieve high efficiency in
    resource utilization and significant improvement in maintaining water quality.
    The increasing demand for food requires more farmable lands but soil erosion and
    pollution has destroyed nearly one-third of farm land. Current intense agricultural
    practices are also damaging the soil quality at faster rate than it can be replenished.
    Researchers believe that Vertical Farming (VF) and plant factories are better
    options to overcome limitation arising due to reduction of arable land and decrease
    in water resource issues. Plant factories are closed plant growing system facilitated
    with artificially controlled light, temperature, moisture, and carbon dioxide
    concentrations. These enable constant production from plant throughout the year,
    even under unfavorable external environment condition. Artificial growth systems
    heavily rely on IoT-based technology for imparting suitable condition for plant
    growth. Vertical Farming is a form of urban agriculture that offers prospect to
    stack the plants in vertical racks. Plants are allowed to grow in limited space
    under controlled environment. Vertical Farming is highly efficient in terms of
    resources consumption due to smart farming approaches. This method enhances production
    several folds by increasing the number of stacks under fraction of ground surface
    as compared to conventional agriculture practices. Indoor farm developer Mirai
    reported that Japanese vertical farm of 25,000 square meters produce 10,000 heads
    of lettuce per day which is double the amount produced under traditional field
    condition. Japanese vertical farms used nearly 40% less energy and 99% less water
    consumption as compared to open field type cultivation practice. Aerofarms, another
    vertical farm developer, reported 390 times higher yields and nearly utilizing
    95% less water as compared to conventional cultivation practice. All abiotic parameters
    required for plant growth is controlled by sensors. Carbon dioxide concentration
    in plant growing environment is very critical parameter. Non-dispersive infrared
    (NDIR) carbon dioxide sensors play important role to detect and control the concentration
    in artificial vertical farms system. Edinburgh Sensors designed Boxed Gascard
    for vertical farms environment. Boxed Gascard employs a pseudo dual beam NDIR
    measurement system to enhance the stability and reduced optical complexity. Mint
    Controls reported development of IoT-connected vertical farm that do not require
    human hands to touch the crops at any stage (Chowdhury et al. 2020). Livestock
    Applications Livestock are important part of agriculture sectors. Livestock or
    farm animals are domestic animals raised for producing labors and different commodities
    (such as meat, eggs, milk, etc.). Water buffalo, cattle, sheep, donkey, camel,
    and goat are some common examples of livestock. Maintaining livestock in clean
    and optimal environment is necessary for good productivity. Optimum supply of
    food and water is also essential for maintaining proper health of livestock. IoT-based
    application has been used successfully for managing livestock. WSN-based technology
    has been employed for monitoring and controlling the environmental conditions.
    It has also been used for monitoring feeding practice, animal tracking, and animal
    behaviors. Murphy et al. (2015) reported use of WSN technology for monitoring
    a beehive colony. Their group collected important information about activity and
    environment within a beehive as well as its surrounding area. Future Challenges
    IoT-based smart agriculture has several challenges that need to be addressed before
    it becomes imperative part of agricultural practice. Challenges range from hardware
    problem to security concerns. The equipment present at the perception layer are
    directly exposed to harsh environmental conditions capable of destroying the electronics
    circuits. Environmental condition such as soaring solar radiation, extreme temperatures,
    rain, humidity, winds, vibrations, and dust storms can damage electronic circuits
    and render perception layer nonfunctional. The devices of IoT system has to stay
    active and function perfectly over long period with limited availability of power
    resources from batteries. Suitable programming tools and low-power utilizing system
    needs to be developed as frequent battery replacement or reset of the system is
    not an easy task in the large-scale open fields. Small power harvesting modules
    like solar panels, wind turbines can be applied to generate power to some extent
    in open fields but still low power utilizing equipment are prerequisite for successful
    IoT system. Ziegeldorf et al. (2014) highlighted the importance of small number
    of interconnected devices produces exceedingly large amount of data. Small-scale
    server infrastructures usually fail to handle such large amount of data (Atzori
    et al. 2010). Logistics infrastructure dealing with food and agricultural sector
    aims to assist the exchange of information as well as transport of goods. Proper
    logistics can optimize the production process and the supply chain networks globally.
    Including IoT-based technology in logistics have progressively transformed post-harvest
    agriculture business processes by providing more precise and real-time information
    to the movement of materials and products. Inclusion of cloud computing into IoT-based
    logistics system has increased service quality primarily by offering ample storage
    and computational resources to store and process the data generated at the edge
    of the network. Botta et al. (2014) used the “CloudIoT” to highlight the ideal
    accompaniment of IoT technologies and cloud computing. The enormous amount of
    data generated at the edge of the network can sustain unpleasantly high cost for
    transferring it to the cloud. Therefore, the researchers and industries must develop
    technologies that can draw best possible balancing between the edge storage and
    processing as well as determine the portion of the workload that is to be done
    on the cloud. Expanding cloud technologies and tools is must for satisfying the
    future requirements of IoT-based technologies. Fog computing which is an extension
    of the Cloud Computing paradigm offers such advancements. It is decentralized
    computing infrastructure that uses edge devises to carry out sizeable amount of
    computation, data storage, and application locally and routed over the Internet
    (Jukan et al. 2019; Bo and Wang 2011). Another challenge for IoT-based system
    is the network layer. Normally wireless communication systems are preferred over
    wired base data transfer system in various agricultural deployments. It is well
    established that environment condition has considerable influence on wireless
    link quality. Environment condition can decrease wireless link quality through
    the multi-path propagation effects and its contribution to background noise (Wang
    et al. 2017). In the real world, performance of popular transceivers has been
    found to be influenced by temperature, humidity, and presence of human and other
    obstacles within the space where a wireless node attempts to communicate. Thus,
    there is need for robust and reliable data transfer technologies that can work
    accurately according to the requirements and challenges of the rural environment.
    Security concerns are another challenge commonly faced by IoT-based system. The
    safe IoT-based system transfer data through interconnected Internet that can ensure
    the security, legitimacy, confidentiality, and privacy of the stakeholders involved
    in this group. A well-protected IoT-based system guard data present in perception
    layer, network layer, and application layer from external attacks. It ensures
    that only approved entities can access and alter data in the application layer.
    IoT security requires to fulfill three primary requirements, namely, authentication,
    confidentiality, and access control. The first layer, that is, perception layer
    often faces most common security breach. This layer requires security not only
    for the acquired information but also physical security for the hardware components.
    In case of agriculture, the physical security of hardware components is quite
    important, since the devices are deployed in open fields and work continually
    without proper surveillance for long periods under diverse environmental condition.
    Very often a single security protocol may not be effective in providing protection
    to all devices as they are deployed in diverse environments and distributed nature
    of IoT. RFID commonly used in IoT has security concern related to leakage of information.
    Information leakage from RFID may reveal the location identity and other similar
    sensitive data. RFID security has been achieved by several countermeasures like
    data encryption, use of blocker tags, and tag frequency modification. Jamming
    of tags and tag destruction policy which enables physical ending of a tag’s life
    has also been used as countermeasures. Security of sensor can be achieved through
    several policies like cryptographic algorithms, identity authentication mechanisms,
    data flow control policies, and data filtering mechanisms (Li et al. 2012). This
    layer is also threatened by wiretapping, tampering, cheating, and replay attacks.
    Therefore, data acquisition and key management protocols must be guaranteed with
    authenticity, confidentiality, and data integrity. Secure routing policies must
    be adopted and sensor node verification policies must be controlled to prevent
    data access by unauthorized things. Middleware layer of IoT also has specific
    security requirements. This layer is positioned between the perception and application
    layers and is accountable for data processing. Middleware layer enables communication
    interface between network and application layers. Confidentiality and secure data
    storage are primary security requirement of middle layer. Data transmissions through
    wireless medium often offer security challenges to IoT system. IoT systems are
    easily exposed to threat, such as denial of service attacks, virus attack, man-in-the-middle
    attacks, and unauthorized access. These security threats often target and affect
    privacy and data integrity of network layer. Security threats of middleware layer
    can be overcome by authentication, intrusion detection, key management, and negotiation
    mechanisms (Demesticha et al. 2020; Farooq et al. 2019). Application layer is
    the top layer in the IoT system. Enormous amount of data streams end up in this
    layer, thus requiring improved storage and computational resources. Often the
    application layer is so closely related with the cloud and thus security threats
    of application layer are similar to the security issues of the cloud itself. Application
    layer experiences threats for data security, privacy, backup, and recovery. Secured
    application layer must have mechanisms to manage the rights and ownership of data.
    It must also control the access rights to all, or part of the information, both
    for users and between machines, or even organizations (Farooq et al. 2019). Conclusions
    The agriculture sector has undergone several important changes during last few
    decades. These changes have transformed traditional agriculture sector into a
    new smart agriculture. The fourth revolution in agriculture has transformed traditional
    farming approaches by introducing ICT technologies. The use of contemporary software
    and hardware technologies like WSNs, IoT, UAVs, cloud computing, and machine learning
    has enabled development of smart agriculture. These technologies have potential
    to further enhance crop yield, improve harvest quality, reduce cost of production,
    and lessen the ecological footprint of traditional farming. Smart farming technologies
    have aided farmers to practice modern process by monitoring crops even at a per
    plant level. IoT is expected to optimize the agriculture process by many means.
    Recent advances in IoT-based open-field and protected cultivation has paved pathway
    to move farming from precision to a micro-precision model of agricultural production.
    Precise monitoring, pervasive computing, and proper agriculture decision support
    system are bound to provide the optimal growing or living conditions for both
    crops and animals. Automation of agriculture systems will allow optimization of
    service and resource usage as well as control the crop production in harmony to
    the market condition. This approach is bounded to maximize the profit and minimize
    the cost of production in every possible way. In a real world, IoT-based agriculture
    system employ diverse equipment, with different technical specifications and sensor
    features. Data coming from vast heterogeneous sources can be used to optimize
    agriculture decision support system or expert system only after making it interpretational,
    filtration, and the semantic annotation of the data. Food supply chains and agriculture
    logistics system armed with WSN and RFID equipment can allow monitoring of product
    at each stage of its life thus imparting feeling of safety for consumer, through
    a transparent product lifecycle information system. All the abovementioned approaches
    are the optimistic advances of the IoT-based agriculture system. However, in this
    perception, several individual players have to participate in accord. Foremost,
    the local networks systems have to be protected against interference from other
    unwanted networks. Undoubtedly, IoT-based agricultural technologies have tremendous
    potential to serve future human demand in sustainable manner. However, still lots
    of issues need to be addressed before IoT-based agricultural technologies become
    imperative part of farming and affordable for every farmer. IoT-based agricultural
    technologies along with robotics and artificial intelligence algorithms are about
    to bring about fifth revolution in agriculture. References Alfian G, Syafrudin

  description: This chapter describes various solutions to meet the challenges of
    today’s networks, which are incapable of providing services to users due to high
    usage of data. Augmented reality plays a vital role in providing stability to
    wireless networks. In order to increase the throughput, these wireless systems
    have to be densely deployed. Combining machine learning with wireless networks
    can also result in more energy-efficient solutions. This chapter discusses the
    various challenges related to networks and security in the internet of things
    (IoT) and image processing. At the same time other problems are also considered,
    viz., standardization requirements, scalability and performance, network deployment,
    interoperability, data management, networking and storage, and integration of
    machine learning. The chapter provides further directions in the research field
    of IoT and image processing.

    power of recent Internet technologies has invaded all devices, facilitating the
    control of innumerable autonomous gadgets to introduce the Internet of Things
    (IoT) [1]. IoT smartly interconnects smart objects and actuators in order to offer
    a smart interactive environment with human [2]. IoT are now representing a major
    source of data, as billions of connected objects gather, analyze, share and transmit
    data in an intelligent way [3]. These data are generated continuously in huge
    amounts, with different types of heterogeneity and unreliability at real time
    from various IoT devices to fulfil their responsibilities [4]. Hence, understanding
    and processing these data in a powerful way are major challenges, as the current
    conventional approaches are not capable of manipulating such data. This creates
    a crucial need for new practices in software engineering (SWE) in conjunction
    with big data analytics (BDA) and IoT [5], [6] to optimally process and analyze
    IoT data. From the BDA perspective, IoT data should be maintained regarding the
    main ten big data Vs [7]–[10]. As from the SWE perspective, IoT data require a
    novel processing model that manages their challenges, such as data concurrency,
    data consistency and availability that significantly complicate any associated
    development [11], [12]. Thus, the merge of a powerful SWE model and BDA offers
    the intelligent service of IoT [13]. IoT technologies have made tremendous economic
    and environmental impacts that affect society in many domains [14]–[16]. Figure
    1 shows a domain-based taxonomy for the main IoT-based systems from the BDA and
    SWE perspectives. We have investigated several research studies in various IoT
    domains, such as: (1) smart environments, (2) human analytics, (3) network analytics,
    (4) energy analytics, and (5) environmental analytics to explore the most common
    IoT-based SWE and BDA challenges. FIGURE 1. A domain-based taxonomy of big data
    analytics systems in IoT. Show All Although different survey studies have been
    conducted for IoT-based systems, many research gaps are still vague, summarized
    as follows: SWE concepts have not been thoroughly investigated for seamless adoption
    to the complex IoT-specific data nature, reflecting different IoT data processing
    and performance challenges, such as system scalability, reliability, etc. Big
    data characteristics have not been enough evaluated with respect to various IoT
    data analytics challenges, such as IoT analytics accuracy and consistency, urging
    for serious improvements to cope with such IoT data. No IoT-specific data processing
    architecture is proposed to consider IoT data processing and data analytics challenges
    that maps the IoT data nature to both the SWE concepts and BDA characteristics.
    Therefore, the scope of this study is to present a comprehensive systematic literature
    review by analyzing the current techniques and technologies used in IoT-based
    systems from the SWE and BDA perspectives at different domains. It explores the
    IoT-based data nature and thoroughly investigates the associated most critical
    challenges in IoT applications with respect to both SWE concepts and BDA characteristics.
    Thus, this study demonstrates the mapping between the current state of IoT technologies,
    SWE development practices and BDA details with respect to the IoT-specific data
    features for the main IoT-based systems to highlight the present research gaps
    and the future directions that can be adopted. The evaluation metrics of this
    study in order to analyze the presented IoT-based systems include the BDA target,
    approach, technology and the challenges from the BDA perspective that would reflect
    processing concerns, as well as the applied evaluation criteria. The metrics also
    include the applied software (SW) architecture and design, whether model-driven
    engineering (MDE), separation of concerns, system validation and verification
    (V&V) are considered and the challenges from the SWE perspective that would affect
    the SW Quality of Service (QoS). To the best of our knowledge, this study is the
    first analytical study that addresses BDA architectures in IoT-based systems at
    several domains then evaluates them from the SWE perspective to highlight the
    main research gaps in this area. Thus, the main contributions of this research
    study are summarized as follows: Explore the key features of IoT data by analyzing
    the main IoT-based systems at different domains. Identify the SWE concepts that
    are concerned with such IoT data features. Diagnose the SWE challenges for IoT-based
    systems that would arise if such SWE concepts were disregarded. Determine the
    big data characteristics concerned with the IoT data features. Explore the BDA
    challenges resulted from the identified IoT data features. Propose a domain independent
    BDA-based IoT processing architecture that handles the highlighted challenges
    from both the SWE and BDA perspectives. The rest of the paper is organized as
    follows. Section II explores the related survey studies that have considered IoT-based
    systems from different perspectives. Section III discusses the research methodology
    adopted to conduct this study. Sections IV, V, VI, VII and VIII present our systematic
    literature review of the main IoT-based systems in the fields of smart environments,
    and the analytical applications related to humans, networks, energy and environment
    respectively to evaluate them from both the SWE and BDA perspectives. Section
    IX investigates the deduced IoT data features and the associated challenges in
    SWE and BDA with respect to the current IoT-based systems and discusses the main
    persistent research gaps. In Section X, we propose a recommended SW architecture
    for big IoT data analytics that addresses most of the highlighted challenges.
    Finally, section XI concludes our findings and directs future research to the
    missing gaps. SECTION II. Related Reviews Studies Previous survey studies have
    been conducted for data analytics in IoT applications at different areas, i.e.
    network management, data mining, data fusion, etc. However, the focus of these
    reviews differs from the prime concern of this review study. This study focuses
    on investigating the mapping of IoT-specific data features with both SWE and BDA
    paradigms to explore the possible IoT data processing and data analytics challenges
    at various IoT domains. The networks protocols were investigated in [17] among
    different BDA applications for IoT in the smart transportation, E-healthcare,
    safety and security and smart energy metering domains to contribute the most appropriate
    protocol per each domain and reveal its limitations for IoT. This study devised
    a taxonomy to bring forth a generic overview of the IoT paradigm for smart cities,
    their opportunities and major requirements. Thus, it focused on the use of IoT
    in the context of smart cities only. Authors in [18] provided a survey for deep
    learning techniques only in IoT by investigating the current types of deep learning
    approaches applied in many IoT applications and evaluating their processing time
    to formulate the deep learning processing challenges and research gaps in IoT
    systems. Another perspective was adopted in [19], in which BDA approaches were
    grouped per applied domain, specifying the analytical function for each presented
    approach, such as cleansing, visualization, etc. to highlight the future directions
    and research gaps with respect to BDA functions for IoT applications. A study
    in [20] considered a variant perspective that enclosed different types of BDA
    approaches for IoT systems, as offline analytics, business analytics memory-level,
    real-time and massive analytics, with their corresponding processing platforms
    to indicate their research gaps. Authors in [21] investigated BDA for IoT applications
    from the context awareness perspective, where each approach was evaluated with
    respect to its context model and applied data mining technique to devote the context
    awareness analytical challenges for IoT systems. Data fusion in IoT systems was
    addressed in [22] by presenting a survey of the applied mathematical models and
    data fusion analytical approaches that were evaluated from the probabilistic parameters
    perspective. From the processing type perspective, many BDA techniques were applied
    on several current scalable processing platforms in [23], such as fog computing
    and cloud computing to evaluate these platforms’ performance and deduce their
    gaps regarding IoT applications. Authors in [24] presented a comprehensive survey
    for the data collection schemes in healthcare. The study analyzed different data
    collection and secure transmission schemes to provide a suggested reliable and
    secured data transmission taxonomy with low computational cost and compression
    ratio. From the data management perspective, authors in [25] reviewed the various
    solutions for managing IoT data at diverse IoT fields, presenting different types
    of IoT data and introducing new basic concepts of data management for IoT in order
    to deduce the open issues and lessons learnt in data management for IoT. SECTION
    III. Adopted Systematic Review Methodolgy This survey adopts the evidence-based
    systematic review approach [26], as this type of review follows a speciific methodology
    that aims to comprehensively identify all relevant studies on a specific topic
    and to select the appropriate studies based on explicit criteria. The main research
    questions driving this study can be formulated as: (RQ1)How are IoT data currently
    being analyzed at the different domains? (RQ2)What are the key features encountered
    for IoT data that would require deep consideration from the SWE and BDA perspectives?
    (RQ3)What are the challenges faced by the IoT-based systems with respect to SWE
    and BDA? (RO4)What should an appropriate architecture for IoT-based system be
    composed of in order to efficiently process IoT data and maintain the resultant
    challenges from both SWE and BDA perspectives? Relevant papers were identified
    by searching on Scopus and Google Scholar that index journals and conferences
    across multiple databases. The inclusion set of search criteria included “big
    data”, “data mining”, “big data analytics”, “Software engineering” keywords, filtered
    by “internet of things”. The articles were screened manually using the following
    inclusion criteria: 1) published papers, 2) described the actual designs, implementations
    and results in enough detail, 3) concerned with analytics and 4) papers after
    2012. The most relevant papers were selected from 13 domains. Figure 2 presents
    detailed statistics for the selected papers with respect to the IoT domains and
    the publication year. Previous surveys considering BDA in IoT systems were first
    investigated to confirm our study’s uniqueness and singularity as discussed in
    section II. RQ1 is addressed in sections IV, V, VI, VII and VIII, evaluating the
    current state-of-the-art in IoT-based systems from both SWE and BDA perspectives.
    RQ2 and RQ3 are handled in section IX, exploring the key features of IoT data
    and their associated challenges from SWE and BDA perspectives, whereas a detailed
    discussion is conducted in section X to satisfy RQ4 by proposing a recommended
    SWE model for big IoT data analytics that manipulates the identified challenges.

    of papers vs. the IoT domains, (b) Number of papers vs. the publication year.
    Show All SECTION IV. IoT Systems for Smart Environment Previous IoT facilitates
    the surrounding objects to become intelligent, which enables the creation of a
    smart life [27]. This section presents the main studies of IoT-based approaches
    that serve the environment to be more comfortable for people. Most of the SW architectures
    in this domain ignored system V&V, MDE and separation of concerns concepts, which
    caused serious challenges in system reliability, availability, security, scalability,
    maintainability and reusability. A. Smart Health Care A new era of medical healthcare
    systems has emerged based on IoT, in which different analysis types on different
    SWE architectures were considered to provide various smart services in healthcare
    [28]. In [29], authors proposed an IoT-based system through a layered architecture
    for patients’ data authentication on the cloud using Ethereum blockchain model,
    which processed the data generated from sensors attached to a human body. The
    architecture consisted of four layers; (1) application layer, (2) middleware layer,
    (3) network layer and (4) perception layer. Their proposed system ignored the
    massive data amount and data quality that affected the accuracy of the resultant
    analytics and degraded the huge data analytics support. Another IoT-based system
    based on a component-based architecture for diseases detection was proposed based
    on ontology in [30]. All diseases’ details such as symptoms, causes and effects
    were used to construct an ontology in a centralized processing server that monitored
    public health using body attached sensors in order to facilitate decision making
    in case of emergencies. The architecture applied separation of concerns on the
    detailed diseases data using ontological classes and their actions, i.e., cause
    of, symptom of, etc. The ontological classes were driven from a medical activity
    model. The analytical model did not manage the timeliness, valuable big data streams
    of sensors’ readings and diseases details on the distributed environment, which
    affected the analytics accuracy and caused latency. In [31], a distributed component-based
    architecture implemented on a cloud-IoT-based platform was presented for improving
    health services through optimizing the usage of cloud resources, data storage
    and retrieval using three different versions of optimization algorithms and inspected
    on the CloudSim dataset. The architecture aimed to get bests selection of Virtual
    Machines (VMs) on the cloud, helping patients reduce execution time. It applied
    separation of concerns by building the architecture in four components: (1) users’
    devices, (2) users’ requests, (3) cloud broker, (4) network administrator. However,
    it did not consider the sensors’ valuable context data for VMs allocation, which
    required anywhere spatial analytics operations, affecting the analytics accuracy.
    Although the proposed architecture targeted cloud resources management, it ignored
    the limited number of processors when existed. A Smart Personal Health Advisor
    (SPHA) was introduced in [32] as another health monitoring system based on a three-layer
    architecture: (1) sensors infrastructure, (2) network management, (3) deep learning
    analysis on Hadoop. The system monitored the patient’s physiological and physical
    cases to recognize his medical factors using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    for feature extraction, in which the patient health status was diagnosed using
    the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for deep learning. The system was verified
    using developed testbeds that collected different categories of personal data.
    Yet, the presented analytics did not consider maintaining the inconsistent body
    sensors’ data, which implied an inconsistent analytical model. B. Smart Agriculture
    Agriculture is a key worldwide economic demand. The agricultural crops could be
    damaged for diverse reasons, causing huge losses [33]. Hence, authors in [34]
    proposed a model for predicting the best crop sequence by analyzing the farmland
    crops history and the soil information given. The model was built on a layered
    architecture consisted of four layers, which were (1) IoT data sources, (2) transmission
    management, (3) data analytics accomplished on Hadoop distributed environment
    and (4) analytics interpretation. The model used different classification algorithms,
    like decision tree algorithm (C4.5), SVM, REPTree, as well as association rule
    mining using FP-Growth to explore soil characteristics needed for classification.
    Overlooking the management of massive and inconsistent data without reduction
    methods would cause a challenge regarding the analytics consistency, as well as
    a difficulty in huge data analytics support. In [35], authors introduced an IoT-based
    real-time monitoring model for smart irrigation and water utilization. It depended
    on thermal imaging analysis captured by sensors and transferred to cloud server
    to analyze several factors, such as humidity, light intensity and temperature
    measurements to avoid unnecessary waste of water. The model was developed on a
    multi-layered architecture that collected crops sensors data and transferred them
    via Internet to central data processing services on the cloud. Not considering
    spatially correlated and heterogenous data during analysis was the main BDA challenge,
    which indicated poor analysis anywhere and low accuracy. Authors in [36] proposed
    a model for smart irrigation by monitoring water amount quantity and comparing
    it to other environmental parameters. The model was built on a layered architecture
    consisted of three layers; (1) Application layer, (2) Network layer management
    and (3) Perception layer. The model used statistical equations for comparisons.
    Overlooking the management of massive and inconsistent data without reduction
    methods would cause a challenge regarding the analytics consistency, as well as
    a difficulty in huge data analytics support. In [37], an IoT platform was introduced
    for pest and disease monitoring. The model predicted pests’ occurrences using
    probabilistic methods over the collected environmental sensors data, such as weather,
    humidity and temperature. The platform was implemented on a multi-layered architecture
    consisting of four layers, which were (1) sensor nodes, (2) data acquisition,
    (3) wireless communication technology and (4) intelligent data processing on the
    cloud. However, the traded data were not managed during transmission to the cloud
    server processor to perform analysis, resulting in poor analytics confidentiality.
    C. Smart Home Use IoT frameworks emphasized the intelligent phenomenon of smart
    homes, which serve to process home sensors data using home resources and intelligently
    identify home activities [38]. In [39], authors proposed a real-time IoT-based
    approach to identify homes’ actions using home deployed sensors on a three-layer
    architecture as follows: (1) different types of sensors to sense different human
    activities, (2) sensors communication manager and (3) the recognition layer, where
    various analytics were accomplished on stream processing engines. Different dynamic
    tests were applied to verify the approach responses to human activities. The approach
    aimed to analyze the real time sensors’ usage readings within home using statistical
    analytics to predict how healthy is an individual. The prediction was based on
    the sensors’ readings time and order without data reduction operations for massive
    data and data inconsistencies handling, which affected the support of huge data
    and analytics consistency in the model. Another IoT-based approach was proposed
    in [40] to predict home activities using home deployed sensors and a mixture technique
    of clustering and classification, as K-patterns followed by an artificial neural
    network (ANN), on a cloud distributed environment following a client-server model.
    The K-pattern clustering was used to group related activity models, aiming to
    extract the ANN features to be learned and predicted from the resultant clustered
    activity models. The ANN predicted the activity based on time and pattern. The
    clustering step was used to ensure the prediction model’s accuracy but managing
    data inconsistencies before analysis was not tackled, which heavily reduced the
    analytics results’ consistency and quality. Another IoT-based approach was introduced
    in [41] as a home decision support system through a three-tier architecture as
    follows: (1) client node layer, where home sensors data were acquired (2) mobile
    edge node layer and (3) fog computing layer, where a deep machine learning (ML)
    technique using NNs was applied. Yet, accomplishing the complex operations included
    in the NN without managing the timeliness valuable home credential data affected
    the analytical model latency. Table 1 summarizes our analysis and evaluation for
    all presented IoT-based studies in smart environments from both BDA and SWE perspectives.
    TABLE 1 IoT Frameworks for Smart Environments From BDA and SWE Perspectives: An
    Overview on the Associated IoT Data Features and Their Encountered Challenges
    SECTION V. IoT Systems for Human Analytics IoT links digital information to human
    world for smarter online lives [42]. This section discusses the main studies that
    considered human-related data analytics in terms of their processes and information
    flow between humans and physical objects. Most of the SW architectures proposed
    in this domain have challenges in system reliability, availability, security,
    scalability, maintainability and reusability due to missing main SWE concepts,
    such as system V&V, MDE and separation of concerns. A. Privacy and Security The
    continuous streams of data generated from IoT usually hold important information
    regarding time, context and user credentials. These data should be fed to several
    software management and control systems connected to autonomous devices [43].
    This section discusses the main approaches for data security and privacy related
    to the IoT-based systems. A generic BDA privacy model was proposed in [44] as
    a policies recommender applied in the public health domain, driven out of the
    requirements engineering offered by the General data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
    organization. The policy making process is going through three steps: (1) Case
    recognition, which determines privacy gaps to address by the health policy using
    regression discontinuity techniques, (2) Action strategy, which sets the procedures
    considering the available resources by medical experts and (3) Plan monitoring
    for policy life cycle to evaluate the initiated policy efficiency. The model was
    implemented on a multi-layered architecture consisting of four layers, which were
    (1) data ingestion, (2) management layer, (3) data analysis on Hadoop distributed
    environment and (4) data visualization. The model considered the big data processing
    aspects, but it was a limited security model that considered security concerns
    related to the public health domain only, ignoring other valuable data that caused
    a challenge in the analytics accuracy. Another approach for improving security
    in IoT-based healthcare systems was proposed in [45] to prevent patients’ data
    attacks using an anomaly detection technique for untrusted parties’ and audiences’
    access identification. The approach was implemented on a cloud distributed environment
    in a client-server model that used a cryptographic service to reach a higher level
    of trusted access data security. However, it did not filter noise data, like disconnected
    access, which downgraded the analysis accuracy, consistency and interpretation.
    In [46], authors presented a client-server-based approach for preserving privacy
    data aggregation using a distributed fog computing environment. The approach employed
    the hash chain technique to facilitate fog devices to filter untrusted data to
    prevent external attackers. The main faced obstacle was the real-time processing
    of the timeliness data and the complex mathematical methods used in the hash chain
    technique, which affected the analytics latency to respond to any unsecured attack.
    B. Social Media Monitoring The huge amounts of data provided by smartphones and
    social networks help identifying individuals’ activities and actions. The convergence
    of IoT and social networks has evolved to present the Social IoT (SIoT), which
    enables each object to identify services by using its relationships [47]. In this
    context, authors in [48] proposed a three-layer architectural model (data, network
    and application layers) to detect telegram data infusion through classifying telegram
    notifications’ speeds using the genetic algorithm. The architecture did not handle
    spatial data and data timeliness that affected analytics latency and anywhere
    analytics. Another generic social IoT-based three-layered architecture for social
    analytics was proposed in [49] as (1) data producers layer, (2) context data management
    layer and (3) data consumer layer. Both humans and things equally participated
    to generate data, in which the Internet allowed the interaction between them and
    the devices. An intelligent system was included to orchestrate and manage data,
    but due to the offline computing of timeliness, traded data and the unsecure data
    transfer resulted in additional challenges in analytics confidentiality and latency.
    Furthermore, in [50], authors proposed a system to predict human activities dealing
    with social networks, in which all objects were formed by interconnected devices
    through the Internet to integrate IoT and social networks with a cloud server.
    The system was implemented using a three-layer architecture consisted of (1) objects
    layer, (2) SIoT server on the cloud and (3) application layer. The used classification
    techniques were used to predict human activities and were tested on different
    Twitter datasets to validate the system throughput, but the heterogenous data
    was managed before analysis. This implied a poor analytical model to support different
    data types. C. Behaviour Analytics There are many studies for exploring the interconnection
    between devices and humans in order to identify human activities. IoT has introduced
    a new connection theme through human-device, rather than the traditional way of
    the Internet through human-human [51]. Accordingly, an IoT-based dynamic client-server
    model was introduced in [52] to predict human location by adapting body sensors
    relocation. It developed the k-nearest neighbor classifier using trained versions
    with various sensor contexts without labelled training data on a cloud distributed
    environment. However, spatial information was not considered in the analysis phase
    that impacted the analytics accuracy and anywhere analytics. Another IoT-based
    client-server approach was introduced in [53] for Human Activity Recognition (HAR)
    using cloud distributed processing with body deployed sensors to monitor patients
    with heart diseases. The activity recognition was accomplished using C4.5 decision
    tree classifier within different situations. Nevertheless, big data veracity was
    not considered due to the absence of any data pre-processing, which highly affects
    the analytic model consistency and accuracy. In [54], a smart sensing IoT-based
    approach based on a client-server model was proposed for Human Computer Interaction
    (HCI) applications to act like a human responding to an activity. The approach
    was applied in a simulated game environment based on imagery analysis on a cloud
    distributed environment, in which the application responded to the player’s actions
    in real environments. The experiments were run on KTH dataset with real environment
    images captured using human devices, then 3D Convolutional NNs were applied to
    identify human actions. The CNN features were driven from an activity model. However,
    securing user data was not addressed, leading to poor analytics confidentiality.
    Table 2 presents the detailed evaluation for all discussed IoT-based studies in
    human analytics. TABLE 2 IoT Frameworks for Human Analytics From BDA and SWE Perspectives:
    An Overview on the Associated IoT Data Features and Their Encountered Challenges
    SECTION VI. IoT Systems for Networks Analytics The internet-connected devices
    currently surrounding day-to-day activities emit enormous real-time mobile data
    [55]. Analyzing such data allow people to enhance their mobility and to provide
    better transportation services as discussed in this section. Nevertheless, most
    of these works did not handle separation of concerns, MDE approaches and system
    V&V. A. Transportation and Traffic With the exponential increase of populations,
    the demand for real-time services and smart infrastructures has also increased.
    For instance, IoT-based systems can provide online traffic guidance using road
    deployed sensors [56]. Authors in [57] proposed a parallel processing graph-oriented
    approach for a smart transportation system that used traffic sensors readings
    and vehicular network to identify vehicles’ instant location and speed. The proposed
    approach was implemented on a seven-layer architecture as follows: (1) data sources,
    (2) communication, (3) graph building, (4) processing on Hadoop, (5) results,
    (6) interpretation and (7) application. The system analyzed the graphs of sensors’
    big data using Giraph tool, without considering the huge sensors’ data that require
    special reduction techniques. This impacted the analytics latency and their ability
    to cope with huge data. In [58], an IoT-based approach was introduced using fog
    computing as an online transportation assistant to provide continuous traffic
    support such as driving assistant, collision detection and hazard prevention.
    It followed a three-layer architecture consisted of (1) intelligent processing
    layer on a fog distributed environment, (2) real-time BDA layer and (3) data sources
    layer. The approach analyzed data in parallel, employing data prioritization methods
    to ensure the availability to end-users. Nevertheless, it did not handle the heterogenous
    data formats before processing, which affected the analytical model to deal with
    variant data types. Another IoT vehicular data analytic approach on cloud was
    proposed in [59] to recommend intelligent parking and avoid congestion based on
    a three-layer architecture with: (1) IoT devices layer, (2) communication layer
    and (3) data analytics on a cloud distributed environment. The approach collected
    geographic location information and analyzed parking availability information
    using Logistic Regression (LR). Many challenges were faced by the analytical model,
    such as its ability to support huge data, as no data reduction techniques were
    applied. B. Mobility Smart objects in IoT-based environments generate massive
    amounts of location data that allow identifying people capacities and optimizing
    routes through smart cities [60]. An IoT-based approach was introduced in [61]
    for mobility analytics using cloud processing deployed on a three-layer architecture
    as follows: (1) devices layer, (2) network layer and (3) data analytics layer
    on a cloud distributed processing. It predicted people movements within a building
    to help directing them in emergencies and validated using automatic tests that
    generated various locations datasets from ETSIIT dataset at different times. The
    analysis applied the autoregressive and moving average (ARIMA) times series prediction.
    However, it did not handle the variant sensors while performing data aggregation,
    which affected the analysis consistency. Another approach for location identification
    services improvement using mobile IoT sensors data recognition was presented in
    [62]. The approach was developed on a three-layer architecture as follows: (1)
    physical layer, (2) network layer and (3) utility layer on a cloud environment.
    The approach applied a utility-driven service model based on sensing requests
    from the physical layer. Ontology analytics were used to dynamically apply cloud
    applications without addressing real-time processing of timeliness data, which
    affected the model latency. A general service-oriented architecture for context-aware
    mobile IoT applications was introduced in [63], utilizing cloud resources and
    IoT technologies as a service. It consisted of a marketplace layer for the user
    interface, a runtime module and interconnected smart objects. The runtime engine
    managed the mobile IoT data heterogeneity, aggregation and business analytics.
    Nevertheless, the analytics faced a challenge in its ability to support huge data,
    as no data reduction techniques were provided. Table 3 summarizes the evaluation
    for all presented IoT-based studies concerning network analytics. TABLE 3 IoT
    Frameworks for Network Analytics From BDA and SWE Perspectives: An Overview on
    the Associated IoT Data Features and Their Encountered Challenges SECTION VII.
    IoT Systems for Energy Analytics IoT devices connected to data centers, running
    on wireless networks allowed their operation in many domains, especially in the
    energy field [64]. Several challenges were encountered, such as managing supply
    on demands, monitoring power consumption, energy pricing, energy storage and energy
    theft prevention, in which many studies have been conducted as discussed herein.
    From SWE perspective, most of the proposed architectures in this domain face challenges
    in system reliability, availability, security, scalability, maintainability and
    reusability as a result of ignoring system V&V, MDE and separation of concerns
    concepts. A. Smart Grid IoT facilitates the communication between the energy measurement
    components of the smart grid, producing huge data for valuable analytics [65].
    In [66], authors proposed an online scalable smart grid management system on a
    cloud service-oriented architecture to report power usage at different time intervals.
    The system applied different data-driven forecasting models for big energy data
    forecasting, like regression tree and ARIMA techniques to predict the energy consumed
    at different spatial and temporal granularities. The system was tested on the
    Los-Angeles Smart Grid dataset. Nevertheless, it did not ensure data quality in
    terms of managing data inconsistencies before the prediction process, which affected
    both the analytics model’s accuracy and consistency. Another smart grid real-time
    distributed processing analytic approach based on a client-server model for real
    time energy pricing was proposed in [67]. It used regression analysis via Hadoop-Spark
    ML libraries, which managed big data velocity and volume, but it ignored managing
    big data variety in terms of the heterogeneity of sensors data that affected the
    model efficiency by not supporting diverse data models, as well as it ignored
    ensuring grid cyber security that affected system security. Authors in [68] presented
    a smart grid management tool using BDA on a cloud implemented on a four-layer
    architecture as follows: (1) data resource layer, (2) data transmission layer,
    (3) data storage layer and (4) data analysis layer. The third and fourth layers
    were implemented on a cloud distributed environment. It planned the energy storage
    scheme of all devices deployed at a consumer’s home based on historical energy
    consumption data using genetic algorithms. Besides, it presented an energy scheduling
    scheme based on the Nash equilibrium game theory for the daily energy usage to
    reduce energy billing. Yet, using such techniques with complex mathematical operations
    without considering any data reduction technique for massive data negatively affected
    the analytic model latency and massive data support. B. Smart Metering Smart meters
    become more intelligent by the power of IoT, which facilitate deploying them at
    customers’ environments to broadcast power consumption data to the service providers
    at regular interval of time [69]. An approach for real-time smart meter data analytics
    on Hadoop distributed environment based on a client-server model was presented
    in [70] to examine the weather impact on energy consumption using the Periodic
    Auto-Regression (PAR) technique for time series data prediction and tested on
    a home power consumption dataset. The main contradiction was the short-term power
    forecast used to cope with real-time processing, ignoring the valuable data insights
    from long-term forecasting. This affected the regression model training, implying
    poor analytic model accuracy. Another approach based on a client-server model
    using Hadoop was presented in [71] to filter smart meters noisy data caused by
    unpredicted events, or data communication faults. It determines the relationship
    between the data at different time periods using autoregression and ANN techniques.
    The approach was validated using rolling and moving cross validation approaches.
    However, the approach ignored stream data handling for timeliness data, which
    caused poor analytic model latency. Authors in [72] proposed an approach for energy
    theft recognition using smart meter data analytics, implemented on a distributed
    processing of a centralized server and distributed nodes. It utilized clustering-based
    feature extraction on the load data to address the imbalanced data, then applied
    the SVM classifier to detect the theft. Running the approach in parallel supported
    big data velocity but managing the data volume was still a challenge, as no data
    reduction was applied. C. Supply on Demand Predictions The fast spreading of IoT
    deployments prevented energy harvesting for managing supply on demand [73]. In
    [74], an IoT-based time series analytics model was proposed to analyze and forecast
    energy consumption patterns to manage supply on demand, implemented on a central
    server. The analysis was associated with several time intervals ranges from hour
    to whole year. The proposed model used the unsupervised data clustering K-means
    to group energy time intervals followed by Bayesian technique to predict energy
    usage and tested on a domestic appliance level electricity dataset. The main drawbacks
    were ignoring the valuable data of environmental factors affecting energy production,
    as well as the reduction of massive data, causing deterioration to both massive
    data support and analytics accuracy. An IoT-based smart Energy Management System
    was presented in [75] for energy consumption monitoring, implemented on a distributed
    three-layer architecture as follows: (1) sensors and actuators layer, (2) data
    management layer and (3) data processing on a central server. The data acquisition
    module in the second layer is connected to each network device for acquiring and
    transmitting consumption data to a centralized processing server. The Benchmarking
    was used for energy data analysis through a generic business intelligence tool
    that generated user interactive charts and reports for annual power consumptions.
    The system was validated by validating the incremental systems prototypes. However,
    the massive and timeliness data and the unsecured valuable energy data transmission
    were the major challenges that seriously impacted the massive data support of
    the analytical model with respect to latency and confidentiality. Another application
    was presented in [76] to manage energy consumption and balance between supply
    and actual demand in smart cities using online support vector regression (SVR),
    applied on a power consumption data that were processed on a central server. The
    proposed application followed unscalable centralized processing and applied energy
    short term forecasting using data kept in memory that ensured big data velocity,
    but it did not consider the SVR cold start and the data volume by reduction methods,
    which affected the model efficiency to support huge data. Table 4 summarizes the
    evaluation from the two considered SWE and BDA perspectives for all presented
    IoT-based studies in energy analytics. TABLE 4 IoT Frameworks for Network Analytics
    From BDA and SWE Perspectives: An Overview on the Associated IoT Data Features
    and Their Encountered Challenges SECTION VIII. IoT Systems for Environmental Analytics
    In relation to data analytics, IoT-based systems can ensure human civilization
    by offering safe surroundings and improving modern lifestyles [77]. Herein, IoT-related
    studies that addressed different environmental analytics are investigated. However,
    important SWE concepts, such as separation of concerns and MDE approaches were
    ignored, which leads to major challenges in system scalability, security, reusability,
    maintainability, interoperability and availability. A. Crisis Prevention One of
    the IoT blessings is context and timing identification that serve in natural disasters
    management [78]. Thus, IoT enhances the effectiveness of disaster response and
    quick decision making. Authors in [79] proposed a real-time monitoring approach
    to respond intelligently in crisis situations, deployed on a cloud distributed
    environment with a three-layer architecture as follows: (1) social media data
    source layer, (2) data crawling layer and (3) data analysis and interpretation
    layer. It gathered social media information using human language interpreting
    and analyzed them online using sentiment analysis. However, working on such valuable
    data without securing them was the main concern in the analytic model confidentiality.
    Another approach was introduced in [80] as a decision support in crisis relief
    situations on central processing architecture as per various forms of both structured
    and unstructured social data. The approach was validated using both convergent
    validity and discriminant validity. The analysis determined disaster relief activities
    using the partial least square regression (PLSR) technique. Although the approach
    managed big data variety, but it revealed poor massive data support and analytics
    latency, as no data stream handling or data reduction were applied. Authors in
    [81] introduced an approach that aggregated sensors’ and users’ data to establish
    spatial risk manager, implemented on a cloud-based three-layer architecture as
    follows: (1) acquisition layer, (2) integration layer and (3) decision support
    layer. The manager was developed using statistical analysis on WSN for flood prevention.
    Yet, the approach did not consider real-time processing for timeliness data, which
    damaged model latency. In [82], an integrated real-time processing system combining
    satellite images and social media data was presented for flood monitoring and
    hazard detection on a central processing server. The satellite imagery was used
    for monitoring floods using image processing techniques, while the social media
    data helped in the forecasting process that applied Bayesian-based relevance ranking
    strategy. However, managing data inconsistencies before both imagery and social
    analysis was not addressed, resulting in analytics inconsistency. B. Urban Planning
    IoT infrastructures support construction engineers to better make their land-use
    plans based on understanding nature rules and human needs [83]. A proposed IoT-based
    monitoring system based on collected noise maps was presented in [84] to identify
    noise and support noise prevention rules in important areas, implemented on a
    client-server architecture over a cloud distributed environment. The system was
    validated using cross validation on algemesí dataset at different locations. The
    system used statistical spatial-temporal prediction to detect noise levels, but
    it faced many challenges regarding spatial data analytics, like using a spatial
    database for data storage and supporting big data variety, in terms of supporting
    different data types rather than images. Another smart IoT-based architecture
    for managing water consumption in smart cities was introduced in [85] based on
    a three-layer architecture as follows: (1) IoT data sources, (2) communication
    management and (3) data analysis on Hadoop. It analyzed rainwater amounts to manage
    water consumption and prevent floods using Global Active Archive of Large Flood
    Events dataset. Yet, ignoring massive data reduction was a critical concern, resulted
    in poor model support of huge data. Authors in [86] proposed an IoT-based water
    supply management system implemented on a client-server model over a cloud distributed
    environment to connect water sources deployed sensors via WSN to massive water
    consumers. The system optimizes the water consumption process using SCADA and
    metering analysis without managing data inconsistencies, affecting the model’s
    consistency. Table 5 presents the evaluation summary of all environmental analytics
    studies. TABLE 5 IoT Frameworks for Environmental Analytics From BDA and SWE Perspectives:
    An Overview on the Associated IoT Data Features and Their Encountered Challenges
    SECTION IX. The Exploration of IoT Data Features Causing SWE and BDA Challenges
    Upon investigating all presented studies in sections IV, V, VII, VII and VIII,
    this section introduces the key features of IoT data that we explored as our first
    contribution in this study. The explored IoT data features are then mapped to
    the SWE challenges that would arise, based on the SWE concepts concerned with
    each IoT data feature as our second contribution. The BDA challenges, resultant
    from mapping these explored IoT data features to the current big data characteristics,
    are then investigated as our third contribution. The three contributions are mapped
    into the inspected studies and presented in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. These tables
    provide a comprehensive comparative summary for the presented IoT-based studies
    with respect to the main metrics considered for comparison as highlighted in section
    I, which included the targeted analysis type, the applied analytical approach
    and used technology, the considered evaluation criteria to evaluate the associated
    results, as well as the SWE concepts that are used as evaluation metrics. The
    tables also include our inferred challenges from both SWE and BDA perspectives,
    in addition to the causes from the IoT data features perspective. As shown in
    these tables, ignoring some SWE concepts, like separation of concerns, MDE approaches
    and system V&V while processing dynamic, valuable and traded IoT data in each
    domain, caused poor system reliability, security, scalability, availability, interoperability,
    maintainability and reusability. Hence, the concepts of SWE and BDA are coupled;
    SWE seeks to maintain generalizable, powerful and reusable processing architectures
    for data analytics, while BDA append the smart characteristic by offering effective,
    continuous, reliable and secured techniques for manipulating the hidden patterns
    in data. Thus, the main objective of this evaluation is to reveal the trade-off
    relation between BDA, SWE and IoT, as presented, as well as to disclose the relation
    between the challenges of SWE and BDA to support the most optimum processing platform
    for IoT-based systems. A. IoT Data Features The IoT era that interconnects several
    devices presents a different scheme of data called IoT data. Presenting IoT data
    nature helps IoT system analysts, SW engineers and developers to understand these
    data and to improve their traditional approaches to cope with them [87]. Studying
    various IoT-based systems, IoT data features can be compiled as follows. Multidimensional
    Massive Data: IoT connected devices generate gigantic amounts of data, which enforce
    the scaling of traditional approaches to store, process and analyze them. Data
    Timeliness: IoT data are dynamically changing over time, which require real time
    processing with high speed at regular basis. Heterogeneous Data: IoT data come
    from many diversified sources with heterogeneous forms. This represents a complexity
    concern on such data to be interpreted and analyzed. Inconsistent Data: The completeness
    and quality of the collected IoT data may vary, which may include uncertainties,
    irregularities, or noise. Traded Data: IoT data are continuously in use and easily
    accessible from different agents. Thus, ensuring privacy concerns on these data
    is a challenge. Valuable Data: IoT sensors are interconnected in different ways
    autonomously, generating data of high business and social value that should be
    analyzed accurately. Spatially Correlated: Excessive different sensors are deployed
    within the same area to generate diverse data. These data are spatially correlated,
    making data aggregation processes more complex. B. SWE Challenges With more devices
    being connected, the IoT presents a new data scheme that traditional platforms
    cannot directly process [88]. Analyzing the considered SWE metrics for the presented
    studies, we deduce the resultant SWE challenges that would be provoked because
    of specific IoT data features while disregarding some SWE concepts as shown in
    Figure 3. As per our analysis, the SWE challenges that have emerged from the IoT
    perspective include: System Availability: The IoT-based platform should confront
    the diversity of fast IoT data for storage, access, processing, analysis and visualization
    using distributed processing themes. The lack of distributed environments threatens
    the availability of SW systems, as central processing systems are more likely
    to fail since they have a single point of failure. Furthermore, any dereliction
    in SW V&V tests related to system failures detection would cause poor system availability.
    System Reliability: The IoT-based platform should be fault tolerant and smoothly
    operating despite of the untrusted IoT data acquired by unreliable sensors, unclear
    imagery, or imperfect natural human language using different event handlers. Powerful
    V&V are responsible for ensuring accepted system performance and detecting system
    faults. Overlooking enough testing results in unreliable SW systems. System Security:
    The lack of control while acquiring, processing and visualizing different and
    opened access IoT data sources affects the overall system security. Thus, preserving
    IoT data security at all platform layers should be addressed to ensure system
    security. Inefficient V&V tests that would examine system resilience at different
    levels of access put the system security at risk. In addition, the reliance on
    central processing systems makes the system subject to various attacks. Besides,
    non-separated SW architectures result in poor system security. System Scalability:
    The IoT-based platform should accommodate the massive IoT data, provided the limited
    hardware resources and used bandwidth, which cause a bottleneck in processing
    and communication. In case of not adopting distributed environments or multi-layer
    architectures in SW systems, it would be dramatically hard to accommodate the
    huge amounts of data, leading to unscalable systems. Besides, developing SW systems
    without considering the separation of concerns concept or even organized architectures,
    in terms of modules, components, or service-oriented, would downgrade the system
    performance exponentially as the data scale. System Reusability: Designing reusable
    systems would support IoT-based applications in order to cope with the rapidly
    dynamic IoT data timeliness. In addition, cross-cutting concerns would restrain
    such reusability goal. Thus, neglecting the separation of concerns concept, or
    any organized architectures, as in multi-layered, or modular architectures, would
    complicate the extension of functionalities in such systems. Moreover, the abandonment
    of the MDE development approaches, i.e. Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams,
    as well as domain-specific languages, would make it difficult to consider reusability.
    According to our inspection, none of the considered studies has mentioned whether
    they addressed any domain-specific languages. System Maintainability: Maintaining
    a SW system for IoT is costly, in which the system’s functionalities are forced
    to cope with different dynamic faulty devices and IoT data timeliness. Ignoring
    the concept of separation of concerns, MDE development approaches or the usage
    of domain-specific languages that facilitate offering basic domain-based functionalities,
    would complicate the maintenance activities of such SW systems. System Interoperability:
    The spectrum of IoT includes heterogeneous data sources using various protocols
    and interfaces for communication and database types, which needs to connect and
    exchange information without restriction. The processing platform should allow
    seamless transition and managing connections among divergent platforms. This challenge
    occurs as a result of the absence of organized designs, such as modular, component-based,
    or service-oriented architectures, where no defined interfaces are available to
    communicate with different systems. Functional Suitability: Developing a SW system
    that correctly covers all functional requirements and user objectives is a challenge
    for IoT, because of the heterogeneous and inconsistent data sources with corelated
    and domain dependent IoT data. Thus, ignoring the consideration of domain-specific
    languages that facilitate covering domain functional requirements would endanger
    functional suitability. Unfortunately, domain-specific languages were not addressed
    in any of the presented studies. FIGURE 3. The explored SWE challenges resultant
    from IoT data features. Show All C. BDA Challenges The magic of IoT extends the
    communication from human-machine and machine-human to machine-machine context,
    where data analytics are addressed in terms of the 10Vs as volume, velocity, variety,
    veracity, value, variability, volatility, validity, visualization and vulnerability
    [6], [7], [89]. Therefore, BDA has a great effect on analyzing and interpreting
    these data to append the intelligent feature of IoT. This section aims to reveal
    the BDA challenges through investigating the effect of IoT data features on the
    big data characteristics as shown in Figure 4. Thus, the main challenges that
    should be considered in such IoT-BDA model include: Massive Data Support: The
    high dimensionality reduction of IoT data should be considered in the IoT-BDA
    model. This challenge appears by ignoring the data volume in the IoT-BDA model.
    Several data reduction approaches could be applied on the IoT data based on their
    data nature, such as compression, filtering, sampling, etc. Analytics Latency:
    The IoT-BDA model should fit the timeliness nature of IoT data. This challenge
    occurs by not considering big data velocity and volatility while constructing
    the IoT-BDA model. IoT-BDA model should force analytics to be accomplished in
    minimal time by avoiding techniques that would consume much time for training
    or mathematical operations. Different Data Models Support: The IoT-BDA model should
    support heterogenous data, which sometimes are spatially correlated. Neglecting
    big data variety in IoT-BDA model would cause such challenge. Traditionally, this
    challenge is addressed by various data integration forms, which require the perception
    of sources scheme to define proper data adapters. Analytics Accuracy: The IoT-BDA
    model should ensure accurate results despite of the massive, heterogenous, inconsistent
    and valuable IoT data nature. Therefore, this challenge occurs when ignoring big
    data volume, variety, veracity, validity, or vulnerability. Accuracy can be granted
    using different testing approaches and efficient BDA model training. Analytics
    Consistency: The heterogenous, spatially correlated and inconsistent nature of
    IoT data due to data noise. Thus, without handling big data variety and veracity
    in IoT-BDA model would cause this challenge. Therefore, the IoT-BDA model should
    maintain these data before analysis through several data cleansing techniques
    that ensure the truthfulness of data and thus, analysis accuracy. Analytics Confidentiality:
    The IoT-BDA model should consider the valuable, traded, heterogenous and timeliness
    IoT data while processing. These features concern the variety, value, variability
    and vulnerability characteristics of big data. Ignoring managing these characteristics
    would cause a serious concern regarding the privacy of IoT data, leading to poor
    model confidentiality. Analytics Anywhere: The spatially correlated and timeliness
    IoT data are concerned with the variability and volatility of big data. Thus,
    the IoT-BDA model should consider geographic location correlations and time information
    during analysis. Analytics Interpretation: The massive, timeliness, heterogenous
    and inconsistent IoT data are concerned with big data visualization and velocity.
    Ignoring these characteristics in the IoT-BDA model would cause a critical challenge
    while presenting the power of analysis, leading to poor analysis interpretation.
    FIGURE 4. The explored BDA challenges resultant from IoT data features. Show All
    Table 6 relates each SWE challenge to its associated BDA challenge(s) that should
    be considered in IoT processing platforms as per our deduced effects of the IoT
    data features. It presents the inferred impact of each IoT data feature and the
    resultant challenges from both SWE and BDA perspectives. TABLE 6 The IoT Data
    Features Effect on SWE and BDA SECTION X. The Proposed Domain Independent BDA-Based
    IoT Architecture Considering the comprehensive analysis for the state of art in
    the current IoT-based systems provided in sections IV through VIII, we propose
    a domain-independent BDA-based IoT architecture, as shown in Figure 5. The proposed
    architecture considers the discussed BDA and SWE challenges resultant from the
    associated IoT data features in most of the current IoT systems in section IX.
    To the best of our knowledge, the proposed architecture exclusively introduces
    a comprehensive solution for online-based data analysis in IoT-based systems that
    considers both SWE and BDA perspectives. FIGURE 5. The proposed domain-independent
    software architecture for BDA-based IoT system. Show All Avoiding the presented
    challenges of central processing, the proposed architecture can be deployed using
    different online computing models, such as edge computing, fog computing, or cloud
    computing models, in which their scalable, mobile and reliable infrastructure
    can be tailored as per the business needs [90]. The proposed architecture follows
    the main SWE design concepts, including model-driven engineering, separation of
    concerns, system V&V and domain-specific language. It is composed of six layers:
    (1) Data Manager, (2) System Resources Controller, (3) System Recovery Manager,
    (4) BDA Handler, (5) SWE Handler and (6) Security Manager. The “Business-Logic
    Software Architecture” layer represents the specific domain application logic
    and business system requirements needed from the IoT-based application to fulfil,
    on which our proposed layers are expected to interact. The “Raw Data Providers”
    represent the application dependent data sources. The architecture separates between
    IoT data management procedures and business logic functionalities. Regarding SW
    modularity, each layer consists of several modules to tackle diverse challenges
    as detailed below. A. Data Manager This layer receives the raw data generated
    from the physical IoT objects sources, like sensors, social media interactions,
    location-based services, smart devices and feeds the whole architecture. It is
    responsible for managing the connections and interactions of the various data
    providers, as well as the continuous acquisition of their data. In order to check
    the consistency of such acquired raw data before processing, this layer consists
    of the following modules to ensure QoS: Network and Communication Manager: This
    module identifies the physical objects and manages the communication protocols
    used to interconnect them before data are obtained. Several IoT technologies are
    used depending on the application nature. For instance, wireless body area networks
    (WBAN) can be used for body deployed sensors in healthcare applications. Network
    throughput in terms of the successful data transfer rate over time, latency in
    terms of the delay between sending and processing data units, and availability
    in terms of the efficient and uprunning network that are ensured by “System Resources
    Controller” module, are the main metrics that can be considered to evaluate this
    module [91]. The efficiency of these evaluation metrics to measure system performance
    is proven in [92]. Data Streaming Acquisition: A suitable stream processing engine
    is needed to ensure the real time processing of timeliness IoT data. This module
    can be evaluated by measuring the response time defined as the time taken between
    sending a request to the server and the task completion [93]. Response time is
    the most appropriate evaluation metric to evaluate analytics latency and system
    availability [94]. Data Consistency Handler: In this module, diverse data manipulation
    procedures are applied on the inconsistent IoT data, such as noisy data cleansing
    and filtering, depending on the data type and system purpose. In addition, data
    transformation techniques can be applied if special data formats are required
    for processing. Handling such procedures enriches analytics accuracy and consistency,
    as well as system reliability and availability. A data integration technique can
    be applied on the maintained data units to evaluate the approaches utilized in
    this module [95], as a data integration technique can efficiently represent the
    correlation between raw data and maintained data versions [96]. System Data Storage:
    The heterogeneity and massive features of IoT data enforce the usage of scalable
    and different database management systems to store the huge amounts of structured
    and unstructured data. Several database management systems can be deployed in
    this module, based on the structure of data units in the IoT domain in hand [96].
    B. System Resources Controller This layer ensures the reliable and scalable processing
    environment for IoT data. It applies data mining optimization techniques to recommend
    efficient allocation and distribution policies of the virtual and physical processing
    resources, in which the processing tasks can cope with the anytime huge data processing,
    access and storage [97]. This module can be evaluated through monitoring resource
    utilization, which is the percentage of resources consumed by the incoming workload
    to present how busy the CPU is [98]. C. System Recovery Manager System reliability
    is directly related to providing efficient data replication schemes and appropriate
    system backups solutions. This layer exploits the power of data analytics by deploying
    predictive analytics over the acquired data to forecast the growth of big IoT
    data, compared to the inspections achieved at the “System Resources Controller”,
    hence determine the storage space needed for future growing data. Recovery time
    objective, which determines how quickly systems must be recovered, can be used
    to evaluate the recovery methodologies of this module [99]. D. SWE Handler This
    layer achieves the main concepts of SWE to ensure the overall system QoS. This
    layer is composed of the following modules: Concerns Separator: This module follows
    the aspect-oriented approach for the separation of concerns that facilitates system
    scalability, reusability and maintainability. It starts by ‘Concerns Identification’,
    which recognizes the core and crosscutting concerns of the IoT system by dynamically
    exposing join points during the execution of the system. Join points include the
    execution of methods, creation of objects, or throwing of exceptions. “Concerns
    Composition” and “Trade-off Resolution” then manage the composition of all related
    concerns by selecting a specific set of join points that satisfies the concerns
    criteria based on different logical operators. The inconsistencies resulted from
    this composition process are then eliminated by applying some filtering techniques.
    “Concerns Representation” represents the resultant concerns by constructing their
    equivalent connected graph, whereas “Concerns Mapping to Architecture Design”
    maps it further to the software architecture design. This module can be validated
    using correlation matrices between the concerns and the generated classes [100].
    MDE Handler: This module ensures the overall system reusability and maintainability
    using model driven engineering approaches that provide a direct process of design,
    construction and maintenance of software by determining the Computation Independent
    Model (CIM) and Platform Independent Model (PIM) of the IoT system. The CIM maps
    the functional requirements to the domain requirements by analyzing the domain
    feature model of the system, expressing the reusable elements in that specific
    domain. The functional requirements and domain features are analyzed by constructing
    UML diagrams and a dictionary of services and techniques used for implementation
    respectively. Thus, CIM is developed by analyzing the user requirements and finding
    a matching set of features from the domain features dictionary. The PIM is then
    generated from the CIM using the domain patterns, which represent the reusable
    structures of the common problems across domains. Design pattern techniques are
    utilized to confirm that all functionalities in the CIM are reflected in the PIM.
    Several graphical code inspections can be conducted to evaluate this module [101].
    System defects are best found by code inspections, as they reveal functionalities’
    defects of a service. Automated V&V Handler: System reliability, SW functional
    suitability and availability are ensured via this module. It presents an IoT-based
    validation and verification model that dynamically generates test cases from UML
    models and establishes a testing simulation environment to test the system’s ability
    to be integrated, configured, installed, executed, upgraded, scaled-up, or scaled-out,
    saving costs and risks of testing the real system [102]. Further, it could support
    self-monitoring architectural models for high fault tolerance. Tracking testing
    progress technique can be applied to validate the testing process and ensure tests
    completeness [103]. Domain-Specific Language Handler: As per our study, the SW
    functional suitability has become one of the major SWE challenges that has not
    been addressed yet in IoT-based systems to the best of our knowledge. This module
    ensures functional suitability by handling domain-specific mini-languages built
    on the top of the hosting language to provide concepts and behaviors in a specific
    context. This presents an interface for diverse service types in a specific domain,
    and facilitates converting, transforming and combining data from multiple services
    to meet the operations needs and satisfy both business and technical requirements.
    Different user interfaces validation techniques from various domains can be considered
    to evaluate this module, which can automatically validate knowledge from heterogeneous
    systems [104]. E. BDA Handler In this layer, data analytics are performed to maintain
    the big data characteristics of the collected IoT data per each of the following
    modules: Data Aggregation: Data aggregation techniques are needed to ensure data
    fusion from multiple and heterogenous IoT data sources into one data repository.
    This module presents a data aggregation model that supports different network
    protocols for different data models with a minimum time between data generation
    and aggregation. This supports analytics anywhere, optimum latency and accurate
    analytics. Confirming data features stability before and after aggregation can
    be used to validate this module [105]. Data Reduction: This module provides different
    approaches to support scalability despite of the huge data volume and to minimize
    their processing time. Data reduction techniques are applied to reduce the multidimensional
    massive IoT data. Data could be reduced in (1) amount, using dataset sampling
    or filtering, or (2) dimension, using dimensionality reduction techniques that
    maintain data correlations or both. This module can be evaluated via the system
    latency and response time before and after data reduction, in addition to the
    applied reduction technique accuracy metric [106]. Data Analysis: Upon maintaining
    IoT data features and considering IoT data processing challenges, this module
    performs the required business analytics depending on the application purpose.
    The Analytics accuracy and latency are managed through several accuracy metrics
    and multi-threading libraries [92]. Data Interpretation & Visualization: Information
    become easily interpreted when effective visualization techniques are utilized.
    This module supports different representation forms for the analytical results,
    based on the application type. For instance, charts are best suitable for numeric
    results, maps for spatial outcomes, … etc. [107]. F. System Security As secured
    processing is a main challenge for IoT data, this layer intersects with all layers
    of the architecture to ensure system security. Its responsibilities vary among
    the layers. For instance, it identifies attacks and authenticates external accesses
    and data storage access all over the system layers, whereas at the BDA Handler
    and SWE Handler layers, it assigns security rules for the system users to accomplish
    each task. At the Data Manager layer, it validates data providers based on legal
    licenses of data usage and networks information encryption. This module can be
    evaluated by initiating several attacks from variant networks and different profiles
    to ensure system security and privacy [108]. G. Implementation Challenges This
    section highlights the challenges, as well as the research and development (R&D)
    efforts that are expected to draw the attention of the research community regarding
    the implementation of the proposed domain-independent BDA-based IoT architecture.
    Each module in the proposed architecture is subject to face the following challenges:
    Data Manager: Supporting heterogeneous data is the main processing concern that
    would endure this module to cope with the different network protocols, ensuring
    data consistency and data storage. System Resources Controller: The massive amount
    of data is a serious challenge to manage the system resources. System Recovery
    Manager: Appropriate innovative data replication schemes and backup solutions
    should be adopted. Thus, initiating such solutions with real-time data is a major
    challenge. SWE Handler: Considering data heterogeneity, inconsistency and freshness
    are the main processing challenges to maintain SWE concepts, such as V&V, MDE
    and separation of concerns. BDA Handler: BDA accuracy is directly affected by
    the different IoT data features, such as the massive data amounts, data heterogeneity
    and inconsistency, which negatively impacts on IoT data analytics. System Security:
    The massive amount of open-accessed data introduces a real challenge to secure
    IoT-based systems. SECTION XI. Discussion and Conclusion Nowadays, the Internet
    of Things (IoT) phenomenon produces a complicated type of data characterized by
    their huge amount, high speed, unstructured format, valuable and credential meaning,
    inconsistencies and spatial correlations. Thus, the emergence of IoT systems brings
    new challenges from both the big data analytics (BDA) and software engineering
    (SWE) perspectives to process and analyze such data. Despite of conducting many
    surveys for IoT-based systems from different perspectives, but the SWE concepts
    and BDA characteristics for such systems are still ambiguous and overlooked with
    respect to the IoT-specific data features. This raises different challenges and
    concerns for the data processing and analytics at these IoT systems. Yet, there
    is no adapted architecture or taxonomy dedicated to process and analyze IoT data,
    irrespective of the IoT domain. To the best of our knowledge, this paper exclusively
    reveals the trade-off relation between BDA, SWE and IoT, and discloses the relation
    between the challenges of SWE and BDA to support an optimum processing platform
    for IoT-based systems. It presents a systematic literature review of IoT-based
    studies at different domains, which are smart environments, human-related analytics
    and network-related analytics, energy-related analytics and environmental-related
    analytics. The study investigates the challenges of these systems from the BDA
    perspective based on the current big data 10 Vs, as well as the processing difficulties
    from the SWE perspective of the main IoT systems, highlighting many research opportunities
    for further consideration to provide secure, available, reliable, scalable, interoperable,
    maintainable, reusable and functional suitable real-time data processing for IoT
    data. In addition, the study inspects that these SWE challenges have emerged due
    to neglecting specific essential SWE concepts while processing IoT data. The main
    abandoned SWE concepts in most of the IoT-based systems at various domains can
    be inferred to be domain-specific languages for functional suitability, separation
    of concerns for maintainability, model-driven engineering (MDE) approaches for
    reusability and systematic validation and verification for reliability. Regarding
    the IoT data challenges with respect to BDA, they are implied to include the huge
    volume of different data models support, as well as the analytics latency, accuracy,
    interpretation, consistency and confidentiality, addressing the current 10 Vs
    of big data. A matrix that presents a concrete overview on the specific IoT data
    features and their encountered challenges and gaps for each IoT domain is provided.
    Accordingly, we propose a domain-independent software architecture for big IoT
    data analytics. The proposed architecture exclusively introduces a comprehensive
    solution for online-based data analysis in IoT-based systems that maintains the
    investigated challenges from both SWE and BDA perspectives through six main layers
    interacting with the business-logic layer of the IoT application and its raw data
    providers. A discussion is further presented to highlight the main challenges
    and R&D efforts that would face the research community at the implementation of
    the proposed architecture. Hence, the contribution of this study can be summarized
    as follows: (1) deducing key IoT data features, (2) identifying the SWE concepts
    and big data characteristics concerned with such IoT data features, (3) inferring
    the resultant BDA and SWE challenges from the IoT data features, and (4) proposing
    a domain independent BDA-based IoT processing architecture that handles the highlighted
    challenges from both the SWE and BDA perspectives, as well as drawing the attention
    to its implementation challenges and the associated implications. Our future research
    efforts focus on investigating the optimum security and privacy preservation approaches
    that would fit the deduced IoT data features, while maintaining system performance
    and timely results. In addition, future considerations are intended for better
    resources utilization and power saving approaches that ideally suit IoT-based
    systems in various domains. Appendix AbbreviationExpansion Abbreviation Explanation

    Abstract Several cities have recently moved towards becoming smart cities for
    better services and quality of life for residents and visitors, with: optimized
    resource utilization; increased environmental protection; enhanced infrastructure
    operations and maintenance; and strong safety and security measures. Smart cities
    depend on deploying current and new technologies and different optimization methods
    to enhance services and performance in their different sectors. Some of the technologies
    assisting smart city applications are the Internet of Things (IoT), fog computing,
    and cloud computing. Integrating these three to serve one system (we will refer
    to it as integrated IoT-fog-cloud system (iIFC)) creates an advanced platform
    to develop and operate various types of smart city applications. This platform
    will allow applications to use the best features from the IoT devices, fog nodes,
    and cloud services to deliver best capabilities and performance. Utilizing this
    powerful platform will provide many opportunities for enhancing and optimizing
    applications in energy, transportation, healthcare, and other areas. In this paper
    we survey various applications of iIFCs for smart cities. We identify different
    common issues associated with utilizing iIFCs for smart city applications. These
    issues arise due to the characteristics of iIFCs on the one side and the requirements
    of different smart city applications on the other. In addition, we outline the
    main requirements to effectively utilize iIFCs for smart city applications. These
    requirements are related to optimization, networking, and security. Keywords:

    computing; optimization; networking; security 1. Introduction In 1950, 746 million
    people lived in urban areas worldwide. This number has increased more than five
    times to 4.22 billion, as of 2018 [1]. Moreover, this number is estimated to rise
    to around 6.68 billion by 2050. Subsequently, several cities are speedily increasing
    in numbers of residents. For example, the number of big cities with a population
    higher than 10 million will grow from 10 cities in 1990 to 43 cities in 2030.
    Furthermore, we will have 66 large cities with a population between 5 and 10 million
    in 2030 compared to 21 in 1990 and 48 in 2018. Consequently, the governments of
    these big cities will face many issues in providing good quality of life for their
    populations. One potential resolution for such issues is transforming these cities
    to smart cities. Progress in communication technologies, IoT, cloud and fog computing,
    and software technologies strongly contributed to the evolving concept of smart
    cities. Many unique opportunities can be offered by these technologies to create
    a wide array of applications that optimize smart cities’ services. IoT enables
    the interaction of different physical objects, including sensors and actuators,
    and integrates them with a smart city network. Cloud computing offers powerful,
    scalable, and on-demand computation, data storage, and innovative software services
    to enable different smart city applications. Fog computing provides real-time
    services, better location and context awareness processing, mobility supports,
    and advanced communication services, such as streaming support for smart city
    applications [2]. The combination of these technologies allows applications to
    utilize the best features of each one to optimize operations and enhance the quality
    of service. As the cloud provides virtually limitless storage and processing capabilities,
    fog nodes supplement those with locality and mobility tuned functions with accurate
    location awareness, real-time responses, caching services, and localized critical
    processing. When the IoT, fog computing, and cloud computing are integrated into
    one system, this integrated system can offer an advanced and comprehensive platform
    for developing and operating many smart city applications [3,4,5]. In such a platform,
    all entities of smart cities like cars, individuals, buildings, roads, hospitals,
    and power and water plants are equipped with IoT components, which connected together
    and linked with fog computing and cloud computing platforms executing smart programs
    to improve the capabilities and features of smart cities. Our previous paper [6]
    offers an overview of some iIFCs smart city applications and issues. In this paper,
    we extend our previous work to provide a comprehensive survey of such applications
    to smart cities with more detailed discussions of their benefits and challenges.
    The main contribution of this paper is comprehensively surveying the applications
    of iIFCs in smart cities and exploring the opportunities for utilizing these iIFCs.
    In addition, this paper investigates the issues and requirements for the design
    and implementation of smart city applications based on the iIFCs. Based on the
    surveyed applications, we identify common issues with utilizing iIFCs for smart
    city applications. These issues are related to the characteristics of iIFCs and
    the requirements needed by various smart city applications. Examples of the issues
    include integration effectiveness, communication, reliability, scalability, security
    and privacy, mobility, network monitoring and management, development, and testing
    environment requirements. In addition, we have to also consider the cost-effectiveness
    requirement in providing smart solutions for smart city applications. We then
    provide new analysis and elaboration regarding their optimization, data collection,
    networks, and security requirements as well as more discussion regarding open
    research issues. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the concepts
    of smart cities and iIFCs in addition to a brief overview of related work. Section
    3 surveys different smart city applications utilizing iIFCs. The issues and challenges
    of utilizing iIFCs for smart cities are discussed in Section 4. Different aspects
    of iIFC smart city applications are discussed in the following sections: optimization
    issues and techniques in Section 5, supported networks in Section 6, and security
    requirements in Section 7. Section 8 provides discussions and open issues, and
    Section 9 concludes the paper. 2. Concept and Related Work This section starts
    with a discussion of the general concepts of smart cities. It also discusses the
    concept of iIFCs for smart city applications, then it briefly goes over some related
    work in the field. 2.1. Smart Cities The smart city concept intends to enhance
    the quality of life of populations, improve the utilization of city resources,
    enhance sustainability, and reduce harm to the environment. This concept depends
    on innovative optimization approaches, technological developments, and both historic
    and real-time data to accomplish the goals of smart cities. The smartness level
    of a city can be measured by several attributes involving smart people, smart
    living, smart economy, smart mobility, smart environment, and smart governance.
    A number of cities in different countries have determined to transfer to smart
    cities for several motives. These motives include rapidly expanding populations,
    limited unused areas for development, insufficient resources, enhanced awareness
    of energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, and economic developments.
    The IBM Global Business Services Executive Report [7] recognizes four high-effect
    points of intelligent cities: Decrease overcrowding in transport systems; Increase
    community safety by dropping crime levels and reducing emergency reaction time;
    Modernize and adapt services for residents, involving a high weight on education;
    and Empower suitable access to healthcare information to improve quality of healthcare
    and timely disease discovery and avoidance. A smart city vision includes advanced
    interactive observing and management of the situations of all the city’s important
    systems and structures, like energy systems, communication systems, water systems,
    streets, highways, vehicles, airports, hospitals, bridges, tunnels, and subways
    to improve the operation and utilization of resource consumption while delivering
    excellent services to the residents [8,9]. This can be achieved by utilizing Information
    and Communication Technology (ICT) to enhance those provided services. It is regularly
    declared that the main objective of utilizing ICT is to progress current services
    and applications by making them more efficient, cost-effective, and user-friendly
    or citizen-centric. With the new developments in ICT, all important systems and
    structures can be integrated, monitored, and managed for the advantage of residents.
    2.2. iIFCs for Smart Cities Some of the evolving technologies that can successfully
    be utilized for smart cities are IoT, fog computing, and cloud computing. An example
    of an iIFC is shown in Figure 1 illustrating how different IoT components in some
    smart city applications connect to different fog nodes, which in turn connect
    to the cloud. Integrating these technologies into one system provides a powerful
    platform that can be used to develop and operate different smart city applications.
    iIFCs help link, observe, and facilitate improvements in all parts of the cities
    using the IoT, fog computing services, and cloud computing services. Figure 1.
    iIFCs Architecture (Flat fog architecture). In this model, cloud computing delivers
    an elastic virtual processing environment and on-demand software and hardware
    services for several applications [10]. It can analyze and store huge data sets
    (e.g., it is estimated that collected healthcare data in 2020 is more than 2000
    exabytes [11]) and deliver computing powers that can easily be scaled in or out
    according to the changing needs of the smart city’s applications. The IoT integrates
    countless physical entities in a city network [12]. These physical objects can
    be small- or medium-sized devices, such as sensors, actuators, robots, and unmanned
    aerial vehicles (UAV), or they can be large integrated components, such as smart
    traffic lights and smart buildings. Many smart city applications require real-time
    control methods and access to services obtainable near the areas where IoT devices
    are available. Nevertheless, the cloud cannot always provide these necessities,
    generally because of the lengthy distances between the cloud computing location
    and the connected IoT devices. Consequently, fog computing was created to offer
    localized to services [2]. Fog platforms can improve the IoT-cloud integration
    model by offering small platforms placed at the edges of smart cities networks.
    Fog nodes can execute cloud-like services to provision numerous IoT operations.
    These services can be computation, data storage, management and control, integration,
    value-added communications services which enable some IoT based applications in
    smart cities. The fog platform will enable the execution of services physically
    close to the IoT devices. Thus, fog computing can provide more localized real-time
    monitoring and management for smart city services and applications, while the
    cloud is more capable of providing large-scale and advanced monitoring, management,
    optimization, and planning mechanisms for smart city services and applications.
    The integration of different fog and cloud services to build smart applications
    helps to effectively realize the concept of smart cities. There are two fog computing
    architectures for smart city applications: flat fog computing architecture and
    hierarchical fog computing architecture. In a flat architecture, as shown in Figure
    1, all of the fog nodes have similar functionalities, they all connect IoT devices,
    and networks are on one side while the cloud is on the other side of the fog layer.
    The hierarchical architecture, as shown in Figure 2, allows for the creation of
    different levels of fog computing nodes with varying capabilities. This is used
    for more efficient communication and operations to support different applications
    in smart cities [13,14]. In this architecture fog nodes can be structured in multiple
    levels and n-tier fog computing between IoT devices and cloud computing can be
    used. Thus, there will be multiple intermediate fog level layers. Each fog level
    mostly communicates and enables services to and from its upper level and lower
    level [15]. In smart cities, diverse infrastructure components, such as smart
    buildings, smart traffic light systems, and smart structure management need to
    be monitored and controlled. It is more efficient and effective to use hierarchical
    fog computing architectures for these applications [13]. In this architecture
    fog nodes have diverse characteristics at various levels in terms of latency and
    capability. Consequently, they can have different functionalities to support smart
    cities. For example, each fog node in the lower level of a two-level fog computing
    architecture in a smart city can offer some functions to support a single smart
    building or a single smart traffic light. However, each fog node in the upper
    level can offer some functions to support all smart buildings or all smart traffic
    lights in a neighborhood. Figure 2. iIFCs architecture (two-level hierarchical
    fog architecture). The fog nodes are typically stationary nodes offered via dedicated
    computers or network routers. Yet, fog nodes can also be mobile. One instance
    of the use of mobile fog nodes is UAV-based fog computing (UAVFog) [16], as shown
    in Figure 3. UAVFog provides fog computing abilities onboard one or more UAVs
    that can dynamically support IoT services and applications at various locations.
    UAVFog is an exceptionally mobile and flexible fog node that can be rapidly relocated
    to different zones in a smart city to supply certain fog services as required.
    Figure 3. UAVFog supporting IoT applications. The architectural layers of iIFCs
    for smart cities is illustrated in Figure 4. In this architecture smart city applications
    are implemented using services provided by the iIFCs. These services can be provided
    by the cloud, fog nodes, or IoT components. One example of cloud computing is
    the use of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), where smart city application developers
    utilize cloud application software (services) running on the cloud infrastructure.
    These software services usually need powerful resources and offer many features
    like data mining, machine learning (ML), decision support, and optimization. Cloud
    computing also provides Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), where developers implement
    and deploy their own applications within the cloud platform. In addition, there
    is Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), where developers benefit directly from
    the computing and storage resources (virtual machines) offered and managed by
    cloud service providers. Examples of fog services include localized and highly
    responsive services like device control, streaming, data caching, location-based
    support, and other similar services. IoT services include Sensing-as-a-Service
    and Configuration-as-a-Service. Developers can mix, match, and make use of needed
    services across all platforms to implement different smart city applications.
    This makes iIFCs the perfect platform for developing and operating smart city
    applications. Figure 4. iIFCs layers for smart city applications. 2.3. Related
    Work There have been many research efforts in investigating and surveying different
    applications and technological issues related to smart cities and urban areas.
    Rashid and Rehmani [17] surveyed the urban area applications of wireless sensor
    networks. In their survey they covered both monitoring applications and networking
    issues, yet they did not include issues related to fog and cloud computing. Al
    Nuaimi et al. [9] surveyed applications of big data to smart cities, and Mohamed
    at al. [18] surveyed UAV applications to smart cities. Gharaibeh et al. [19] surveyed
    different smart city technologies, data management, and security issues, while
    Jawhar et al. [20] discussed networking architectures and protocols for smart
    city systems. Other issues facing IoT-based smart cities have also been investigated
    and surveyed [21,22,23,24]. However, these investigations either did not include
    fog computing issues or did not include both fog and cloud computing issues. In
    addition, the use of fog computing for smart cities was investigated in different
    research papers like Tang et al. [13,25] as well as He et al. [26], who proposed
    multi-level hierarchical fog computing architectures for big data analytics in
    smart cities. Perera et al. [27] investigated the use of fog computing for sustainable
    smart cities and covered case studies pertaining to various smart cities. Zahmatkesh
    and Al-Turjman [28] reviewed the enabling technologies and caching techniques
    for utilizing fog computing for smart cities. SmartCityWare [3] was proposed as
    a service-oriented middleware for enabling the development and operations of cloud
    and fog integrated smart city services. Furthermore, Giordano et al. [29] developed
    a platform that executes multi-agent systems to support smart city applications.
    Javadzadeh and Rahmani [30] provided a systematic review of utilizing fog computing
    for smart cities. The authors mainly focused on fog computing utilizations without
    covering the issues related to integration with IoT and cloud computing. Mahmud
    et al. [31] provided a taxonomy, review, and future direction potentials for application
    management in fog computing environments. These were reviewed in terms of architecture,
    placement, and maintenance. Furthermore, there are some surveys that mainly focused
    on fog computing issues such as architectures, security, and research challenges
    and directions without discussing smart city situations and applications [32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41].
    Unlike these surveys, we focus on applications of iIFCs for smart cities and discuss
    the integration issues. The closest related work to this paper can be seen in
    resources [42,43]. Both studies, like this paper, focus more on the integration
    issues of iIFCs environments. Dizdarević et al. [42] surveyed the communications
    protocols for IoT and the integration issues with fog and cloud computing. However,
    this survey is set within the general IoT context and does not directly link to
    smart city applications. Bittencourt et al. [43] studied the technical benefits
    and challenges of the IoT, fog computing, and cloud computing continuum. However,
    they did not cover application benefits in smart city scenarios. The focus of
    this paper is on applications of iIFC environments for smart cities, their benefits,
    requirements, and associated issues. 3. Applications Recently many new smart city
    applications have emerged. Here, we specifically discuss several IoT-based smart
    city applications. These applications are effectively and efficiently implemented
    and operated using integrated services provided by the IoT, fog computing, and
    cloud computing. We categorized these applications based on their application
    domains as illustrated in Figure 5. Needless to say, IoT-based applications require
    computing power. Traditionally this is offered on premise computing facilities,
    then some were migrated to the cloud. However, each model has its advantages and
    disadvantages. When we integrate IoT-based systems with both cloud and fog computing,
    we can use the best of each to create more effective and efficient applications.
    Figure 5. iIFC smart city application domains. 3.1. Smart Energy Applications
    iIFCs can be utilized to offer better monitoring, management, decisions services,
    flexibility, and agility for smart grids [44,45]. These features may help improve
    reliability and save on cost and energy. Smart grids are improved electrical grid
    systems that employ different technologies to offer some improvements such as
    cost-effectiveness, reliability, efficiency, and sustainability of the generation
    and distribution of electric energy. These improvements are accomplished by gathering
    and controlling the collected information, such as information about the production
    activities of providers and the consuming behaviors of clients in an automated
    manner. iIFCs can provide many capabilities to enable communication and control
    between energy producers and customers to improve overall grid efficiency, cost-effectiveness,
    and robustness by using system self-examining and self-acting through closed-loop
    feedback controls. This involves placing and controlling IoT devices, such as
    smart sensors and meters, through power production, transmission, and distribution
    facilities to consumer facilities to obtain granular live information concerning
    the current statuses of electricity energy generation, utilization, and problems.
    Smart grids need to gather and analyze huge amounts of data, collected from millions
    of connected smart meters and other smart grid data sources, and instantaneously
    process the gathered data to send back the necessary control signals and maintain
    the improved operations, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of the complete electric
    power system. Fog computing can be utilized as a distributed platform to execute
    the control models for managing different components of smart grids [46]. Deploying
    local computing and processing services on fog nodes at the edge of the network
    offers location-awareness, low latency, and real-time data analysis for smart
    grid applications. These features can be used to build more controllable, and
    reliable smart grid infrastructures that offer energy efficiency and cost reductions
    [45]. In addition, fog computing can help in maintaining the balance between electricity
    consumption and distribution [47]. Furthermore, cloud services can be deployed
    for critical management and planning applications in smart grids such as power
    load prediction, power utilization assessment, and failure discovery [48]. Moreover,
    incorporating renewable energy resources to smart grids requires having some real-time
    capabilities for integration management to enable the reliability, efficiency,
    and cost-effectiveness of integration [49]. These management services can be implemented
    and offered by iIFCs. Generally, all smart grid functionality can be satisfied
    through cloud services. However, taking into consideration the size of a smart
    grid (covering large cities and, possibly, the whole country), the load on these
    cloud services will be very high and costly. Adding fog nodes to handle local
    events, aggregate data, respond to small scale processing needs at specific locations,
    will reduce network traffic, shorten response time, and reduce the demand on the
    cloud nodes. Another important energy application of iIFCs is managing microgrids.
    A microgrid is a localized set of electric power sources and loads integrated
    and managed with the objective of enhancing energy production and consumption
    efficiencies and reliabilities [50]. The electric power sources can be distributed
    power generators, renewable energy stations, and energy storage components in
    facilities created and owned by different organizations or energy providers. One
    of the main advantages of microgrid technology is that it not only allows residents
    and other electric power consumers, such as factories, to have access to the needed
    energy, it also allows them to produce and sell excess energy to the grid. In
    this regard fog computing can be used to facilitate the operations of microgrids
    [51] locally instead of shipping all data to the cloud for processing. This will
    save time and reduce the load on the cloud nodes, thus saving their resources
    for the more compute- and storage-intensive operations. In addition, local fog
    nodes will be more customizable to each microgrid and can respond to localized
    events quickly without the need for external support from the cloud. One possibly
    extreme scenario is if an accident happens in one microgrid, possible starting
    a fire or other problem that requires immediate action. A local fog node can discover
    and initiate mitigation actions almost immediately. In such case, waiting for
    processing and feedback from the cloud could have catastrophic results. Fog computing
    services can support interoperability, scalability, ease of deployment, and cost
    effectiveness of services managing microgrids. The integration of fog computing
    and microgrids can be utilized to reduce the energy consumption of some types
    of IoT applications [52]. Fog computing can facilitate better controls for realizing
    an energy efficient IoT and optimizing the usage of energy resources, such as
    local renewable energy. In addition, fog computing can be utilized to track load
    changes in microgrids and compensate in real-time. Load changes can be captured
    and managed in a distributed manner using multi-level fog computing. This helps
    avoid centralized management and enhances the realization of an optimal dispatch
    of microgrids [53]. In such a model issues like high communication traffic, massive
    computational burdens in large-scale systems, and the increased complexity of
    real-time monitoring of microgrids can be avoided. Cloud computing can also provide
    additional planning services to improve the operations of microgrids and enable
    the construction of smart microgrids. Examples of such services include resource
    optimization, power flow analysis, resource allocation, and economic analysis
    [54]. In addition, some smart services can be used to reduce the power demand
    issue [55]. Moreover, integrating fog computing with smart services on the cloud
    will better support power demands and production management by reducing the high
    volume of information being transferred to the cloud while also assuming some
    analysis and processing responsibilities to improve response times [56]. iIFCs
    can also offer services to manage energy usage in smart buildings. Energy consumption
    in commercial, industrial, and residential buildings is accountable for a substantial
    ratio of total power usage. For instance, power usage in buildings is estimated
    to be about 40% of their total energy consumption in Europe. A significant methodology
    to this high consumption energy issue is to consider the idea of smart buildings
    which employ various technologies to offer intelligent functions for the management
    of a building’s equipment, for examples its heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning
    (HVAC) systems, lighting systems, and different appliances. Building Energy Management
    Systems (BEMS) are employed for such management. Cloud facilitated BEMS [57] can
    be utilized to improve the automation features of smart buildings by offering
    configuration and analytics services to decrease power use. These include services
    for advanced power diagnostics [58] and advanced data analytics for several equivalent
    buildings [59]. Moreover, iIFCs can be utilized as a platform for the creation
    of an energy knowledge system pertaining to smart building consumption in smart
    cities and the execution of big data analytics to improve energy-efficiency decisions
    and management in these buildings [60]. Another smart city application that offers
    energy savings is smart lighting [61,62]. Cities light their streets, parks, and
    other indoor and outdoor facilities for the convenience and safety of their residents.
    Smart lighting systems can help by adjusting based on daylight availability and
    occupancy levels. For example, the lighting on long stretches of roads can be
    automated to turn on and off depending on the street usage. Lights in parks and
    other facilities can be dimmed significantly after working hours. Some can be
    programmed to turn on if they detect movement. Fog computing can be used to provide
    localized and adaptive management to control smart lighting systems that can quickly
    respond to changes, while collected data over time can be off-loaded to the cloud
    for more in-depth analysis. 3.2. Smart Water Network Applications Smart water
    networks resemble smart grids in terms of structure and operational needs. A lot
    of the work in the applications can be done remotely on the cloud. However, there
    are areas where local computing capabilities are necessary for enhance operations.
    For example, locally monitoring and controlling water pipelines to avoid major
    water losses by quickly detecting and reacting to leaks in addition to dynamically
    adjusting supply levels based on real-time consumption information. iIFCs can
    be utilized to develop, deploy, and operate different services to manage smart
    water networks. These services can enable them to be more efficient, reliable,
    and sustainable. IoT devices such as sensors and actuators can be attached to
    water networks to provide some management and monitoring mechanisms and add smart
    features for water networks [63]. An example of these features is an early warning
    mechanism to detect possible issues in water networks. For instance, issues like
    leaks and pipe bursts can be noticed quickly [64]. This permits for the employment
    of short-term initial resolutions to prevent water waste and decrease the risk
    of major damages. Additionally, iIFCs can deliver a set of services to screen
    the water quality in a water network and deliver live data on the potential occurrence
    of pollutants in the water being supplied. This capability could prove beneficial
    in detecting both the places of origin for such defects as well as their causes.
    While both IoT and fog computing can offer local observing and control for smart
    water networks, the cloud will offer smart services for evaluating and managing
    the diverse issues of such water networks. Furthermore, on the cloud, it is possible
    to include a knowledge-based system developed according to collected data and
    used to facilitate and inform future planning and enhancement decisions. For example,
    the knowledge-based system can be used to build more accurate models of a water
    network and its operations. This will help to improve the sustainability and resilience
    of the water network’s infrastructure [65]. IoT and fog computing can also provide
    other applications for smart water networks like enabling precision irrigation
    [66]. Fog computing-based solutions can alleviate the scalability challenge of
    large-scale IoT-based smart water networks [67]. Furthermore, fog computing can
    help reduce network traffic between a network’s IoT devices and the cloud. For
    example, fog nodes can decrease the amount of data being transferred by optimizing
    the local analysis and aggregation of collected data from the smart meters in
    a large smart city’s infrastructure before sending it to the cloud [68]. 3.3.
    Smart Transportation Applications As obtained from an investigation directed by
    Seattle-based INRIX and the Centre for Economics and Business Research, congestions
    in road traffic cost around $124 billion in the United States in 2013 alone. This
    includes $78 billion of direct losses because of fuel consumed in traffic congestions
    and $45 billion indirect losses in businesses. This already large number is projected
    to rise to $186 billion in 2030 [69]. A significant contribution to this high
    cost is because of congestions in metropolitan areas. Los Angeles, for instance,
    contributes around 20 percent of the whole of the United States’ traffic congestion
    expenditures. Luckily, traffic congestion and its associated expenditures can
    be meaningfully decreased by utilizing iIFCs to support smart transportation management
    services that aid in traffic management, smart route planning, as well as smart
    car parking. iIFCs can be utilized to deploy smart traffic-light managements,
    which include observing devices across many places to correctly forecast traffic
    models and regulate traffic lights to improve flow. Furthermore, this application
    can utilize vehicles’ location information, which can be obtained from global
    positioning systems as well as vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure
    communication systems to create a more comprehensive assessment of traffic conditions.
    To achieve high performance and real-time responses, localized fog nodes can be
    deployed to handle local traffic analysis and adjustments needs, while collaborating
    with other local fog nodes in different areas to coordinate controls across multiple
    locations. Collecting, correlating, and processing data coming from hundreds of
    traffic lights on the cloud will be a lot slower and will take longer to arrive
    at satisfactory controls for each area. In addition, most of the data and analysis
    is localized and does not require similar data from other areas, therefore passing
    it to the cloud for processing is not necessary. This supplementary information
    can also be applied to improve overall urban traffic management through cloud
    services. This kind of smart city application can cut traffic delays, lessen vehicle
    travel times, enhance the average velocity of vehicles on the road, and improve
    conditions for emergency vehicles’ movements in urban areas. Smart and efficient
    learning and adaptation software algorithms are typically employed in such applications
    to improve urban traffic management. Examples of such algorithms have been proposed
    [70,71]. Furthermore, in these types of applications, fog computing services can
    be used to provide local traffic monitoring and management [72], while cloud computing
    services can be used to offer global city monitoring and management [3]. Another
    important application, which is related to the transportation sector and can be
    enabled by iIFCs, is a smart parking service [73]. Identifying the suitable parking
    spots for drivers going to particular destinations or events in crowded zones
    with several parking sections and buildings, such as the center of a city, can
    take a considerable amount of time. However, a smart parking service can quickly
    offer information regarding the existing parking lots in any given section of
    a smart city. Moreover, other functions can be included to improve the smart parking
    services, for example, discovering and booking the best suitable parking spot
    for each specific driver according to factors like walking distance, parking fees,
    access to main roads upon exit, etc. Smart parking services can be developed and
    executed by an IoT and fog computing platforms to observe and report untaken parking
    lots/spots, while some of cloud services can gather and process this data to search
    and assign the most suitable parking lot/spot for individual drivers, and a smartphone
    app can be employed to provide access to such services. This innovated parking
    service will not only enable each person to obtain an ideal parking spot quickly,
    but it will additionally decrease the traffic in a crowded zone, since the car
    owners will no longer spend lengthy amounts of time driving on the roads searching
    for parking. Other smart transportation applications in which iIFCs can play an
    important role are the applications for self-driving cars [74] and UAV taxis [75].
    Traffic monitoring sensors, fog services, and cloud services can be used in conjunction
    to provide safe transportation services for such applications. Cloud computing
    can be used to run ML tools, simulation environments, and observation and evaluation
    tools to provide a safe journey for both self-driving cars and UAV taxis. 3.4.
    Smart Health and Wellness Applications iIFCs can be used to provide ubiquitous
    healthcare and wellness services. Cloud computing can be utilized in healthcare
    applications to offer a powerful and scalable infrastructure to store and manage
    patients’ Electronic Health Records (EHRs). In addition, the cloud can offer various
    healthcare information services that enhance support for patients’ health needs
    as well as healthcare quality, financial operations, strategic planning processes,
    research capabilities, public safety support, and clinical trials processes [76,77].
    Cloud computing can also be used for archiving and processing medical images [78]
    and as an enabler for physician collaboration [79,80]. In addition, cloud computing
    can provide different services for IoT-based healthcare systems [81], which utilize
    wearable, environmental, and implanted sensors to monitor patient health and provide
    health assistance remotely. The connected cloud computing infrastructure and its
    services can store and analyze the data collected from these sensors and serve
    as an emergency health detector [82]. In addition, the cloud can provide some
    services to enable doctors to provide remote healthcare services for patients
    and share medical resources with other doctors and healthcare professionals. Ubiquitous
    healthcare can then be enhanced using fog computing on a more localized basis.
    Fog nodes can be installed in smart homes, smart healthcare clinics, or hospitals,
    giving them close proximity to the different IoT-based healthcare systems in these
    locations. This way, fog nodes can solve many issues facing these systems, such
    as scalability, mobility, energy efficiency, reliability, and interoperability
    [83]. Fog computing can be used to provide services supporting real-time patient
    monitoring for different illnesses, particularly acute illnesses. Such services
    could include an electrocardiogram feature to aid in the diagnosis of many cardiac
    diseases [84]. Fog computing can also be utilized to filter any unnecessary flow
    of information and provide better privacy and protection mechanisms for personal
    data [85]. In addition, other diseases such as autism and COVID-19 can be monitored
    in cities utilizing cloud-fog-IoT architecture [86,87]. 3.5. Smart Structural
    Health Management Applications It is essential for cities to preserve their infrastructures,
    such as their highway networks, tunnels, bridges, subway and train rails, and
    pipeline networks, and extend their life and utilization. Intelligent and live
    examining for these important infrastructures can be accomplished using iIFCs.
    Diverse sensor devices and other IoT components can be installed to monitor the
    integrity of these infrastructures and communicate any possibility for potential
    or imminent defects within the infrastructures [88,89]. Some cloud services can
    compile and analyze the possibility of such issues and assist in identifying the
    most suitable maintenance needs. In addition, a set of fog services can be used
    to provide local, real-time, adaptive, and smart monitoring for different cities’
    infrastructures. This aids in recognizing and fixing any issues at their initial
    phases as well as taking action to avoid such issues in the future. This can significantly
    reduce the time and costs needed to repair them. Furthermore, this improves the
    actual use of the infrastructure, as no considerable time will be required to
    conduct lengthy maintenance. Recently, different approaches and applications for
    monitoring structural health using smart sensing technology have been proposed.
    Examples include smartphones, UAVs, cameras, and robotic sensors. These smart
    sensing technologies can acquire structural data in a more cost-effective manner
    [90]. They can provide effective vision-based structural health monitoring [91].
    For example, UAVs can be employed as flexible, speedy, and economical tools for
    inspecting some city structures [92]. UAVs can be directed quickly at any time
    to verify reported issues in these structures. They can also deliver photos or
    videos of possible problem areas. These can be examined with internal fog services
    or remote cloud services to identify any issues in the structures. Many ideas
    have been suggested for the application of UAVs in structural examinations for
    bridges [93], power lines [94], and water, gas, and oil pipelines [95]. Different
    data-driven and ML techniques have also been proposed to aid in recognizing different
    structural health conditions and symptoms [96,97,98]. These can be employed through
    the cloud to provide effective mechanisms with which to monitor these structures
    and discover problems early. Considering the use of fog nodes as part of such
    applications will help enhance the capabilities of the UAVs by allowing the onboard
    fog nodes to perform localized processing, filter data, and handle immediate needs
    before shipping everything to the cloud. This will reduce UAV-cloud communication
    and reduce energy consumption in the UAVs and take some of the load to the cloud
    resources. In addition, fog nodes can be useful when facing emergency situations
    such as natural disasters or large-scale accidents involving city infrastructures.
    If every building/area has local fog nodes, these can be equipped with monitoring
    and control capabilities that can quickly respond to local emergencies, while
    still capable of passing all information to the cloud for large-scale responses.
    For example, if a fire starts inside a building, the IoT devices will detect it
    and trigger specific applications in local fog nodes that in turn will evaluate
    the situation, dispatch fire engines, and initiate evacuation procedures in real-time,
    while also calculating possible risks to nearby structures to issue the necessary
    warnings. 3.6. Smart Security and Public Safety Applications Smart cities should
    provide smart security services to protect their infrastructures and residents.
    Some new technologies, in addition to cloud computing and fog computing, can enable
    the implementation and operation of smart security services. One common approach
    to use remote cameras for monitoring. A set of cameras can be installed and used
    to provide remote monitoring for critical places, such as airports, train and
    subway stations, important street intersections, power plants, etc. In addition,
    they are installed to monitor abnormal human behaviors in some areas, such as
    sports facilities, workplaces, busy streets, and malls. These cameras are usually
    connected to monitoring stations where security officers can observe the activities
    in these areas using multiple screens. The recorded videos are usually stored
    in circular storage due to storage limitations. One of the main issues with this
    approach is the question of how a limited number of officers can efficiently and
    effectively monitor large facilities equipped with hundreds or maybe thousands
    of cameras. Another issue is that with so many cameras installed, there is a need
    for very large storage space even with the use of circular storage. One attractive
    solution for the officers/screens problem is to have video-based abnormal motion
    detection [99] and video-based abnormal human behavior recognition [100]. Several
    smart algorithms have been developed that can provide automation for detecting
    abnormal situations. These algorithms usually need high and scalable processing
    power to provide real-time alerts. iIFCs can be utilized to implement these algorithms
    and support those smart video monitoring applications that can help protect city
    infrastructures and residents. In addition, the scalable storage in the cloud
    can be used for circular buffering of captured videos and make them available
    when needed. Fog nodes can be used to optimize the communication and operations
    of installed cameras and the cloud [101]. For example, fog nodes will locally
    analyze and store videos and selectively forward videos to the cloud or to a security
    control center if they detected abnormal situations. iIFCs can be used to provide
    physical security for smart city residents. This is especially important in protecting
    children, women, people with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups, as concerns
    for their wellbeing and safety are rising [102,103]. In addition, this can be
    an important part of the protection details for public figures and extraordinary
    people, who are generally in the spotlight and monitoring them can cause major
    problems in terms of protecting their private lives or putting them at risk by
    exposing their routines, movements, and interactions. By using wearable, mobile,
    and fixed IoT devices as well as fog and cloud computing to uninterruptedly monitor
    residents and make timely decisions and actions, it is possible to prevent undesirable
    events or accidents from taking place [104]. Instead of making all the decisions
    either locally, using local and wearable IoT devices, or globally, using the cloud,
    the multilevel approach of processing information among the IoT devices, fog,
    and cloud can provide more accurate monitoring and information within a shorter
    response time [104]. In this approach, devices at the IoT level collect information
    about a situation and make initial security decisions. Some decisions may require
    processes beyond the capabilities of the IoT devices, thus fog nodes nearby can
    provide these needs locally and quickly. Furthermore, the fog and cloud levels
    can further process the data and make more advanced decisions based on predefined
    requirements. This way, the fog and cloud are utilized to execute smarter more
    sophisticated algorithms requiring more resources to evaluate the situation. iIFCs
    can also be employed to offer crowd-management services for big special events
    like festivals, carnivals, important sports games, or any outdoor events [105].
    During such events it is critical to enforce organization and law to be able screen
    and estimate crowd movements and conduct fast analyses, decisions, actions regarding
    some public security and safety concerns, like improving police attendance in
    around some zones, closing down some streets to smooth ordinary movement, and
    opening additional parking areas. Crowd monitoring could be accomplished via road
    cameras, smartphone positions examination, traffic sensor systems, and other systems
    used to track vehicle movements. UAVs can also be used for crowd monitoring [18].
    UAVs can be used as flexible and moveable fog computing nodes [16] that provide
    services to improve the monitoring of specific crowds or areas. Such advanced
    technologies allow for tracing and understanding crowds’ locations, concentration
    levels, and potential movement directions. A UAV can typically have good onboard
    computing and storage facilities to handle local monitoring and processing needs
    for these applications. Vehicles, smart phones, and other small devices, can support
    the process, but, generally, cannot provide the same levels of power. In addition,
    the issues of ownership and privacy become a concern if trying to deploy personal
    compute facilities for public use. Different approaches and algorithms have been
    developed to provide advanced analysis to detect abnormal behaviors in crowded
    areas [106]. These algorithms pertain to video analytics, cognitive dynamic systems,
    interaction modeling, crowd emotion sensing, and crowd-behavior modeling. These
    algorithms rely on high processing power to provide timely and accurate analysis
    of various situations. These algorithms can be implemented via fog and cloud services
    to collect and evaluate accumulated data to provide a clear and live status regarding
    a given condition, potential risks, and feasible solutions. Furthermore, these
    services can be beneficial in the case of an emergency situation within a crowd
    by providing real time information about the situation and allowing specialized
    algorithms to help make critical decisions for the city’s emergency response teams.
    An additional security application example that can be supported by iIFCs in smart
    cities is wide-range emergency response applications [107]. In disasters like
    earthquakes, floods, large-scale terrorist attacks, and volcanoes, fast observations
    and appropriate acts are required. In these situations, observation data will
    be communicated to disaster response centers from a large number of officials
    and private citizens continuously. Additional data will be collected and transmitted
    from UAVs, robots, sensors, and satellites and there will be data obtained from
    cars and smartphones movements. Altogether, the volume of collected data will
    be very large and advanced cloud services can be used to aid the emergency center
    in examining this communicated data to plan for most suitable utilizations of
    existing human resources like emergency teams, doctors, and police officers, as
    well as physical resources, such as emergency automobiles and hospitals to execute
    relief activities as rapidly and effectively as possible. 3.7. Smart Waste Management
    Applications Sewage and waste management is an important aspect of any city, smart
    or otherwise. As is the case with other important sectors in smart cities like
    the smart grid and smart water networks, smart mechanisms and automation can be
    applied to sewage and waste management to enhance operations and reliability and
    reduce costs. Sewage networks can be monitored and managed by IoT devices. These
    devices can provide continuous, detailed information about the status of the sewage
    networks and their operations. This information can be analyzed using specialized
    cloud and fog services for both interactive monitoring and future maintenance
    and upgrade operations. These services can be used to detect leaks or failures
    and initiate the appropriate actions needed to mitigate the negative impacts of
    these leaks and failures. In addition, fog and cloud services can be used to manage
    autonomous clearing and waste collection vehicles in smart cities. Using autonomous
    clearing and waste collection vehicles can provide cost-effective and high-quality
    solutions for smart cities. However, such service could be better managed and
    developed using cloud and fog services. For instance, a fog node with fog services
    can be installed onboard an autonomous clearing and waste collection vehicle to
    ensure coordination, safety, and communication with the cloud. Cloud platforms
    can be utilized to support better waste management and control. It can provide
    a dashboard to monitor waste collection, disposal, and recycling in a city. In
    addition, as waste management directly impacts lifestyle, healthcare, the environment,
    and the recycling and disposal industries, the cloud can offer services to help
    these industries get more real-time and accurate information about waste status
    to optimize their operations. Cloud computing can provide waste management as
    a service for the different entities involved [108]. Waste bins for different
    categories like organic material, paper, metal, and plastic can have sensors to
    measure the remaining space in the bins and trigger requests for collection before
    they get full. Fog nodes can be utilized to detect disposal violations in real-time
    and offer an interface for services to examine disposal behavior [109]. The collected
    information is transferred to the cloud continuously for further analysis and
    to optimize collection and processing plans [110]. For example, when the level
    of trash in a bin reaches a certain level, this information is efficiently transferred
    to a nearby fog node that in turn can use it locally and/or send it to a smart
    waste-management system on the cloud [111]. The almost-full bins can be grouped
    into location clusters based on proximity, and the shortest path for collection
    is calculated. Furthermore, waste-collection trucks of different sizes can be
    used to provide more optimized waste collection and transportation [112]. In dense
    cities, it is difficult to use large-size trucks during peak hours. However, other
    truck sizes can be used based on the traffic situation as well as the amount and
    type of waste in need of disposal. Further analysis of the information on the
    cloud will help identify trends and patterns about waste collection frequency,
    routes, amounts, and other characteristics. This information can offer more insight
    to improve city planning for collection schedules, disposal locations, fleet capabilities,
    etc. 3.8. Smart Environmental Monitoring Applications iIFCs can offer smart services
    for environmental monitoring, like air quality, river, coastal, and noise monitoring
    [113,114]. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) can be installed and organized to observe
    and communicate the present conditions of environment to deployed fog and cloud
    services for data collection and examination [115,116,117,118]. Advanced services,
    like alert services to actual values to predefined thresholds and communicate
    undesirable environmental situations, can be integrated in the cloud. Furthermore,
    there are many advantages of utilizing fog computing for environmental monitoring
    applications in smart cities. These advantages include decreasing communication
    traffic between the used WSN and the cloud, reducing energy spending of the IoT
    and WSN, and extending the life of these devices [115]. In addition, fog computing
    can improve the reliability and efficiency of environmental monitoring processes
    [116]. Fog computing can also support and/or localize several of the decision-making
    activities to improve response times and offer fast controls. An interesting application
    was developed to monitor air quality in Antwerp City, Belgium, and alert residents
    of ambient pollution using a fast notification system [119]. Fog computing was
    used for to enable fast service provisioning decisions. Using fog computing allows
    for a significant drop in communication bandwidth use as well as latency compared
    to cloud only solutions. UAVs can also be used as fast deployment tools to monitor
    specific areas in a city [18]. They can also be used as fog nodes to provide local
    services for more adaptive smart environmental monitoring. 4. iIFCs Utilization
    Issues Although iIFCs can provide several benefits for smart city applications,
    their effective utilization involves several issues such as heterogeneity, integration,
    reliability, effectiveness, etc., which need to be addressed. 4.1. Heterogeneity
    Different smart city applications use heterogeneous IoT devices. These devices
    can be stationary like surveillance cameras, sensors, and actuators; or mobile
    such as mobile robots, personal smart devices, wearable sensors, and UAVs. These
    have varying performance given the differences in processing, communication, and
    storage capabilities. Some IoT devices are also energy constrained, thus requiring
    the use of efficient or energy-aware communication and processing techniques.
    Additionally, fog nodes may be heterogeneous in terms of capabilities and services.
    These nodes may also be in different locations and have different communication
    capabilities. Therefore, the development and operations of systems that use heterogeneous
    IoT components and integrate them with such fog nodes for smart city applications
    are difficult. However, the utilization of abstraction and modular concepts can,
    however, assist in relaxing the difficulties of dealing with heterogeneity. Hiding
    technical details behind well-defined services and interfaces will create a more
    flexible and easier ways to integrate the components. Moreover, the careful design
    of interfaces across different IoT devices, their capabilities, and the software
    modules used will further enhance the situation. 4.2. Integration Effectiveness
    Achieving the effective integration of IoT devices, and fog and cloud computing
    nodes/services for use in smart city applications is another important concern.
    In this context different types of IoT devices, fog nodes, and cloud services
    are used, all of which have different types of interfaces and constraints in connectivity.
    This will also impede the collection and exchange of data across all elements.
    Integration will require additional services or adaptors to work correctly. Unfortunately,
    these additions will reduce the effectiveness of the integration and possibly
    the overall performance of the applications. Fog nodes can be used to provide
    local services to support IoT devices and connect with cloud services for smart
    city applications. Thus, creating and managing successful integration models that
    are also efficient becomes a complex process. A possible solution to the integration
    of IoT devices and fog nodes is using the Haystack standard [120]. This standard
    is an open-source initiative that provides standard semantic data models with
    the goal of simplifying the extraction of added value from the data generated
    by different IoT devices. These include IoT devices used in homes, buildings,
    and cities. In addition, the inclusion of fog nodes in these systems can help
    hide or mitigate some of the issues in performance due to the integration services.
    4.3. Reliability Many IoT-based smart city applications are considered critical
    and therefore must be available at all times and be able to deliver correct and
    reliable functions. Consequently, the iIFCs used for these applications must be
    reliable and fault-tolerant to avoid service interruptions or errors. In addition,
    the integration mechanisms and network infrastructure used to connect all the
    distributed components of the iIFCs must also be reliable. Reliability and fault-tolerance
    techniques and management services for cloud computing have been thoroughly investigated,
    and several solutions have been suggested [121,122,123,124,125,126]. These solutions
    rely on the availability of large-scale computing and storage resources to implement
    such capabilities. In addition, some solutions for enabling network reliability
    and fault-tolerance between IoT and fog nodes have been proposed [127,128]. Furthermore,
    some initial work in fault-tolerance for fog computing has been conducted [129,130,131,132].
    However, there are more issues to be addressed with regard to achieving fault-tolerant
    fog computing for large IoT-based environments such as smart cities [133]. These
    include issues related to effective resource management and fault-tolerance mechanisms
    for advanced and more complex fog computing architectures, such as multi-layer
    architectures. 4.4. Security and Privacy Moving from a model where we have all
    computation, data storage, and software services on one system, such as an on-premise
    server or a single cloud node, to another model that distributes these services
    among multiple edge, fog, and cloud platforms is extremely challenging. Add to
    the mix the vulnerabilities of IoT devices and networks in such systems and you
    will have extremely difficult security and privacy issues [134]. In particular,
    compliance and the ability to confirm the security and privacy of these systems
    are considered extremely important challenges. When distributing services on different
    platforms and increasing data transfers on the connecting networks, smart city
    information becomes more vulnerable to a wide range of security threats and attacks.
    To utilize iIFCs for smart city applications, it is important to include effective
    and efficient security and privacy mechanisms to protect the integration components
    and the services provided through them. We will further discuss security requirements
    in Section 7. 4.5. Scalability In iIFCs, cloud computing offers scalable and on-demand
    computing and data storage infrastructures for smart city applications. Furthermore,
    fog computing enables the establishment of large-scale and scalable IoT networks
    to support these applications [68,135,136,137]. A single-level (linear) or multi-level
    (hierarchical) fog architecture can be employed to provide scalable support for
    smart city applications. A linear architecture is relatively simple and can be
    adequately managed. However, a hierarchical architecture poses many issues like
    determining the optimal number of levels, the required services in each level,
    and the resource capacities of the fog nodes in each level. As a result, the architecture
    provides bigger opportunities for scalability, but at the same time complicates
    the support for smart city applications and may affect their performance or effectiveness.
    Careful selection of service types and resource capacities is needed for each
    level. Placing services in the wrong levels could generate unnecessary network
    traffic and system loads that negatively impact the overall performance of the
    application. Services must be strategically placed on the most suitable levels
    to reduce network traffic and system load, enable scalability, and efficiently
    satisfy all of the functional and nonfunctional requirements of smart city applications.
    In addition, the resource capacities of the fog nodes in each level should be
    chosen to support the needs of fog services and meet future scalability needs.
    4.6. Real-Time Support One of the major advantages of fog nodes is their closeness
    to the IoT components and ability to provide real-time support. Using fog nodes
    can provide localized system resources to support the real-time capabilities of
    IoT-based applications, in a smart city [2]. Fog nodes in a smart city can be
    close to different IoT devices where data is generated and where most actions
    are needed. However, fog nodes may have limited resources and with increasing
    load, they will not be able to provide the necessary real-time support, thus lowering
    the value of using them. One approach to address this is to enable active collaboration
    among multiple fog nodes. Collaboration between fog nodes in close proximity to
    each other will enable better utilization of their resources and an enhanced ability
    to achieve real-time performance. With fog node collaboration, better load balancing
    across these nodes is achieved and situations where some nodes become overloaded
    while there are other nodes with low loads can be eliminated [137,138]. However,
    adding features to enable fog nodes collaboration is also a complex task, as several
    issues must be addressed. These include allowing fog nodes to monitor each other’s
    loads, creating efficient replication and migration techniques, managing collective
    resources, and optimizing services and resources allocation to achieve load balancing
    which will satisfy the real-time requirements. 4.7. Mobility Some smart city applications,
    particularly vehicular applications, involve mobility. Therefore, incorporating
    fog nodes in these applications can help support mobility and keep mobile components
    connected. Fog nodes will be capable of maintaining mobile components connectivity
    with IoT devices, between IoT devices and fog or cloud nodes, among fog nodes,
    and/or between fog nodes and the cloud. There are different issues involved when
    supporting mobility, such as keeping mobile components like vehicles or drones
    continuously connected with some fog services. To successfully implement such
    solutions, it is important to have real-time connectivity monitoring and efficient
    handover mechanisms [139]. Mobile components may experience repeated communication
    interruptions that can substantially affect data processing and decision-making,
    leading to incorrect operations or loss of functionality. In addition, supporting
    mobility requires supporting service migration among fog nodes while maintaining
    some other requirements, like reliability and end-to-end delay [140]. Furthermore,
    it is important to utilize different advanced approaches, such as software-defined-networking
    [141] and mobility-aware application scheduling [142], to effectively support
    mobility. These issues will further complicate the necessary integration requirements
    and increase the overall complexity of developing these features for smart city
    applications with mobile components. 4.8. Communication It is impossible to use
    one type of communication technology to link all components within iIFCs. The
    communication links that connect fog nodes and the cloud are usually different
    from those between IoT devices and fog nodes and among IoT devices. IoT devices
    are usually limited in resources, while fog nodes and the cloud are less constrained.
    In addition, some applications involve communication among IoT devices with different
    capabilities, thus requiring different communication protocols and technologies
    better suited for their varying capabilities. Using heterogeneous communication
    technologies for iIFC applications imposes more constraints on the design and
    implementation of these applications. It is important that smart city applications
    are designed and developed with communication diversity in mind. In Section 6
    we will further discuss networking architectures and communication requirements
    for iIFCs. 4.9. Network Monitoring and Management iIFCs smart city applications
    require the deployment of large-scale heterogeneous networks capable of supporting
    the connectivity and effective operations of thousands to millions of IoT devices,
    hundreds of fog nodes, and multiple cloud systems. The networks must provide different
    functions for supporting and enabling the operations of such applications. These
    networks need monitoring and management to maintain effective and efficient communication.
    It is practically impossible to operate reliable, highly available, and efficient
    smart city applications without reliable, highly available, and efficient networks.
    It is important to include advanced tools for monitoring and controlling these
    large-scale networks. The scale of these networks dictates the use of advanced
    and efficient tools and dashboards to monitor, configure, and manage all of these
    components. These tools can monitor the integrity of all the components in the
    network and provide easier ways to reconfigure different components and identify
    any performance bottlenecks in the networks. 4.10. Development and Test Environments
    Developing smart city applications that run on iIFCs and ensuring that they meet
    several functional and nonfunctional requirements is challenging. There are some
    development environments designed to enable the development and operations of
    smart city applications on iIFCs. Examples are SmartCityWare [3] and FogFlow [4].
    These development environments provide a base upon which to build services for
    such applications. However, these environments are limited and do not provide
    comprehensive solutions for developing, operating, and testing smart city applications
    and services. There is still a need for more innovative development environments
    that can deal with both functional and non-functional requirements for iIFCs for
    smart city applications. Traditional distributed applications, even at a very
    large scale, are implemented and tested on a development infrastructure that resembles
    the production infrastructure, thus allowing for more accurate coding, testing,
    and eventually porting to the production infrastructure. A smart city application’s
    production infrastructure is really a very large portion of the city’s infrastructure
    and systems. It is extremely difficult to create a development infrastructure
    that can resemble a smart city. Therefore, it becomes difficult to build and test
    any application components and guarantee a close match to the operational infrastructure.
    Many development activities are done using simulation environments and testbeds
    (representing some relevant smart system components). Many of these were either
    initially designed for other purposes, such as ns2 [143], which was designed for
    network simulations, or have focused features like the City of Things testbed
    [144], which is mainly designed for performing large-scale wireless network and
    big data experiments. Therefore, successful porting of a developed application
    on simulation environments and testing on modeled testbeds does not guarantee
    easy and successful deployment on the production infrastructure. More work is
    needed to create development environments that closely resemble the real world,
    create testbeds that accurately simulate smart city components, and add more features
    to existing simulation platforms and testbeds. 4.11. Cost Effectiveness As several
    smart city services will be supported by iIFCs, these systems should be designed,
    implemented, and operated efficiently and economically. The development costs
    can be reduced by creating and using more iIFCs for several applications in multiple
    smart cities (economy of scale). Furthermore, using modularity and suitable software
    architectures will increase software reuse and reduce software development costs.
    With modular design, common functions and components can be created and extensively
    tested, then made available for reuse in various applications that need them.
    For example, common modules to support communication handover, simple data aggregation,
    and basic security capabilities are needed by a large number of smart city applications.
    Every application development project reusing these modules will cut development
    costs in proportion to the size and number of reused modules. In addition, using
    advanced autonomous operational tools and controls for managing iIFCs can reduce
    the need for manual monitoring, controls, and human involvement, thus the operations
    costs can be substantially reduced. Moreover, reducing human involvement in controlling
    such systems will also reduce the possibility of human error, which can increase
    the cost of operating and maintaining these systems. Another way is to add smartness
    using artificial intelligence (AI), data analytics, and ML to allow functions
    to adapt to changes in the environment and intelligently manage the system. For
    example, using collective intelligence can offer more cost-effectiveness for iIFCs
    [145]. 5. Optimization with iIFCs Many real-world problems in smart cities are
    considered optimization problems. Examples include finding the optimal traffic-light
    configuration or creating optimal process schedules to improve some predefined
    performance metrics. Therefore, the use of optimization methods can provide advantageous
    features to applications for smart cities. Optimization methods can benefit significantly
    from the availability of iIFCs, which enables the collection and analysis of relevant
    data. The final outcome of these optimization methods can be decision support
    or even fully automated actions. As thousands (possibly millions) of IoT devices
    collect smart city data, fog nodes can become the organization and filtering point
    before shipping data to the cloud. Integrated fog nodes can also do some of the
    local processing and monitoring using the collected data from the IoT devices
    directly connected to them. They can in real-time make the necessary decisions
    and take the appropriate actions. All data eventually will reach the cloud for
    more in-depth analysis and optimizations on a larger scale. The challenge for
    the use of such optimization methods is defining performance measures and objectives
    using formal specification, analysis, and measurement models. Typically, smart
    city problems are multidimensional, yielding multi-objective optimization problems.
    This implies that different performance measures target different areas, and all
    of them need to be quantified and weighted with respect to their importance. With
    the support of iIFCs that can accurately provide the necessary data and measurements,
    the use of optimization methods will result in more efficient operations and better
    utilization of smart city resources. Using iIFCs for smart city applications requires
    the efficient use of its capabilities and features to provide the most effective
    optimizations. Optimizations could involve different tasks, including situation
    learning, situation modeling, simulation, and application tuning. Cloud computing
    is traditionally used to perform these processes; however, these tasks can be
    better optimized using the capabilities of other components of the iIFCs. Some
    applications may require fast, context-sensitive or location-sensitive processing
    to optimize certain tasks. For example, the aforementioned air monitor application
    in Antwerp City, Belgium, utilizes the iIFCs infrastructure to perform different
    optimizations to satisfy the requirements of detecting pollutants in the air and
    alerting the city residents in near real time [119]. In this example, the authors
    used fully integrated and autonomous fog computing controls with distributed data
    analysis and decision making in conjunction with optimized routing protocols to
    support this application. This approach is suitable since pollutants detection
    is generally a localized activity. One area could make use of knowledge of other
    areas, but that can be handled by cloud-based optimization techniques over the
    long run. However, the initial actions and alerts can be done locally and faster
    through the fog nodes. This improved the process and eliminated a high volume
    of data transfer to the cloud and allowed for better use of cloud resources for
    long-term optimizations. Different intelligent algorithms and ML techniques can
    be used to support optimizations for iIFCs based on the smart city applications.
    Alli and Alam [146] developed a ML-based approach to secure computation offloading
    schemes in iIFCs for smart city applications. This approach supports employing
    the fog nodes for processing large amounts of data generated by many IoT devices,
    accelerates processing of large tasks, and conserves energy in the IoT devices.
    The authors used the Neuro-Fuzzy model and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) via
    the smart gateway to select an optimal fog node for computation offloading. If
    the fog node does not have enough resources for the workload, it sends it to the
    cloud. Tajalli et al. [53] developed a distributed multi-agent-based model structured
    on a three-layer fog computing structure for the optimal economic dispatch of
    microgrids. This model actively monitors load changes and the availability of
    renewable energy to determine the need for dispatching microgrids to supplement
    the energy efficiently. A fast consensus-based algorithm updated by a fuzzy adaptive
    leader technique that utilizes the three layers of fog computing is used. Some
    current ML methods can be customized to fit better within the iIFCs environment.
    For example, Ghosh and Grolinger [147] developed a technique which utilizes both
    fog computing and the cloud to perform more optimized deep ML, instead of using
    only the cloud. Here, they placed the encoder part of the trained autoencoder
    on the edge while the cloud had the decoder part. This technique was evaluated
    using human activity recognition, which is one of the important methods used to
    enable smart security and public safety applications in smart cities. The authors
    found that data can be cut down on the edge up to 80% while maintaining the same
    level of accuracy. Another example is Edgelens [148], which is a deep ML-based
    object detection technique in iIFCs. The main advantage of EdgeLens is its ability
    to adapt to different service requirements, such as those related to the accuracy
    and latency of object detection processes. Efficient optimization is also needed
    for effective service placement in the fog environment to support smart city applications
    that run on iIFCs. To achieve good support for these applications, it is important
    to manage and optimize service placement methods [149]. Canali and Lancellotti
    [150] proposed a heuristic solution based on genetic algorithms for placing smart
    city services on fog nodes. Both the communication delay and the processing time
    on the fog nodes are considered in this optimization. Choi and Ahn [151] proposed
    another service placement approach based on the logical fog network and the pre-obtained
    service demand as defined by previous usage. This approach considers the nature
    of such large-scale smart city applications and the need for a scalable service
    placement approach. The authors found that service placement based on pre-obtained
    demand can improve the utilization of the resources available to fog nodes; however,
    a service migration capability is needed for this approach. Zhu et al. [152] proposed
    an optimization technique for service allocations on vehicular fog computing.
    In this model, a trade-off is preserved between the service delay and quality
    level. Generally, a simulation approach can be used to understand different performance
    metrics to support iIFCs smart city applications optimizations. Byrne et al. [153]
    developed RECAP, a simulation for cloud/edge/fog computing scenarios. This simulator
    enables the evaluation and analysis of the effects on resources, workloads, and
    quality of service (QoS) metrics in different cloud and fog computing scenarios.
    It also helps understand and weigh the trade-offs for energy efficiency and cost
    in such environments. Data collection is at the core of the emergence of smart
    services, since efforts to optimize services, learn patterns, and predict trends
    that are mainly based on how systems behave and behaved historically. The ease
    of collection and availability of data is the key to enabling and enhancing most
    of these smart city applications. Optimization techniques, in particular, require
    extensive knowledge of past processes and their performance. In addition, they
    require detailed information on the resources, capabilities, availability, and
    overall conditions of the running systems. The data must also be accessible to
    various processes at different levels, whether in IoT locations, on the edge,
    or in the cloud. The iIFCs provide a suitable architecture to support data collection
    and analysis at all levels. The inherent characteristic of IoT devices is that
    they collect data. Fog nodes can, to some extent, store, and process that data,
    while the cloud offers flexible and large-scale resources for storage and processing,
    making it possible to use high-performance methods for optimization. Collectively,
    and with the correct allocation of necessary tasks, the iIFC is an ideal infrastructure
    for the optimization processes of smart city applications. 6. Smart City Networking
    Architectures and Communication Requirements This section investigates networking
    and communication requirements for iIFC smart city applications. It also discusses
    some protocols that can be used to enable communication among the systems and
    components employed to assist such applications. Various wireless communication
    protocols can be utilized to create connectivity between the various IoT devices
    and the local fog platforms. Such protocols include short-, medium-, and long-range
    protocols, which may be chosen depending on the application involved. In some
    cases, where power usage must remain very low due to the energy limitations of
    smaller IoT devices, a multi-hop approach can be used to achieve connectivity
    among IoT components. Then, data messages can be collected by cluster heads within
    each IoT cluster, which can also play the role of gateway nodes. If multiple clusters
    exist in a certain small area (e.g., several floors in a building, where each
    floor constitutes a cluster), then the cluster heads relay their collected information
    to a sink node, which then forwards the data further up the hierarchy to the fog
    nodes and the cloud. Figure 6 presents an illustration of this architecture. Figure
    6. Illustration of multi-hop networks connected to fog nodes through gateway and
    sink nodes. On the other hand, connectivity between the fog and cloud computing
    platforms can be established using appropriate protocols and networking technologies
    with higher data rates to support inter-domain IP traffic. Generally, broadband
    links, fiber optic networks, and dedicated links over the internet are used to
    connect fog nodes with the cloud infrastructure. The decision on the types of
    connections depend heavily on how much communication is expected between the fog
    nodes and the cloud. For example, continuous video streams sent from fog nodes
    connected to surveillance cameras will require high bandwidth and it may be necessary
    to use dedicated links; however, applications sending small amounts of data to
    the cloud will be able to work well over a regular Internet connection. In addition,
    different layers of fog nodes can exist between the IoT and cloud layers. Connectivity
    between these layers can be wired or wireless. Fog nodes can also consist of different
    types of networking devices including routers, switches, and wireless access points
    [43]. Wireless protocols can be employed for fog-to-fog and fog-to-cloud connectivity
    depending on the existing networking infrastructure. Typically, cloud-to-fog connectivity
    is established by internet service providers using optical links to ensure high
    bandwidth. Fog-to-fog connections can be established using networking technologies,
    which include fiber optics, point-to-point microwave links, free space optics,
    IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) [154], cellular and wireless LAN protocols such as IEEE 802.11
    (WiFi), to name a few. Moreover, cellular technologies, such as 3G, 4G, and 5G,
    can be good candidates to ensure fast, reliable, long-range connections and might
    be the only available technologies in some areas. In the following discussion,
    we focus on the link between the IoT smart city devices and fog platforms. Applications
    with short-range communication, such as smart buildings and smart water networks,
    can utilize protocols from the personal area network (PAN) classes, such as IEEE
    802.15.4 (Zigbee) and 801.15.1 (Bluetooth) [154,155]. These protocols are usually
    distinguished by lower bandwidth, low energy consumption, and short-range communication.
    Applications and services demanding longer ranges, like intelligent transportation
    and manufacturing and control, can use protocols in the local area network (LAN)
    class, such as IEEE 802.11 [156]. Applications involving wide-range communication,
    such as UAVs and smart grids, can use wide area network (WAN) protocols, such
    as IEEE 802.16 [157], cellular, and satellite communication. All of these protocols
    can support asynchronous and synchronous data connections. Asynchronous data connections
    can be used for smart city applications with best-effort traffic, which can tolerate
    delay. These applications include structure monitoring and data-gathering services.
    Such services can be a part of smart city applications such as smart structural
    health management, smart water networks, smart sewage and waste management, smart
    environmental monitoring, and smart energy. Synchronous data connections can be
    used for smart city applications with data traffic requiring more stringent QoS
    requirements, such as bandwidth and delay [158] such as real-time and multimedia
    communications. Services that generate such traffic can be a part of smart city
    applications, such as smart transportation, smart public safety and security,
    and smart healthcare and wellness. These applications may be using cameras to
    monitor and transfer captured videos of different situations to determine the
    appropriate actions, which must be done in real-time. Additionally, these networking
    protocols provide security and reliability functions. Though, majority of these
    security functions need extra processing and can create additional delay and consume
    a significant energy amount. Consequently, these considerations should be considered
    before enabling these features. Some smart city applications require low bandwidth
    needs, such as environmental monitoring, while other applications need high bandwidth,
    such as interactive vision-based UAV applications. Nevertheless, even for an individual
    application, different functions need different bandwidth levels. This is based
    on the type of data being collected and exchanged with other systems. For instance,
    some basic UAV-base sensing applications will only need a low bandwidth, while
    UAV-based applications performing scans, recording videos, and directly communicating
    that data to a ground control center will need higher bandwidth. Additionally,
    some smart city applications require very low end-to-end communication delays.
    Examples of such smart city applications are smart transportation and smart grids.
    Delays are not tolerated, since the control information being communicated needs
    to reach its destination within a few micro- or milli-seconds to support reliable
    control systems and quick response times so as to avoid the possibility of physical
    damages or collisions. In contrast, other applications have a higher tolerance
    for communication delay, such as UAV applications that collect sensor data for
    future analysis. Energy efficiency is also a critical necessity for smart city
    applications, though various applications that have in-house power sources, like
    smart grid systems, can work with high energy consumption protocols [158]. Other
    smart city applications have very limited energy sources and require protocols
    that consume less power. Some examples include UAV-based smart city applications
    and applications for remote pipeline monitoring [159]. It is also imperative to
    consider that some applications such UAV-based smart city applications and remote
    pipeline monitoring use wireless communication [160]. Others, such as smart grids
    and smart buildings, use both wired and wireless communication networks. In addition,
    some applications need mobility support while others do not. These are important
    requirements that need to be considered in connecting with other systems such
    as fog and cloud computing. There are some research efforts to provide solutions
    for networking and communications issues for iIFCs. In a study by Naranjo et al.
    [161], the authors developed a fog-based network architecture named FOCAN to support
    the Internet of Everything based smart city applications. With this network architecture,
    different network resources are utilized to jointly compute, route, and communicate
    to reduce latency and minimize energy consumption. This includes intra-fog communication
    and wired/wireless communication through thing-aware TCP/IP links. Another example
    is provided by Peng et al. [162], who propose a reconfigurable architecture named
    iCloudFog to enable agile integration of fog and cloud networks. This architecture
    is designed to fit the needs for provisioning different IoT devices and Fog nodes.
    Fog nodes, including wireless, wired, or hybrid fog nodes, can be integrated in
    this architecture. Furthermore, Desikan et al. [163] proposed a solution of topology
    control methods for making and handling a large-scale smart city IoT network.
    This solution consists of two phases: Construction Phase and Maintenance Phase.
    During the Construction Phase, a cost-effective IoT network including fog nodes
    are built while during the Maintenance Phase, the resource utilization in the
    network is optimized. Maswood et al. [164] developed an optimization for minimizing
    the bandwidth cost in an integrated three-layer cloud-fog system. 7. Smart City
    Security Requirements Like any other application, applications based on iIFCs
    will face security threats. These threats may be natural threats or human threats.
    Natural threats can be floods, fire, power outages, or earthquakes. These disasters
    have direct safety implications; however, they also lead to various security threats
    by exposing systems and data sources. Human threats can be external intruders,
    who may spy on the city’s iIFCs network traffic, interfere with operations, or
    directly attack systems and try to steal valuable information or compromise assets
    and/or people in the smart city. There are also internal intruders who spy on
    their organizations, find ways to profit from their positions inside these organizations,
    or cause other damages. Internal threats also come unintentionally when users
    and operators do not follow security procedures or create unintentional problems
    in the systems. Therefore, there is a strong need for different types of security
    measures and controls to protect iIFCs smart city applications. These security
    controls are divided into three types: administrative controls, technical controls,
    and physical controls. All these security controls are important to protect smart
    city applications. Administrative controls are more managerial controls that include
    defining security policies, security standards, privacy requirements, guidelines,
    awareness, procedures, and documentation for smart city systems and applications.
    In addition, the enforcement of these defined security policies and other controls
    is another important aspect of administrative controls. Technical controls are
    used to implement and support the defined administrative controls for iIFCs smart
    city applications. These include authentication mechanisms; encryption for communication,
    storage, and computations; and access control procedures. In iIFCs, it is important
    to provide end-to-end security for both the environment and the smart city applications
    in use. While there are good security controls that have been developed for cloud
    computing [165], there are still some issues for fog security controls [166] and
    IoT security controls [167]. This is important not only in protecting these individual
    systems but the whole iIFCs as well [42]. Security measures must account for the
    different platforms and networking infrastructures in use in addition to being
    able to adapt and evolve to provide flexible protections for the services used
    and the changes in the environment where the application is operational. One recently
    developed security model that can be used effectively for security in smart city
    applications is blockchain [168,169,170,171]. The main advantage of blockchain
    is that it enables a group of entities to reach an agreement on a certain activity
    and register that agreement without the need for a third party. Their agreed upon
    activities are registered, secured, and shared among all parties using blockchain.
    Blockchain incorporates techniques from peer-to-peer networks and cryptography
    to support a distributed shared ledger among a group of entities or users (organizations,
    firms, individuals, robotics, autonomous cars, smart devices, software agents,
    etc.) such that all involved agree on its content and all transactions are secure
    and cannot be altered after being appended to the chain. Furthermore, the nature
    of blockchain provides traceable audit trails, measurable components, and access
    to detailed information regarding transactions recorded in the chain; thus, it
    permits for detailed validations, tracking, and measurements. These features can
    be used effectively among different IoT, fog, and cloud systems that belong to
    different organizations in a smart city to establish a good level of trust among
    them and maintain detailed records of transactions exchanged between them. The
    last security control type is physical controls, which addresses threats affecting
    the physical components of iIFCs. Some components of these systems like the cloud
    infrastructure can be easily protected as cloud service providers usually invest
    heavily in their datacenters and ensure physical safety. Other components such
    as IoT devices and some fog nodes can be installed in remote locations or in areas
    prone to natural or human risks. These would usually operate unattended and cannot
    be protected easily. Therefore, it is important to design systems that can tolerate
    physical attacks on smart city components and are capable of isolating such components
    when attacked to minimize exposure. In addition, when possible, specific components
    and fog nodes need to be equipped with specially designed security and alert services
    targeted to the specific threats to these components. Some initial research efforts
    to provide security solutions for iIFCs include the work of Mukherjee et al. [172],
    which proposed security middleware for end-to-end communication for iIFCs. In
    another study, Thota et al. [173] proposed a fog-based security platform for IoT
    and cloud computing for healthcare applications. The authors provide mechanisms
    in their platform for the authentication and authorization of the connected devices.
    Amin et al. [174] proposed a secure communication protocol for fog-cloud environments.
    Passwords are used to enable the security mechanism in this protocol. Mohamed
    et al. [175] proposed using data-driven security to protect smart city systems
    such as iIFCs. Guan et al. [176] developed an anonymous and privacy-preserving
    data aggregation technique for IoT-fog environments. This technique uses authentication
    and supports multi-authority to control smart devices and fog nodes. Hu et al.
    [177] proposed a framework for securing and preserving the privacy of residents
    in IoT-based face identification applications utilizing fog computing. 8. Discussion
    Applications of iIFCs for smart cities offer various ways to deal with all aspects
    of city life like smart energy systems, smart water networks, smart waste management
    systems, smart transportation systems, and intelligent safety and protection applications
    for their inhabitants and infrastructures. Table 1 includes these applications
    and reviews by what means IoT, fog, and cloud computing can provision them. There
    are several requirements necessary for the effective utilization of iIFCs to create
    optimized smart city applications and services. Both iIFCs and the optimization
    methods employed for diverse applications need to be developed to deal with the
    various challenges involved. The ability to seamlessly integrate and use many
    components and devices like sensors, actuators, smart wearable devices, and robotics
    along with all the software services needed is one challenge. The applications
    are further complicated by the need to interact with humans and other systems.
    Furthermore, the need to use advanced software and algorithms for analysis, optimization,
    decision-making, and to achieve autonomy presents another challenge. As a result,
    iIFCs must be flexible, scalable, and secure to support the growing and demanding
    needs of smart city applications. In addition, these systems must be able to handle
    heterogenous components, mobile devices, and unpredictable operational conditions.
    Table 1. Smart City Applications that can benefit from an iIFCs platform. Big
    data has also become an integral part of smart cities, given the amounts of data
    being observed, generated, and stored. The iIFCs need to provide the capabilities
    to handle and use big data at various levels. Real-time capabilities are also
    a must, since many smart city applications require instantaneous decisions and
    actions for various applications. For example, a smart grid needs to be able to
    quickly change supply levels to certain areas or immediately cut off power due
    to a failure. iIFCs designed with these requirements in mind will lead to the
    creation of usable and flexible platforms that will ease development efforts and
    increase flexibility to operate these applications effectively and efficiently.
    A major part of the services in many smart city applications need to incorporate
    accessible and efficient optimization features and services. These services require
    access to huge resources for storage and computation, which means they usually
    reside in the cloud. The iIFCs will allow for these cloud services to be directly
    linked to the applications and effectively utilize the fog for caching, real-time
    support, and data organization and aggregation services. This arrangement will
    provide the flexibility necessary to support the different levels of optimization
    as well. Based on the types of the services and the problems targeted, different
    types of optimization approaches are needed, depending on the level of efficiency
    reached, time available, and accuracy required. The amount of data that needs
    to be processed to achieve optimization plays a large role in the resources needed
    for optimization. Knowing this, smart city optimization needs will require to
    be distinguished by three factors: efficiency, optimality, and data. Nevertheless,
    the influence on these factors will alter according to the characteristics and
    constraints of the services required. To illustrate, in a smart city transportation
    application the optimization process will place a greater emphasis on efficiency
    at the price of optimality. The need to have fast solutions that work is more
    important than having the perfect, most optimized, solution. However, for planning
    projects, like highway extension projects, where time is not a concern, the emphasis
    changes to optimality, basically because it is not required in real-time. This
    is logical since decisions pertaining to infrastructure plans, changes, and expansions
    must be as accurate as possible. In both instances though, the volume of data
    required to achieve a resolution could simply change the emphasis further. For
    instance, for traffic control, if the focused zone is very large and busy, then
    additional data will need to be processed; nevertheless, we still require results
    quickly. Thus, we change the emphasis further to efficiency. Conversely, with
    highway planning, no matter how much data is obtainable, we generally have adequate
    time and resources to deal with all the data and accomplish the highest optimization
    (accuracy) levels. Managing these factors and changing requirements can be done
    efficiently when the applications using them can easily and seamlessly access
    all the necessary resources with the support of the iIFCs. Despite all the promising
    capabilities an iIFC can offer for smart city applications, there are still various
    open issues that must be addressed to enable the effective utilization and optimization
    of smart city applications. This incorporates constructing efficient, effective,
    dependable, and secure iIFCs architectures that address the issues of smart city
    applications and support their varying requirements. We need more studies and
    in-depth investigations of these integration opportunities and issues, involving
    identifying effective integration approaches and creating some level of uniformity
    or standardization on how these integrations can be designed and used. In addition,
    security issues are of extreme importance and, while current models and techniques
    can help, more advanced techniques and suitable approaches to large-scale and
    distributed security measures are needed. There are several promising works to
    secure iIFCs [178,179,180] for different applications. In addition, there is other
    emerging effort to develop some security approaches for IoT and fog applications
    in smart cities [175,181,182,183]. Nevertheless, there is still the requirement
    to further improve and upgrade these security and privacy approaches and include
    them in development platforms. There is also a need to develop administrative
    security controls and figure out how to tolerate physical attacks in such systems.
    Another critical concern is that a substantial area of the smart city applications
    can be viewed as decision making problems, or as multi-objective optimization
    problems. Consequently, we should utilize adaptive and intelligent decision support
    systems in place to facilitate suitable solutions according to the attributes
    of the problem, the architecture, and the resources accessible to the iIFCs. This
    concern will come to be even more critical and noticeable with growing data collection
    and the rising number of issues that will require to be solved. This includes
    having decision support preprocessing stages that will enhance the value of the
    smart city applications. Furthermore, decision-making and optimization methods
    require accurately specified objectives to direct them. Decision support services
    incorporated in the iIFCs will facilitate these functionalities in different smart
    city applications. The recognition and adoption of integrated technologies in
    a framework like iIFC is starting to show in actual smart city projects around
    the world. Some smart cities started to recognize the importance of using fog
    computing to support IoT based smart city applications and to enable the integration
    with the cloud. Denver as a city investing in IoT solutions to build smart city
    applications noticed the importance of using fog computing for their applications
    [184]. The vice president of innovation for Denver South, Jake Rishavy mentioned
    that “We see fog computing as a critical tool for enabling the advanced digital
    applications that will enrich the experiences for area businesses, citizens and
    visitors as we head into the future.” Another city that focuses on utilizing fog
    computing to realize its smart city applications is Barcelona [185]. They focus
    on fog computing initiatives for some aspects and applications such as power management,
    access control, event-based video, traffic management, and connectivity on demand
    [101]. While there are some initiatives to utilize fog computing for smart cities,
    there are still some issues need to be further investigated especially those related
    to trust, authentication, privacy, energy efficiency, and optimal locations of
    fog nodes in a smart city. All these issues are important due to the potential
    of using thousands of fog nodes in a smart city to support its smart applications.
    9. Conclusions iIFCs offer the opportunity to create suitable platforms to develop
    and operate important smart city applications. These applications can utilize
    services provided by IoT devices, fog nodes, and cloud services. This paper provided
    a review of smart city applications and how the integration of IoT, fog, and cloud
    technologies can better support these applications. This paper also discussed
    the technical challenges and reviewed current work to develop solutions to relax
    these challenges. Integrating services using these systems offers several opportunities
    to optimize service values and improve efficiency and controllability of smart
    city applications. Each technology will cover different and specific needs for
    these applications. For example, an application will be able to integrate sensing
    and actuating activities powered by real-time decision support services from fog
    nodes, while uploading and storing all data to the cloud for further analysis,
    long-term planning, and decision-making. While there are some research efforts
    and solutions to address the challenges of utilizing iIFCs for smart city applications,
    there are several issues that need to be resolved to achieve effective integration
    and good results. These issues are related to the iIFCs’ architectural design,
    security, privacy, and appropriate optimization methods customized with the attributes
    of both the smart city and the iIFCs in use. As we discussed earlier, some cities
    started to utilize fog computing to add efficiency, scalability, and more smart
    features for their smart city applications. However, there is more to be done
    in this area. One of the main issues with the iIFC paradigm is how to make this
    distributed system work as a single system and how to utilize it and manage it
    as one system. There is a lot more to be done to realize the full capabilities
    of such paradigm. The application domain is wide, as is the possibility for many
    benefits in optimizing smart city resources and increasing the quality of life
    for smart city residents once the challenges are resolved and the key issues hampering
    such utilization are solved. Identifying the challenges and outlining what is
    being done currently to address them is a first step for further in-depth research
    and development efforts for more ways to support the integration and develop highly
    effective smart city applications. Author Contributions The paper’s main idea

  description: In recent years, Smart Farming (SF) and Precision Agriculture (PA)
    have attracted attention from both the agriculture industry as well as the research
    community. Altogether, SF and PA aim to help farmers use inputs (such as fertilizers
    and pesticides) more efficiently through using Internet of Things (IoT) devices,
    but in doing so, they create new security threats that can defeat this purpose
    in the absence of adequate awareness and proper countermeasures. A survey on different
    security-related challenges is required to raise awareness and pave they way for
    further research in this area. In this paper, we first itemize the security aspects
    of SF and PA. Next, we review the types of cyber attacks that can violate each
    of these aspects. Accordingly, we present a taxonomy on cyber-threats to SF and
    PA on the basis of their relations to different stages of Cyber-Kill Chain (CKC).
    Among cyber-threats, we choose Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) for further
    study. Finally, we studied related risk mitigation strategies and countermeasure,
    and developed a future road map for further study in this area. This paper’s main
    contribution is a categorization of security threats within the SF/PA areas and
    provide a taxonomy of security threats for SF environments so that we may detect
    the behavior of APT attacks and any other security threat in SF and PA environments.

    Abstract In recent years, Smart Farming (SF) and Precision Agriculture (PA) have
    attracted attention from both the agriculture industry as well as the research
    community. Altogether, SF and PA aim to help farmers use inputs (such as fertilizers
    and pesticides) more efficiently through using Internet of Things (IoT) devices,
    but in doing so, they create new security threats that can defeat this purpose
    in the absence of adequate awareness and proper countermeasures. A survey on different
    security-related challenges is required to raise awareness and pave they way for
    further research in this area. In this paper, we first itemize the security aspects
    of SF and PA. Next, we review the types of cyber attacks that can violate each
    of these aspects. Accordingly, we present a taxonomy on cyber-threats to SF and
    PA on the basis of their relations to different stages of Cyber-Kill Chain (CKC).
    Among cyber-threats, we choose Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) for further
    study. Finally, we studied related risk mitigation strategies and countermeasure,
    and developed a future road map for further study in this area. This paper’s main
    contribution is a categorization of security threats within the SF/PA areas and
    provide a taxonomy of security threats for SF environments so that we may detect
    the behavior of APT attacks and any other security threat in SF and PA environments.
    Keywords: smart farming; precision agriculture; cyber-threats; advanced persistent
    threats; cyber-kill chain; security threats 1. Introduction Population growth,
    climate change, and rising affluence leading to more resource-intensive diets
    all mean that today, global food security is seen as a major challenge. According
    to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), global food production
    needs to be increased by 70% in order to feeding 10 billion people by 2050 [1,2].
    Keeping pace with this growing demand for food while also working towards sustainable
    development requires new approaches to agriculture [2,3]. To this end, different
    cutting edge technologies that use IoT are supporting food industries [4] and
    industrial agriculture [5]. However, the development in these industries and their
    applications brings about a broad range of security challenges [6,7,8]. Moreover,
    the increased population will cause constraints in terms of land and water that
    will encourage adoption of farming techniques designed to improve agriculture
    resource utilization and crop yield. Applying IoT technology is a viable solution
    towards increased efficiency to tackle the challenges facing modern agriculture.
    As a result, we are observing the emergence of Smart Farming (SF) and Precision
    Agriculture (PA). Recent literature comes with numerous research works focusing
    on SF [9,10,11] and PA [12,13]. In general, both PA and SF refer to the use of
    modern technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), drones, robotics and Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) in the control and management of farms in order to improve productivity
    and yield, while reducing input, land, and labor requirements. A typical multi-layer
    SF architecture is shown in Figure 1. This architecture has been used as the reference
    architecture in several research projects [14,15,16,17]. In the architecture of
    Figure 1, the “Cloud”, “Network Communication”, “Edge” and “Physical” layers connect
    various smart IoT devices such as sensors and actuators as well as heterogeneous
    Cyber-Physical System (CPSs) to each other and to the internet [18,19]. A SF platform
    with the architecture of Figure 1 collects data from IoT devices, and then forms,
    processes, and controls data to provide various applications as well as various
    access levels to the users [20,21]. Figure 1. A typical SF architecture. PA is
    distinct from SF in that it specifically refers to IoT-based approaches aiming
    at improving the efficiency of input use through providing farmers with tools
    that increase the granularity of decision making. In other words, PA is so sensitive
    and accurate that the minimum adversaries’ activities simply can change the control
    system, target and damage valuable resources. Indeed, the PA is highly related
    to data and information of the system that can lead to costly, disruptive decisions
    and actions from the farmers via invalid data during run time. For instance, in
    terms of crops, PA allows farmers the ability to move from managing fields to
    tailoring management to square meters or even individual plants within fields.
    For livestock farmers, PA means using IoT to shift from flock/herd scale management
    to being able to manage the needs of individual animals. A wide range of enabling
    technologies such as fog computing [22], AI [23], Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
    [24,25] and sensor networks [26] have been used to support both PA and SF. Especially,
    IoT can be considered as one of the most important technologies for SF [27,28,29]
    and PA [30] due to its capabilities of remote sensing and operation without human
    interference. However, these IoT-based technologies create new cyber-security
    vulnerabilities and cyber-threats [1,3], which can be exploited to gain control
    on on-field actuators, sensors, and autonomous vehicles such as tractors, drones,
    sprayers, and planters, Refs. [1,3,31] as well as related databases and applications.
    A cyber-attack could have severe consequences on a farm. For instance, unauthorized
    changes to data could deceive a farmer to make changes that negatively influence
    the health of a herd. Poultry production relies on sensors to control temperature
    and air quality within barns. In this case, a cyber-attack could cause the mortality
    of thousands of birds. Similar sensitivities are in greenhouse growing conditions
    where a breach in cyber-security could result in a devastating amount of profit
    for the farming operation [2]. Security is a highly-challenging aspect of SF [2,32,33]
    and PA [34,35,36] due to different properties of IoT devices including heterogeneity,
    mobility, and resource limitations. This exposes SF and PA to a broad range of
    cyber-threats. Although the literature comes with several research reports focusing
    on security-related issues in SF and PA, to the best of our knowledge, there is
    no systematic review on these issues. A survey in this area, along with a future
    road map, can improve public awareness and pave the way for further research.
    In this paper, we first discuss security aspects of SF and PA. Next, we review
    state-of-the-art attacks on SF and PA, and study the security aspect(s) violated
    by each of them. In reviewing literature for examples of specific attacks on SF
    and PA, we identify the general security violations of each. In many cases, these
    attacks are on IoT technologies that support SF and PA functions thus countermeasures
    suggested here focus on these identified threats, rather than on novel SF/PA specific
    mitigation techniques. According to our studies on security aspects and attacks,
    we present a taxonomy on cyber-attacks to SF and PA. Our taxonomy is based on
    the relation between attacks and the stages of Cyber-Kill Chain, which is a methodology
    for analyzing the chronology of complex cyber-attacks. As a chosen class of threats
    for further study, we discuss the anatomy as well as the behavioral characteristics
    of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). Furthermore, we review risk mitigation
    strategies and countermeasures against cyber-threats to SF and PA. On the basis
    of the above discussions, we suggest some topics for future research on security
    of SF and PA. The main contributions of this paper can be explained as follows.
    We itemize the security aspects of SF and PA and establish a map between attacks
    and security aspects. We use CKC [37] for the first time to present a systematic
    taxonomy on cyber-threats to SF and PA. We study the anatomy as well as the behavioral
    characteristics of APT. Finally, we develop a future road map to highlight some
    related emerging areas that still need to be studied in future research. The rest
    of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a review on existing
    reviews to highlight our motivations for the work of this paper. We examine cyber-attacks
    on SF and PA in Section 3. CKC-Based taxonomy on security threats to SF and PA
    are presented in Section 4. Moreover, APTs are specifically studied in more detail
    in Section 5. We study threat mitigation strategies and countermeasures in Section
    6. Section 7 presents the future road map and; Section 8 concludes the paper.
    2. Existing Reviews Many researchers have conducted reviews on different aspects
    of PA. Some of these surveys focus on the applications of AI-based techniques
    in PA [38,39,40], the design of sensors [41] and sensor networks [42,43,44,45,46]
    to support PA, the application of educational hardware such as Raspberry Pi [47]
    and technical aspects such as imaging techniques [48] and routing protocols [49,50].
    More specifically, few researchers have reviewed the literature on threats to
    PA. For example, Boghossian et al. [51] have presented a review on vulnerabilities
    of PA as well as the related threats along with some limited threat mitigation
    strategies. Another review on cyber-security threats to PA has been reported by
    Window [34]. However, none of the aforementioned reviews on threats to SF come
    with a taxonomy or a future road map for further research in this area. On the
    other hand, surveys on SF and related technologies have been of interest to several
    researchers in recent years [52,53]. Especially, the roles of IoT [54,55,56] and
    AI [57] in SF has received great attention. Moreover, security-related aspects
    of SF have appeared as part of the subject in some surveys. As an example, one
    may refer to the research reported by Gupta et al. [2], wherein some challenges
    related to the security and privacy of SF have been studied, without presenting
    a taxonomy of threats. As another example, a review published by Barreto et al.
    [58] takes an empirical approach towards the identification of cyber-security
    challenges of SF. However, the most relevant works to the scope of this paper
    are those focusing on threats to SF. Among these works, we can mention the one
    reported by Demestichas et al. [3], which fails to develop a taxonomy or a future
    roadmap. Table 1 presents the characteristics of the existing surveys in the scope
    of SF and PA. Table 1. Characteristics of the existing reviews in SF and PA. 3.
    Cyber-Attacks on SF and PA As suggested by recent research works, the main security
    aspects of SF and PA can be outlined as follows. Privacy is required to keep a
    user from unauthorized access to to other users’ information. Some attacks such
    as Physical Attack, Replay Attack, Masquerade Attack can lead to the violation
    of privacy. Several research works have focused on the privacy of SF and PA [59,60,61].
    Integrity: guarantees information not to be changed during storage or transmission.
    Integrity of PA and SF has been part of the topic in several research projects
    [62]. Confidentiality of SF and PA, which protects data against unauthorised access
    has been of interest to a few researchers [61,63]. Availability guarantees the
    continuity of the provided services. Some recent research works have focused on
    the availability of SF and PA [64]. Non-Repudiation keeps users from repudiating
    what they have done in the system. The importance of non-repudiation in SF and
    PA has received attention form a few researchers [65]. Trust: makes it impossible
    for a user to spoof another identity. The literature in this area comes with a
    few research projects focusing on authenticity of SF and PA [65]. In the absence
    of proper provisions for security aspects discussed above, SF and PA may be exposed
    to a variety of attacks that may exploit these environments and related smart
    information systems or cause harm, stealth, unauthorized change, or destruction
    on them. In the following, attacks on SF and PA are classified on the basis of
    their target components. Attacks on Hardware: Unknown or unprotected vulnerabilities
    of IoT and cyber-physical devices (as well as other hardware components) may be
    exploited by professional attackers using specialised tools [66]. As good examples
    for this kind of attacks, we may refer to side channel and Radio frequency (RF)
    jamming attacks, which can violate privacy, confidentiality, or authenticity when
    they hit poorly-designed IoT and cyber-physical systems [2,66,67,68]. - Side Channel
    Attack [2,69] aims at gathering unauthorized information regarding the implementation
    detail of a system via monitoring physical parameters such as electrical current
    or voltage. Attacks of this type violate the confidentiality of the system. -
    RF jamming [2,68] attacks are caused by the open nature of wireless channels and
    the progress in designing jamming-resistant wireless networking systems. Attacks
    of this type violate the availability of the systems in the SF and PA area like
    a greenhouse. Attacks on the Network and Related Equipment: target the network
    or the connected devices. This category of attacks can be further categorized
    as follows. - Denial of Service (DoS) [70,71] prevents users or devices from their
    authorized access to a resource such as a node, a server, or a communication link/network.
    For example, Radio Frequency (RF) Jamming [2,72] overwhelms the RF spectrum used
    by a network aiming to deny communication services to the connected nodes. - MITM
    (Man-In-The-Middle) Attacks [2,67,72] transparently store and replay (or in some
    cases modify) data transmitted over a connection. These attacks may target the
    confidentiality or the integrity of the system. - Botnets [2,73,74] are groups
    of Internet-connected devices (remote sensors), each running one bot or more.
    Botnets can be used for many different purposes, including Distributed DoS (DDoS)
    attacks, information stealing, SPAM dissemination. They can be designed to violate
    availability, integrity, or trust. - Cloud Computing Attacks [2] misuse cloud
    features such as self-provisioning, on-demand services and auto-scaling to take
    advantage of cloud resources. For instance, an infected virtual machine can quickly
    spread the infecting malware to other virtual machines via the cloud. These attacks
    may target non-repudiation, trust, or integrity. Attacks on Data: hit the data
    while being stored, transmitted, or processed in the system. This category of
    attacks can be divided into the following subcategories [75]. - Data Leakage [2,76]
    refers to the illegal transmission of an organization’s data by a source (a person
    or a device) within the organization to an unauthorized external destination.
    This kind of attack violates the confidentiality of the data. - Ransomware [37,72]
    encrypts files, partitions or entire storage devices, and keeps the key secret
    to make the owner [77] pay a ransom. These attacks violate the privacy, trust,
    and integrity. - Cloud Data Leakage [76,78] is the exposure of data related to
    the users of an organization or the provided services, which violates the privacy
    of users or parties. - False Data Injection [2,79] is a title for attacks that
    try to feed malicious information or control commands into the system. This kind
    of attack targets the integrity of the data. - Misconfiguration [2] is the action
    of configuring the SF or the PA reporting systems in a way that reflects invalid
    information regarding the managed farm, which can lead to costly, disruptive decisions
    and actions from the farmers. Misconfiguration attacks violate the integrity.
    Attacks on Code (applications): - Software Update Attacks [2] violate the integrity
    and the availability of the system via disrupting the update process of the installed
    software. - Malware Injection [2,72,80] refers to attacks that infect nodes and
    devices by malicious codes. This kind of attack violates integrity. - Buffer overflow
    [72,80] is a software coding error or vulnerability that hackers can exploit to
    gain unauthorized access to corporate systems. This kind of attack violates availability.
    - Indirect Attacks (SQL Injection) [2,81] use code injection techniques in order
    to mislead the database server to run malicious SQL codes injected into entry
    fields of the database. Indirect attacks violate trust. Attacks on Support Chain:
    are designed to hit different components of the support chain. - Third Party Attacks
    [2,80] occurs when an adversary infiltrates a system via an outside partner or
    provider who has access to the system and/or the data. Third party attacks can
    violate the confidentiality or the integrity of the system. - Data Fabrication
    [82] involves the creation of malicious data or processes misusing an access provided
    for another purpose. It can lead to the violation of the system’s integrity. Misuse
    Attacks: include attacks that misuse SF and PA physical resources in order to
    conduct attacks on other entities such as people or institutes. - Cyber-Terrorism
    [2] may use IoT systems and cyber-physical devices to attack people or premises
    from afar. This can lead to the violation of trust in SF and PA systems. - Invalidation
    and /compliance [2,83] refers to disruptions in the certification process created
    by fabricated false data. These attacks target the integrity of the system. Figure
    2 demonstrates the above classification of attacks on SF and PA and maps each
    class of attacks to the related security aspects. Figure 2. Classification of
    attacks on SF and PA. 4. CKC-Based Taxonomy on Security Threats to SF and PA In
    this section, we present a CKC-based taxonomy for cyber-threats to SF and PA.
    Developed by Lockheed Martin [84], CKC decomposes the process of conducting a
    complex attack into seven stages. This decomposition improves the analyst’s insight
    into an attack, and facilitates the study of adversarial strategies, approaches,
    and methods. The CKC stages of an attack are chained in a way that the whole attack
    scenario will fail if each of the adversaries fail to accomplish any individual
    stage. Our taxonomy provides a stage-by-stage operational understanding of every
    cyber-threat, which can be efficiently used to detect APT groups active in the
    area of SF and PA. In the following, we first, introduce the CKC model in more
    detail, and then propose our CKC-based taxonomy. 4.1. CKC As suggested by CKC
    model, a typical complex attack consists of the following stages. Reconnaissance,
    where the attacker starts to identify and profile the victim via gathering as
    much information as possible. Any relevant information, such as email addresses,
    can be of interest in the reconnaissance stage. The primary goal of this stage
    is to discover the vulnerabilities of the victim. If properly accomplished, this
    stage can facilitate and accelerate a cyber-attack and make it difficult to detect
    via identifying the weak and strong points of the victim system. Moreover, the
    reconnaissance itself should not be suspicious to security mechanisms in the victim’s
    system. We can consider a passive and active approach for Reconnaissance. In the
    context of a cyberattack, passive Reconnaissance is known as footprinting. Active
    Reconnaissance is commonly referred to as scanning. An easy scan would be to ping
    every IP address owned by the destination network to see which ones went to real
    hosts. More sophisticated exploitation methods connect to every port number of
    the IP address to determine what services run on that host and which ports are
    open. In contrast to footprinting, scanning provides more specific information
    but is more intrusive. Additionally, the target may be alerted to a potential
    attack since scanning can trigger more abnormal connections, which must be avoided
    when scanning. Weaponization, wherein the attacker designs and implements the
    remote access malware (the weapon) e.g., the backdoor, virus or worm tailored
    to the vulnerabilities of the victim (discovered in the reconnaissance phase).
    Delivery, in which the attacker launches the remote access malware onto the victim
    (e.g., via a USB device, an e-mail attachment or a website). Exploitation, which
    triggers the remote access malware. In this stage, the attacker utilizes the remote
    access malware to action on the victim and the related network in order to exploit
    vulnerability. Installation, where the attacker tries to get permanent access
    to the victim via installing proper Command and Control (C2) servers. C2, wherein
    the attacker communicates with the C2 server in order to control the victim. Action
    on Target, where the attacker completes the attack scenario and achieves the final
    goal by compromising the victim. The aforementioned stages are demonstrated in
    Figure 3. A point to note here is that not every attack goes through all of the
    above stages strictly and clearly. Moreover, some stages may not be observed,
    tracked, or reported. For example, the Reconnaissance stage is usually a secret
    stage, although the vulnerabilities identified in this stage may be reported later.
    Figure 3. The stages of a typical cyber-attack according to CKC (Courtsey [85,86]).
    4.2. The Taxonomy The taxonomy presented in this subsection connects known SF
    and PA cyber-threats to CKC stages. 4.2.1. Threats Related to the Reconnaissance
    Stage Our review demonstrates that many state-of-the-art cyber-attacks on SF focus
    on several layers of the multi-layered architecture to collect information in
    the reconnaissance stage [37]. Moreover, IoT hardware is of great interest in
    the reconnaissance stage for many attackers targeting SF [1,2] or PA [2,3] systems.
    Thus, most cyber-threats to SF and PA fall into one of the following two categories.
    Threats to the IoT hardware: Although IoT devices are commonly protected by software
    applications, they may be vulnerable to some hardware attacks such as default
    password attacks [2,87]. Threats to the multi-layer architecture: These threats
    target different layers of the multi-layered architecture of Figure 1 as explained
    below. - Physical Layer [2,88,89]: where sensors and actuators spread over farms
    and greenhouses gather environmental data and transmit it through gateways or
    receive command and control messages via the gateways. This layer is threatened
    by a variety of attacks during the reconnaissance stage. - Edge Layer: SF and
    PA environments rely on the edge layer devices for their real-time or near real-time
    computations and services. In some scenarios, attackers may be able to shutdown
    the function of these devices, causing disruption, delay, customer dissatisfaction,
    and financial loss [2]. - Network Layer: This layer resolves the heterogeneity
    of devices spread over farms and greenhouses. Moreover, this layer provides connectivity,
    which makes devices available to SF and PA. DoS attacks and botnets are commonly
    conducted in this layer [2,70,71]. - Cloud Layer: This layer provides the virtualization
    for cloud services. Web attacks and application blocking attacks are examples
    of attacks on this layer [2,88]. 4.2.2. Threats Related to the Weaponization Stage
    Attacks on SF and PA use a variety of techniques to evade detection in the weaponization
    stage. Most of these techniques try to prevent the attack to be revealed by security
    mechanisms operating in IoT device level or in network level. Thus, we classify
    cyber-threats related to the weaponization stage as follows. IoT Device Level
    Evasion: It has been observed that defence in IoT device level mainly relies on
    anti-viruses and end-point security solutions embedded in or installed on devices,
    which detect well-known virus signatures or anomalies in behaviors. Well-designed
    attacks on SF and PA try to hide themselves from these mechanisms. As an example,
    one may refer to hollowing technique or heap spraying, which may successfully
    embed a malicious code inside an application even in the case the anti-virus includes
    the related signature [90,91,92,93]. Network Level Evasion: Firewalls and Intrusion
    Detection/Prevention Systems (IDSs/IPSs) are the most common tools for in-network
    protection [94,95]. A key point to be reiterated here is that there is no completely
    secure solution, including firewalls and IDS/IPS. Although these tools can detect
    a malicious executable file, they may be unable to detect a malicious file attached
    to an email. Thus, they are not considered as completely-secure mechanisms in
    SF and PA. To evade these mechanisms, SF and PA attacks depend on a wide range
    of techniques, among which we can mention illegal use of well-known protocols
    (HTTPS, DNS, HTTP, etc.) [37] or ports (53, 80, 443, etc.) [37] as well as network
    spoofing [89]. 4.2.3. Threats Related to the Delivery Stage After the completion
    of the Weaponization stage, the adversary needs to find a way to penetrate directly
    or indirectly into the victim node(s) to deliver the malicious payload [96,97].
    In direct penetration, the adversary personally delivers the exploit to the victim.
    Indirect penetration depends on a trusted third party to compromise the victim
    in a way that the adversary can deliver the exploit. According the above discussions,
    we can divide threats related to the delivery stage into the following categories.
    Direct Penetration: Malicious payloads are commonly delivered through the body
    or the attachments of an email [98,99], such as a fake software update or a spear-phishing
    link [37,100]. Indirect Penetration: In the indirection penetration scenario,
    a communication protocol, a gateway or a web application may play the role of
    the trusted third party. Trusted third parties can help attackers gather information
    via TCP/UDP port scan, spoofing and sniffing, or launch a pre-designed backdoor
    [1,3]. 4.2.4. Threats Related to the Exploitation Stage Some state-of-the-art
    attacks on SF and PA exploit a vulnerability in the software or in the underlying
    Operating System (OS) to get the victim run their malicious code in the exploitation
    stage [37,101]. Others use SQL injection techniques for this purpose [37,102].
    Accordingly, the cyber-threats related to the exploitation stage can be classified
    as follows. Exploiting Software and OS Vulnerabilities: Zero-day exploits are
    good examples for this kind of threat [103]. They are not detectable by common
    software vulnerability protection mechanisms. They exploit unknown software vulnerabilities
    for which no patch or fix is available. Moreover, viruses, worms, Trojan horses,
    and backdoors are common threats related to OS vulnerabilities in smart devices
    and consequently in SF and PA [104,105]. SQL injection: In recent years, SQL injection
    has frequently hit data-driven applications using code injection techniques [37].
    It can potentially hit SF and PA databases as well. 4.2.5. Threats Related to
    the Installation Stage In the installation stage, a downloader can be fooled,
    codes can be injected into the memory, or unofficial applications may be installed
    to download malware such as rootkits and backdoors [37,106]. To this end, some
    attacks may exploit vulnerabilities in Operating Systems (OSs) used in IoT such
    as Android [107], Raspberry Pi [108], Symbian [109], or Android with Linux kernel
    [110]. This kind of attacks may take one or a combiation of the following approaches
    to achieve the goal. Modifying registry keys [111] DLL Search Order Hijacking
    [112] DLL side loading [113] Startup Folder Modification [37] Other attacks may
    exploit vulnerabilities in embedded software or firmware [114]. In this case,
    some of the following approaches may be taken by the attacker. Brute-forcing access
    [115] Buffer overflow Exploit [116] SMS Trojan viruses [117] Install unofficial
    Apps on mobile OS [117] 4.2.6. Threats Related to the C2 Stage This stage is about
    how hackers control the victim system after completing the installation stage.
    This commonly happens via registering a C2 server [118]. Our studies highlight
    two C2 mechanisms in attacks on SF and PA, the first of which depends on network
    protocols [2,88] and the second uses removable media [37,101]. Thus, we categorise
    threats related to the C2 stage as explained below. C2s using Network Protocols:
    Many common attacks on SF and PA use HTTP/HTTPS, ICMP, DNS, FTP, SMTP and other
    standard network protocols for their communications in the C2 stage [119,120].
    For example, in many scenarios, when direct connection to an external mail server
    or an agriculture database server is not possible, hackers rely on backdoors that
    use protocols such as FTP or SMTP to penetrate into the server via sending files
    or emails [37,101]. Moreover, to bypass common network security mechanisms, hackers
    may perturb DNS packets, which makes the attack more difficult to trace [121].
    C2s using Removable Media: Given the features of removable media (such as USB
    storage), they are commonly used to bypass networks for the exfiltration of data.
    For example, when a disk is formatted for decreasing the size of a partition,
    hundreds of megabytes of data (including malicious files) can be stored at the
    last addresses of the disk without being lost [37]. 4.2.7. Threats Related to
    the Action Stage In the last stage, the adversary tries to finalize the attack
    and achieve the ultimate goal, which can be the exfiltration of data or damaging
    valuable resources, etc. In this stage, most attacks on SF and PA try to infect
    as many IoT devices as possible, and get access to the network and the infrastructure
    in order to compromise valuable targets such as edge devices, servers, etc. [2,37,122].
    Moreover, attackers may try to get command line terminals such as WinExe or credentials
    management tools such as Mimikatz to access one computer through another using
    methods such as Pass the Hash (PtH) [123]. 4.2.8. Threats Related to More Than
    One Stage Include attacks that create threats related to more than one CKC stage.
    In this category, we can refer to ransomware and similar attacks. Specifically,
    APTs cover almost all CKC stages. These attacks are individually studied in more
    detail in Section 5. Figure 4 demonstrates our CKC-based taxonomy on cyber-threats
    to SF and PA according to the above discussions. Figure 4. The CKC-based taxonomy
    on cyber-threats to SF and PA. 4.3. Case Study In this section, we study the anatomy
    of the DoS attack against SF infrastructures reported by Sontowski et al. [124],
    and connect it to the stages of CKC. 4.3.1. The Target Environment The target
    is an SF system based upon Microsoft FarmBeats 11 [125] connected to Microsoft
    Azure cloud. The SF system uses a Raspberry Pi, to which different kinds of sensors
    including ambient temperature, light, humidity, and soil moisture sensors are
    connected. In this system, IEEE 802.11 connects the Raspberry Pi to a Wi-Fi access
    point that provides cloud connection. 4.3.2. Anatomy of the Attack On the basis
    of the details reported in [124], we can use the CKC methodology to study the
    attack as explained below. Reconnaissance: In this stage, the attackers have studied
    the architecture and components of the victim’s system and gathered the information
    mentioned in Section 4.3.1. Then they have used sniffing tools such as WireShark
    in order to identify the address of the Raspberry Pi via tracking the sensor update
    packets it sends every few seconds/minutes. Moreover, they have identified the
    vulnerabilities in authentication and deauthentication mechanisms of IEEE 802.11,
    reported by Wright [126]. Weaponization: In the Weaponization stage, the attackers
    have designed and implemented a Wi-Fi deauthentication tool capable of exploiting
    the vulnerabilities reported in [126] in order to disconnect the Raspberry Pi
    from the access point and consequently from the network and the cloud. Delivery:
    In this stage, the Wi-Fi deauther is installed on a MakerFocus ESP8266 Development
    Board, and imitates the Raspberry Pi via spoofing sensor update packets (using
    the address of the Raspberry Pi). Thereby, the deauthentication tool fools the
    access point because the access point perceives it as the Raspberry Pi. Exploitation:
    In this stage, the deauther fabricates and sends deauthentication notification
    packets to the access point (Spoofed as the Raspberry Pi). According to the IEEE
    802.11 protocol, the access point is obliged to deauthenticate and disconnect
    the sender of these packets without the need for a new authentication. (In fact,
    this is the exploited vulnerability). This way, the Raspberry Pi is disconnected
    from the access point along with the sensors connected to it. Installation: The
    attack bypasses this phase, as it does not need any further installation after
    the deauther is delivered. C2: The attackers have designed a control panel software
    tool to control the deauther. This tool is installed on the MakerFocus ESP8266
    Development Board along with the Raspberry Pi and plays the role of the C2 server.
    Action on Target: Since this attack is a DoS attack, the final goal is to disconnect
    the Raspberry Pi from the access point. Therefore, no further action is taken
    in this stage. 5. APTs in SF and PA APT attacks create one of the most severe
    threats to SF and PA as they cover almost all CKC stages [37,101]. This severity
    motivates the discussions in this section, which are specifically focused on APTs
    as a chosen case for further study. In the rest of this section, we first introduce
    general APT attacks, and then go deeper into APT attacks on SF and PA. In addition
    to the anatomy of these attacks, we study some of their behavioral characteristics.
    5.1. An Introduction to APT Attacks APT generally refers to a threat where an
    adversary (or maybe a group of adversaries) are persistently connected to a network
    to identify and steal strategic data without being detected [127]. APTs usually
    target highly-strategic corporations, industries, or financial agencies as well
    as government institutes or national security and defence agencies, where top
    secret information is stored, transmitted, and processed. Information regarding
    military and political plans, nuclear and aerospace technology, Intellectual Property
    (IP), etc. is of interest to APT groups [37,127,128]. Thus, it is pertinent to
    expect them to be interested in information regarding the agricultural sector
    as well. APT attacks are different from other cyber-attacks in that they use personalized
    tools instead of more commonly used tools. Moreover, they take place over a longer
    period of time, which makes them more difficult to trace compared to other attacks.
    They utilise TTPs in a way that allows them to proceed covertly even in the presence
    of common IDSs or IPSs [37]. An APT attack is usually named after the researcher(s)
    who has (have) detected and systematically analyzed the attack. Among well-known
    APT attacks, one may refer to Sykipot [129], GhostNet [129], APT34 [129], APT28
    [37], APT29 [37], APT30 [37], and APT37 [129]. Systematic APT attack detection
    and prevention methods typically depend on multi-faceted interaction between providers
    of security service providers and end users. Traffic monitoring, access control,
    and Whitelisting (monitoring and imitating access to the network from authorized
    domains) can be mentioned as commonly-used mechanisms used for this purpose [11,29].
    5.2. APT Attacks on SF and PA Most APT attacks on SF and PA try to gain hidden,
    persistent access to information regarding food chain and production network [4,129].
    APT groups attempt to hit valuable targets such as greenhouses, livestock, and
    smart farms. To achieve their goals, APT groups depend on advanced techniques
    such as zero-day exploits, phishing attacks, and social engineering. Among the
    consequences of ATP attacks in SF and PA, one may refer to the following. Theft
    of IP (patents, etc.) Stealth of critical data related to food chain, control,
    genetics, etc. Damage to important agricultural infrastructure (change to database
    entries or control parameters) The Anatomy of an APT Attack on SF or PA A successful
    ATP attack on SF or PA is classically decomposed into the following three steps
    [130]. We map these steps to CKC stages. Penetration (Infiltration): This step
    can be mapped to the first three stages in CKC. Social engineering can be mentioned
    as a common reconnaissance technique used in this step [129]. This phase may involve
    vulnerability exploiting and malicious code uploading (SQL Injection). Penetration
    may lead to the installation of backdoors, which can provide the attacker with
    further access to the network. This step is composed of the following phases.
    Testing the target for detection Deployment White noise attack Initial infiltration
    Outbound connection initiation Further Access (Expansion): This step may be mapped
    stages 4 through 6 in CKC. In this step, the attacker tries to gain longer access
    to the network or access to more strategic resources. The goal is getting control
    of critical functions and manipulating them to pave the way for the final step.
    This step is composed of the following phases. The following two functions can
    be run in this step. Expanding access and stealing credentials using phishing
    and similar techniques Broadening the presence Information Stealth and Sabotage
    (Exploitation): We can compare the final step to the last stage in CKC. In this
    step, APT groups may steal valuable information, shut down a strategic function,
    or cause damage to the system. Critical business information regarding the production
    value or cultivation process of livestock or crops may be of interest to APT groups
    in this step. These kinds of information can be sold to a rival or used to undermine
    the production process. The stolen data may be stored somewhere inside the victim
    network for covert transportation in the future. APT attacks commonly use white
    noise techniques (maybe in the form of a DDoS attack) to evade detection systems
    [131]. This step is typically composed of the following phases. White noise attack

    APT attack. Figure 5. The anatomy of an APT attack. 5.3. Some Behavioral Characteristics
    of APT Attacks on SF or PA In this subsection, we study some behavioral characteristics
    of APT attacks on SF and PA. In the following, we mention some symptoms that may
    be considered as warnings for an active APT attack. Unusual and suspicious activities
    in security and control systems (especially the high-level access systems) Widespread
    use of backdoor tools (Most of them can be detected by common IDSs. Suspicious
    and unusual activities occurring in the databases Evidences for data and information
    stealth 6. Risk Mitigation Strategies and Countermeasure Our discussions on attacks
    and threats related to SF and PA highlight the need for a study on related risk
    mitigation strategies and countermeasures for different IoT attacks and security
    threats in SF and PA, which can be considered as the important side of research
    in this area. Table 2 and Table 3 summarize our studies in this regard. While
    it is not necessarily feasible for every farmer to be an expert at technology
    and cyber-security threats in agriculture, there are some cyber-safe behaviours
    farmers can perform to reduce the security risk. These include dynamic and secure
    passwords, frequently password changeover, data encryption, 2-factor user authentication,
    and updating software when prompted [132,133]. Avoidance of suspicious emails,
    links, and not saving personal or financial data on browsers and auto-fill features
    are recommended too [132,133]. Likewise, farmers should only make data-driven
    decisions when systems are demonstrably secure. Not only should farmers be wary
    of cyber-security threats, but it is imperative that the various stakeholders
    involved along the food production chain be cognizant of the risks. Farmers often
    are sharing data with trusted advisors, researchers, suppliers, and buyers - therefore,
    cyber-safe behaviours need to be encouraged throughout the data ecosystem. Physical
    access controls and other physical behaviours can also reduce security risk. For
    instance, it is prudent to inspect and maintain devices regularly to prevent environmental
    and personal complications that could obscure security measures [133]. Creating
    back-ups of data helps reduce impact severity when data is stolen, and farmer
    access is denied. Protecting sensitive information, documents, and devices by
    placing them in secure spaces liked locked cabinets, rooms, and off-site caches
    can also reduce security risk [133]. Blockchain technology has been applied to
    some architectures to ensure data privacy and security as well as addressing fault
    tolerance, access control, and third-party removal to tackle these challenges
    [3,134,135]. We summarize existing research on intensifying security issues and
    privacy in IoT and ICT usage in the agricultural sector. Table 3 outlines a list
    of countermeasures that can be taken versus security features threats and threats
    layer in a smart farming environment. In fact, understanding and considering them
    is a viable way to obtain security threat mitigation in SF and PA environments.
    Table 2. Risk Mitigation Strategies for SF and PA.                  Table 3. Attack
    Countermeasures for SF and PA.       7. Future Roadmap In this section, we discuss
    some open research challenges related to the security of SF and PA. While in this
    paper, we begin the first steps in creating novel SF/PA mitigation strategies
    by reviewing the literature, developing a taxonomy, and conducting a case study
    on APTs. Future research can build upon this through interdisciplinary research
    that draws on knowledge from farmers, SF tool developers, and computer scientists
    to test the mitigation techniques mentioned here and to develop more specific
    strategies to the SF and PA context. Listed below, these challenges can highlight
    a future road map for further research in this area. Access Control from a Security
    Perspective: Dealing with hired labor and livestock, the owners of farms, greenhouses,
    etc. are traditionally concerned about access control. However, they need to adopt
    a security perspective for their property. Authentication, authorization, and
    accounting should be incorporated to prevent unauthorized access, which is the
    stepping stone in many severe attacks on SF and PA. Although the literature in
    this area comes with some relevant research reports [1,2,3,41,50], there is still
    opportunities for systematic research. Data Protection: Given, the abilities of
    smart devices and IoT, enormous data acquisition, communication and processing
    is a well-known characteristic of SF and PA [1,2]. This raises the need for efficient
    data protection mechanisms, which has been of interest to a few researchers [1,2].
    However, data protection can still be considered as an open research challenge
    in this area. Network Infrastructure and Physical Layer Protection: The physical
    layer and the network infrastructure play critical roles in SF and PA. They are
    targeted by several attacks [3]. Although a few research projects have focused
    on this topic [4,9,81,135,136], research in this area still needs to be developed.
    Education as Risk Reduction: The social elements of reducing cyber-risks, such
    as education, has received relatively little attention by scholars [146]. Not
    only are farmers are interested in education regarding security threats to their
    operations, but education is regarded as a vital tool for reducing security risk
    [132,147,148]. Future research opportunities exist in assessing what cyber-safe
    behaviours farmers currently utilize. From this, there can be investigation of
    what educational formats, content, and dispersion would be most effective and
    appreciated by these vital stakeholders. Specific Secure Communication Protocols
    for SF and PA: In SF and PA, where sensors, actuators, drones, autonomous tractors
    and other smart devices are spread out in various locations, communication protocols
    are of critical importance. Although several network, Machine-to-Machine (M2M)
    and IoT protocols such as Bluetooth, NFC, WiFi, SSL, TCP, UDP and 6loWPA have
    been adopted from other technologies [3,121,149], there is still room for research
    on secure protocols specifically designed and standardized for SF and PA. Secure
    Smart Devices: Given the threats to smart devices used in SF and PA (studied in
    previous sections), security needs to be taken into consideration in design and
    implementation phases of these devices. Secure AI Adoption: In recent years, some
    researchers have been concerned about the application of AI in SF and PA [2,3].
    Thus, the security threats to AI such as adversarial attacks [1,2] can motivate
    future research on secure AI in SF and PA. Informed by this taxonomy of cyber-threats,
    strengthening policy regarding cyber-security in PA is an important consideration
    for future research. Legal frameworks designed to protect private data and ensure
    privacy are key to addressing the challenge of cyber-security arising from new
    farming technologies [150]. Reviews on the social science of PA have highlighted
    that future research needs to address how policy-makers should respond to cyber-attacks
    on agri-food systems [151]. 8. Conclusions SF and PA have the potential to enhance
    global food security and reduce agriculture’s impact on the environment, however
    to be able to realize this potential these technologies need to be protected from
    cyber-attacks. It’s clear right now that there are plenty of cyber-attacks and
    security threats in this area. These attacks can impose serious disruptions to
    global markets and especially to the economies of developing nations that are
    heavily dependent on the agriculture industry. In this paper, we considered the
    security of SF and PA, which is a critical need in the field of smart farming.
    We highlighted important security aspects needed to be considered in SF and PA.
    We presented a survey on attacks that violate each of these security aspects.
    Accordingly, we introduced cyber-threats to SF and PA. It is a viable source to
    tackle existing security issues here. Our studies on SF and PA cyber-threats led
    to a systematic CKC-based taxonomy on these threats. Among the mentioned threats,
    we chose APTs for further studies. We studied the anatomy as well as behavioral
    characteristics of APTs. Moreover, we presented a survey on risk mitigation strategies
    and countermeasures against attacks on SF and PA. Lastly, we developed a future
    road map to pave the way for future research in this area. Author Contributions

  description: With the internet of things (IoT), it is proven that enormous networks
    can be created to interconnect objects and facilitate daily life in a variety
    of domains. Research is needed to study how these improvements can be applied
    in different ways, using different technologies, and through the creation of different
    applications. IoT Protocols and Applications for Improving Industry, Environment,
    and Society contains the latest research on the most important areas and challenges
    in the internet of things and its intersection with technologies and tools such
    as artificial intelligence, blockchain, model-driven engineering, and cloud computing.
    The book covers subfields that examine smart homes, smart towns, smart earth,
    and the industrial internet of things in order to improve daily life, protect
    the environment, and create safer and easier jobs. While covering a range of topics
    within IoT including Industry 4.0, security, and privacy, this book is ideal for
    computer scientists, engineers, practitioners, stakeholders, researchers, academicians,
    and students who are interested in the latest applications of IoT.

    a holistic review Article 13 September 2021 1 Introduction The present world population
    will increase to 8 billion people in 2023. Rapid population growth according to
    the United Nation (UN) makes it more difficult to eradicate poverty, end hunger
    and malnutrition, and broaden access to healthcare and educational opportunities
    [1]. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation predicts that the global food supply
    would need to increase by 70% by 2050 as a result of decreasing agricultural lands
    and the depletion of limited natural resources [2]. As a result there is a pressing
    need to raise farm productivity. Due to a lack of natural resources such as fresh
    water and cultivated land as well as trends in declining agricultural yields for
    several key commodities the issue has gotten worse. Another obstacle is the agricultural
    workforce’s changing organisational structure. There seem to be astonishing numbers
    for the Indian agricultural industry. With a Gross Value Addition of US Dollar
    265.51 billion it supports the livelihood of 58% of Indians. Despite employing
    around 58% of the working force directly and indirectly, this industry only provides
    about 15.87% of the nation''s Gross Domestic product (GDP) [3]. The topic of agricultural
    productivity is brought up as a result. Agricultural Value Added per Worker is
    the indicator that is most frequently used to gauge agricultural output. China,
    India, Indonesia and other impoverished or emerging countries with large populations
    have the lowest agricultural value added per worker. India has the lowest agricultural
    value added per worker among the top 20 economies. Water is essential to life
    for all creatures including plants and animals. It is a fundamental necessity
    of every human being. The only way that water is used in agriculture in India
    today is for irrigation. This proportion may increase as a result of increased
    food consumption and population growth. So a problem that affects most agriculture
    is a lack of water. By applying various water-saving strategies this can be reduced
    to a minimum. There are many strategies to stop or minimise water waste. Tamil
    Nadu''s quick development and industrialisation is responsible for the state''s
    excessive water usage. The primary factor influencing the rapid deployment of
    ground water irrigation is the ongoing change in Tamil Nadu''s yearly rainfall
    pattern. The main objective of this work is to use groundwater irrigation to decrease
    the negative effects of water scarcity on crop productivity in order to sustain
    agriculture in Tamil Nadu throughout the year. This investigation looks at temporal
    variations in irrigated areas between 2000 and 2014 [4]. We use spectral matching
    methods to map and classify the seven bands of MODIS satellite images of the land
    surfaces in order to show changes in rainfall at the sub-basin level. The only
    way that water is used in agriculture today is for irrigation. This proportion
    may increase as a result of increased food consumption and population growth.
    Thus, one of the problems facing the planet is water scarcity. Day by day the
    most efficient plant monitoring systems currently in use make use of plant optical
    and infrared imaging. Everyone needs water including humans, animals, and plants.
    It is a fundamental necessity of human being. Water waste is the key problem in
    the majority of agriculture. By applying various water-saving strategies this
    can be reduced to a minimum. There are many strategies to stop or minimise water
    waste. Water is trickled onto the plant’s roots using drip irrigation which is
    the most effective method of irrigation [5]. A sprinkler system is an irrigation-based
    system that makes use of tubes-mounted guns, sprays, or sprinklers. Abiotic and
    biotic constraints are two categories of environmental limitations that have an
    impact on crop production. Actually these aspects are more obvious due to climate
    change brought on by global warming [6]. Abiotic stresses modify a plant''s morphology,
    physiology, biochemistry, and molecular structure which negatively affects its
    growth and productivity. Climate and soil characteristics (soil components, physicochemical,
    pH, and biological features) (drought, flood, cold, heat stress, etc.) are examples
    of abiotic constraints. On the other hand biotic variables include weeds, vertebrate
    pests, pathogens, beneficial species (pollinators, decomposers, and natural enemies),
    and anthropogenic evolution. To address all the environmental issues that are
    lowering crop yields and maintaining food security, trans- and multidisciplinary
    research is required. Numerous factors present a severe risk that will lower productivity
    if farms are not adequately monitored and maintained. Three categories biological,
    environmental, and technological can be used to categorise these variables [7].
    Due to the need to increase crop production and the increasing use of farming
    practises like irrigation, extensive inorganic fertiliser application, and synthetic
    chemical weed and insect control, more land has been converted to agriculture
    [8]. These operations have decreased the quality of the soil, the water, exacerbated
    soil erosion, contaminated groundwater and the quality of the food. In an effort
    to enhance yields on current farms while reducing the environmental effect of
    agriculture this has prompted programmes for sustainable development [9,10,11,12,13].
    Today wireless sensor networks play a huge role in agriculture. These systems
    among others include those that use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based
    traceability systems, continuously monitor the environment and preserve agricultural
    accuracy. For the automated irrigation system to transmit the sensor data for
    the soil moisture content, temperature, and humidity to the remote area, a wireless
    modem using LoRa is essential. Wireless sensor networks are used to remotely monitor
    humidity and temperature information on a regular or irregular basis utilising
    General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) based systems. The aforementioned information
    allows us to frame the proposal’s objective as Fabrication of monitoring device
    with AI analyzation of Drought Monitoring and forecasting by Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data from MODIS Satellite. The contributions
    of the study are as follows NDVI time series data from MODIS Satellite along with
    Micro climate Analysis for adapting the new cropping pattern. Implementation of
    irrigation depends on age of crops and Micro climate using AI To monitor crop
    growth leaf colour changes, pest control, nutrients deficiency by Spectrogram
    images adopting AI. Also provide Fertilizer calculator to have a realistic estimate
    of the quality of fertilizer needed for our crop and area. To proposed LoRa Technology
    transmit all sensors data from farm field to control unit without Global System
    for Mobile communication (GSM) technology and any other Internet facilities. 2
    Literature review Currently irrigation is the only usage of water in agriculture.
    Increased food demand and population expansion could cause this percentage to
    increase. Therefore a global issue is the lack of water [14]. Utilising plant
    optical and infrared pictures the most effective plant monitoring systems are
    being implemented daily [15]. Every human, animal and plant needs water to survive.
    Every human being has a basic need for it. Water waste is the main issue in the
    majority of agriculture. Utilising various water saving techniques can help to
    lessen this [16]. There are numerous ways to prevent or reduce water waste. The
    first one is the ditch irrigation system, in which rows of seeds are placed in
    ditches that have been dug out. For the passage from the main ditch to the canals
    there are tubes resembling syphon tubes. The most effective technique of irrigation
    is drip irrigation which involves pouring water onto the plant''s roots [17, 18].
    Sprinkler systems are another type of irrigation-based system that employ sprinklers,
    sprays or guns mounted on tubes. The tubes carry water and some of the ends include
    sprinklers to apply water where it is needed. The sprinkler won’t activate until
    the temperature and humidity sensor in the root zone surpasses the threshold value.
    The rotary system is the best irrigation technique for large regions. The rotary
    system uses mechanically driven sprinklers that travel in a round motion due to
    its 100-foot range. As a result the device sprinkles over time in a larger area
    while using less water. For the purpose of watering cotton crops, infrared thermometers
    are utilised to measure the temperature of the remote canopy [19]. A temperature
    threshold is upheld during this process. When the canopy temperature rises above
    a certain threshold the mechanism activates. The majority of irrigation systems
    are automated rather than manual in order to maximise cotton production and water
    usage. An alternative parameter to calculate agricultural irrigation requirements
    is plant Evapotranspiration (ET). When two terms are combined as in evaporation
    and plant transpiration the result is called ET. Evaporation is the vaporisation
    of water from soil, water bodies and canopy interception [20] into the atmosphere.
    Water vaporises from stems, flowers, and leaves during the process of transpiration.
    Water reductions of up to 42% are possible with ET-based systems [21]. Due to
    uses like vehicle monitoring and robot control, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)
    nodes have grown in popularity in recent years. IRIS nodes built on TINY OS are
    used to measure the soil moisture content of paddy fields [15]. The most popular
    method for measuring the data in irrigation fields is the ZigBee transmission
    of data from end devices. However the distance between the two nodes is only 10
    to 100 m when these devices are used. As a result the majority of applications
    transport data to faraway locations using GPRS-based technologies [17]. ZigBee-based
    transmission is used in the agricultural sector to collect data from numerous
    sensor nodes. In today''s world wireless sensor networks are essential to agriculture
    and the food industry. These systems among others, include those that use RFID-based
    traceability systems, continuously monitor the environment and uphold agricultural
    precision [16].A wireless modem using GSM/GPRS is called the SIM900A. It is crucial
    for the automated irrigation system to communicate the values from the soil moisture
    [12] content sensor as well as the temperature, humidity and other sensor data
    to the remote area. The AT commands can be used to do this. The microcontroller
    unit and GSM/GPRS modem are interfaced [12]. Wireless sensor networks are used
    for remote monitoring using GPRS-based systems to continuously or sporadically
    monitor temperature and humidity data in industry and even in agricultural [18].Various
    models and limitations of existing systems are discussed in the Table 1. Table
    1 Comparison of existing systems Full size table The main objective of this article
    is to develop an automatic watering system using AI and sensors linked to a microcontroller.
    This study made use of the DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity as well as
    the VH400 sensor for soil moisture. These sensors are interfaced with the microcontroller
    unit which was buried beneath the root zone of the plant. Sending an SMS to a
    mobile phone of a remote owner is the main goal of using a microcontroller. SMS
    messages are delivered using the SIM900A module which is coupled to the microcontroller
    unit. The irrigation system is put to the test with various plants at various
    humidity and temperature levels in both dry and typical situations. To keep the
    water content in those specific regions soil moisture sensors are used. All results
    acquired under wet and normal conditions have been shown to be logical. 2.1 LoRa
    technology A LoRa-enabled architecture for precise irrigation and monitoring has
    been demonstrated [28] with each sensor node being able to connect to another
    LoRa-enabled receiver and create a communication channel. A low-power operating
    method called LoRa allows for transmission and reception over a vast communication
    range. Despite the fact that LoRa technology makes it simple to transfer sensor
    data from farm fields to a control unit. Field-installed sensors gather information
    about things like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. These sensors broadcast
    the data in discrete packets using low-power, long-range wireless technology called
    LoRa. The packets are sent by LoRa-capable sensors to LoRa gateways placed around
    the farm. Gateways accept the packets and use the LoRaWAN (LoRa Wide Area Network)
    protocol to send them to a central control unit. The control unit gathers and
    analyses the incoming data to produce actionable insights. Real-time updates on
    crop conditions may be included in this data, enabling knowledgeable decisions
    on pest management, fertilisation, and irrigation. 2.2 Challenges of AI Although
    implementing AI in the agricultural sector faces significant obstacles it is a
    logical step towards smart agriculture for efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable
    farming. The agricultural sector and the field of AI research are not connected.
    Therefore AI researchers are not well-versed in the issues that farmers confront,
    and farmers are also not well-versed in the AI technologies that are currently
    available. It will take more interdisciplinary cooperation to find a solution
    to this dual issue. The use of AI in agriculture is still in its early stages,
    hence there aren''t any established norms or regulations. As a result there are
    several legal questions surrounding smartt farming. Because the majority of AI-IoT
    solutions were cloud-based until recently, farmers were reluctant to adopt AI
    methods due to worries about cyber attacks, data security, and privacy. A new
    IoT option called \"Edge AI\" has emerged to address this problem. Edge AI handles
    sensor data locally and offers better data protection and privacy as well as reduced
    latency and cost. Another challenge for AI in agriculture is a lack of data. AI
    is a data-driven technology. The absence of pertinent data makes it difficult
    to deploy certain AI algorithms. In remote, rural areas with no higher speed mobile
    networks but where agriculture is the main industry, edge AI has the potential
    to transform the game. The potential for intelligent agriculture is increased.
    Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) were used in [29] to compress sensor image data
    at the edge layer before transmitting the compressed data to the fog layer using
    LoRa technology. 3 System architecture The three layers of the proposed system
    architecture are depicted in Fig. 1. Layer 1: A farming device The foundation
    layer of the smart farm architecture is called layer. It consists of numerous
    components, including sensors which are dispersed across the agricultural ground.
    These devices also known as distributed source nodes, are simply LoRa wireless
    sensor networks. They recognise the physical parameters continuously collect data
    in real-time and send it to the gateway node at the following layer. The data
    received by several sensors and cameras in various smart agriculture applications
    is shown in Fig. 2. For instance data is gathered by on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
    (UAV) sensors and cameras in a field of rice and relayed to the edge where subsurface
    soil sensors process it. Fig. 1 System architecture Full size image Fig. 2 Product
    over view Full size image Layer-2: The Edge Computing Layer is included in Layer
    2. There are several edge nodes in this. Depending on the particular smart agriculture
    system, different nodes may be present. Here, layer-1 data is processed, filtered
    and encrypted. Due of resource constraints at the edge layer the prognostic and
    solution components were previously completed at the following layer. Trained
    machine learning models can perform prognostics and provide suggestions at this
    layer, nevertheless thanks to recent hardware advancements and initiatives for
    AI at the edge. However if the task requires a lot of resources or is not time-sensitive,
    prognosis and inference can both be done in the following layer. For instance
    the ESP8266 for integrating smart agricultural components to manage environmental
    conditions [25] and the ESP32 for smart irrigation [26]. Layer-3: The third or
    uppermost layer in the bottom-up design of the smart agriculture system is cloud
    computing. This virtual layer is often located in data centres and is accessible
    via the Internet from any location in the world [27]. Massive amounts of data
    generated by cameras or sensors in agricultural farms are required. 4 Data 4.1
    Satellite data The seven bands of MODIS are used to measure surface reflectance.
    Blue wavelengths between 459 and 479 nm, green between 545 and 565 nm, red between
    620 and 670 nm, near-infrared between 841 and 875 nm, and short-wave infrared
    between 1628 and 2155 nm, are used to examine vegetation and land surfaces. For
    monitoring the vegetation at a continental scale [30] using the Terra platform''s
    MODIS 500-m resolution and 8-day surface reflectance. Scientific Data Set documentation
    for MOD09A1 [31] is given. The study also included secondary data in addition
    to the original data set, which came from MODIS time-series data as shown in Fig.
    3a Fig. 3 a Rainfall fluctuations over time in different irrigated agricultural
    areas in Tamil Nadu. b Tamil Nadu agricultural land classification, by source,
    with major river basins Full size image 4.2 River basins and their irrigated area
    There are 40,000 tanks, 1 million wells, and 61 large reservoirs that rely extensively
    (17.5 BCM) on surface water. Surface irrigation is not as important as ground
    water irrigation (15. 3 BCM). Table 2 provides information on the basin''s irrigation
    condition for 39 years, from 1976 to 2014, together with 54 years'' worth of rainfall
    data, from 1961 to 2014 shown in Fig. 3b also. At the sub-national level, which
    is similar to a state, county or district, statistics on the total amount of irrigated
    agriculture and irrigated area of the country were gathered. The Department of
    Economics and Statistics of the Tamil Nadu government provided data on irrigated
    areas. Daily rainfall data from 2000 to 2014 were collected from the India Meteorological
    Department''s (IMD) Hydro Met Division website at http://imd.gov.in. The monsoon
    was the subject of our investigation. We focused our research on the monsoon season
    (kharif season) from May to December because all the agricultural activities are
    done during this season and image analysis also carried out for that season. Table
    2 Characteristics of the major river basins Full size table 4.3 Spectral matching
    techniques for identifying changes in irrigated area using NDVI The NDVI, which
    is a combination of near infrared and red bands, is frequently used to discern
    vegetation conditions such as density and vigour. NDVI values range from − 1 to + 1,
    with higher values indicating more vigorous vegetation and lower values indicating
    less vigorous vegetation. The total area irrigated from 2000–2001 to 2014–2015
    and the annual irrigated area differ significantly. The change in the irrigated
    area was discovered using spectral matching techniques. The highest mean NDVI
    value in Tamil Nadu was 0.79 during the kharif season. From this result along
    with the micro climate analysis (Temperature, Air quality index and Humidity)
    suggest the right crop for the season. 4.4 Crop management Crop management is
    the process of evaluating the sociological, ecological and economic factors that
    play a significant role in the choice, growing and selling of crops. Cropping
    patterns are influenced by crop growth, the availability of water resources, labour,
    insurance, and environmental conditions using MODIS satellite and AI. Cropping
    patterns might change according to ecological variables. For instance traditional
    crops like paddy agriculture, which require extensive water resources, cannot
    be supported in places with diminishing water supplies and groundwater tables.
    Crop choice is also influenced by the agricultural product''s market as well as
    the export and import regulations of other nations. 4.5 Soil monitoring In the
    overall farming process, soil moisture is crucial. During the course of a plant’s
    growth, it is in charge of photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration and the
    transfer of minerals [30]. In making decisions for farms, soil monitoring is crucial.
    Cropping patterns are influenced by a number of variables, including soil salinity,
    pests, precipitation, pH, and humidity. These elements support the evaluation
    of soil health. Field-based sensors track the temperature and humidity of the
    soil, and the cloud receives through LoRa Transmitter and the process the data.
    Farmers will be informed about a variety of issues, and planting patterns are
    evaluated and chosen depending on salinity content, soil nutrient level, humidity,
    and temperature. A wide range of topics will be discussed with farmers, and planting
    patterns will be considered and selected based on factors like salinity content,
    soil nutrient level, humidity, and temperature. Water is essential for photosynthesis,
    regulates temperature, and transports food and nutrients for plant growth, making
    soil moisture a crucial element in plant growth. Humidity controls the food supply
    and transpiration rate for ideal plant growth. A humidity of 50% to 60% is ideal
    for the growth of vegetable plants [32]. To ensure the best possible use of water
    resources, soil moisture sensors are inserted into plant roots and analyse soil
    moisture level measurements [33, 34]. 4.6 Smart irrigation Smart irrigation is
    the practise of enhancing the quality and quantity of production while making
    the most use of available water resources. By giving the plants the right amount
    of water, it saves water. Irrigation systems can be classified as either soil
    moisture sensor-based or weather-based. A controller controls the irrigation in
    weather-based irrigation systems, which collect temperature and rainfall data
    from a nearby small weather station. In irrigation systems using soil moisture
    sensors, sensors buried in tree grass provide precise measurements of the soil''s
    moisture content. In order to irrigate the field with this sort of irrigation,
    precise humidity and air temperature measurements, weather monitoring, and cropping
    patterns are all necessary with AI. Sprinkler actuators and data are delivered
    to the cloud together [35]. The data from the soil moisture sensor determine the
    irrigation schedule for each farm area. Maximum crop growth and 100% water utilisation
    efficiency are guaranteed by micro level analysis, scheduling, and effective actuation
    [36]. From a mobile application built for smart phones, farmers can monitor and
    may control the irrigation system. This irrigation system is based on information
    collected from field-installed temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and ultrasonic
    sensors [37]. Farmers can execute actuation by turning on the irrigation pumps
    to water the farm using a user-friendly mobile application that is built for smart
    phones and connected to the cloud for analysis. 4.7 Plant growth monitoring The
    key step after selecting a crop is crop cultivation. Modern technology is available
    to farmers and sensors installed in the field monitor plant growth. For instance,
    ultrasonic sensors. For instance, to track the presence of insects and pests that
    hinder plant growth, ultrasonic sensors are deployed in the field. When pests
    are found, high frequency sound waves are produced to eliminate them, and the
    farmer is also made aware of their presence for additional assistance [31]. 5
    Methodology and implementation Applied Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
    Machine intelligence that resembles human intelligence is known as artificial
    intelligence. Many industries, including e-commerce and marketing [38], human
    resources [39], computer vision [40], multimedia forensics [41, 42], healthcare
    [43], social media [44, 45], gaming [46, 47] and agriculture have showed great
    potential as a result of advancements in AI and ML. In agriculture, artificial
    intelligence (AI) is used to improve productivity, crop yield, and profitability
    as well as to track livestock, monitor the weather, optimise supply chains, manage
    irrigation systems, manage pesticide and fertiliser use, and control weeds. Researchers
    are using fuzzy logic, other AI/ML techniques like classification and logistic
    regression, as well as Neuro-Fuzzy logic, to improve agricultural decision-making,
    predictive analytics, and mobile expert systems [48]. Real-time monitoring of
    the environment in agricultural areas is made possible by integrating sensors
    with a microcontroller unit. The system can identify the presence of pests or
    unusual variables linked to pest attacks by deploying sensors like temperature,
    humidity and pest-specific sensors. Early identification is made possible by this
    allowing farmers to act right away and minimise any crop damage. The system may
    analyse sensor data and detect certain pest species or patterns linked to pest
    infestations by incorporating AI algorithms. The accuracy of pest identification
    can be increased over time by using AI models that have been taught to detect
    pests. The manual effort needed for pest monitoring is decreased thanks to this
    automated identification procedure which also provides prompt and precise detection.
    By utilizing LoRa the system can transmit data even in areas with poor or no network
    coverage. This is particularly valuable in rural or remote agricultural locations
    where traditional network connectivity may be limited. The agricultural system
    can transmit pest detection data via LoRa to a central server or cloud platform.
    Using LoRa technology alerts can be sent to the farmer’s mobile device as soon
    as the system detects and identifies a pest attack. These notices may contain
    details on the individual pest the intensity of the attack and suggested pest
    control measures. This makes it possible for farmers to act quickly and protect
    their crops no matter where they are. Farmers can keep informed and make informed
    decisions wherever they are thanks to remote accessibility via mobile alerts.
    According to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, pests lose between 30
    and 35 percent of India''s annual agricultural yield. By applying cutting edge
    AI solutions to this issue there is a tremendous possibility to raise our yield.
    Early pest detection allows for the use of appropriate and less-excessive pesticides
    to protect the crop, increasing crop output. Three steps make up the Process Flow
    module: Data gathering, Keras-RetinaNet-based pest detection and Pest attack density
    detection as shown in Fig. 4 Fig. 4 AI process flow for pest detection Full size
    image 5.1 Training the model We utilised a Keras-RetinaNet model to identify pest
    photos because deep learning for visual identification is becoming increasingly
    successful. Keras-RetinaNet With ResNet + FPN as the backbone for feature extraction
    and two task-specific subnetworks for classification and bounding box regression,
    Keras-RetinaNet, developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR), achieves state-of-the-art
    performance and outperforms Faster RCNN, the well-known two-stage detector [49].
    Recent studies have shown that adopting pre-trained networks and applying them
    to other datasets significantly improves performance compared to developing new
    models from scratch. This was made possible by the models’ capacity to discover
    general features applicable to a variety of computer vision tasks. On the COCO
    dataset, we used a pre-trained model with a ResNet50 backbone, and we trained
    it using our own data. To train our model, we utilised the weights “resnet50_coco_best_v2.1.0.h5”.
    We have tested a number of models throughout the course of this project and updated
    them as we discovered models that performed better. 5.2 Features Pest Detection:
    Detects pests through Keras-RetinaNet object detection model. (As explained above)
    Pest affect Density: The amount of pests found in each image is counted by the
    model. It serves as a criterion to determine how much damage has already been
    done and provides an estimate of how many pests are present on a leaf. The sensors
    and AI will begin to function according to the power supply given to the Arduino
    board in the proposed approach. A soil moisture sensor coupled to a microcontroller
    unit delivers the corresponding readings on a periodic basis, and the DHT11 sensor
    detects the temperature and humidity in the crop roots on the other end. An air
    index sensor is also used to determine the air index. The microcontroller unit''s
    primary goal is to get the data values sent by the sensors and ESP32, which was
    configured to save the data in the cloud. These values are shown on the LCD screen
    by the data that is delivered to the microcontroller. For timely irrigation, which
    supplies the necessary amount of water to the receptive crops according to the
    stages, a Direct Current (DC) Pump and a Microcontroller are employed. If the
    Arduino is turned on and all the sensors are controlled by Arduino, then all of
    the aforementioned sensors will start working at once. The Raspberry PI, AI, and
    camera that are housed in the other portion of the gadget are utilised to detect
    both pest and disease attacks. The farmer is informed if the camera detects the
    insect attack. We also offer a fertiliser calculator to help you determine how
    much fertiliser is necessary for each crop in order to control insect attacks.
    Therefore, farmers may apply the proper amount of fertilisers to the crops using
    our fertiliser calculator. We now offer a mobile application that allows you to
    examine real-time farm data in addition to the fertiliser calculator feature.
    Our mobile application pulls data from the cloud and displays it in accordance
    with what farmers are asking for. Micro climate analysis, harnessed through AI
    algorithms, offers a data-driven approach to optimize crop selection. Through
    continuous monitoring of temperature, air quality index, and humidity, AI employs
    decision trees algorithm to correlate environmental variables with crop preferences.
    For instance, decision trees analyze historical and real-time data to identify
    temperature thresholds where specific crops flourish, ensuring ideal growing conditions.
    Air quality insights guide choices, as AI recognizes crops resilient to pollutants
    or sensitive to air composition changes. Humidity data guides water-intensive
    crop selection in suitable conditions. Additionally, AI can perform clustering
    analysis, grouping areas with similar micro climates, enabling regional-specific
    crop recommendations. AI''s adaptive learning capabilities fine-tune crop recommendations
    over time, enhancing accuracy with each season’s data. 5.3 Implementing a fertilizer
    calculator with AI involves several steps 1. Collect data on crop types, soil
    characteristics, growth stages, and historical pest incidents. 2. Apply regression
    algorithms to analyze this data, correlating nutrient levels with pest occurrences.
    3. Train the AI model using historical data to predict optimal nutrient requirements
    based on crop and soil conditions. Incorporate real-time data such as weather
    forecasts and pest population trends to dynamically adjust recommendations. 4.
    Create a user-friendly Mobile App interface where farmers input crop details and
    receive AI-generated fertiliser suggestions. Integrate data from IoT devices and
    sensors for accurate, up-to-date information. 5. Regularly update and refine the
    AI model with new data to improve accuracy. 6 Results Framework of proposed work
    is variety of environmental factors including temperature, humidity, soil moisture
    and nutrient is defined. Next, select and fabricate the necessary hardware components,
    including sensors and IoT devices. Then, set up data collection and management,
    ensuring secure storage and preprocessing. Develop AI models for real-time analysis
    and visualization of data, enabling actionable insights for farmers. According
    to the suggested algorithm as depicted in Fig. 2, the sensors will start operating
    in accordance with the power supply provided to the Arduino board. The microcontroller
    unit and the soil moisture sensor are both interfaced, and the microcontroller
    unit periodically receives the corresponding readings from the soil moisture sensor.
    Along with the temperature and humidity of the microenvironment detected by the
    temperature sensor, the air index is also monitored using an air index sensor
    and NDVI time series data from MODIS Satellite for adapting the new cropping pattern.
    The main objective of the microcontroller unit is to receive the data values transmitted
    by the sensors and the LoRa transmitter, which is set up to save the data in the
    cloud. The microcontroller receives the data from the LoRa receiver and displays
    the information in the LCD screen. For timely irrigation, which supplies the necessary
    amount of water to the receptive crops according to the stages, a DC Pump and
    a Microcontroller are employed. If the Arduino is turned on and all the sensors
    are controlled by Arduino, then all of the aforementioned sensors will start working
    at once. The Raspberry PI, AI and camera that are located in the other portion
    of the gadget are utilised to detect both insect and disease attacks. The farmer
    is informed if the camera detects the insect attack. We also offer a fertiliser
    calculator to help you determine how much fertiliser is necessary for each crop
    in order to control pest attacks. So, according to our fertilizer calculator farmers
    can feed the correct quantity of fertilizers to the crops. Along with fertilizer
    calculator facility we also provide Mobile Application to view the live data of
    the farm. Our mobile application retrieves data from the cloud and shows it in
    accordance with what farmers are asking for (multilingual). Google Firebase, where
    the database is located and the web server is hosted on Apache Web Server, receives
    the data. Figures 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 display the entire prototype output
    screenshot of Mobile Application. Fig. 5 Output of micro climate analysis humidity

    7 Conclusion Technology advancements and the meteoric expansion of ICT have transformed
    traditional agriculture into a smart, intelligent, automated agriculture. Smart
    agriculture reduces its carbon footprint by implementing sustainable, green farming,
    limiting the use of pesticides and fertilisers, and increasing the use of natural
    resources. As was already said, smart agriculture has various challenges. To get
    around these challenges, both new and old technologies must be used. In this work,
    cloud-based AI models for smart agriculture are used. The use of advanced microcontrollers
    in hardware has expedited the shift in computing paradigm. Giving IoT devices
    intelligence is the most recent development. LoRa technology enables network accessibility.
    If the sensor data exceeds a predetermined threshold value, the microcontroller
    unit continuously examines the sensor data using AI and sends an alarm SMS to
    the mobile phone of an owner who is in a faraway place. The relevant data obtained
    from measuring the DHT11 sensor''s varied readings in a range of climatic conditions
    are used to determine the threshold value. By employing WSN nodes like LoRa for
    data transmission and database systems for local data storage, this system can
    be improved. Technology advancements and the meteoric emergence of AI have transformed
    traditional agriculture into a smart, intelligent, automated agriculture. Smart
    agriculture reduces its carbon footprint by implementing sustainable, green farming,
    limiting the use of pesticides and fertilisers, and increasing the use of natural
    resources. The agricultural industry will soon include Agriculture 5.0 [48]. By
    doing this, the system''s sustainability will be preserved as yields rise. Both
    industrialised and developing countries will follow a similar trend. From an economic
    and environmental standpoint, humanity will embrace efficient food production
    and delivery more than ever [50]. Future work of the work should prioritize sensor
    technology advancements, enhancing AI models for precision agriculture, optimizing
    energy efficiency, expanding user-friendly interfaces, promoting scalability and
    cost-efficiency. These efforts will contribute to more accurate data collection,
    better decision-making for farmers, sustainable IoT implementations, improved
    accessibility, and wider adoption of this technology, ultimately fostering increased
    agricultural productivity and sustainability. References World Health Organization

  description: 'Background: The industrial wireless automation system enables the
    monitoring and control of processes. It may be difficult to recharge the battery
    of sensors installed in harmful environments. Hence optimization of the power
    is the major issue to be addressed while implementing the network. The proposed
    hybrid data transmission approaches optimize data accuracy and energy efficiency
    of a wireless sensor node deployed in any industry. Methods: In the time-driven
    method, the sensor nodes periodically sense the environment and transmit the data
    continuously over time. In the event-driven method, the sensor nodes transmit
    data only when there is a drastic change in the occurrence of a certain event.
    Results: Based on the nature of the process, applications are classified as, less
    critical, critical and most critical. The time-driven based hybrid transmission
    approach is suggested for the most critical applications because they need to
    be monitored continuously so as to attain data accuracy. In the case of critical
    applications, the data is not required to be sent continuously, but instead it
    can be sampled and transmitted once in two seconds. Though the above suggested
    methods intended to provide better outcomes in terms of power utilization, in

    system enables the monitoring and control of processes. It may be difficult to
    recharge the battery of sensors installed in harmful environments. Hence optimization
    of the power is the major issue to be addressed while implementing the network.
    The proposed hybrid data transmission approaches optimize data accuracy and energy
    efficiency of a wireless sensor node deployed in any industry. Methods: In the
    time-driven method, the sensor nodes periodically sense the environment and transmit
    the data continuously over time. In the event-driven method, the sensor nodes
    transmit data only when there is a drastic change in the occurrence of a certain
    event. Results: Based on the nature of the process, applications are classified
    as, less critical, critical and most critical. The time-driven based hybrid transmission
    approach is suggested for the most critical applications because they need to
    be monitored continuously so as to attain data accuracy. In the case of critical
    applications, the data is not required to be sent continuously, but instead it
    can be sampled and transmitted once in two seconds. Though the above suggested
    methods intended to provide better outcomes in terms of power utilization, in
    the case of process control applications, most critical and critical applications
    need to be monitored continuously. Hence such applications could be done as a
    heterogeneous industrial automation network, which is the combination of wired
    and wireless connectivity. This can be implemented by replacing all the signal
    cables with wireless communication system, regular power supply must be provided
    for the radio module attached with final control elements and also to the transmitters
    involved in most critical applications. For the least critical applications, the

    may be used, and in the case of a less critical process, the duty-cycling based
    hybrid transmission approach could be selected. By selecting appropriate transmission
    approach the life time of IWAS could be improved. Keywords: Controllers, process

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be used in
    agriculture to provide farmers with a large amount of information. Precision agriculture
    (PA) is a management strategy that employs information technology to improve quality
    and production. Utilizing wireless sensor technologies and management tools can
    lead to a highly effective, green agriculture. Based on PA management, the same
    routine to a crop regardless of site environments can be avoided. From several
    perspectives, field management can improve PA, including the provision of adequate

    in agriculture research as well as classifies and compares various wireless communication
    protocols, the taxonomy of energy-efficient and energy harvesting techniques for
    WSNs that can be used in agricultural monitoring systems, and comparison between
    early research works on agriculture-based WSNs. The challenges and limitations
    of WSNs in the agricultural domain are explored, and several power reduction and
    agricultural management techniques for long-term monitoring are highlighted. These
    approaches may also increase the number of opportunities for processing Internet
    of Things (IoT) data. Keywords: energy-efficient; energy harvesting; precision
    agriculture; wireless communication technology; WSN 1. Introduction Wireless sensor
    network (WSN) technologies have rapidly developed over the years. Ecological phenomena
    in a vast area can be monitored using pervasive devices called motes or sensor
    nodes. Battery-powered WSNs comprise several sensors, processors, and radio frequency
    (RF) modules. The sensor nodes or motes can communicate wirelessly through a communication
    link and forward their data to a base station or coordinator node by communicating
    with a gateway. The communication among sensor nodes depends on the merging of
    diverse sensors from simple (i.e., humidity, pressure, and temperature) to complex
    (i.e., localization, tracking, micro-radars, and images), thereby allowing WSNs
    to monitor a wide range of surroundings to obtain precise information from the
    field [1]. Accordingly, the sensing, storage, processing, and communication capabilities
    of sensor nodes have continuously increased [2]. WSNs have been used in different
    applications, such as military, agriculture, sports, medicine, and industry. Agriculture
    can be considered as one of the most favorable facilities for WSNs to improve
    food crop yields and minimize the burden of farmers [3]. Several projects have
    been introduced in the precision agriculture (PA) literature. PA aims to prevent
    the application of the same management routine to a crop regardless of site circumstances
    and to improve field management from several perspectives. For instance, PA can
    minimize the wastage of pesticides for the effective control of weeds, pests,
    and diseases as well as guarantee that crops receive an adequate amount of nutrients,
    thereby leading to a highly effective, green agriculture. Specifically, PA is
    a management strategy that employs information technology to improve agricultural
    quality and production. PA differs for traditional farming in the sense that this
    process accurately identifies variations and relates the spatial data to management
    activities. PA involves five stages, namely, (i) data collection, (ii) diagnosis,
    (iii) data analysis, (iv) precision field operation, and (v) evaluation [4]. WSNs
    are used as cost-effective processes to increase agricultural yield. Accordingly,
    WSNs have been used in different agricultural applications, such as for monitoring
    climate and using soil nutrient data to forecast the health of crops and the quality
    of agricultural products. Irrigation planning can be predicted using WSNs by observing
    weather conditions (such as temperature and humidity) and soil moisture. Other
    sensor nodes can be added to the existing WSN to improve the parameters of the
    agricultural monitoring system and to make the network scalable. However, some
    challenges have hindered the agricultural application of WSNs, such as determining
    optimum deployment schemes, measurement periods, routing protocols, energy efficiency,
    cost, communication range, scalability, and fault tolerance [5]. For example,
    the scattered deployment of sensor nodes with a long data-gathering period can
    help extend the network lifetime. However, some factors may challenge the selection
    of the distribution region. When the agricultural field faces many obstacles,
    the communication link may be weakened or lost as a result of signal attenuation.
    The sensor nodes in WSNs are supplied from the battery, thereby preventing connections
    to the main supply in the deployment location. Reducing power depletion and prolonging
    battery life are imperative for WSNs considering their limited battery power.
    Although the application of WSNs has increased constantly over the years, the
    manufacturing of batteries has not developed at the same rate [6]. Therefore,
    WSNs are mainly limited by their batteries [7]. Among the aforementioned challenges,
    this paper focuses on energy management and highlights energy-efficient and energy
    harvesting techniques that can be used in agriculture. To fulfill PA requirements,
    such as addressing the problems resulting from the long distance between farms
    and base stations, a mobile data connection service can be established by connecting
    unmanned aerial vehicles or drones with the base station [4]. Such connection
    allows the sensor nodes to relay their data to the base station within the wide
    area of the farm field. However, this solution is limited by the quality of service
    of WSNs. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: (i) The
    potential of using wireless communications protocols or technologies in agriculture
    was investigated, and the technology with the best power consumption and communication
    distance was identified. (ii) The taxonomy of energy-efficient and energy harvesting
    techniques was examined to address the power consumption problems in agriculture
    and to identify those methods that are most suitable for solving these problems.
    (iii) The existing solutions, applicability, and limitations of applying WSNs
    in agriculture were reviewed and compared. (iv) Recent studies using WSN in PA
    applications based on Internet of Things (IoT) were surveyed and compared in terms
    of type of sensors and actuators, IoT end devices, IoT platforms, and IoT application
    layer. 2. Wireless Communication Technologies for Agriculture This section presents
    the different wireless protocols and standards that are used in agriculture. These
    wireless technologies are also compared to identify the most convenient technology
    in terms of power consumption and communication range, where the two metrics are
    posed challenges in current solution of agriculture application [5,8]. IoT is
    a revolution for the future realm where everything that can utilize a connection
    will be connected. Cellular technologies are grown and developed to play a crucial
    role in the IoT realm [9]. Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) is a new IoT system constructed
    from current Long Term Evolution (LTE) functionalities. Subsequently, NB-IoT is
    possible to share the spectrum of LTE without coexistence problems and to utilize
    the same pieces of equipment, as well as it is possible to connect seamlessly
    into the LTE main network. This permits all network facilities such as security,
    tracking, policy, charging, and authentication to be totally supported [10]. The
    design goals of NB-IoT cover high coverage area, extended battery life (i.e.,
    10 years), high network size (52,000 devices/channel/cell), and low-cost devices
    [10,11]. However, in the near future, NB-IoT technologies, such as Long Range
    radio (LoRa) will take place in agricultural applications due to low power consumption
    and preferably used when the agricultural information are to be transmitted over
    long distances. 2.1. ZigBee Wireless Protocol ZigBee wireless protocol is considered
    one of the best candidate technologies for the agriculture and farming domains.
    Given its low duty cycle, ZigBee is considered appropriate for PA applications,
    such as irrigation supervision [12], water quality management, and fertilizer
    and pesticide control, all of which require a cyclic information update. Based
    on this technology, the sensor nodes in the agricultural field can communicate
    with the router or coordinator node over a long range (i.e., 100 m) when XBee
    Series 2 is used. ZigBee can also reduce the communication distance by up to 30
    m for indoor conditions (i.e., greenhouses) [13]. The number of deployed sensor
    and router nodes will be increased to cover the entire field area under surveillance.
    Some studies have employed Zigbee for PA. For instance, ZigBee was used to investigate
    the effect of signal strength on node spacing, base station antenna height, and
    leaf density [14]. In [14], three experiments were conducted in palm orchards
    in to evaluate a signal propagation model based on the received signal strength
    indicator (RSSI) of the ZigBee wireless protocol. Through their experiments, the
    authors concluded that the wireless channel propagation model must be determined
    before deploying the sensor nodes in palm orchards to obtain robust signal strength
    characteristics. A path loss model in a mango greenhouse was investigated based
    on the ZigBee wireless protocol [15]. A cattle-localization-system-based ZigBee
    WSN was also applied in a grazing field [16]. Instead of requiring additional
    hardware, ZigBee relies on link quality indication (LQI) to measure distance.
    The ZigBee protocol achieves cattle localization at a low power consumption and
    minimum cost. The key parameters of greenhouse climate (i.e., humidity, temperature,
    CO2, and solar radiation) are considered in [17] to ensure the comfortable growth
    of plants with 22% energy savings and 33% water usage. ZigBee and Global System
    for Mobile communication/General Packet Radio Service (GSM/GPRS) technologies
    were used to monitor and control the climate condition of greenhouses [17]. The
    ZigBee wireless protocol has also been used to monitor animal behavior (e.g.,
    walking, grazing, lying down, and standing) [18]. ZigBee was also adopted in [18]
    to overcome the high power consumption and unreliability issues in mobile ad hoc
    WSNs. A WSN-based greenhouse that uses ZigBee star topology is merged with artificial
    intelligence (i.e., fuzzy logic controller) in [19]. The ZigBee wireless protocol
    is adopted to preserve energy by switching between active and sleep states. Thus,
    power consumption can be minimized, and the battery lifetime of sensor nodes can
    be extended. ZigBee is currently applied in smart beehives [20], orange orchards
    [21], dairy healthcare monitoring of cows in pastures and barns [22], automation
    in irrigation [23], greenhouse monitoring systems [24,25], and livestock monitoring
    [26]. As a universal standard for WSNs, the ZigBee protocol was used in several
    agricultural applications because of its low power consumption, low cost, self-forming
    characteristics, and suitable communication range. 2.2. Bluetooth (BT) Wireless
    Protocol The BT standard has been utilized to establish a communication link between
    movable and portable devices, such as laptops, over a short distance of up to
    10 m. Given its pervasive nature and availability in most mobile devices, BT has
    been employed to satisfy multi-level agricultural requirements [5]. Weather information,
    soil moisture, sprinkler position, and temperature are monitored remotely using
    Global Positioning System (GPS) and BT technologies. The proposed system in [27]
    was developed for irrigation application to increase field productivity and conserve
    water. The irrigation application proposed in [28] collects field information
    in real time via the BT wireless communication protocol. Several software and
    hardware were developed in [29] to monitor the relative humidity and temperature
    in greenhouses based on BT. The BT module was employed in integrated control method
    [30] to control the irrigation system in greenhouses based on soil and weather
    information, and this technology improved the leaf number, height, dry weight,
    and fresh weight of red and romaine lettuce in greenhouses. Result of estimation
    for water usage and electricity also improved by 90% based on integrated control
    method using BT technology relative to the traditional method (i.e., timer control
    strategy). Given its low energy consumption, wide availability, and ease of use
    for farmers, smartphone-based BT has been employed in different agricultural applications
    [31,32,33,34,35], such as controlling irrigation systems, monitoring soil and
    weather conditions, and controlling the use of fertilizers and pesticides. 2.3.
    WiFi Wireless Protocol WiFi is currently the most extensively utilized wireless
    technology available in portable devices, including tablets, smartphones, laptops,
    and desktops. WiFi has a suitable communication distance of about 20 m and 100
    m in indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. In PA applications, WiFi extends
    diverse architectures by connecting several types of devices via an ad hoc network.
    WiFi and 3G wireless technologies were employed in [36] to estimate the agricultural
    applications of mobile phones. Remote access and short message services have also
    been used for controlling and monitoring protected crops. In [37], agricultural
    data, such as soil temperature, soil moisture, weather temperature and humidity,
    sunlight intensity, and CO2, were stored in a gateway before they were transmitted
    to the server computer over a WiFi network. A Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11g)-based smart
    WSN is proposed for agricultural monitoring in [38]. The proposed system consists
    of three nodes: sensor, router, and server. The climate conditions of the greenhouse
    or agricultural field, such as humidity, temperature, air pressure, light, water
    level, and soil moisture, are monitored. The said work attempts to lower cost,
    minimize wiring connections, and enhance the mobility and flexibility of the sensing
    points in WSN. However, the energy consumption of the proposed system is extremely
    high at 42.17 J/h. Given that WiFi requires much power [5], long communication
    time, and huge data payload [26]. WiFi technology is not preferable for agricultural
    applications in spite of the fact that a Wi-Fi server prevents data losses by
    adopting data redundancy techniques. In addition, WiFi cannot be employed for
    multi-hope applications and influenced by number of users and the signal intensity;
    thereby, it is inappropriate for agriculture WSNs. Moreover, the WiFi nodes listen
    all the time, so power consumption will increase [39]. 2.4. GPRS/3G/4G Technology
    General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet data service for GSM-based cellular
    phones. GPRS frequently experiences variable delays and throughputs, and such
    technology depends on the volume of consumers that share the same communication
    channels and resources. Gutiérrez et al. [40] used the GPRS module and WSN to
    develop an automatic crop irrigation system based on the information collected
    by temperature and soil moisture sensors installed at the root zone of plants,
    and considered this system a cost-effective and practical solution for improving
    water quality in PA. A drip irrigation process was evaluated in [41] by measuring
    soil moisture. A prototype system was also developed based on a data management
    server and a WSN-GPRS gateway. WSN-GPRS gateway acts as a bridge between WSN and
    GPRS where the data from the WSN are transferred to a data management center.
    Navarro-Hellín et al. [42] equipped various wireless nodes with GPRS to measure
    and transmit soil, plant, and atmosphere information. The wireless nodes have
    unlimited autonomy because of their independent nature and use of solar energy.
    Different sensors may transmit information to a remote location via a GPRS network
    for further analysis by using tablets, mobile phones, or computers. All agriculture
    sensors are interfaced to the sensor board to obtain agricultural information.
    Such information is transmitted to the remote server for further analysis through
    the GPRS-board, which depends on a GSM/GPRS mobile network. 2.5. Long Range Radio
    (LoRa) Protocol LoRa is introduced by the LoRa Alliance as a protocol stack for
    low power and wide area Internet of Things (IoT) communication technologies that
    are associated with indoor transmission [43]. The basic network architecture of
    a LoRaWAN consists of LoRa end devices, LoRa gateways, and a LoRa network server.
    The LoRa end device communicates with gateways that employ LoRa with LoRaWAN.
    LoRa gateways pass raw LoRaWAN packets from the end devices to a LoRa network
    server with a high throughput based on the backhaul interface, which is typically
    3G or Ethernet. Accordingly, LoRa gateways act as a bidirectional communication
    or protocol adapter with the LoRa network server. In this case, the LoRa network
    server takes charge of decoding the data packets transmitted by the LoRa devices
    and creating the frames that would be directed back to the devices. LoRa offers
    a bidirectional solution that matches machine-to-machine (M2M) WiFi or cellular
    technologies. LoRa presents a cost-effective method for linking batteries or mobile
    devices to the network or to end devices. The LoRa wireless protocol was used
    in [44] to monitor bee colonies in rural areas and to ensure a communication between
    the bee node and the local server that is located in a remote location. The soil
    moisture and temperature, air temperature and humidity, and light intensity inside
    greenhouses were also monitored using different sensors, microcontrollers, and
    the LoRa wireless protocol [8]. The LoRa gateway collects data from LoRa nodes
    to construct the topology of a star network, and may communicate with a cloud
    server over a long communication range and with high scalability. LoRa was recently
    utilized in several agriculture research projects developed by the Libelium Company
    (Zaragoza, Spain) [45], such as improving kiwi production based on a smart irrigation
    system (Italy), monitoring of green areas by using a smart garden system (Spain),
    improving fertilization methods of corn yields (Italy), improving production of
    banana yields (Colombia), increasing tobacco crops by controlling the climate
    condition (Italy), saving water through a smart irrigation system (Barcelona),
    monitoring of vineyard crops (Spain), and monitoring of diseases that affect vineyards
    (Switzerland). 2.6. SigFox Protocol SigFox is an ultra-narrowband wireless cellular
    network [43] with low data rate applications, thereby making this technology appropriate
    for IoT and machine-type communications systems. SigFox has been used in different
    applications, including telephone, security, mobile, broadband, and television.
    The SigFox network was used in [46,47] to construct a geolocation system that
    localizes animals in mountain pastures throughout the summer. A system was proposed
    in [46] to help farmers locate their cattle and enhance their production. The
    importance of power consumption analyses was highlighted in [47], especially when
    the cattle are located in high mountainous areas. 2.7. Performance Comparison
    of Wireless Communication Protocols Table 1 compares the aforementioned wireless
    communication protocols or technologies relative to different parameters, including
    power consumption, communication range, data rate, cost, system complexity, and
    other parameters. The challenges in agricultural applications may be developed
    from the selection of the deployment range. For instance, the transmitted signal
    by the sensor node is attenuated when the agriculture field is separated by obstacles.
    Power consumption is considered as another limitation in the WSN design in agricultural
    applications [5]. The ZigBee wireless protocol was designed to run with a suitable
    communication range and low power consumption. LoRa and SigFox are considered
    to work with low power consumption and long radio range. Accordingly, the power
    consumption and communication distance of the above technologies have been assessed
    as follows. Table 1. Different wireless communication technologies. Zigbee and
    Bluetooth low energy (BLE) are designed for battery-powered devices. These technologies
    conserve power through low duty cycling and enter sleep mode to extend the battery
    lifetime. Classic BT, WiFi, GPRS, LoRa, and SigFox have a higher power consumption
    than ZigBee. Although ZigBee has a shorter communication range than LoRa, SigFox,
    and GPRS, this range may be extended with a router node to overcome the node deployment
    limitations in agricultural applications. BLE outperforms ZigBee in terms of power
    consumption, but this wireless protocol is limited in agricultural applications
    because of its short communication distance of 10 m, as reported in [48]. ZigBee
    also has a higher network elasticity than BT, thereby permitting various topologies.
    Given the large number of nodes (more than 65,000) in the ZigBee network, the
    ZigBee technology can be used to cover a wide agricultural. Accordingly, the ZigBee
    wireless protocol has been adopted in many agriculture studies [5,49,50,51,52,53].
    One of these studies [5] prefers to utilize ZigBee in farming domains and agricultural
    applications owing to its energy-efficient, reliable, and low-cost wireless protocol.
    The LoRa wireless protocol covers a large communication area with low power consumption.
    Therefore, it can be suitably deployed in vast agricultural fields. The network
    size of the LoRa protocol is limited by its duty cycle, where a 1% duty cycle
    can lead to a maximum communication time of 36 s per hour for each end device
    [54]. In addition, LoRa gateways have a limited message capacity of less than
    100 messages per minute because of the unplanned deployment of LoRa gateways in
    urban areas, thereby interfering with low power wireless area networks, such as
    SigFox. Therefore, increasing the number of gateways can challenge the infrastructure
    of the LoRa network [54]. Moreover, the LoRa technology is complex and has sizable
    hardware implementations [55]. SigFox has an extremely low data rate (100 bps)
    and slow transmission time (10 s for 10 bytes) compared with ZigBee and LoRa [56].
    SigFox supports star topology supervised by a centralized sever that manages connectivity
    between devices and the base stations, whereas the LoRa supports wide area network
    based on star-to-star topology creating a bridge of LoRa gateways. Given that
    data rate and transmission time are both critical issue in any communication system,
    SigFox cannot be widely used for agricultural applications. Moreover, this technology
    does not support the collision avoidance scheme, thereby affecting the network
    because several M2M devices may be operated in the same area. Moreover, SigFox
    has a limited reliability because of its one-way communication (without an acknowledgment
    signal) and low received power. However, both the LoRa and SigFox infrastructures
    are still in progress. Ali et al. further discuss the limitations of these protocols
    [56]. From the above discussion and the comparison results presented in Table
    1 and Figure 1 and as will be shown in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table
    6, Table 7 and Table 8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been identified
    as the most suitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications because
    of their low power consumption, communication range (acceptable for ZigBee and
    long for LoRa), small size, easy network implementation, simplicity, low latency
    (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size. Figure 1. Different wireless technologies

    applications based on IoT. PA using sensors, actuator, processor, wireless transceiver,
    and other information technologies, potentially permits manufacturers to computerize
    site-specific management for automated agriculture. In terms of precision, the
    considered wireless protocols for agricultural applications have improved the
    agriculture domain. Precision irrigation is frequently regarded as optimizing
    irrigation accuracy due to its ability to control the optimum amount of water
    and irrigation time. The water savings of 90% (based on ZigBee), 33% (based on
    ZigBee), 50% (based on Bluetooth), and 90% (based on Bluetooth) were achieved
    for precision irrigation systems relative to traditional irrigation systems in
    research [17,28,30,40], respectively. Animal behavior, such as laying down, standing,
    grazing, walking, and other modes, was monitored in [18] using ZigBee wireless
    protocol. The authors found that laying down and grazing could be improved by
    83.5% compared with the findings from similar studies. In another study that has
    adopted a proposed algorithm that depended on the ZigBee wireless protocol [20],
    an accuracy rate of 95.4% was expected for the proposed algorithm to monitor the
    honey bee and the agricultural and environmental aspects. In [23], the automation
    of the irrigation system based on ZigBee saved the system cost between 1.24% and
    6.72% relative to the entire cost of the water user associations, with energy
    savings of 2.05 to 8.21% and water savings of 0.71 to 6.46%. The proposed model
    in [35] utilized a smartphone platform (based on Bluetooth and GSM technologies)
    and permitted three types of irrigation systems. The efficiency factors were improved
    by 90% for subsurface drip type and 85% and 75% for high- and low-pressure overhead
    sprinkler types, respectively, to compute for drift and evaporation before the
    water droplets approached the soil. 3G technology was adopted by Libelium based
    on Waspmote wireless sensor devices to monitor the vineyards in Northwest Spain
    [57]. Phytosanitary treatments, such as fungicides and fertilizers, were minimized
    by 20% and growing yields were enhanced by 15% based on PA. In [8], LoRa wireless
    protocol was considered to monitor the agriculture environments with 90% power
    efficiency. The cost of pumping and water for precision irrigation system in green
    areas was reduced by 30% based on SigFox wireless protocol [58]. The preceding
    survey for different agricultural applications revealed that PA can be achieved
    in terms of water savings, animal behavior, accuracy, power efficiency, and reducing
    system cost for various wireless protocols. Consequently, agriculture can be improved
    based on agricultural automation systems compared with traditional agriculture
    systems. 3. Agriculture-Based Energy-Efficient Schemes in Literature The solution
    to the power consumption problem in the agriculture domain using WSNs has been
    highlighted in several studies. Previous studies focused on reducing the power
    consumption of sensor nodes in WSNs by proposing energy-efficient schemes. This
    study reviews the existing energy-efficient schemes in WSNs as shown in Figure
    2. This review classifies the energy-efficient schemes in agriculture application
    into two categories, namely, power reduction and energy-harvesting techniques.
    These techniques can also be classified into subcategories to explore the power
    consumption problem of agriculture WSNs. Most of these techniques can be employed
    in agricultural applications, which are highlighted in the following subsections.
    Figure 2. Energy-efficient schemes in agriculture based on wireless sensor networks
    (WSNs). 3.1. Agriculture-Based Power Reduction Techniques WSNs contain numerous
    sensor nodes, which are utilized to measure ecological phenomena in real time
    and transmit information back to the master node through a wireless module. Given
    the absence of wire connections, sensor nodes are appropriate for different applications
    under strict environments. PA is one of the important applications relying on
    WSNs [67]. A sensor node is usually equipped with rechargeable batteries, which
    have limited capacity and pose a challenge to long-term application [68]. These
    batteries supply power to the sensor nodes by providing the necessary current
    to maintain each part of the sensor nodes working properly. The total power consumption
    of a sensor node is the sum of each element in the node (i.e., sensor, microcontroller
    unit, and radio module), and each component may operate at different energy states.
    Therefore, the lifespan of a sensor node is the time consumed to exhaust its batteries
    under a sustainable operation threshold. Numerous scholars have developed power
    reduction techniques to provide sensor nodes an infinite lifespan. This section
    reviews several power reduction techniques of WSNs that can be used in agricultural
    applications. The purposes, wireless protocols, findings, advantages, and limitations
    of each technique are also discussed. 3.1.1. Sleep/Wake Strategy Wireless transceivers
    consume a significant amount of power relative to processors. The energy of the
    wireless nodes is mostly dissipated during the reception and transmission processes.
    The radio of sensor nodes can enter sleep mode via the sleep/wake strategy to
    reduce the power consumption of the RF components of WSNs. No data communication
    occurs during the sleep mode. The sensor nodes wake up to collect and transmit
    data within a certain period and then return to sleep mode to conserve energy.
    In agricultural applications, the sleep/wake strategy is implemented via (i) duty
    cycling, (ii) medium-access control (MAC) protocols, and (iii) topology control.
    Duty cycle is proposed in several studies to lower the power consumption for different
    agricultural applications based on WSN. Zhang et al. [69] proposed a WSN-based
    system to monitor soil moisture and analyzed the temporal and spatial variability
    of soil moisture for variable irrigation. To reduce the power consumption of the
    soil sensor nodes, the soil moisture sensors were always in sleep mode and activated
    only when data were to be collected. Million et al. [70] designed a WSN for PA
    in Malawi and called it WiPAM. This system was intended to automate irrigation
    and implement an irrigation management system (IMS). The authors investigated
    soil moisture variability. The sensor nodes were homogeneous, and each was composed
    of a ZigBee end device (ZED) and a ZigBee coordinator (ZC). In the star topology,
    three sensors nodes were configured as ZED (in field-nodes) and one as a gateway
    node. Another node was configured as ZC for aggregating data and actuating the
    irrigation valves. The power source to sustain the operation of the network was
    solar power. This approach was complemented by an energy-efficient management
    approach. In other words, sensor nodes went to sleep when idle and woke up to
    transmit data when required. The irrigation valves opened or closed depending
    on the values stored in the coordinator node. Ouadjaout et al. [71] presented
    an energy-efficient WSN for soil moisture monitoring in an irrigation system.
    The new platform, DZ50, consists of an RFM12b transceiver and an ATmega328P microcontroller.
    This platform consumes very low power, and much energy can be saved in sleep mode,
    in which the transceiver goes inactive (sleep mode) for long periods. Comparison
    showed that the performance of DZ50 is better than that of TelosB and MicaZ. Specifically,
    the battery lifetime of DZ50 is seven times that of TelosB and MicaZ based on
    a 10 s sampling period. Monitoring of environmental conditions, such as wind direction,
    wind speed, humidity, temperature, conductivity, rain level, pH, and water level,
    in crop fields was presented in [72]. A solar cell was used to power several sensor
    nodes deployed at a distance of 500 m to 5 km. WSNs based on IEEE 802.15.4 (C1120
    transceiver) and GPRS/3G were adopted to transmit the rural environments to the
    base station. Energy was saved through low duty cycling (3.3%) for the RF transceiver;
    the saved energy is equivalent to 30 s of wake up time every 15 min. In addition,
    a 2-watt solar cell was used to supply power to the overall system, whose total
    average power consumption was 207 mW. MAC protocols were also proposed in previous
    research on agriculture WSNs [39,73,74,75,76]. Sudha et al. [39] proposed an energy-efficient
    TDMA-based algorithm for wireless sensor communications in an automatic irrigation
    system. Their experiment involved a header node that collected data directly from
    all the nodes in the field and passed these data to the base station (BS). This
    network arrangement was a star single-hop topology. These techniques attain power
    savings of 10% with a high communication distance of 1 km between the sensor node
    and the base station. However, when this distance increases, the power consumption
    also increases. López et al. [75] proposed a WSN for monitoring horticultural
    yields, which are disseminated among small plots scattered at a communication
    distance of 10 km. The air temperature and soil moisture are collected during
    a 10-week period. The authors adopted the MAC protocol and star topology to conserve
    the power consumption of the sensor nodes that used the IEEE 802.15.4 standard
    based on the CC2420 transceiver. The lifetimes of the soil moisture and air temperature
    sensor nodes are 1024 days and 222 days, respectively, utilizing a battery that
    delivers 2700 mAh. The topology protocol scheme can be used in agricultural monitoring
    WSNs to modify the network topology according to the application requirements,
    thereby reducing the number of active nodes in a network. Some nodes in the network
    can enter sleep mode to prolong the network lifetime when they are not sensing
    the same area of interest. Aneeth and Jayabarathi [77] implemented Ad hoc On-Demand
    Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols over a different
    topology of ZigBee WSN (i.e., cluster topology, random topology, star topology
    with gateway based on two cases; inside and outside) in simulation environments
    by using the OPNET software (Riverbed, San Francisco, CA, USA). Twenty soil moisture
    sensor nodes and one gateway node were distributed in a farmland with a dimension
    of 100 × 100 m2. Each node sends information about the soil moisture to the gateway
    node through the ZigBee wireless protocol. The gateway node passes the information
    to the controlling system to control the irrigation valve system. Their study
    showed that the star topology using DSR protocol reduces the power consumption
    of the WSN because it has less routing overhead compared with AODV protocol. Table
    2 shows the comparison of power reduction technique based on sleep/wake schemes
    for previous research in agricultural applications. 3.1.2. Radio Optimization
    Previous studies show that the power is mostly dissipated in the RF components
    of WSNs than in data processing units, such as microcontrollers and microprocessors
    [80]. A number of scholars have applied various radio optimization schemes or
    techniques, including (i) transmission power control (TPC), (ii) modulation scheme,
    and (iii) cognitive radio, to reduce the power consumption of the RF components
    of agriculture sensor nodes. In the TPC scheme, the sensor nodes modify the transmitted
    power to save energy, stimulate avoiding interference, and establish a communication
    link [81]. TPC can be used in the agricultural field [82,83], where the RF transmitted
    power of the sensor nodes can be modified to reduce their power consumption based
    on the measured distance between the sink node and the sensor nodes. Sahota et
    al. [82] have investigated the application of TPC in reducing the power consumption
    of the sensor nodes in precision agriculture-based WSNs. Several power levels
    and different receiver sensitivity levels are considered to perform the said process.
    The network layers and MAC protocol in a WSN (based on CC1110) for the agriculture
    domain are adopted to further lower the power consumption of the sensor node.
    Results show that the power saving that employs multiple modes of transmitted
    power can be improved by approximately 10% relative to the traditional mode. By
    contrast, Kamarudin et al. [83] prolonged the lifetime of the sensor node by more
    than 8.5% by modifying the transmitted power of the CC2420 communication device.
    A cognitive radio is an intelligent wireless communication network [84] in which
    the wireless communication channel in the spectrum band can be selected efficiently
    [85]. The transmission metrics (e.g., transmitted power, carrier frequency, and
    modulation scheme) can be adjusted accordingly. A cognitive radio requires more
    energy than conventional devices do because it includes sophisticated and complex
    functions [86]. Therefore, an energy-efficient cognitive radio network poses challenges,
    especially with regard to the use of battery energy. In wireless communication,
    the electromagnetic spectrum is fully occupied, with several bands being partially
    used or unused. This situation supports the utilization of a cognitive radio,
    in which spectrum holes can be utilized. Sabri et al. [19] fused fuzzy logic control
    (FLC) with a ZigBee wireless sensor actor network (WSAN), which can sense the
    surroundings and respond in ideal performance without interference from agricultural
    crops. FLC assists the specialists in managing complex systems more compared with
    traditional control methods, which are ineffective in terms of flexibility, energy,
    productivity, and labor interference. Two significant greenhouse environment parameters
    (i.e., humidity and temperature) are monitored during daytime and nighttime. The
    results show that the intelligent technique-based FLC can significantly improve
    the WSAN lifespan. Therefore, the WSAN can work for 14 years with a 210 mAh battery
    power based on the FLC merged with WSAN. The power consumption of networks can
    be directly affected by the modulation scheme [87]. The modulation parameters
    can be adjusted to their optimal values to preserve the minimum power consumption
    of radio modules. Anane et al. [88] investigated the Frequency-shift keying (FSK)
    and Minimum-shift keying (MSK) modulation strategies to minimize the total power
    consumption of the sensor node required to transmit given data packets. Through
    their extensive study, the authors concluded that MSK outperforms FSK in terms
    of power consumption. However, several modulation schemes cannot be used in the
    ZigBee wireless protocol that operates at 2.4 GHz because this protocol supports
    a single modulation scheme. Specifically, the ZigBee wireless protocol works with
    offset quadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK) [89]. Table 3 shows the comparison
    of power reduction technique based on radio optimization schemes for previous
    research in agricultural applications. 3.1.3. Data Mitigation Data mitigation
    presents another power consumption solution for agriculture WSNs to reduce the
    amount of data transmitted from source nodes to destination nodes. Data mitigation
    can be achieved via (i) data gathering, (ii) data comparison, (iii) data rate,
    and (iv) data-driven techniques. Data gathering can extend the lifetime of sensor
    nodes in WSNs by minimizing redundant data transmission. In different applications
    of agriculture WSNs including environment observation, the sensed data of the
    neighboring nodes may spatially be associated. In this case, data combination
    presents an important method for reducing the amount of redundant data, reducing
    the number of transmissions, and minimizing the power consumption of the nodes
    in the network [90]. Data gathering also reduces latency by minimizing data traffic
    and improving the delay between the sink and sensor nodes; after reducing the
    number of communications, this approach can improve the exploitation of bandwidth
    [91]. Data merging can be accomplished along a route starting from sensor nodes
    to sink nodes. The nodes in a route can rebroadcast only the maximum, minimum,
    or average amount of received data. The design of an energy-efficient WSN-based
    data-gathering scheme poses a significant challenge because this scheme must ensure
    a trade-off among power consumption, latency, security, data accuracy, and fault
    tolerance. Gathering data in agricultural applications, including humidity, weather,
    temperature, and soil moisture, can minimize the power consumption of environment
    sensor nodes by spatially correlating the field and redundant data of the sensor
    nodes when the temperature does not change significantly [1], especially during
    nighttime. For example, if the microcontroller of the temperature sensor node
    measures the same temperature value for extended hours, then the sensor node sends
    the temperature value every four hours to reduce power consumption. Merging the
    temperature and humidity sensors into a single sensor may also reduce the power
    consumption, size, and system complexity. Azaza et al. [17] integrated climate
    condition parameters (i.e., temperature, CO2, humidity, and illuminance sensors)
    inside a greenhouse and observed a comfortable growth of plants while saving water
    resources and energy. The greenhouse was equipped with environment control devices,
    such as ventilation system, fogging system for humidification, and electrical
    heaters. A smart system based on fuzzy logic control correlated humidity and temperature
    measurements is implemented to improve the fogging system operation. In that way,
    the power consumption of the fogging system can be significantly reduced. In addition,
    the system was improved by a wireless data observing platform (STM 32/F4 microcontroller
    and Virtex V FPGA board) for logging and data routing, which provides data access
    in real time. The suggested control system based on fuzzy logic control was experimentally
    implemented and validated. The results revealed that the total energy and water
    usage decreased by 22% and 33%, respectively. Musaazi et al. [92] introduced a
    data caching algorithm (DCAL) that optimizes the sleep/wake up periods of ZigBee
    WSNs to achieve low energy consumption and latency in PA application. In WSNs,
    data are collected from the source nodes and routed to the sink node; from the
    sink node, the data are sent to the Internet. Reducing the transmission of duplicated
    sensed data reduces the power consumption. Energy conservation is paramount during
    the communication phase to prolong the lifetime of sensor nodes. The main method
    utilized to conserve energy involves switching off the nodes’ transceiver when
    they are not transmitting nor receiving packets. Additionally, the data-gathering
    method for agriculture WSNs has been investigated in [93]. The proposed system
    includes ZigBee wireless sensor nodes, customized farming personal digital assistants
    (PDAs), and a host PC. Each sensor node contains four sensors to identify five
    agricultural field parameters: soil temperature, soil moisture, environmental
    humidity, soil electrical conductivity, and environmental temperature. The PDA
    combines the ZigBee coordinator node, GPRS module, and GPS module. The ZigBee
    WSN gathers farming data and obtains GPS information for each sensor node. It
    then passes the data to the host PC through GPRS. The experimental results show
    that the battery power of the sensor nodes can be saved based on the data-gathering
    scheme. Data compression is a useful method for deploying sensor nodes with restricted
    energy resources. Information encoding can be performed in sensor nodes, whereas
    information decoding can be performed in sink nodes. Using compression techniques
    to reduce the size of information that the sink nodes transmit over wireless channels
    may also reduce the power consumption and extend the battery life of the sensor
    nodes. One study has applied data compression approaches to reduce the power consumption
    for auto-irrigation system which based on CC1000 RF module [41]. Based on this
    method, the battery of the sensor node can be extended to 359 days. The data-driven
    power reduction technique aims to reduce the amount of sampled data by conserving
    the sensing accuracy to an appropriate level for a specified application [94].
    Thereby, the amount of data to be transmitted to the sink nodes can be minimized.
    Therefore, this technique can reduce the power consumption of agriculture WSNs
    and extend their battery life. A data-driven algorithm is considered by Lerdsuwan
    and Phunchongharn [95] to solve the energy consumption problem of the sensor node
    in PA with low complexity and maintain the transmission rate. Their experiment
    reveals that their proposed algorithm has higher energy efficiency than the ESPIN
    and SPIN algorithms in [96,97] by 36.84% and 81.53%, respectively. The data rate
    of RF transceivers can be adjusted in the physical layer of a wireless protocol
    to reduce the power consumption of the sensor node. Davis et al. [98] investigated
    the low battery condition of a sensor node to attain prolonged battery life for
    separate wireless sensor nodes that can preserve sampling suitability and reliability
    in communicating accurate data. Different sensors, such as those for soil moisture,
    sap flow, and soil water, were examined to study the effect of sensing debility
    due to low battery voltage. The comparison of the data sampling rate of these
    sensors shows that sap flow measurement is the best option for agricultural WSN.
    This finding is attributed to the low error obtained when the sampling interval
    increased to 15 min while maintaining measurement accuracy. Table 4 shows the
    comparison of power reduction technique based on data mitigation schemes for previous
    research in agricultural applications. 3.1.4. Routing Protocol Routing protocol
    introduces another power reduction scheme for agriculture WSNs to minimize the
    path between sensor nodes and sink node, thereby the power consumption of the
    WSN is reduced. Routing protocol can be performed via (i) sink mobility, (ii)
    multi-path routing, (iii) cluster architecture, and (iv) routing metric. Sink
    mobility was adopted in previous research [99,100]. Mathur et al. [99] proposed
    a novel mechanism that adopts unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to gather data from
    forest regions instead of classical sensing from nodes deployed in WSN. The proposed
    method enables the UAV to collect data from WSN in harsh terrain and transmit
    it to the base station situated far from the sensing area. Therefore, the multi-hop
    transmission between cluster heads can be completely avoided, and the communication
    range can be extended. Multi-path routing has also been suggested by other scholars
    for agriculture WSNs [67,68,101]. Recently, Nikolidakis et al. [67] proposed an
    agricultural field weather monitoring system based on the ZigBee wireless protocol.
    An advance energy-efficient routing protocol was implemented for WSN to automate
    irrigation management. The transmitter could modify its power based on the distance
    between the sensor node and base station to save energy. The results revealed
    that network lifetime increased to 1825 min. Hedley et al. [101] developed a WSN
    soil moisture mapping and monitoring method to provide information for irrigation
    scheduling. To conserve power, the sensor nodes relayed data to the BS every 15
    min through the greatest energy-efficient route. Cluster head method is considered
    by Ndzi et al. [102] to extend the ZigBee WSN lifetime for agricultural application.
    In addition, the quality of the crop yields is improved and their cost is minimized.
    The research presented WSN coverage measurements in a mixed crop farmland. An
    adaptive energy consumption model for each sensor node was proposed and used to
    compute the energy consumption in the network. A deployment model with a cluster
    head and two antennas was also proposed and simulated to alleviate short network
    lifetime due to the vegetation attenuation of signals. This network deployment
    model extended the lifetime of the network by a factor of more than 20 compared
    with a deployment where cluster heads are not used. Nikolidakis et al. [103] proposed
    a new routing protocol for WSN that can reduce the power consumption of sensor
    nodes through balanced clustering. This protocol was called “equalized cluster
    head election routing protocol” (ECHERP). ECHERP was implemented in Java language
    for 500 homogeneous nodes distributed in a 100 × 100 m2 land. The simulation results
    showed that the proposed protocol outperforms existing protocols in terms of power
    consumption. A potential application of this protocol is PA. Another type of routing
    protocol is called routing metric. Chen et al. [104] used two routing metrics,
    namely, remained energy and expected transmission count, to compute the optimal
    routing path to the sink node that ensures low power consumption. “A scalable
    context-aware objective function (SCAOF)” is proposed by combining robustness-aware,
    energy-aware, resource-aware, and reliability-aware contexts that render to the
    compound routing metrics scheme. The experiment is conducted in a garden based
    on a testbed, which includes a uIPv6 protocol stack and contiki OS. The obtained
    results prove that SCAOF can convey the desired advantages on network lifespan
    prolonging, as well as high efficiency and reliability in different hardware testbeds
    and simulation scenarios. Table 5 shows the comparison of power reduction technique
    based on routing protocol schemes for previous research in agricultural applications.
    With these power reduction techniques, we compared the power saving or battery
    lifetime, communication distance, and limitations of WSNs in different agricultural
    applications in the work of several scholars (Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table
    5 and Table 6). The tables show that most previous studies used ZigBee wireless
    protocol for different agricultural applications. The use of ZigBee supports our
    assumption that this wireless protocol is suitable for agricultural monitoring
    systems as discussed in Section 2. A combination of two or more power reduction
    schemes was also highlighted by several scholars [106,107,108] to further lower
    the power consumption of the WSN. Table 6 shows the comparison of power reduction
    technique based on a combination of power reduction schemes for previous research
    in agricultural applications. Considering that sensor nodes are power-hungry and
    battery-limited, one or more of the power reduction schemes can be integrated
    with energy harvesting techniques to prolong the operation life of sensor nodes
    significantly. The classification of energy harvesting techniques is explained
    in the following section. 3.2. Agriculture-Based Energy-Harvesting Techniques
    A major limitation of sensor nodes is their limited battery capacity. Several
    energy-efficient schemes have been introduced in previous research to solve the
    power consumption problem of sensor nodes. An alternative method that has been
    utilized to address the problem of limited node lifespan is the use of energy-harvesting
    techniques. Numerous techniques have been developed to allow sensor nodes to harvest
    different types of energy, such as solar, wireless power transfer (WPT), mechanical
    vibration, kinetic, and wind energy, from different environments [110] (Figure
    2). Compared with traditional sensor nodes, rechargeable sensor nodes can work
    continuously for a long lifetime. Ambient energy can be converted to electrical
    energy and used directly to supply the sensor nodes or can be stored and used
    later on. In agricultural applications, energy harvesting can be used to prolong
    the lifetime of sensor nodes. Energy-harvesting techniques for previous research
    works employed in precision agriculture are shown in Table 7. The said table lists
    the categories of energy-harvesting techniques, types of wireless protocols, and
    output energy/power of energy-harvesting techniques. In addition, the form of
    agricultural applications, and limitations of each article are also highlighted.
    Energy-harvesting mechanisms can be implemented with batteries for the sensor
    nodes. For example, a sensor node using solar energy to charge its batteries can
    work extensively during daytime when adequate sunlight is available. Meanwhile,
    the sensor node can use its batteries through power reduction techniques, such
    as sleep mode (i.e., duty cycle), at night when sunlight is unavailable to save
    energy. In addition, the sensor node can enter restricted sleep periods (i.e.,
    low duty cycle) and reduce transmission power when its batteries possess low residual
    energy [111]. Furthermore, adopting a maximum power point tracking system is a
    reliable battery charging technique for long-term operation. The charge–discharge
    cycle of the battery is minimized [112]. 3.2.1. Solar Energy Solar energy based
    on photovoltaic system and methods can be used in agricultural applications based
    on WSNs [113]. Therefore, solar cells provide a good solution [114] to ensure
    the survivability of the agriculture monitoring system. Solar cell energy has
    been used by several studies to provide long-term energy to sensor nodes in agriculture
    applications. Gutiérrez et al. [40] developed an irrigation system based on the
    ZigBee wireless protocol. The system was developed to improve water usage for
    agricultural crops. Temperature and soil moisture sensors in WSN were placed in
    the root of the plants to send sensor information to a web application via a gateway.
    The proposed algorithm controls the water quantity based on threshold values of
    soil moisture and temperature that are programmed in a microcontroller-based gateway.
    The WSN is powered by solar cell panels and rechargeable batteries. Water savings
    of up to 90% were achieved relative to the conventional irrigation method. Considering
    that the system is cost effective and autonomous, it can be utilized in geographically
    isolated regions where water sources are limited. Zou et al. [68] improved the
    battery lifetime of a WSN based on harvested energy (i.e., solar cell) utilizing
    shadow detection. With this strategy, sensor nodes can accordingly modify their
    scheduling to optimize their power production and remaining battery levels. Furthermore,
    data transmission is optimized through routing and clustering mechanisms. A Bayesian
    network was employed to provide warning reports of bottlenecks along the path.
    The system was deployed in real time based on the Texas Instruments CC2530 platform
    that includes the ZigBee wireless protocol. The battery (lithium type with a storage
    capacity of 2500 mAh) of the sensor node was charged from the solar cell panel
    when the harvested power was adequate. The experimental results showed that these
    techniques allow network activities to occur in a continuous and effective manner.
    In [115], a micro-irrigation system that relies on a small solar-powered cell
    was developed. The energy input, energy output, greenhouse gas productions, and
    solar cell installation for rural areas were investigated with the proposed co-located
    system. The researchers compared their system with another commonly used method
    (i.e., aloe vera cultivation) in terms of life cycle. The life cycle evaluation
    showed that the proposed system is economical for several rural areas and may
    provide opportunities for agriculture electrification and motivate economic growth.
    Roblin [116] presented an irrigation system relying on a solar cell for rural
    areas where sunlight is often available. The irrigation system includes pumps
    working on a solar cell instead of an electricity grid and/or a diesel generator.
    The study showed that the irrigation system based on a solar cell is better than
    systems that depend on other energy resources because the electricity grid is
    unavailable at all times, and the operating cost of diesel pumps is high and relies
    mainly on the diesel price. Although the solar-powered system was relatively expensive,
    it became a free source of energy after installation in the rural area and proved
    to be a worthwhile investment in the long term. A similar irrigation system was
    proposed in [117]. The system adopts photovoltaic panels to power a water pump
    that converts the continuous drift of water into a drop drift to achieve increased
    water usage efficiency. Kwon et al. [118] suggested a novel prediction technique
    for energy harvesting with a solar cell within three hours. Moreover, the packet
    transmissions of the sensor nodes can be controlled depending on the estimated
    energy. Packet transmissions and energy harvesting are integrated to improve the
    WSN performance. The integration of these schemes enhances the prediction accuracy
    and improves the WSN throughput and power consumption. The throughput of the sensor
    node can be increased by shortening the packet transmission period. By contrast,
    when the packet transmission period increases, the power consumption of the sensor
    node decreases. The experimental results show that the proposed packet transmission
    scheme is superior to the others in terms of data throughput and deadline miss
    rate. The proposed energy-harvesting method is also predicted more precisely than
    others by 6.92%. A study [119] used a solar cell to provide energy to a WSN deployed
    in a greenhouse. The humidity and temperature of the greenhouse were controlled
    through a management and monitoring system, which was based on a low-power MSP430
    (Texas Instruments, Dallas, TX, USA) microcontroller and an ultra-low-power nRF24L01
    transceiver (Nordic Semiconductor, Oslo, Norway). The power consumption of the
    WSN was minimized as much as possible. In another study, a WSN-based ZigBee (CC2420
    module) wireless transceiver and microcontroller (low-power ATmega128L) supplied
    by the solar cell as a battery charger were considered to monitor the humidity,
    temperature, rain level, and leaf wetness of vineyards [120]. The WSN covered
    30 m between ZigBee units with a low power consumption (35 and 38 mW in transmission
    and reception modes, respectively). 3.2.2. Wireless Power Transfer Recent developments
    in wireless power transfer (WPT) are expected to increase the lifetime of WSNs
    significantly and make them continuously operational, given that WPT techniques
    can be utilized to transmit electromagnetic energy between transmitter and receiver
    devices without any contact between the two. WPT is expected to overcome the constraint
    of the supply of WSNs. Consequently, some researchers highlighted the utilization
    of mobile node that can deliver power to deployed sensor nodes such as [121,122].
    WPT technology poses a challenge to the energy cooperation between neighboring
    nodes in WSNs. Therefore, in the future, sensor nodes could harvest energy from
    the environment and transfer this energy to other nodes in the network; in this
    manner, a self-sustaining network can be achieved [123]. Accordingly, recent research
    has investigated multi-hop energy transfer [124,125], which paved the way for
    new energy cooperative schemes and WPT charging protocols. WPT can be classified
    into three main subcategories: (i) electromagnetic (EM) radiation, (ii) magnetic
    resonator coupling, and (iii) inductive coupling, as shown in Figure 2. Wireless
    charging in WSNs can be performed via EM radiation and magnetic resonant coupling.
    EM signals suffer from attenuation over distance, and active radiation may pose
    a threat to the human body. Meanwhile, magnetic resonant coupling can address
    the power requirements of agriculture based on WSNs because of its efficiency
    within a distance of several meters. Many studies used WPT to charge sensor nodes
    for different applications and fields. WPT-based inductive coupling [121] has
    been used to charge the battery of sensor nodes scattered in agriculture fields.
    The energy is transferred from the source coil (mounted on a UAV) to the receiver
    coil (attached with sensor nodes). A 2.4 W transfer power is transferred to charge
    a single sensor node. The results addressed a number of limitations and challenges
    related to the charging of sensor nodes via a UAV. In addition, the results revealed
    that the battery lifetime of the deployed sensors can be significantly extended
    through the UAV. A similar approach was adopted by Chen et al. [122] to charge
    a WSN in an agricultural field through the harvesting of electromagnetic radiation.
    3.2.3. Air Flow Energy Harnessing wind energy is another energy-harvesting technique
    that can be utilized to provide power to sensor nodes in agricultural applications.
    An adaptive routing protocol, wind energy harvesting, and sleep scheduling were
    considered in [126] to minimize the power consumption of the ZigBee transceiver
    and extend the lifetime of the WSN. 3.2.4. Vibration Energy Vibration energy based
    on piezoelectric can be used to charge the battery of sensor nodes to prolong
    their lifetime. Müller et al. [127] have been analyzed various WSN protocols based
    on ZigBee (CC2420 and CC2500) and CC1100 with respect to their applicability in
    the agricultural setting. Furthermore, a fully synchronous protocol with a time-slot
    architecture for a WSN has been proposed for agricultural machinery to achieve
    real-time capability, low latency, and deterministic behavior. The objective of
    their application was to monitor the back door position and filling level of a
    forage wagon using a ZigBee (CC2420) RF transceiver. Clock synchronization among
    all nodes is implemented to ensure strict power on/sleep times of each sensor
    node. Meanwhile, an energy-harvesting unit based on a piezoelectric material has
    been designed; the unit provides an average power of 200 μW to sensor nodes. In
    this case, the sensor node can transmit a data payload of nine bytes in 40 ms.
    3.2.5. Water Flow Energy Multi-energy sources (water, wind, and solar) platform
    is designed for precision agricultural applications by Morais et al. [128]. The
    authors explored water flow, wind speed and solar radiation feasible energy sources
    to encounter the requirements of ZigBee router node in WSN. Thus, several powered
    solutions for WSN is presented. Design considerations regarding water flow energy,
    the water flow in the pipes of crops irrigation system are employed to generate
    the energy for ZigBee router node. This idea can be applied in different agricultural
    applications such as greenhouses, aquaculture, and hydroponic systems, where the
    water recirculation in pipes is continuous. Like to bulky hydroelectric generation
    utilities, a water flow in the pipes, derived from the main water source, can
    be employed to run a turbine joined to a small direct current (DC) generator.
    The experimental results revealed that the three energy sources combined together
    can generate an energy of 58 mAh, more than the requirement of the ZigBee router
    node (39 mAh). 3.2.6. Microbial Fuel Cell Energy Another type of energy harvesting
    technique is called microbial fuel cell. This technique is extracted from energy
    neutral system. Sartori and Brunelli [129] proposed microbial fuel cell to supply
    the underground freshwater system that used for monitoring the water level in
    the phreatic zone, artesian wells, and tanks. The proposed system comprises a
    low-cost phreatimeter sensor, a low-power microcontroller (i.e., MSP430FR5739),
    and a low-power LoRa wireless protocol. However, the amount of microbial fuel
    cell energy extraction of 296 μW is not enough to supply LoRa wireless protocol
    and microcontroller directly when they are in active mode. Therefore, a DC-to-DC
    boost is employed to raise the small input voltages of 130 mV to 4.5 V. Evidently,
    most agricultural applications prefer to use solar cells as battery chargers of
    WSNs because these cells are easy to install, work efficiently when sunlight is
    available, and supply more energy compared with other energy-harvesting techniques
    as shown in Table 7. In addition, the table shows most of the previous scholars
    adopted ZigBee wireless protocol. Clearly, employing ZigBee supports our study
    that this wireless protocol is more suitable for agricultural monitoring systems.
    Solar panels can supply 100 mW/cm2, whereas radio frequency, thermal, vibration,
    wind, microbial fuel cell, magnetic resonant coupling WPT, and water flow can
    supply 0.001, 0.06, 0.8, 1.0, 0.296, 14, and 19 mWs, respectively [128,129,130,131].
    For example, as shown in Figure 3 (Part A), if the power consumption of the WSN
    components presented in [120] is 35 mW for ZigBee (Chipcon CC2420), 0.27 mW for
    the temperature sensor, 3 mW for the humidity sensor, 0.27 mW for the rain gauge
    sensor, 5 mW for the leaf wetness sensor, and 24 mW for the ATmega128L microcontroller
    [132], a single solar cell (2 × 2 cm2) panel can adequate supply this WSN. However,
    when the power consumption of the WSN increases, the dimension of the solar cell
    panel also needs to be increased. Figure 3. Example of farm field-based Internet
    of Things (IoT) and provided by a solar cell battery charger: (a) Agriculture
    sensor node with related sensor and solar cell, (b) Sink and actuator nodes, and
    (c) Gateway node and cloud computing. 4. Agriculture Requirements for IoT The
    IoT represents the visibility of a group of systems, technologies, platforms,
    and design principles for joining things, depending on the physical surroundings,
    through the use of the Internet. PA is an application that can employ the benefits
    of IoT to increase production efficiency, improve the quality of yields, reduce
    the negative ecological impact, prevent the prevalence of plant-eating pests or
    plant diseases, alert farmers about farm fires [141], and increase the profitability
    of several agricultural production schemes. Agriculture involves farming, planting,
    and animal rearing, and it has grown under the scope of IoT recently [5]. Tracking
    of animals, monitoring of farms, and irrigation processes are the main domains
    of IoT for cultivation [142]. Furthermore, feeding, rearing, medication, and vaccination
    are essential applications of IoT in the agricultural domain [143]. Consequently,
    several IoT modular architectures have been proposed and implemented by scholars
    for PA monitoring (as presented in Table 8). Real-time ecological information
    can be remotely gathered from the agricultural surroundings based on different
    sensors, which transmit the information to be processed to determine problems,
    take required actions using actuators, or store data. Sensors in WSN can be employed
    to gather information about environmental and physical features, whereas actuators
    are used to respond to the feedback to control or to perform an action over the
    conditions (Figure 3, Part B). The use of sensors in agricultural applications
    poses a number of requirements, including gathering of soil, weather, and crop
    information; surveillance of agricultural areas, water and fertilizer requirements
    of diverse pieces of rough land, several crops on a single piece of acreage, different
    requirements of crops for unlike soil and weather circumstances, and eliminating
    of interactive solutions and relying on proactive solutions. All these requirements
    are applied and processed in parallel. Therefore, different sensors and actuators
    must be used to handle this information and respond to different conditions. Processed
    information can be utilized to make a decision instead of raw data of the sensor
    [132]. This information can be transmuted to the cloud computing via gateway for
    data processing and data storage, as shown in Figure 3 (Part C). Reference [144]
    proposed a modular architecture for a wireless sensor node implemented for PA
    applications. The sensors employed in this modular were soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and wind direction and speed sensors to monitor the agricultural environments.
    “Adafruit Pro Trinket” platform was selected for the data processing, and nRF
    wireless protocol was used as a transceiver to transfer sensor data to the gateway
    (i.e., Intel Edison to reduce the power consumption). The gateway was in charge
    of collected information from different sensors and passed the information to
    the cloud server. The proposed system resulted in improved crop quality and minimized
    negative ecological effect. In [145], the usage of water in smart irrigation systems
    was controlled based on developed IoT platforms. A cloud agriculture field-monitoring
    scheme was designed and implemented to enable the farmer to monitor the soil condition.
    Soil moisture and weather temperature were monitored to automate the irrigation
    system in farm while minimizing water consumption, which led to reduced cost and
    maintained environmental benefits. The proposed water irrigation system included
    three main parts: a WSN and actuator, a cloud platform, and user application.
    The WSN and actuator part consisted of sensor nodes for collecting the soil moisture
    and weather temperature, an actuator node to control the irrigation process, and
    a sink node that could pass all farm information to the cloud platform. All sensor,
    sink, and actuator nodes adopted low-power ZigBee wireless protocol. WSN and 3G
    network-based agriculture IoT was considered in [146] to monitor the air temperature,
    air humidity, and soil moisture. The entire system consisted of sensor nodes,
    actuators sink nodes, server, gateway, and the mobile phone device of the farmer.
    The collected information by the sensor nodes was sent to the server via gateway
    and Internet network. The gateway connected the WSN with the Internet to relay
    the command control among the sensor nodes, the phone of the farmer, the actuators,
    and the server. However, in this system, the data transmission over the 3G network
    must ensure real-time communications to support the agricultural WSN. IoT-based
    agriculture applications changed classical agricultural surveillance approaches
    by speedily providing quantitative data with significant temporal and spatial
    resolution. Several IoT platforms have recently been available in the market.
    For instance, in agricultural applications, SmartFarmNet [147] platforms can be
    used to provide more than 30 packages for good commercial products, such as Libelium
    [45], and experimental, such as Motes [148] and Arduino [149] sensor platforms.
    Other examples of agricultural applications based on IoT are provided in Table
    8. The table presents a comparative analysis of several scholars in terms of sensors,
    actuators, IoT devices, and IoT platforms that can be used to support agricultural
    applications. The major requirements of PA domain such as sensors, microcontrollers,
    and wireless technologies are highlighted and classified in Table 9. For better
    clarification, the sensors are classified into three main categories leaf wetness/plant,
    soil moisture, and environment sensors [5,132]. These sensors can be utilized
    in several potential agriculture applications. In Table 9, the microcontroller/processor
    and wireless protocols are also highlighted. Among the microcontrollers, the majority
    of agriculture sensor nodes adopting ATmega128L because this microcontroller supports
    data aggregation, decision making, storage capability, flash memory, low complexity,
    and energy management through multi-levels of power down modes [132]. ZigBee and
    LoRa wireless protocols/technologies are widely used in several agricultural applications,
    as discussed previously in Section 2. Table 9. Types of sensors, microcontrollers,
    and wireless protocols/technologies used in precision agriculture (PA). In precision
    agriculture, to obtain high-quality products, the environmental parameters should
    be controlled to provide optimal values. For example, the temperature rate that
    has a positive effect on the growth of the pepper field is between 20 and 25 °C.
    The temperature in rainy, sunny, and nightly days should be kept between 20 and
    22 °C, between 25 and 28 °C, and between 18 and 20 °C, respectively and the minimum
    value should be not lower than 16–17 °C. Air humidity for pepper vegetables should
    be kept between 60% and 70%. The high-temperature value combines with low humidity
    value may be caused a negative influence on the growth of the pepper. The maximum
    humidity value in pepper greenhouse should be not above 70%. Soil pH (i.e., soil
    acidity) is another factor that directly effects on the pepper crops, where it
    can measure the quantity of calcium in the soil. The soil for pepper crops can
    be acid or alkaline depending on the weather conditions. It should be acid for
    wet climate and alkaline for a dry climate. Soil with pH levels above 7.0 is considered
    alkaline, while soil with pH levels below 7.0 has acid nature. Soil pH values
    must be controlled according to the type of the agricultural yield. For pepper
    crop, the best values for pH gauge are between 6.5 and 5.5. Therefore, the humidity,
    temperature, and soil pH should be constantly supervised in order to identify
    the right time for draining and watering the agricultural crops. 5. Challenges
    and Limitations The development of WSNs prompted new research trends in the agricultural
    domain. Micro electromechanical system (MEMS) technologies allow for the manufacture
    of cheap and small sensors. The pervasive nature of the process, together with
    tiny, self-regulating sensor nodes, cost-effective equipment, and scalability,
    indicate that WSNs can be used for agriculture automation [5]. However, regarding
    the distribution of WSNs to observe different agricultural climates, a number
    of open challenges and limitations remain. Several of these challenges and limitations
    in existing agricultural applications based on WSNs are listed below together
    with suggestions on how to address them. (1) Power consumption and battery life:
    A WSN consists of three main components: sensors, microcontrollers, and RF transceivers.
    Given that the battery of a sensor node provides limited energy, ensuring that
    the components of the sensor node consume minimum power is crucial. In particular,
    reducing the power consumption of the RF transceiver, which consumes more power
    than the other components in a sensor node, would alleviate this problem [67,127].
    Moreover, this issue can be addressed in two steps. The first is to propose an
    intelligent energy-efficient algorithm. The second step can be performed by utilizing
    available energy-harvesting techniques, such as solar cells, vibration, and WPT.
    (2) Communication range: WSNs suffer from the effect of harsh ecological conditions
    because of the wide range of open agricultural surroundings [5]. The WSN protocol
    contains mechanisms to resist the effect of data transmission failures in the
    network, which increase due to ecological effects. In agricultural applications,
    most wireless sensor technologies support a relatively short communication range.
    Therefore, many sensor and router nodes need to be diffused in a WSN. In the point-to-point
    Zigbee network, the communication distance can reach 100 m in outdoor environments.
    The ZigBee communication range can be extended by adopting multi-tire, ad-hoc,
    decentralized, and mesh network topologies. Drones or UAV also can be used as
    a mobile router node to extend the communication range within a farm field. A
    drone could pass the collected data from the sensor nodes to the master node through
    multi-hop. However, using drones entails other challenges and limitations. (3)
    Propagation losses: In agricultural applications, WSNs must be able to work in
    diverse surroundings, such as ground, bare land, orchards, greenhouses, farms,
    and complex topography; they must also be able to operate in all climate conditions.
    All these conditions influence the performance of radio propagation. Whether the
    topography is simple or complicated, the communication possibility between the
    points in a WSN still suffers from serious challenges. The signal transmitted
    from the sensor nodes in agricultural applications need to pass through a heavy
    crop canopy to arrive to at the receiver nodes, which cannot ensure a sufficient
    clearance area and will cause signal propagation absorption, reflection, attenuation,
    and scattering. In this case, the link quality is degraded, especially when the
    signal spreads through dense crops. Therefore, when deploying WSNs, communication
    link quality and temporal and spatial variables must be guaranteed. The communication
    performance of WSNs is related to the working surroundings. Therefore, due to
    the limited resources and power budget of WSNs, an accurate wireless channel path
    loss model must be adopted to reflect the propagation features. This model is
    expected to demonstrate correct optimization and network evaluation performance
    throughout the deployment design process to develop the energy efficiency of the
    nodes [15], improve the target detection and localization applications [16], decrease
    the number of retransmission, and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) of the network
    [175]. (4) Routing: Different problems can emerge due to packet collision and
    limited bandwidth, which are introduced by channel propagation, and so on. Therefore,
    when a WSN is deployed in a wide area in farm fields, multi-hop is required. Kim
    et al. [3] developed an independent mobile robot platform based on a mobility
    task for surveillance to overcome channel interference. (5) Localization and tracking:
    Tracking and localization of a herd of cattle are considered smart farm applications
    based on WSNs. For example, a WSN can be employed to track and localize of dairy
    cows to enable herd management. ZigBee wireless protocol is used to monitor animal
    locations and behaviors, such as walking and standing, lying down, and grazing
    [16,18]. In this context, several considerations, such as radio interference,
    animal situation, and mobility, changes in WSN topology, penetration depth of
    the signal through the animal body, height of the collar, and access point antennas,
    need to be taken into account [176]. These considerations pose challenges in the
    localization and tracking of the animals. (6) Reliability: Agricultural monitoring
    systems based on different environmental sensors can also be used to monitor pollution
    aside from climate conditions. Important information on climate conditions is
    reported to related agencies and farmers from a remote location for advance investigations.
    Dangerous information needs to be dealt with immediately in an emergency, which
    means that data transmission in WSNs should demonstrate high reliability [3].
    (7) Scalability: In agricultural applications, the construction of WSN-based fault-tolerant
    and robust hierarchical architectures requires large-scale deployment relative
    to single-level network architectures. A hierarchical architecture can be scaled
    up for developing applications by duplicating to several fields. In this context,
    to increase the number of WSNs over a vast area, multiple wireless router nodes
    are placed in an agricultural field to guarantee sustained operation. (8) Cost:
    The total hardware and software costs of sensor nodes are important. The design
    of sensor nodes for any agricultural application level must involve a low cost
    while demonstrating a robust performance; moreover, the design needs to be available
    for use by poor country markets [5]. This challenge can be overcome by reducing
    software and hardware costs further. (9) Real time: Most crops are vulnerable
    to climate conditions, such as humidity, intensity of illumination, and temperature.
    This vulnerability is a burden to farmers who monitor changes in climate conditions
    hourly and/or daily because doing so is labor-intensive. Moreover, in greenhouses,
    a fire can occur and lead to severe agricultural disasters. This evidence suggests
    that the monitoring of the ecological conditions of agricultural WSNs needs to
    be in real time. Real-time monitoring will enhance yield production and plant
    growth and avoid dangerous disasters in farms [3]. (10) Storage and recording
    of data: Large amounts of data are recorded from agriculture observing systems
    because several WSNs in agricultural applications contain several sensors for
    crop growth analysis and harvesting estimation. This condition requires the base
    station to monitor changes in farm fields by analyzing patterns. The base station
    must thus be supported by a high storage capacity. (11) Security: Security and
    protection are important issues in agricultural products. Protection from insects
    or attacks of rodents in grain stores or fields is essential. Such a challenge
    must be considered to maintain the security level of agriculture. Protection and
    security can be achieved based on real-time analysis and processing of agricultural
    information without human intrusion [159]. (12) Delay tolerance: Critical delay
    poses a challenge to agricultural applications. Some agricultural applications
    can be considered as time sensitive, such as those used in farm fire detection,
    detection of exposure of crops to pests, cow heat event detection during milking,
    and exposure of cattle to heat for a certain period. Such information must be
    transmitted as fast as possible if the critical issue is to be handled. In such
    a case, a tradeoff between energy consumption and data timelines is necessary.
    By contrast, some agricultural applications are delay tolerant (i.e., time insensitive),
    such as protein content, milk fat [177], gathering data from soil and grass monitoring.
    With delay tolerant approach, the short range low power wireless protocols can
    be used [178]. Where the information of the agricultural field can be collected
    and transferred to the master node or to a cloud computing node using “messengers”
    e.g., a mobile node (mobile robot or UAV). Consequently, the cost [179] and the
    complexity of the agriculture WSN will be reduced and the lifetime will be increased.
    (13) Fault tolerance: Fault tolerance is a crucial feature of WSNs for succeeding
    PA. Several faults may occur in PA based on the WSN system, which are (i) communication
    failure, (ii) faulty sensor setting, (iii) sensor component faults producing incorrect
    value, and (iv) node failure because of exhausted battery or any other cause.
    Gutiérrez et al. [40] introduced communication failure and node fault tolerance
    for an irrigation system. If any fault occurs, the irrigation system tracks the
    default irrigation program. The node energy depletion failure was minimized in
    [1,40,180] by adopting solar-cell-powered nodes. Data aggregation and topology
    control schemes are probable to be fault tolerant for deploying sensor nodes in
    a vast area. (14) Data management: The data management in agriculture poses a
    challenge because the large amount of data that can be collected from several
    sensors spread in agricultural field, especially when the agricultural data are
    intended to be connected to the cloud. Determination of the (i) data analysis
    method, (ii) data collection schemes, (iii) sensor types, (iv) semantic sensor
    networking, (v) big data, and (vi) complex event processing enables the designer
    to manage these crucial aspects. The integration of IoT and software-defined network
    also introduces a promising and new methodology in deployment, monitoring, and
    design of network services and resources [181]. (15) Heterogeneous sensors: Integration
    of wired and wireless heterogeneous sensors into information platforms to perform
    interoperability pose challenges in PA. Chen et al. [152] proposed “web service-enabled
    cyber-physical infrastructure” to solve this issue. The proposed system was able
    to integrate, process, acquire, and distribute surveillance data from different
    physical sensors spread in the PA system over the Internet. The infrastructure
    was executed to serve as an architecture middleware between PA clients and heterogeneous
    sensors. 6. Conclusions A review of WSN-based agricultural applications was presented.
    A comparison was conducted among different wireless technologies or protocols,
    such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPRS/3G/4G, LoRa, and SigFox. The comparison
    results revealed that the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols are more convenient
    for agricultural applications than the others because of its low power consumption
    and suitable communication range for ZigBee and long for LoRa. A classification
    of energy-efficient techniques or algorithms and energy-harvesting techniques
    was also provided. Based on the presented taxonomy, we show that significant types
    of energy-efficient and energy-harvesting techniques can be used in the agriculture
    domain. Previous research was also investigated and compared to explore the current
    problems in agricultural applications based on WSNs and obtain optimum solutions
    for maintaining system performance. Challenges and limitations were introduced
    for design considerations in the future. The state-of-the-art approaches of IoT
    in agricultural applications were reviewed and compared to explore various sensors,
    actuators, devices, IoT platforms, and application layers. Acknowledgments The

    • Ongoing challenges and future perspectives of IoT in agriculture are discussed.
    The increasing demand for food, both in terms of quantity and quality, has raised
    the need for intensification and industrialisation of the agricultural sector.
    The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a highly promising family of technologies which
    is capable of offering many solutions towards the modernisation of agriculture.
    Scientific groups and research institutions, as well as the industry, are in a
    race trying to deliver more and more IoT products to the agricultural business
    stakeholders, and, eventually, lay the foundations to have a clear role when IoT
    becomes a mainstream technology. At the same time Cloud Computing, which is already
    very popular, and Fog Computing provide sufficient resources and solutions to
    sustain, store and analyse the huge amounts of data generated by IoT devices.
    The management and analysis of IoT data (“Big Data”) can be used to automate processes,
    predict situations and improve many activities, even in real-time. Moreover, the
    concept of interoperability among heterogeneous devices inspired the creation
    of the appropriate tools, with which new applications and services can be created
    and give an added value to the data flows produced at the edge of the network.
    The agricultural sector was highly affected by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies
    and is expected to be equally benefited by the IoT. In this article, a survey
    of recent IoT technologies, their current penetration in the agricultural sector,
    their potential value for future farmers and the challenges that IoT faces towards
    its propagation is presented. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    1. Introduction and motivation The term “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a term first
    coined by a British visionary, Kevin Ashton, back in 1999. As the phrase “Internet
    of Things” reveals, the IoT paradigm will provide a technological universe, in
    which many physical objects or “Things”, such as sensors, everyday tools and equipment
    enhanced by computing power and networking capabilities will be able to play a
    role, either as single units or as a distributed collaborating swarm of heterogeneous
    devices. Agriculture is one of the sectors that is expected to be highly influenced
    by the advances in the domain of IoT. The Food and Agricultural Organization of
    the United Nation (FAO) predicts that the global population will reach 8 billion
    people by 2025 and 9.6 billion people by 2050 (FAO, 2009). This practically means
    that an increase of 70% in food production must be achieved by 2050 worldwide.
    The great increase in global population and the rising demand for high-quality
    products create the need for the modernisation and intensification of agricultural
    practices. At the same time, the need for high efficiency in the use of water
    and other resources is also mandatory. One of the most promising concepts, which
    is expected to contribute a lot to the required increase of food production in
    a sustainable way, is precision agriculture (PA) (Zhang, Wang, & Wang, 2002).
    Precision agriculture aims to optimise and improve agricultural processes to ensure
    maximum productivity and requires fast, reliable, distributed measurements in
    order to give growers a more detailed overview of the ongoing situation in their
    cultivation area, and/or coordinate the automated machinery in such way that optimises
    energy consumption, water use and the use of chemicals for pest control and plant
    growth. At a higher level, having gathered information from many heterogeneous
    systems, well-evaluated scientific knowledge can be organised in the form of smart
    algorithms to provide a better insight into the ongoing processes, do the reasoning
    of the current situation and make predictions based on heterogeneous inputs, produce
    early warnings about potential dangers that threaten the cultivars, and improved
    automated control signals, based on plant responses (Kacira et al., 2005, Körner
    and Van Straten, 2008). The algorithms required to handle the distributed data
    in real time are far too complicated to run locally on a low-power Wireless Sensor
    Network (WSN) node. However, in the context of IoT, all the objects will be interconnected,
    and therefore the computational overhead can be easily shifted to the cloud or
    be distributed among more than one interconnected devices. The greatly increasing
    interest in IoT in agriculture can be roughly seen in Fig. 1. The increase in
    the appearance of the term “IoT” along with the term “Agriculture” in the international
    scientific literature is rather indicative. These data motivated us to present
    an overview of the state-of-the-art research on IoT in its various forms, appearing
    in the agricultural sector, rather than a generic review. For this reason, a research
    methodology was adopted derived from the existing guidelines used by medical researchers,
    adapted and optimised for software engineering matters (Kitchenham, 2004). According
    to this methodology, a selection of recent literature was done, setting the year
    2010 as starting point. The 2010 starting point year was determined because it
    is then when a significant number of publications appeared. Moreover, technologies
    and approaches before 2010 are quite obsolete at the time of writing the present
    manuscript. Other selection criteria included the multidisciplinary nature of
    a publication. Works utilising more than one technology in order to synthesise
    their solutions were considered as IoT-oriented; for instance, cloud and embedded
    devices/wireless sensors, or, works that make use of more than one type of end
    devices (things) within the same network. Having none of the aforementioned restrictions,
    the reviewed literature area would be too wide and out of the scope of this work.
    Moreover, this paper seeks to present research that adopts newer architectures,
    closer to the principles of IoT. Download : Download high-res image (97KB) Download

    to “IoT in Agriculture”, as they appear in Scopus. This paper begins with an introduction
    in the recent trends in the technologies, which represent the building blocks
    of IoT, such as the Radio Frequency Identification Radio Frequency Identification
    (RFID), wireless sensor networks, the addressing of the “things” in a common network,
    as well as the applications running on the cloud. Following the same categorisation,
    several works are presented, which incorporate one or more of the IoT aspects
    and focus on the agricultural sector. Some of the most popular hardware platforms,
    met in agricultural deployments, is also surveyed. The review closes with a discussion
    on future challenges and their effect on IoT spreading, which has effects on the
    adoption of IoT in the agricultural sector too. One of the goals of this work
    is to provide the members of a multidisciplinary community, such as the researchers
    working on deploying innovative monitoring, tracking, decision support and control
    systems, with a handful manuscript that summarises the latest advances in embedded
    devices, sensor modules, wireless communication technologies, programming paradigms
    and cloud services suitable, or optimised, for use in agriculture. Some of the
    most common keywords appearing in the presented literature are presented in Fig.

    Keyword distribution in the presented literature. 2. Internet of Things enabling
    technologies The structure of IoT is based on three layers; namely, the perception
    layer (sensing), the network layer (data transfer), and the application layer
    (data storage and manipulation). Despite great improvements, IoT is still evolving,
    trying to obtain its final shape, as can be seen in several reviews (Atzori et
    al., 2010, Botta et al., 2014, Gubbi et al., 2013, Miorandi et al., 2012). As
    the term “Internet” implies, networking capability is one of the core features
    of the IoT devices. The internet as we know it today is mostly an internet of
    human end-users, while the IoT will be an internet of non-human entities, therefore
    a lot of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication will take place. 2.1. Layer 1:
    the perception layer At the perception layer, we meet technologies such as WSN,
    RFID and, recently, Near Field Communications (NFC). There is some overlap between
    WSN and RFID technologies, since semi-passive and active RFID tags can also be
    regarded as wireless nodes with lower computational and storage capacity. Typically,
    a wireless sensor node consists of a processing module, usually a low-power microcontroller
    unit (MCU), one or more sensor modules (embedded or external analogue or digital
    sensing devices) and an RF communication module, usually supporting a low-power
    wireless communication technology (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image
    (202KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The architecture of a typical
    wireless sensor node. Apart from monitoring and control during the production
    process, there is a need for monitoring, identification and tracking of agricultural
    and livestock products after harvest. WSNs are often met in several works related
    to monitoring and climate control of storage and logistics facilities. RFID technology
    is considered the first, and most basic, example of interconnected “Things”. RFID
    tags contain data in the form of the Electronic Product Code (EPC) and the RFID
    Readers are triggering, reading and manipulating a large number of tags. Offering
    object identification, tracking and data storage on active or passive (without
    the need for embedded power supply) tags, RFID and NFC technologies play an important
    role in the agricultural domain. Typical user scenarios include products or livestock
    monitoring, supply chain and quality control tracking and lifecycle assessment
    of agricultural products (Welbourne et al., 2009). 2.2. Layer 2: the network layer
    At the second layer of IoT, wireless sensor nodes interacting with physical objects
    and/or their environment, communicate with their neighbouring nodes or a gateway,
    building networks through which the data are usually forwarded towards a remote
    infrastructure for storage, further analysis, processing and dissemination of
    the valuable knowledge that can be extracted (Gubbi et al., 2013). When it comes
    to wireless communications, a large scientific literature has been created on
    sensor networks, addressing several problems, such as energy efficiency, networking
    features, scalability and robustness (Atzori et al., 2010). Communication protocols
    built over wireless standards, such as 802.15.4, facilitate the device networking
    and bridge the gap between the internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes. Such
    protocols include ZigBee, ONE-NET, Sigfox, WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and 6LowPan,
    to name a few (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE), LoRa/LoRaWAN, DASH7 and low-power WiFi have also appeared in
    several deployments recently. 2.3. Layer 3: the application layer The application
    layer is the third layer of the IoT. It is of high importance and, in many ways,
    it is this that facilitates the realisation of the IoT. The application layer
    faces several issues which have to be resolved, such as the identification of
    the devices as unique entities. Identifying and addressing billions of devices
    around the globe will provide a direct, internet-like access and control over
    them through the future internet. The uniqueness of identity, reliability, persistence
    and scalability represent important features of the addressing schema (Gubbi et
    al., 2013). IPv6, with its internet mobility aspects, could alleviate some of
    the device identification problems and is expected to play a vital role in this
    field (Botta et al., 2014). However, the heterogeneous nature of wireless nodes,
    the variability of data types, concurrent operations and confluence of data from
    the devices amplifies the problem even further (Zorzi, Gluhak, Lange, & Bassi,
    2010). Meta-data and context-aware addressing, supplementary to IPv6, are expected
    to contribute a lot while dealing with the above-mentioned challenges (Kalmar,
    Vida, & Maliosz, 2013). Heterogeneity is another big challenge in the IoT world.
    The vision of IoT is to allow billions of devices, with great diversity in their
    technical specifications (form factor, power supply, environmental capabilities,
    compatibility with other devices), computing power, peripheral devices and networking
    subsystems to co-exist in one inter-network. Middleware is a software layer, composed
    of sub-layers located between the devices and the application layer, abstracting
    the device functionalities and technical specificities and providing developers
    with sets of more generic tools to build their applications (Fig. 4). Middleware
    has gained much attention due to its major role in simplifying the development
    of new services and the integration of legacy technologies into new ones (Atzori
    et al., 2010). Furthermore, middleware is the mechanism that combines the cloud
    infrastructure with a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the sensor networks
    in a generic manner, ready to provide appropriate tools for any type of deployment
    (Ghosh & Das, 2008). SOA approach benefits the enterprise by reducing the time
    invested in adapting itself to the changes imposed by the market and allows software
    and hardware reuse, since it is technology independent, when it comes to service
    implementations (Pasley, 2005). Future agricultural IoT interconnected devices
    may include sensors, connected machinery and vehicles, weather stations, internet
    gateways, network storage, RFID scanners, smartphones, tablets, wearables and
    many other devices. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Software layers over heterogeneous devices and operating
    systems presenting how the Middleware layer serves in order to make it possible
    for a single/common application to run seamlessly on several platforms and operating
    systems. Finally, in order for the sensed data to have a real value for the end-user
    or another system (in case of M2M scenarios) they have to be stored, analysed,
    synthesised and presented in an understandable and intuitive manner. Big Data
    is one side-effect of the continuous data flow coming from billions of geo-distributed
    devices and has three dimensions, namely volume, variety and velocity (Beyer,
    2011). The Cloud with its virtually unlimited computational and storage capacity
    is the only technology capable of withstanding the IoT workload. In modern agricultural
    scenarios, stored data are automatically processed, corrected and used or combined
    under artificial intelligence algorithms, machine learning technologies, and decision-making
    systems based on models, in order to extract knowledge about phenomena, which
    cannot be directly measured. These systems can either propose the optimal tactic
    to the end-user, or produce the appropriate control signals for actuator devices,
    offering fully-automated sensing and control solutions. Plenty of studies have
    focussed on the standardisation of the IoT core technologies (Jazayeri et al.,
    2015, Sawant et al., 2014). The classical WSN/WSAN (Wireless Sensor-Actor Network)
    paradigm, i.e. distributed smart devices sensing and transferring data to a sink
    and/or driving one or more actuators, moves one step further towards interoperability
    of devices and objects. Other aspects of IoT include technologies that support
    the intercommunication among devices and/or end-users, as well as the platforms,
    the software, the hardware abstractions and the programming tools, over which
    developers and providers can build new applications and services (Atzori et al.,
    2010, Miorandi et al., 2012). The IoT paradigm is driven by the principles: “Anything
    communicates – anything is identified – anything interacts”. 3. Internet of Things
    hardware, platforms and sensors in agriculture 3.1. Low-power wireless sensor
    networks In the recent literature, a large number of embedded programmable devices
    have been used. Some are custom-built, while others are either commercial programmable
    boards or complete, closed-source sensing/monitoring solutions. Researchers choose
    their equipment depending on the research priorities set, or the main focus of
    each study. Commercial sensing solutions provide a number of features out of the
    box, allowing researchers to focus on other aspects of IoT deployments, like meta-processing,
    smart algorithms for monitoring and control, cloud interoperability, etc. (Edwards
    Murphy et al., 2015, Mamduh et al., 2012, Yu et al., 2011). Programmable, open
    solutions, on the other hand, provide developers the flexibility to have full
    control over the behaviour of the nodes and the network and program new peripheral
    devices to make them compatible with the nodes, like new sensor or actuator modules
    (Akshay et al., 2012; Wu, Li, Ma, Qiu, & He, 2012; Hou and Gao, 2010, Jayaraman
    et al., 2015a, Jimenez et al., 2012, Park and Park, 2011). The potential applications
    of IoT in agriculture cover a large number of scenarios. Barcelo-Ordinas, Chanet,
    Hou, & Garcia-Vidal (2016) categorise them in networks of scalar sensors, utilised
    in sensing and control of agricultural infrastructures, such as greenhouses, multimedia
    sensor networks for the remote image capturing and processing for the detection
    of insects and plant diseases, and tag-based networks (RFID, NFC) for product
    tracking and remote identification. Especially in the case of WSN in agriculture,
    the specific characteristics of the situation and the environment, in which the
    nodes will be deployed, should be taken into account. Crops, or other obstacles
    in farmlands whose positions may move, cause considerable interference in the
    communication between nodes. This varying movement of obstacles affects the connection
    quality of links, making it variable with space and time, affecting the deployment,
    routing, failure diagnosis, and other aspects of WSN. Harsh environmental factors
    such as temperature, humidity, rainfall and high solar radiation, the effect of
    shading by the plant leaves, as well as the noise produced by building structures,
    such as greenhouses, extend the spatiotemporal climatic variation, greatly affecting
    the links and communication quality among the nodes (Wang, Yang, & Mao, 2017).
    The periodic nature of the recorded phenomena in agricultural installations usually
    drive the development of the applications. This characteristic sets the requirements
    and provides opportunities for novel duty-cycle control, sampling scheduling,
    data reconstructions, as well as data storage and query, intelligent control,
    and so on (Ahonen et al., 2008, Mottola and Picco, 2011; Pawlowski et al., 2008).
    Therefore, the choice of the correct IoT platform to build a deployment could
    affect the overall success of the project. A summary of some of the popular programmable
    boards and embedded platforms used in recent deployments is presented in Table

    for agricultural Internet of Things/Wireless Sensor Network deployments Although
    many theoretical aspects of WSN have been extensively studied in literature, realistic
    IoT/WSN deployments in agricultural sector are quite demanding and remain a challenging
    task. Sensor modules need to be accurate enough, with the appropriate measuring
    range for the situation at hand, and shielded against environmental factors which
    can either create false readings or even destroy the sensor permanently. Due to
    the distributed nature of IoT, in cases of battery-operated nodes, placed in open
    fields or other agricultural facilities, replacing the power source can be a very
    difficult task, if not impossible. Therefore, very strict power constraints affect
    the selection of hardware and the low-power features of the selected peripheral
    devices are always considered when designing a new system. Software-wise the components
    which are to be integrated in order to implement the functionality of an end-device
    have to be carefully inspected. The final functional code requires deep embedded
    software engineering knowledge and sufficient testing to avoid failures in the
    field (Barrenetxea et al., 2008, Langendoen et al., 2006). . Other characteristics
    making a low-power, embedded device selectable for a deployment are its long-term
    stability, the number of digital and analogue inputs/outputs which determines
    the number of peripheral devices (sensors and actuators) that can be supported,
    the ability to be sustainable through power harvesting modules, and, the effort
    required for its programming. 3.3. Wireless communication protocols in agriculture
    The dominant wireless technologies in the domain of IoT are separated into seven
    main categories, namely, Global System for Mobile Communications (Groupe Spécial
    Mobile – GSM) offered by authorised operators, Wireless Personal Area Networks
    (WPAN), Wireless Regional Area Networks (Cognitive Radio/WRAN), Mesh, Point-to-Point
    (P2P) and Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPN/LPWAN). GSM standard is further divided
    into GSM EDGE Radio Access Network (GERAN) and UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network
    (UTRAN). Numerous wireless devices have been developed upon the various wireless
    standards. As in many aspects of IoT, interoperability is the biggest challenge.
    Another challenge, which is common in the wireless communications, is the interference
    among devices that operate in the same band (Bluetooth, ZigBee and WiFi, for instance)
    or in neighbouring bands. An attempt to summarise the most popular IoT wireless
    standards is presented in Table 2. Table 2. Summary table of the most popular

    provide a wide variety of bandwidth, communication range, power consumption and
    security measures. The variety of technologies and standards, as well as the differentiation
    among the IoT projects and their specific requirements, hamper interoperability
    at the networking layer. When it comes to agricultural deployments, high temperature,
    and high humidity are two very common phenomena. Based on the observations of
    Bannister, Giorgetti, and Gupta (2008), temperature has a significant effect on
    the received signal strength (RSS) when it rises from 25 °C to 65 °C. Similar
    results were presented by Boano, Tsiftes, Voigt, Brown, and Roedig (2010). Furthermore,
    humidity can also be very high in agricultural deployments. In the case of open
    fields, the wireless nodes are directly exposed to rain or irrigation systems.
    In greenhouses, relative humidity can be over 80% for long periods too. Humidity
    has been shown to strongly affect radio wave propagation (Room and Tate, 2007,
    Thelen, 2004). Therefore, the number of nodes, the distance between them, the
    height of the antenna, and the operating frequency based on the desired size of
    messages are serious matters to be taken into consideration, when choosing a wireless
    transceiver for an agricultural deployment. 4. Applications in agriculture The
    general overview of IoT structural elements presented in Section 2 clearly reveals
    the great potential of these technologies in the domains of Agriculture and the
    recent trend of Precision Agriculture (PA). Recent advances in sensor technology,
    along with the miniaturisation of electronics and the great drop in their cost
    have contributed a lot to the technological evolution of traditional agriculture
    to precision and micro-precision agriculture (Kacira et al., 2005). Climate sensors,
    ground sensors, radiation sensors, weather stations (made of sensors) emphasise
    that it is all about sensors and sensor data flows, which are stored and used
    for monitoring, knowledge mining, reasoning, and control. Additionally, in recent
    years, there is an increasing demand for high quality and safe agricultural products.
    This trend has yielded the need for interoperable, distributed, robust, and accurate
    logistics traceability systems. The IoT family of technologies provides all the
    appropriate tools for building and maintaining such infrastructure and services,
    specially designed to support supply chains in agricultural and floricultural
    sectors (Verdouw, Beulens, & van der Vorst, 2013). 4.1. Agricultural monitoring
    and control Sensors, in the form of wired and wireless sensors, have been widely
    used in agriculture during the last decades. Sensing the environment in which
    production occurs, and, more recently, the responses of the plants to the climate
    (Nishina, 2015), is crucial for taking the correct and more precise decisions,
    optimising productivity and quality of the cultivars. The traditional WSN have
    recently evolved to IoT-friendly-WSN, by adopting more generic standards in terms
    of communication, allowing remote access to the internet and implementing smart
    algorithms for meta-processing of the data aiming to improve monitoring and/or
    control. Versatile devices, with high computational abilities, very convenient
    form factor and low cost, can nowadays be used, on batteries, and operate for
    long periods, with or without the assistance of power harvesting modules. In addition,
    modern embedded devices have sufficient resources to support more demanding sensors,
    such as image sensors, and the support of more sophisticated networking protocols,
    such TCP/IP, extending the traditional WSN networking capabilities. A rough classification
    of literature on monitoring and control could be: - Monitoring and, in some cases,
    creation of early warnings, via simplified rules. This includes multi-point monitoring
    for catching and absorbing climatic gradients in greenhouse cultivation (Katsoulas
    et al., 2017a, Tolle et al., 2005). - Monitoring, meta-processing (algorithm/model
    implementations on the server/cloud side) and control, including control suggestions
    to the user and fully automated control (Aiello, Giovino, Vallone, Catania, &
    Argento, 2017). - Monitoring using more computationally demanding sensors, such
    as image sensors and more powerful end-nodes. Captured images are used either
    for plain monitoring of the system, or utilised for image processing on-board,
    at the edge of the network (Fog computing) or on a cloud/server-based infrastructure
    (Katsoulas et al., 2016, Ravikanth et al., 2017, Senthilkumar et al., 2016). Sensing
    is of high importance in agriculture. WSNs have been widely used in climate and
    soil monitoring deployments both in open field and in controlled environment agriculture.
    4.2. Controlled environment agriculture Greenhouses have been shown to present
    significant climate variability, which affects the productivity of the plants
    (Kittas, Bartzanas, & Jaffrin, 2003), if not harming them. Greenhouse cultivation
    is more intense, therefore, in many cases, it requires higher precision in terms
    of monitoring and control (Fig. 4). Several studies have focussed only on localised
    and remote monitoring. In most cases data are stored and represented in various
    graphical ways (Wu et al., 2012; Jimenez et al., 2012; Katsoulas, Bartzanas, &
    Kittas, 2017; Yu et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2010). In addition to the high-precision
    monitoring, there have been studies presenting systems which incorporate meta-processing
    procedures with data transferred on remote infrastructures through the internet.
    Utilising well-evaluated equations, crop and climate models, such systems produce
    assessments of the climate and/or crop status in order for the grower to take
    better decisions or get early warnings (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Fernandes et
    al., 2013, Hernandez and Park, 2011, Hu and Qian, 2011, Jiao et al., 2014, Katsoulas
    et al., 2017b, Ma et al., 2011, Suciu et al., 2015, Tuli et al., 2014, Yu and
    Zhang, 2013, Zhou et al., 2013). Agricultural-cloud IoT solutions for greenhouse
    monitoring and control are more and more common. End-nodes collect various data
    which are uploaded to a cloud infrastructure where these data are analysed deeply,
    in a faster way, at a lower cost, reliably and efficiently (Jiawen et al., 2013,
    Keerthi and Kodandaramaiah, 2015, Wang et al., 2013a). Since plant factories are
    becoming more popular in the wider frame of urban CEA in smart cities, there have
    been a number of studies focussing on artificial growth systems (Kozai and Fujiwara,
    2016, Lee and Yoe, 2015). Katsoulas, Bartzanas, et al. (2017) presented a system
    for online precise irrigation scheduling for greenhouses (OpIRIS) based on well-evaluated
    scientific knowledge organised in the form of a web application communicating
    with remote sensors installed in greenhouses. The system integrated industrial-grade
    climate sensors and machinery including fertigation valves/controllers and sensors
    for automatic drainage sampling and forwarding the data to the cloud infrastructure
    for further analysis. The system proved very accurate in predicting the crop water
    needs and provided growers with very efficient indications about when to irrigate
    and how much nutrient solution to apply. Similar attempts to automate irrigation
    have been based on an agricultural information cloud and a hardware combination
    of IOT and RFID (Tongke, 2013), the system achieving dynamic distribution of resource
    and load balancing. As a result, authors report high efficiency of resource use
    and significant improvement in water quality. There have also been studies that
    implement control of one or more of the actuator systems in greenhouses, such
    as climate, or, irrigation controllers, also known as WSANs (Moga et al., 2012,
    Sabri et al., 2011). The control can be done remotely in two ways. The first is
    manual control by the farmer. In these cases, system administrator, based on the
    suggestions made by a Decision Support System/Expert System, chooses to control
    the machinery. Applications in this monitoring and control category include Integrated
    Pest Management (IPM) (Chougule, Kumar, & Mukhopadhyay, 2016), remote monitoring,
    warning and control in open field (Chu et al., 2013, Dinh Le and Tan, 2015), and
    in controlled environment agriculture (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Pahuja et al.,
    2013, Qiu et al., 2013). There also plenty of studies attempting fully-automated
    control by communicating the control signals, produced after processing the sensed
    data, directly to the actuators succeeding a closed-loop control (Kassim et al.,
    2014, Nikolidakis et al., 2015, Rajaoarisoa et al., 2012, Yin et al., 2014, Yongheng
    and Feng, 2014). 4.3. Open-field agriculture In open-field deployments researchers
    usually measure climate conditions, but also focus a lot in soil monitoring. In
    many cases authors use more than one sensors in the ground, at different depths.
    Optimising irrigation by providing exactly as much water as the plant needs is
    the only way to preserve water, since all the extra amount or irrigation is either
    lost into the ground, or in the atmosphere through evaporation (Fig. 5) (Sivakumar,
    GunaSekaran, SelvaPrabhu, Kumaran, & Anandan, 2012). Optical sensors have been
    used for additional information on crop reflectance or remote temperature sensing,
    as well as, mapping of the situation in the field (Fisher and Kebede, 2010, Inoue
    et al., 2012, Moshou et al., 2011, O''Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010). Integration
    of IoT and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) has been proposed in cases where
    precision of mapping of the sensed data is important (Li et al., 2012, Wang et
    al., 2013b, Ye et al., 2013). Another aspect of WSNs in agriculture are the Underground
    Wireless Sensor networks, which present significant advantages, especially in
    open field applications (De Lima et al., 2010, Dong et al., 2013, Silva and Vuran,
    2010). Download : Download high-res image (188KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. A modern example of Cloud IoT solutions for climate monitoring and
    climate optimisation based on cloud analytics services. Data fusion is realised
    on the cloud. These data come from various sources, like sensors inside and outside
    the facilities, weather stations, historical data from data bases. User can interact
    remotely with the system through a wide variety of devices (laptops, tablets,
    smartphones, etc.). As mentioned earlier, the advances in embedded device technology
    have made very powerful platforms available at very convenient prices. This has
    given the chance to researchers to implement more sophisticated end-devices, such
    as Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks, incorporating sensing nodes with much
    bigger computational capabilities, enough to support highly demanding peripheral
    devices, such as image sensors. This kind of node allows heavier local processing
    at the edge of the network, in fog-network-like manner. These works either use
    cameras for simple security or facility monitoring purposes (Cai et al., 2011,
    Zhang et al., 2011), or implement various image processing algorithms in order
    to track invading animals (Baranwal & Pushpendra, 2016), insects or other plant
    threats (Dang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014) and crop growth (Rodriguez de la
    Concepcion, Stefanelli, & Trinchero, 2014). 4.4. Livestock applications Several
    deployments have been realised in the fields of livestock. Optimal environment
    which absorbs extreme climate conditions known to have negative effects on animals
    productivity is a serious matter for many authors (Corkery et al., 2013, Ilapakurti
    and Vuppalapati, 2015, Wang and Lee, 2012, Zhang et al., 2016). Livestock IoT
    includes not only animal and animal climate monitoring and control, but, in some
    cases includes field monitoring for optimal feeding practices (Fig. 6) (Bhargava,
    Ivanov, & Donnelly, 2015). Another aspect of livestock IoT includes the instrumentation
    and analysis of beehives (Edwards Murphy et al., 2015). Wireless sensors have
    been used in animal tracking and behavioural analysis (Asikainen et al., 2013,
    Huircán et al., 2010, Jeong and Yoe, 2012, Kwong et al., 2012, Nadimi et al.,
    2012) as well as odour and hazardous gas monitoring (Mamduh et al., 2012). There
    are also studies that focus on optimising the performance of the equipment used
    in livestock deployment, based on the imposed challenges of the situation at hand
    (Jeong & Yoe, 2012). Download : Download high-res image (151KB) Download : Download

    overview. 4.5. Food supply chain tracking Modern agriculture tends to be more
    and more industrialised. Therefore, standardisation mechanisms at each step for
    the product, from the grower to the consumer, have to be adopted in order to assure
    food safety and quality (Fig. 8). This need has led to a growing interest in food
    supply chain traceability systems. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies include
    plenty of solutions to contribute greatly to the construction, support and maintenance
    of such systems. In the reviewed literature, solutions focus either on the business
    side of Food Supply Chain (FSC) or technology. There are some works, though, which
    attempt to propose solutions for both sides. Recent developments in e-commerce
    have given a boost to various Supply Chain research activity. In this review,
    however, a focus only on FSC was attempted, since they are optimised for food
    supplies. Download : Download high-res image (206KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. Schematic representation of the food supply chain from the production
    phase until the final consumer. RFID is the most common IoT technology found in
    Food Supply Chain (FSC). RFID tags, acting as enhanced barcodes, enable the tracking
    of agricultural products. Recent research, following the IoT paradigm, has combined
    more than one sensor to enrich the information of product status whenever this
    is recorded through its RFID (Maksimovic et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2013). A common
    issue in IoT is its distributed nature and the asynchronous and heterogeneous
    flow of information. Therefore, naming is vital for the accurate and fast retrieval
    of information when it comes to FSC tracking services (Liu et al., 2015). The
    realisation of IoT-based infrastructure leads to the virtualisation of the supply
    chains, since physical proximity is no longer required (Verdouw et al., 2013).
    Various models analysing the FSC issues and the way IoT technologies tackle them
    appear in literature (Lianguang, 2014, Zhang, 2014). Technological evolution,
    combined with the increasing robustness and maturity of several technologies met
    in IoT, have given researchers the chance to develop complete systems, which incorporate
    sensing modules and software infrastructures. The software part of these systems
    is either hosted on cloud providers or shared among distributed shareholders.
    Complete systems offer automated services, intelligent schemes and automatic reasoning
    based on the measured phenomena and artificial intelligence (Chen, 2015, Jiang
    and Zhang, 2013, Xu et al., 2011). Other works present approaches on how to organise
    a complete FSC information management system (Li, Chen, & Zhu, 2013) or how to
    design the system in such a way that it maximises the economic profit (Pang, Chen,
    Han, & Zheng, 2015). 4.6. Internet of Things middleware and interoperability Interoperability
    at all levels is a key concept in the developing IoT world. Middleware is an approach
    that aims to facilitate interoperability (Fig. 9). The concept of interoperability
    in IoT can be expressed in many ways. Modern agriculture has evolved into a highly-intensive
    industry, expanding from the level of single grower up to international organisations.
    Therefore, agricultural-oriented IoT research offers literature in all aspects
    of interoperability, namely technical, syntactical, semantic and organisational
    interoperability . Download : Download high-res image (99KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 9. The dimensions of interoperability (Serrano et al., 2015).
    Technical interoperability is associated with hardware and software components,
    aiming to provide seamless exchange of information between systems (M2M). Syntactical
    interoperability has to do with data formats, i.e. the syntax that messages should
    have, in order to be exchanged between the systems, in the form of bit-tables
    or high level languages (HTML, XML, etc.). Semantic interoperability has a special
    value for end users, since it has to do with the human interpretation and understanding
    of the content produced by IoT systems. Finally, organisational interoperability
    is of high importance when it comes to IoT scalability. The ability to communicate
    effectively and transfer meaningful data, over highly varying systems and/or geographic
    regions is the key to success of distributed, global-IoT infrastructures (Serrano
    et al., 2015). Hu, Wang, She, and Wang (2011a) present a middleware to promote
    data (Technical) interoperability among various grain storage systems. Technical
    interoperability is the absolute basic type of interoperability a system must
    satisfy. At a higher level of intercommunication among systems, syntactical interoperability
    has to be implemented, in more generic, understandable and human-friendly messages.
    The incorporation of new, high-end, technologies, such as IoT, within a traditional
    productive sector, such as agriculture, and the trend of precision agriculture
    has given Semantic interoperability middleware an extra value. This is because
    Semantic interoperability middleware makes technology more intuitive and easier
    to understand, for both growers and agronomists (Jayaraman et al., 2015b, Sawant
    et al., 2014). Knowledge retrieval is a second feature of Semantic middleware.
    Data flows are organised and synthesised, allowing for better reasoning and management
    in agricultural (Perera et al., 2013, Yuan et al., 2013) and livestock (Saraswathi
    Sivamani, Park, Shin, Cho, & Cho, 2015) deployments. Moving one step further towards
    the realisation of large-scale national, or international cooperative deployments,
    organisational interoperability has been studied (Hu et al., 2011b, Sivamani et
    al., 2013). Providing the base for seamless cooperation between organisations
    presents numerous advantages, ranging from the technical level, for instance,
    quality improvement in sensing, reasoning and control systems by automatic exchange
    of knowledge between self-learning and self-improving systems, up to economic
    and business level by adapting the production rate according to market trends.
    4.7. Multi-layer deployments and commercial solutions IoT allows for the interoperability
    of the systems and organisations. Therefore, it makes it easier to interconnect
    systems involved in the various phases of a product''s lifecycle and several studies
    have presented systems which integrate numerous platforms that monitor, control
    and track agricultural products. Fu (2012) presents in short an intelligent agricultural
    system which could potentially be used in optimal melon and fruit production and
    management, as well as internet trading and supply chain tracking of organic goods.
    IoT concepts and technologies have been widely applied in many aspects of the
    transportation and storage of goods from the producer to the wholesale reseller
    to the consumer, from post-harvest treatment optimisation, storage facilities
    monitoring and management, and controlled environment shipping containers (Dittmer
    et al., 2012, Moon et al., 2015) to swarms of delivery drones (Yu, Subramanian,
    Ning, & Edwards, 2015), autonomous trucks and ships. IoT applications are there
    to drive future changes (Hribernik, Warden, Thoben, & Otthein, 2010). Several
    vendors have moved towards providing solutions either in the form of service or
    solutions that also include the hardware to do the monitoring. In all these cases
    cloud-based applications do the analysis of the data providing suggestions, warnings
    or control signals. These solutions do not only focus on large-scale production,
    but also on individual gardening and home production. Bitponics is cloud-based
    solution offering automated advisory services for garden care (Bitponics, 2016).
    Plantlink offers a solution for connecting garden to home users integrating sensors
    and irrigation controller in one network (Plantlink, 2016). Growtronix is a modular
    system that can monitor almost every aspect of indoor gardens and plant factories
    (Growtronix, 2016). Some promising smart greenhouse monitoring and control solutions
    are offered by Sensaphone, Monnit and GetSenso (GetSenso, 2016, Monnit, 2016,
    Sensaphone, 2016). These solutions aim to optimise climate in greenhouses minimising
    the risk of yield losses through a more optimal climate for the crops. In addition,
    Fieldclimate appears to be a rich platform providing both hardware (weather stations,
    sensor nodes) and cloud-based software solutions (weather forecast, irrigation
    management, disease models etc.) (FieldClimate, 2016). CropX is a complete system
    including field ground sensors measuring soil moisture and temperature, uploading
    the data to the cloud and offer a mapping and optimal irrigation planning as a
    service to the grower through a mobile application (CropX, 2016). Microsoft has
    recently launched its end-to-end IoT platform for agriculture. FarmBeats consists
    of UAV drones and sensors, connectivity support, and cloud infrastructure which
    includes machine learning-based backend analytics with predictive features, and
    cloud storage (Microsoft, 2015). 5. Discussion 5.1. Internet of Things hardware
    & software challenges in agriculture When it comes to IoT in agriculture, several
    challenges arise. Firstly, the equipment residing at the perception layer has
    to be exposed directly to harsh environmental phenomena, like high solar radiation,
    extreme temperatures, rain or high humidity, strong winds, vibrations and other
    dangers capable of destroying the electronic circuits. The end-devices will have
    to stay active and function reliably for long periods relying on the limited power
    resources of batteries. Therefore, appropriate programming tools and low-power
    capabilities are mandatory, since the frequent battery replacement or reset of
    the stations (in case of a program failure), for example in a large-scale open
    field deployment, is not easy. Power harvesting can be a solution to some extent,
    however, the power consumption has still to be within the power budget of small
    power harvesting modules (e.g. solar panels, wind turbines etc.). Furthermore,
    the large number of interconnected (in an internet-like manner) devices produces
    an incredibly large amount of data, which will soon be beyond the resource capacities
    of small-scale server infrastructures to handle (Atzori et al., 2010, Ziegeldorf
    et al., 2014). 5.2. Organisational challenges & interoperability When it comes
    to logistics for the food and agricultural sector, this infrastructure aims to
    facilitate the exchange of information and the transportation of goods, optimising
    the production process and the supply chain networks globally. IoT is gradually
    transforming business processes by providing more accurate and real-time visibility
    to the flow of materials and products (Lee & Lee, 2015). Cloud Computing provides
    high quality services, hardware-agnostic application development tools and sufficient
    storage and computational resources to store and process the data produced at
    the edge of the network. Therefore, it seems like an ideal complement for the
    IoT technologies towards the composition of “CloudIoT” paradigm (Botta et al.,
    2014). The huge amount of data produced at the edge of the network, however, can
    incur a severely high cost to be transferred to the cloud, both in terms of money
    and latency. Therefore, the optimal balancing between the edge storage and processing
    and the part of the workload that is to be done on the cloud is a serious matter.
    Fog Computing is an extension of the Cloud Computing paradigm, expanding cloud
    technologies and tools, as well as, the horizons of application development (Bonomi,
    Milito, Natarajan, & Zhu, 2014). 5.3. Networking challenges The characteristics
    of the environment do not only impose challenges to the hardware, but also to
    the network layer. Wireless communication is the most common in agricultural deployments,
    due to the lack of wiring costs. Environment is known to be one of the major factors
    which lead to low wireless link quality, through the multi-path propagation effects
    and its contribution to background noise (Wang et al., 2017). Real-world deployments
    have shown that the performance of popular transceivers is affected by temperature
    (Bannister et al., 2008, Boano et al., 2010), humidity (Thelen, 2004), human presence
    and other obstacles within the space in which a wireless node attempts to communicate.
    Therefore, data have to be transferred using robust and reliable technologies,
    according to the requirements and challenges of the rural environment. 5.4. Security
    challenges The transfer to an interconnected internet of “smart things” must ensure
    the security, authenticity, confidentiality and privacy of the stakeholders involved
    in this network. In other words, IoT must be secure against external attacks,
    in the perception layer, secure the aggregation of data in the network layer and
    offer specific guarantees that only authorised entities can access and modify
    data in the application layer. Security in IoT is summarised in three requirements:
    authentication, confidentiality and access control (Sicari, Rizzardi, Grieco,
    & Coen-Porisini, 2015). In the perception layer the most common security issues
    include information acquisition security and physical security of the hardware.
    The latter one is quite important in the case of agriculture, since the devices
    can be deployed in open fields and function without surveillance for long periods.
    Due to the distributed nature of IoT and the fact that its devices may be deployed
    in diverse environments, a single security protocol is, usually, not enough (Li,
    2012). RFID security issues are usually related to leakage of information, which
    can unveil the location and other sensitive data. Security countermeasures include
    data encryption, use of blocker tags, tag frequency modification, jamming and,
    finally, tag destruction policy, in other words the physical ending of a tag''s
    life (Matharu, Upadhyay, & Chaudhary, 2014). Sensor nodes differ from RFID tags,
    in the way that sensors are active and relate to dynamic properties of things.
    Therefore, encryption algorithms, key distribution policies, intrusion detection
    mechanisms and security routing policies have to be deployed, always keeping in
    mind the hardware restrictions of smart devices. In the current IoT concept, data
    flow from the end devices to a gateway, which is in charge of uploading these
    data to other infrastructures, such as the cloud. Various security policies for
    sensor terminals exist, including cryptographic algorithms, identity authentication
    mechanisms, data flow control policies, data filtering mechanisms etc. (Li, 2012).
    Moreover, the perception layer requires information acquisition security measures
    too. Wiretapping, tampering, cheating, and replay attacks are just a few of the
    security threats. Therefore, authenticity, confidentiality and data integrity
    have to be ensured during the phase of data acquisition, and key management protocols
    and secure routing policies should be adopted and sensor node authentication policies
    must be leveraged to prevent data access by unauthorised entities (Gou, Yan, Liu,
    & Li, 2013). 5.5. Stack challenges Middleware is another part of IoT presenting
    specific requirements for increased security, since it stands between the network
    and application layers and is responsible both for data processing and communication
    interface between these two layers. Security in the middleware layer requires
    confidentiality and secure data storage. Wireless medium is challenging, when
    it comes to security in transmissions, even for more sophisticated hardware than
    the platforms met in IoT deployments. Therefore, the IoT architecture can easily
    be exposed to risks, such as denial of service attacks, unauthorised access, man-in-the-middle
    attacks, and virus injections which target and affect confidentiality and data
    integrity. Authentication, intrusion detection, key management and negotiation
    mechanisms could possibly provide solutions against the network layer threats.
    Application layer is the top layer in the IoT vision. It is the place where enormous
    flows of data streams end, requiring increased storage and computational resources.
    This is why the application layer is so closely-related with the cloud. The security
    issues here are not very different from the security issues of the cloud itself,
    including data security, privacy, backup and recovery. Control mechanisms need
    to administer the privileges and ownership of data and manage the access rights
    to all, or part of the information, both for physical users and between machines,
    or even organisations. 5.6. Potential value of IoT in agriculture Internet of
    Things is rapidly evolving and many novel applications and services are emerging
    from it. A great amount of research is being conducting towards the integration
    of various heterogeneous systems, the security assurance at various levels of
    IoT and the analytics, which will give a better insight into the “Big Data” in
    order to optimise various business processes. National policy of governments around
    the world for increased production rate of fresh-cut vegetables and meat, at lower
    price, with higher quality standards, as well as, the consumers'' demand for transparency
    in the production cycle and the environmental footprint of the products they buy,
    provide IoT a huge field for development and diffusion. According to Bradley,
    Barbier, and Handler (2013), the estimates from 2013 to 2022 of potential IoT
    value vary significantly, ranging from a minimum of $1 trillion up to more than
    $15 trillion, not including the increased revenues, the benefits of cost reduction
    among companies and industries and the general economic activity due to IoT. Much
    of the added-value of IoT comes from the flexibility and the optimisation and
    precision that it introduces into the production processes of industry and production
    units of all types. Therefore, it is not so risky to forecast that agricultural
    sector processes at all levels will drastically change in the very near future.
    Obviously the economic numbers related to IoT are very big, tempting some very
    serious players to invest in it. Examples, like the recent purchase of Nest Labs,
    a company specialising in IoT for home automation, by Google for $3.2 billion
    in cash and the purchase of Jasper Technologies, developer of and IoT cloud platform,
    by Cisco for $1.4 billion, reveal the great potential of IoT and prove that it
    is highly attractive to big investors and behemoth technological firms. The partnership
    formation, however, is not so trivial. This is due to the fact that the companies
    involved in IoT invest in one or a few aspects of it, because of its wide nature.
    Therefore, sooner or later, they will have to cooperate with each other, putting
    aside any competition, or the notion of who is more important, in order to introduce
    some universal standards in the evolving IoT hype. 6. Conclusion When it comes
    to agriculture, IoT is expected to optimise the production by many means. Farmlands
    and greenhouses are about to move from precision to a micro-precision model of
    agricultural production. Distributed, pervasive computing and precise monitoring
    of the facilities will provide the optimal growing or living conditions for both
    vegetables and animals. Autonomous systems will be able not only to command the
    actuators in the most efficient way, optimising the utility and resource usage,
    but also to control the production in accordance to the market situation, maximising
    the profit and minimising the costs in every possible way. On the other hand,
    food supply chains, equipped with WSN and RFID equipment, will be able to monitor
    each stage in the life of a product, make automatic reasoning, in case of a faulty
    product and increase consumer''s feeling of safety, through a transparent product
    lifecycle information system. All the above is the optimistic approach of the
    IoT integration in agriculture. However, in this concept, plenty of individual
    players are about to participate. First of all, local networks have to be secured
    against interference from other networks, especially as these technologies reach
    their full potential. In a real IoT scenario, most of the players will use different
    equipment, with different technical specifications and/or sensor characteristics.
    Obviously, the interoperability, the filtering and the semantic annotation of
    the data, coming from each producer, has to be made to some extent. This is the
    only way in which the data, coming from vastly heterogeneous sources, can be used
    to optimise a shared decision support or expert system. Security, anonymity and
    control over the access rights on the information is vital for such a system to
    be adopted. In a wider perspective, many of the data related to business/institution
    strategic planning cannot be disclosed or retrieved by non-authorised entities,
    so that the market is safe against unorthodox tactics. References Ahonen et al.,

    • The role of Internet of Things in arable farming is reviewed. • Internet of
    Things is leading arable farming to become data-driven. • Implementation and application
    are described in depth. • Challenges, corresponding solutions and potentials are
    discussed thoroughly. The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically
    arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective
    production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental
    impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential
    application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly
    varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges
    to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes
    an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline
    of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible
    solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for
    the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones,
    intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated
    Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles
    and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart
    arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered,
    and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the
    architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared
    standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption,
    network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have
    been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different
    solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such
    as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. Previous

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    searching criteria: (Internet of things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. IoT architecture represented by device, network and application
    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    \ countries with water scarcity.\nThis also aﬀects\nagriculture, as a large amount\
    \ of water is dedicated to that use. The possible consequences of global\nwarming\
    \ lead to the consideration of creating water adaptation measures to ensure the\
    \ availability\nof water for food production and consumption. Thus, studies aimed\
    \ at saving water usage in the\nirrigation process have increased over the years.\
    \ Typical commercial sensors for agriculture irrigation\nsystems are very expensive,\
    \ making it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of\nsystem.\
    \ However, manufacturers are currently oﬀering low-cost sensors that can be connected\
    \ to\nnodes to implement aﬀordable systems for irrigation management and agriculture\
    \ monitoring. Due to\nthe recent advances in IoT and WSN technologies that can\
    \ be applied in the development of these\nsystems, we present a survey aimed at\
    \ summarizing the current state of the art regarding smart\nirrigation systems.\
    \ We determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation systems regarding\n\
    water quantity and quality, soil characteristics and weather conditions. We provide\
    \ an overview of\nthe most utilized nodes and wireless technologies. Lastly, we\
    \ will discuss the challenges and the best\npractices for the implementation of\
    \ sensor-based irrigation systems.\nKeywords: irrigation; IoT; precision agriculture;\
    \ sensors\n1. Introduction\nThe lack of fresh water is a rising concern, particularly\
    \ in the Mediterranean countries or southern\nAsian countries such as India. Among\
    \ the countries in Europe, the Mediterranean countries are the\nmost vulnerable\
    \ to drought [1]. A connection has been established between climate policies and\
    \ water\nmanagement. Water management can be aﬀected by diﬀerent variables such\
    \ as the water demand\nfrom the diﬀerent sectors or the consequences of some degrees\
    \ of warming on hydrological resources.\nClimate change and its eﬀects are a recurrent\
    \ topic in research papers regarding water resources and\nagriculture. The possible\
    \ consequences of global warming have led to the consideration of creating\nwater\
    \ adaptation measures to ensure the availability of water for food production\
    \ and people and\nto maintain ecosystems [2]. Furthermore, the safety of the water\
    \ to be consumed by humans and\nto be returned to the environment must be ensured.\
    \ The possible risks of climate change are an\nincrease in water shortage, the\
    \ reduction of water quality, the increase in water and soil salinity,\nthe biodiversity\
    \ loss, the increase in irrigation requirements or the possible cost of emergency\
    \ and\nremediation actions. These reasons have led to an increase in the number\
    \ of studies focused on\nreducing water usage in irrigation processes. Some of\
    \ these studies suggest the implementation of\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042; doi:10.3390/s20041042\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n2 of 48\nsocial, economic\
    \ and climate change policies, as well as the implementation of technological\
    \ innovations\nto improve water management.\nThe agricultural sector is one of\
    \ the most important economic resources in these countries\nadding to the importance\
    \ of managing well the available water resources to ensure the continuing\nof\
    \ this economical sector. In India, 10% of the area of the country is covered\
    \ by rice plantations [3].\nFurthermore, 20% of the Indian population is below\
    \ poverty levels and 15% is food insecure. Therefore,\nlow food production aﬀects\
    \ both the population and the economy. In 2002, the monsoon season\nproduced the\
    \ least amount of precipitation in the last 130 years. That resulted in a loss\
    \ of rice production\ndue to the lack of fresh water. To determine the drought\
    \ caused by anomalies in surface water, the\nStandardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration\
    \ Index (SPEI) was utilized. These indexes and the\ninformation gathered from\
    \ sensors that monitor the environment, the soil and the water can be utilized\n\
    to determine the current state of the water and the possibility of covering all\
    \ the freshwater needs.\nCountries with higher funds are already implementing\
    \ systems for water management and water\nreuse aiming to optimize water usage\
    \ and reduce the environmental impact caused by utilizing great\namounts of water.\
    \ However, some countries may ﬁnd these solutions to be costly.\nCommercial sensors\
    \ for systems aimed for agriculture and its irrigation are very expensive,\nmaking\
    \ it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of system on their\
    \ farms. However,\nmanufacturers are currently oﬀering low-cost sensors that can\
    \ be connected to nodes to implement\nlow-cost systems for irrigation management\
    \ and agriculture monitoring. Furthermore, due to the\ninterest in low-cost sensors\
    \ for monitoring agriculture and water, new low-cost sensors are being\nproposed\
    \ in researches such as a leaf water stress monitoring sensor [4], a multi-level\
    \ soil moisture\nsensor comprised of copper rings placed along a PVC pipe [5],\
    \ a water salinity monitoring sensor\nmade with copper coils [6] or a water turbidity\
    \ sensor made with colored and infrared led emitters\nand receptors [7].\nDue\
    \ to the recent advances in sensors for the implementation of irrigation systems\
    \ for agriculture\nand the evolution of WSN and IoT technologies that can be applied\
    \ in the development of these\nsystems, we present a survey aimed at summarizing\
    \ the current state of the art regarding smart\nirrigation systems. In this survey,\
    \ we are going to provide an overview of the state of the research\nregarding\
    \ irrigation systems. We will determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation\n\
    systems regarding water quantity and quality, soil characteristics, weather conditions,\
    \ and fertilizer\nusage. We will provide an overview of the most utilized nodes\
    \ and wireless technologies employed to\nimplement WSN and IoT based smart irrigation\
    \ systems. Lastly, we will discuss the challenges and the\nbest practices for\
    \ the implementation of sensor-based irrigation systems.\nOther authors have performed\
    \ studies with a focus on irrigation systems, water management\nor precision agriculture\
    \ systems. However, the other available surveys on smart irrigation systems\n\
    analyzed quite a few papers [8–12] and therefore do not provide an in-depth analysis\
    \ of the state\nof the art regarding irrigation systems. Others are focused on\
    \ speciﬁc aspects regarding irrigation\nsuch as software for irrigation systems\
    \ [13], pivot-center speciﬁc irrigation systems [14] or irrigation\nsystems for\
    \ greenhouses [15]. Lastly, there are surveys that focus on precision agriculture\
    \ [16–21], crop\nmonitoring [22] and the agro-industrial and environmental ﬁelds\
    \ of agriculture [23] that comment on\nirrigation agriculture. In this survey,\
    \ we provide an overview of the current advances in irrigation\nsystems and the\
    \ utilized sensors and actuators. Furthermore, we provide discuss the most utilized\n\
    nodes and the wireless technologies employed for the communication and transmission\
    \ of the data\ngathered by the sensors. This way, with this work we address the\
    \ current gap in literature with a\nsurvey that provides an overview of IoT-based\
    \ smart irrigation systems.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section\
    \ 2 presents the methodology employed to\nperform the survey. Section 3 presents\
    \ the water management techniques utilized in current studies, the\nparameters\
    \ that are utilized to determine the irrigation schedule and the related actuators.\
    \ The sensors\nand parameters considered for the soil monitoring aspects of the\
    \ evaluated smart irrigation systems\nare depicted in Section 4. The most monitored\
    \ weather parameters and the sensors that monitor\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n3 of\
    \ 48\nthem are presented in Section 5. Section 6 comments on the most utilized\
    \ nodes for IoT and WSN\nirrigation systems and the most popular wireless communication\
    \ technologies and cloud platforms.\nThe discussion of the current trends regarding\
    \ IoT crop irrigation systems is presented in Section 7.\nLastly, the conclusion\
    \ and future work are presented in Section 8.\n2. Materials and Methods\nIn this\
    \ section, the process followed to elaborate this paper is presented. To perform\
    \ this study,\nthe following research questions were considered: What are the\
    \ current IoT solutions for smart\nirrigation for agriculture? What sensors, actuators,\
    \ nodes, and wireless technologies are being utilized\nto develop IoT irrigation\
    \ systems? Search engines and digital libraries were utilized by the authors to\n\
    search manually for papers suitable for this survey. A total of 283 papers were\
    \ obtained from Google\nScholar [24], IEEE explore [25], Scopus [26] and the digital\
    \ library of Sensors [27]. The keywords\nemployed to obtain the total number of\
    \ papers to be analyzed were IoT irrigation, IoT irrigation system,\nand smart\
    \ irrigation. Furthermore, all papers were checked to ensure they included the\
    \ keywords\nirrigation or water and IoT or smart in their content.\nIn order to\
    \ discern which papers to use, only papers written in English were considered.\n\
    Furthermore, to observe the recent evolution in this ﬁeld, the selected papers\
    \ were published from\nthe years 2014 to 2019 (both years inclusive). Finally,\
    \ a total of 178 papers were utilized to compile\nthis review.\nAfter the selection\
    \ process, all papers were classiﬁed manually into IoT irrigation systems and\n\
    architecture, protocol and sensor proposals that were not used to create the ﬁgures\
    \ in this paper but\ndiscussed relevant information. The papers from the ﬁrst\
    \ group (160) were then analyzed to determine\nthe sensors and actuators that\
    \ were employed to develop the IoT irrigation system, the parameters\nthat were\
    \ monitored, the type of irrigation and agriculture, the type of node, the type\
    \ of wireless\ntechnology and data visualization technique that was utilized to\
    \ access the data and to manually\nchoose the actions of the irrigation system.\
    \ All the collected data has been then classiﬁed into diﬀerent\nsections and converted\
    \ into graphs and tables to provide a complete overview of the actual state of\
    \ the\nart regarding IoT irrigation systems.\nThe distribution of the papers regarding\
    \ the country of the ﬁrst author is presented in Figure 1.\nAs it can be seen,\
    \ the countries that investigate IoT systems for irrigation are countries where\
    \ agriculture\nis a major economic source. India is the country with the highest\
    \ number of papers with a total of\n92 papers, 57.5% of the total. China and Spain\
    \ are tied with seven papers each. Costa Rica, Ecuador,\nIndonesia Thailand, and\
    \ the USA have between three and six papers. The rest of the countries that\n\
    have investigated IoT systems for irrigation have one or two papers.\nIt is remarkable\
    \ that only one out of the ﬁve countries with the highest agricultural land area\n\
    (China, USA, Australia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan) is included in the top ﬁve countries\
    \ of our survey\nin terms of water management. India, which is the country with\
    \ the highest production of papers\nthat presents IoT systems for water management\
    \ is the 7th country in terms of agricultural land area.\nWith regard to the top\
    \ six countries, in terms of published papers with irrigation systems, three of\n\
    them (India, China, and Spain) have regions with high and moderate water scarcity\
    \ problems. Again,\nthere are some countries with regions aﬀected by water scarcity\
    \ that use irrigation systems in their\nagriculture and have published fewer papers\
    \ on irrigation systems like the USA. Nonetheless, it does\nnot mean that in these\
    \ countries no eﬀorts are done in order to reduce water use in agriculture. It\
    \ is\npossible that in these countries the major eﬀorts are done by enterprises\
    \ and their ﬁndings are directly\npatented and distributed in the marked. Most\
    \ of the papers are published by authors who come from\ndeveloping countries.\n\
    As per the number of papers per year of publication, see Figure 2, the interest\
    \ in this topic has\nbeen increasing over the years. The lower amount of papers\
    \ for 2019 is due to the year not being\nﬁnished when the selection process of\
    \ the papers was completed. Thus, not all the papers performed\nin 2019 had been\
    \ published.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n4 of 48\n \nThe distribution of the papers\
    \ regarding the country of the first author is presented in Figure 1. \nAs it\
    \ can be seen, the countries that investigate IoT systems for irrigation are countries\
    \ where \nagriculture is a major economic source. India is the country with the\
    \ highest number of papers with \na total of 92 papers, 57.5% of the total. China\
    \ and Spain are tied with seven papers each. Costa Rica, \nEcuador, Indonesia\
    \ Thailand, and the USA have between three and six papers. The rest of the \n\
    countries that have investigated IoT systems for irrigation have one or two papers.\

    \ per country. \nFigure 1. Number of published papers presenting IoT systems for\
    \ irrigation per country.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n4 of 48 \nIt is remarkable that\
    \ only one out of the five countries with the highest agricultural land area \n\
    (China, USA, Australia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan) is included in the top five countries\
    \ of our survey in \nterms of water management. India, which is the country with\
    \ the highest production of papers that \npresents IoT systems for water management\
    \ is the 7th country in terms of agricultural land area. With \nregard to the\
    \ top six countries, in terms of published papers with irrigation systems, three\
    \ of them \n(India, China, and Spain) have regions with high and moderate water\
    \ scarcity problems. Again, there \nare some countries with regions affected by\
    \ water scarcity that use irrigation systems in their \nagriculture and have published\
    \ fewer papers on irrigation systems like the USA. Nonetheless, it does \nnot\
    \ mean that in these countries no efforts are done in order to reduce water use\
    \ in agriculture. It is \npossible that in these countries the major efforts are\
    \ done by enterprises and their findings are directly \npatented and distributed\
    \ in the marked. Most of the papers are published by authors who come from \n\
    developing countries.  \nAs per the number of papers per year of publication,\
    \ see Figure 2, the interest in this topic has \nbeen increasing over the years.\
    \ The lower amount of papers for 2019 is due to the year not being \nfinished\
    \ when the selection process of the papers was completed. Thus, not all the papers\
    \ performed \nin 2019 had been published. \n \nFigure 2. Number of published papers\
    \ presenting IoT systems for irrigation per year. \n3. Water Management \nIn this\
    \ section, we present the information and analysis of papers that present different\
    \ \ntechniques for water management in the irrigation process. For this analysis,\
    \ we consider the papers \nthat include any sort of water pumping actuator as\
    \ an irrigation system. From a total of 178 evaluated \npapers, 107 of them present\
    \ an actuator for irrigation. After analyzing the 107 papers we discard the \n\
    ones that just offer partial information, a total of 89 papers are included in\
    \ this section.  \nIn the agriculture activities that use water inputs, also known\
    \ as irrigated agriculture, there are \ndifferent manners to distribute the water.\
    \ The different options present different efficiency and, in \nsome cases, a specific\
    \ manner should be used for a specific crop. The specific manners to irrigate\
    \ have \na great variety but we can divide them into the following categories:\
    \ Attending to the way of water \nis distributed we can consider: (i) flood irrigation,\
    \ (ii) spray irrigation, (iii) drip irrigation, and (iv) \nnebulizer irrigation.\
    \ Regarding the existence of sensing systems we can have: (i) irrigation without\
    \ \nany consideration, when the amount of water is not calculated or estimated,\
    \ (ii) scheduled irrigation, \nwhen the water is supplied according to the estimated\
    \ needs in a period of year, (iii) Ad hoc irrigation, \nwhen the amount of water\
    \ is calculated based on the sensors measurements. The vast majority of the \n\
    papers included in this section propose to use pumps and valves to distribute\
    \ the water in \nconjunction with sensors to measure environmental parameters\
    \ in order to calculate the water needs. \nFrom the 89 evaluated papers in this\
    \ section, 83 include clear information of the proposed irrigation \nsystem, the\
    \ other six only mention that they include actuators for irrigation, see Figure\
    \ 3. Those 83 \ninclude different levels of detail, there are 49 papers that only\
    \ indicate that there are motor/pumps in \nFigure 2. Number of published papers\
    \ presenting IoT systems for irrigation per year.\n3. Water Management\nIn this\
    \ section, we present the information and analysis of papers that present diﬀerent\

    \ The diﬀerent options present diﬀerent eﬃciency and,\nin some cases, a speciﬁc\
    \ manner should be used for a speciﬁc crop. The speciﬁc manners to irrigate\n\
    have a great variety but we can divide them into the following categories: Attending\
    \ to the way\nof water is distributed we can consider: (i) ﬂood irrigation, (ii)\
    \ spray irrigation, (iii) drip irrigation,\nand (iv) nebulizer irrigation. Regarding\
    \ the existence of sensing systems we can have: (i) irrigation\nwithout any consideration,\
    \ when the amount of water is not calculated or estimated, (ii) scheduled\nirrigation,\
    \ when the water is supplied according to the estimated needs in a period of year,\
    \ (iii) Ad\nhoc irrigation, when the amount of water is calculated based on the\
    \ sensors measurements. The vast\nmajority of the papers included in this section\
    \ propose to use pumps and valves to distribute the water\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n\

    \ This information is presented in Figure 5. A paper that monitored the soil\n\

    \ (see Figure 6).\nFrom the 89 included papers, more than half of the proposals\
    \ measure between three and four\nparameters. Measuring fewer parameters (one\

    \ On the other hand, there are ﬁve\npapers (6% of cases) that do not measure any\
    \ parameter [33,41,77–79].\nNext, the details about the measured parameters are\
    \ shown. Regarding the sensors of soil, plants,\nand water (see Figure 7), the\
    \ most used sensor in the systems is the soil moisture sensor, it is used in 76\n\
    papers (more details in Section 4). First, we will analyze the data from soil\
    \ and plant sensors. The soil\ntemperature is much less considered in these systems,\
    \ it is only measured in seven proposals. Attending\nto the soil characteristics,\
    \ in one proposal the authors use a sensor that monitored the nutrients of the\n\
    soil [80]. There are 14 proposals of IoT for irrigation management that include\
    \ a pH sensor. However,\nnot all of them specify if the pH sensors are for the\
    \ soil or for the water [31,42,49,54,68,70,74,75,81,82],\nonly four of them indicate\
    \ this (three for soil [66,67,72] and one for water [69]). Only four papers\n\
    consider plant monitoring, in two papers the measured parameter is the plant height\
    \ [64,83], using an\nultrasound sensor. In the other two cases, the leaf wetness\
    \ was considered in their system [46,84,85].\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n7 of 48\n\
    Diﬀerent sensors are used, [84] used a sensor based on optical signals while [46]\
    \ utilized a commercial\nFC-37 sensor (Lydia Vogler, Peißenberg, Germany).\n \n\

    \ this (three for soil [66,67,72] and one \nfor water [69]). Only four papers\
    \ consider plant monitoring, in two papers the measured parameter \nis the plant\
    \ height [64,83], using an ultrasound sensor. In the other two cases, the leaf\
    \ wetness was \nconsidered in their system [46,84,85]. Different sensors are used,\
    \ [84] used a sensor based on optical \nsignals while [46] utilized a commercial\
    \ FC-37 sensor (Lydia Vogler, Peißenberg, Germany).  \nNow, the data from the\
    \ water sensor are presented. In this case, we will consider for the \ncommentaries\
    \ not only the data of the graphic (proposals with irrigation system) but also\
    \ the \ninformation of the paper which measures the water quality, having or not\
    \ the actuators for the \nirrigation system. The water level in the tanks is measured\
    \ in 17 [32,36,51,57,58,61,62,64,69,85–92] out \nof 88 papers that have a pumping\
    \ system. There are different methods to monitor the water level in \nthe tanks\
    \ and the most used is the one based on ultrasound [32,69,89], the resistive methodology\
    \ is \nused in one case [36], the rest of cases do not offer information of how\
    \ the data is measured. In the \ncase of sensors based on ultrasound methods,\
    \ the most utilized sensor is the HC-SR04 (Shenzhenshi \nguoyun dianzishangwu\
    \ youxiangongsi , Shenzhen, China, used in [69]). In addition, there are six \n\
    papers that do not include an actuator for the irrigation system even when they\
    \ have water level \nsensors [60,93–97]. There are nine papers where sensors for\
    \ monitoring water flow are utilized \n[14,31,42,45,50,64,75,76,82]. The sensors\
    \ used are only described in two cases, the commercial Gems \nFT110 G3/8 sensor\
    \ (Gems Sensors and Controls, Mumbai, India) is used in [75] and the YF-S402 \n\
    (Wuhan yingying yingying xinxi jishu youxian gongsi , Wuhan, China) in the proposal\
    \ presented in \n[76]. Both sensors are based on a Hall effect turbine. They have\
    \ different prices and similar \noperational ranges. The Gems FT110 G3/8 can measure\
    \ flows between 0.5 to 5 L/min. The other \nsensor, the YF-S402, is capable of\
    \ measuring flows between 0.3 to 6 L/min. Moreover, water flow \nsensors are used\
    \ in three other proposals that do not include actuators for irrigation systems\
    \ [5,98,99]. \nRegarding water quality, the water conductivity is monitored in\
    \ four proposals [51,68,69,75]. Only in \none case [75], the authors indicate\
    \ the used sensor. They use commercial sensors for monitoring pH \nand conductivity\
    \ from B&C Electronics (Carnate , Italy). \n  \nFigure 7. Monitored parameters\
    \ from the soil, water, and plants in papers that propose an irrigation \nsystem.\
    \ \nAdditionally, there are two papers without an actuator for irrigation systems\
    \ that include in \ntheir proposals a sensor for conductivity [98,100]. Nevertheless,\

    \ In this case, we will consider for the\ncommentaries not only the data of the\
    \ graphic (proposals with irrigation system) but also the\ninformation of the\
    \ paper which measures the water quality, having or not the actuators for the\
    \ irrigation\nsystem. The water level in the tanks is measured in 17 [32,36,51,57,58,61,62,64,69,85–92]\
    \ out of 88 papers\nthat have a pumping system. There are diﬀerent methods to\
    \ monitor the water level in the tanks\nand the most used is the one based on\
    \ ultrasound [32,69,89], the resistive methodology is used in\none case [36],\
    \ the rest of cases do not oﬀer information of how the data is measured. In the\
    \ case of\nsensors based on ultrasound methods, the most utilized sensor is the\
    \ HC-SR04 (Shenzhenshi guoyun\ndianzishangwu youxiangongsi, Shenzhen, China, used\
    \ in [69]). In addition, there are six papers that\ndo not include an actuator\
    \ for the irrigation system even when they have water level sensors [60,93–97].\n\
    There are nine papers where sensors for monitoring water ﬂow are utilized [14,31,42,45,50,64,75,76,82].\n\
    The sensors used are only described in two cases, the commercial Gems FT110 G3/8\
    \ sensor (Gems\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n8 of 48\nSensors and Controls, Mumbai,\
    \ India) is used in [75] and the YF-S402 (Wuhan yingying yingying xinxi\njishu\
    \ youxian gongsi, Wuhan, China) in the proposal presented in [76]. Both sensors\
    \ are based on a\nHall eﬀect turbine. They have diﬀerent prices and similar operational\
    \ ranges. The Gems FT110 G3/8\ncan measure ﬂows between 0.5 to 5 L/min. The other\
    \ sensor, the YF-S402, is capable of measuring\nﬂows between 0.3 to 6 L/min. Moreover,\
    \ water ﬂow sensors are used in three other proposals that do\nnot include actuators\
    \ for irrigation systems [5,98,99]. Regarding water quality, the water conductivity\n\
    is monitored in four proposals [51,68,69,75]. Only in one case [75], the authors\
    \ indicate the used\nsensor. They use commercial sensors for monitoring pH and\
    \ conductivity from B&C Electronics\n(Carnate, Italy).\nAdditionally, there are\
    \ two papers without an actuator for irrigation systems that include in their\n\
    proposals a sensor for conductivity [98,100]. Nevertheless, no data regarding\
    \ the equipment used are\ngiven. Regarding the pH of water, it is monitored in\
    \ another three papers (apart from [69]) [99,101,102].\nIn one case [99], the\
    \ authors specify the used sensor, the Lutron Pe-03 (Lutron, Taipei, Taiwan).\n\
    The temperature of the water is measured in two proposals [51,69]. Only in one\
    \ case [69] did the\nauthors specify that the used sensor is the DS18B20 (Adafruit\
    \ Industries, New York, NY, USA). No other\nproposals evaluated in this survey\
    \ (having or not irrigation system) presented the use of temperature\nsensors\
    \ for the water.\nOn the other hand, with regard to the proposals that monitored\
    \ the atmospheric parameter,\nthe data is presented in Figure 8. Next, we are\
    \ presenting the importance of these sensors for irrigation\nsystems. No details\
    \ of which sensors are used in which papers are given in this section. This information\n\
    will be further discussed in Section 5. The air temperature is the most measured\
    \ parameter, it is\nmonitored in 58 papers. A total of 51 proposals include a\
    \ humidity sensor. Other parameters are less\nmeasured such as the rain, which\
    \ is measured in eight out of 89 papers that proposed an irrigation\nsystem, or\
    \ the wind, measured in only one paper. Meanwhile, there are 15 proposals that\
    \ consider the\nweather forecast. From those 15 proposals, 10 of them use the\
    \ data from the forecast in conjunction\nwith the data gathered by sensors and\
    \ ﬁve proposals use the weather forecast as the sole information\nfor weather\
    \ data/atmospheric parameters.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n8 of 48 \n[99,101,102].\
    \ In one case [99], the authors specify the used sensor, the Lutron Pe-03 (Lutron,\
    \ Taipei, \nTaiwan). The temperature of the water is measured in two proposals\
    \ [51,69]. Only in one case [69] \ndid the authors specify that the used sensor\
    \ is the DS18B20 (Adafruit Industries, New York, New \nYork, USA). No other proposals\
    \ evaluated in this survey (having or not irrigation system) presented \nthe use\
    \ of temperature sensors for the water.  \nOn the other hand, with regard to the\
    \ proposals that monitored the atmospheric parameter, the \ndata is presented\
    \ in Figure 8. Next, we are presenting the importance of these sensors for irrigation\
    \ \nsystems. No details of which sensors are used in which papers are given in\
    \ this section. This \ninformation will be further discussed in Section 5. The\
    \ air temperature is the most measured \nparameter, it is monitored in 58 papers.\

    \ 10 of them use the data from \nthe forecast in conjunction with the data gathered\
    \ by sensors and five proposals use the weather \nforecast as the sole information\
    \ for weather data/atmospheric parameters. \n  \nFigure 8. Monitored atmospheric\

    \ only the irrigation system as an actuator.\nThere are seven papers (8% of cases)\

    \ the most used actuator in the diﬀerent irrigation systems.\nTherefore, we do\
    \ not include the use of irrigation actuators in Figure 10. The most utilized\
    \ actuator is\nthe sound emitter, used in seven cases [32,49,58,59,61,66,103].\
    \ It is generally used as an alarm for the\nfarmers or as a dissuasive measure\
    \ to prevent the entry of animals into the farming lands. In second\nposition,\
    \ we found the use of artiﬁcial light systems. They are used in six cases [36,38,50,71,72,75].\n\
    The use of artiﬁcial light is mainly related to the generation of artiﬁcial photo-\

    \ purposes. Fans are included in ﬁve proposals\nand their use is related to modifying\
    \ the atmospheric conditions (temperature, humidity or even the\nbalance between\
    \ CO2/O2). The proposals that include the use of fans are [39,65,68,72,75]. The\

    \ in Figure 10 the description of the selected actuators. Since we are considering\
    \ \nonly the papers that include an irrigation system, the most used actuator\
    \ in the different irrigation \nsystems. Therefore, we do not include the use\
    \ of irrigation actuators in Figure 10. The most utilized \nactuator is the sound\
    \ emitter, used in seven cases [32,49,58,59,61,66,103]. It is generally used as\

    \ Fans are \nincluded in five proposals and their use is related to modifying\

    \ can estimate the potential ET given a location. For ET monitoring, remote sensing\
    \ is the\nbest option as many papers point out [106–108]. Among the possibilities\
    \ for ET monitoring with sensors,\nthe integration of soil moisture changes can\
    \ oﬀer evaporation data. Nonetheless, the measurement of\ntranspiration is more\
    \ complex; it can be estimated with the data of sensors that measure radiation,\n\
    leaf area index, and vapor pressure deﬁcit [109]. Due to the complexity of its\
    \ measurement, it is not\nincluded as a monitored variable in most of the papers\

    Most of those proposals use similar sensors based on the conductivity between\
    \ two electrodes.\nDiﬀerent models of the aforementioned sensor have been used\
    \ in the proposals (see Figure 13). The most\nused sensor, based on conductivity,\
    \ is the YL69 (SparkFun Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA). It has been\nused in nine\
    \ proposals [44,56,71,87,95,115–118]. This sensor is characterized by a low price\
    \ and it is\ncreated speciﬁcally to operate with Arduino (and similar nodes).\
    \ The output voltage goes from 3.3\nto 5 V and the output values are related to\
    \ soil moisture (0 to 300 for dry soil, 300 to 700 humid soil).\nNevertheless,\
    \ it is not possible to have a measure that indicates exactly the value of moisture\
    \ without\nperforming new tests and calibration of the sensor. The same range\
    \ of measure is found in the other\nused sensor based on the same principle, the\
    \ FC-28 (Uruktech, Baghdad, Iraq, used in [34,72,76]) and\nthe SEN0114 (DFRobot,\
    \ Shanghai, China, used in [46]). The S-XNQ-04 sensor (XNQ Electric Company\n\
    Store, Beijing, China), used in [55] has a similar operation principle. However,\
    \ it is composed of three\nelectrodes. In this case, the sensor output voltage\
    \ goes from 0 to 2 V and the sensor is capable of\nmeasuring the soil moisture\
    \ giving as a response the relative saturation moisture content expressed\nin\
    \ percentage (%). This sensor has an accuracy of 3% and it can measure from 0\
    \ to 100% of relative\nsaturation. It can operate from −40 to 85 ◦C.\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, x \n12 of 48 \nsensors goes from −40 °C to 85 °C and its accuracy\
    \ is ±0.5 °C. The operation principle of this sensor is \nnot specified in the\
    \ datasheet.  \n \nFigure 13. Number of papers that used different models of soil\
    \ moisture sensors. \nIn terms of sensors for soil nutrients, three papers include\
    \ in their proposals sensors for \nmonitoring this variable [5,80,102]; nonetheless,\
    \ not all of them indicate the used sensor. The only \npaper that clearly indicates\
    \ the utilized sensor is the proposal presented in [80] includes an 1185 \nSunRom\
    \ color sensor (Sunrom Electronics, Ahmedabad, India). This sensor is based on\

    \ time, the VH400 (Vegetronix,\nInc., Riverton, UT, USA), is utilized in [37,40,89,96,119,120].\
    \ These sensors can be used from 40 ◦C to\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n12 of 48\n\
    85 ◦C, but the accuracy and operational range of the sensor probe are not indicated\
    \ in its datasheet.\nThe operational principle of this sensor is based on the\
    \ measurement of the dielectric constant of the\nsoil using transmission line\
    \ techniques to measure the moisture in any type of soil notwithstanding\nsoil\
    \ salinity. The output voltage of this sensor goes from 0 to 3 V. This output\
    \ voltage is related to\nthe volumetric water content in the soil. The sensor\
    \ does not oﬀer a linear relationship between the\noutput voltage and the volumetric\
    \ water content, but the sensor can measure from 0 to up to 60% of\nvolumetric\
    \ water content in the soil. This sensor has a relatively low price and can be\
    \ implemented in\nArduino systems (and similar).\nA sensor with completely different\
    \ operational principles, the 200SS (HYPERION TECHNOLOGIES\nB.V., Delft, The Netherlands),\
    \ is used in two proposals [14,121].\nIt is a solid-state electrical\nresistance\
    \ sensing device that is used to measure soil water tension.\nThe 200SS has a\
    \ pair of\nhighly corrosion-resistant electrodes, as a resistive device, the resistance\
    \ of the sensor changes with the\nsoil moisture. The electrodes are embedded within\
    \ a granular matrix. The output values of the sensor\ngo from 0 to 199 centibars.\
    \ The higher the value of centibars the lower the water availability for the\n\
    plants. The system presented in [54] uses an SM300 sensor. This device is able\
    \ to measure two soil\nparameters (moisture and temperature). The SM300 measures\
    \ the soil moisture and temperature based\non the generation and propagation of\
    \ the electromagnetic ﬁeld into the soil. The sensors measure\nthe soil moisture\
    \ as the volumetric water content, the operating range goes from 0 to 100% and\
    \ the\naccuracy is ±2.5%. This sensor is manufactured by Delta-T Devices Ltd.\
    \ (Cambridge, UK). This sensor\nis not speciﬁcally created to be integrated in\
    \ an Arduino measuring system, even though it can be\nadapted since the output\
    \ voltage goes from 0 to 1 V.\nFinally, the system detailed in [122] used the\
    \ HA2002 sensor, but no information is available\non the internet about this sensor\
    \ in terms of operational principle nor range of measuring. The sole\ninformation\
    \ that was found was that the sensor is an HA2001 sensor manufactured by Handan\
    \ Dingrui\nElectronics Co., Ltd. (Handan, China).\nRegarding the sensors used\
    \ for monitoring the soil temperature, which are mentioned in [37,40,\n45,54,63,67,94,122,123],\
    \ the diﬀerent sensors are detailed in this paragraph. There are ﬁve papers that\n\
    do not specify the sensors used [45,63,67,94,123]. The other four proposals indicate\
    \ in the paper the\nsensors selected. Although in one paper no information could\
    \ be found about the sensor utilized [122],\nthe authors indicate that their system\
    \ includes the HA2001 sensor.\nIn other cases, the information of the selected\
    \ sensors is detailed. The proposal presented in [54]\nused an LM35 sensor. This\
    \ device is able to measure temperature. The operating range is −40 to\n+125 ◦C\
    \ and the accuracy is ±0.5 ◦C. The sensors oﬀer an analogic signal and it is manufactured\
    \ by\nTexas Instruments (Dallas, TX, USA). The proposals presented in [37,40]\
    \ selected the THERM200\n(Vegetronix, Inc., Riverton, UT, USA) to measure the\
    \ temperature. The operational range of these\nsensors goes from −40 ◦C to 85\
    \ ◦C and its accuracy is ±0.5 ◦C. The operation principle of this sensor is\n\
    not speciﬁed in the datasheet.\nIn terms of sensors for soil nutrients, three\
    \ papers include in their proposals sensors for monitoring\nthis variable [5,80,102];\
    \ nonetheless, not all of them indicate the used sensor. The only paper that\n\
    clearly indicates the utilized sensor is the proposal presented in [80] includes\
    \ an 1185 SunRom\ncolor sensor (Sunrom Electronics, Ahmedabad, India). This sensor\
    \ is based on RGB color detection,\nin [80] authors relate the color of the soil\
    \ with the nutrients. The pH of the soil is measured in four\nproposals [66,67,72,110].\
    \ However, none of these proposals indicates the selected device or equipment\n\
    in the paper.\n5. Weather Monitoring\nAn overview of the weather parameters monitored\
    \ in IoT irrigation monitoring systems and the\nmost utilized sensors to monitor\
    \ these parameters is provided in this section. The weather conditions\nare a\
    \ key factor both in irrigation needs and in the performance of crops. Figure\
    \ 14 shows the most\nmonitored weather parameters in the currently available smart\
    \ irrigation proposals. Temperature\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n13 of 48\nand humidity\
    \ aﬀect the evapotranspiration of the water in the soil. Air temperature is deﬁned\
    \ as the\nthermic level of the atmosphere and is usually measured in Celsius,\
    \ Fahrenheit or Kelvin degrees.\nIt is the most monitored weather parameter with\
    \ one hundred papers monitoring it. Humidity is the\npresence of water vapor in\
    \ the air. The amount of water vapor in the air is expressed in percentage (%).\n\
    It is the second most monitored weather parameter with 86 papers. Furthermore,\
    \ luminosity is paired\nwith temperature as direct radiation from the Sun raises\
    \ the temperature and leads to more water loss in\nthe soil. It is deﬁned as the\
    \ intensity or brightness of the light. It is measured in Lux. It is the third\
    \ most\nmonitored parameter with 28 papers. The amount of precipitation determines\
    \ whether the irrigation\nis needed or not and the amount of water to be employed\
    \ in the case of irrigation being necessary.\nIt considers any form of hydrometeor\
    \ that falls from the atmosphere and reaches the earth’s surface.\nFurthermore,\
    \ it includes rain and snow. A total of 14 papers considered precipitation monitoring.\n\
    Although temperature, relative humidity, luminosity, and precipitations are the\
    \ most important factors\nregarding IoT irrigation systems for agriculture, many\
    \ systems propose the monitoring of other\nenvironmental parameters. Table 1 details\

    \ industry. The SEN-08942 is a meteorology station manufactured\nby Sparkfun (SparkFun\
    \ Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA). It allows monitoring both wind speed and\ndirection\
    \ and it incorporates a pluviometer [46]. The PRD180 is comprised of a rain detecting\
    \ board\nwith two separate PCB tracks and a control module that provides a digital\
    \ and an analog output [48].\nThe operating voltage is from 3.3 V to 5 V. It is\
    \ manufactured by Elecmake (India). Like the PRD180, the\nYL83 (Vaisala, Vantaa,\
    \ Finland) is comprised of a series of conductive strands printed onto a Bakelite\n\
    plaque [76]. The water creates a short-circuit oﬀering a low resistance between\
    \ the lines connected to\nthe ground and the lines connected to the positive polarity.\n\
    The type of agriculture most concerned with air and wind as a parameter concerning\
    \ weather\nis greenhouse agriculture. For example, one of the aims of [68] is\
    \ the sanitation of the air of the\ngreenhouse from pathogens and chemical contaminants.\
    \ This is then closely related to the activation\nof the actuators necessary to\
    \ the regulation of the quality of the air. The contaminants that can aﬀect\n\
    the quality of the air are CO, CO2, O3, NOx, PM2.5, and PM10, among others [64].\
    \ In the context\nof agriculture, air contaminants are monitored with the use\
    \ of sensors that can be low-cost sensors\nsuch as the MQ135 (SHENZHEN INVENTOR\
    \ ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGYCO., LTD., Shenzhen,\nChina), MQ131, MQ2 or MQ9 sensors\
    \ or commercial sensors that can be found in professional weather\nstations. The\
    \ MQ135 [64,143], used for benzene, alcohol, smoke, NH3, NOx and CO2 monitoring,\
    \ and\nthe MQ2 [64,95], used for gas monitoring (propane, hydrogen, and LPG),\
    \ are the most utilized low-cost\nsensors for air quality monitoring. The MQ131\
    \ is utilized for ozone, Cl2, NO2 monitoring [64] and\nthe MQ9 is utilized for\
    \ CO/combustible gas, methane, carbon monoxide and LPG monitoring [64].\nAnother\
    \ sensor that can be used to monitor CO2 is the CDM4161A (Toshniwal Sensing Device\
    \ Private\nLimited, Ajmer, India) [145].\nWind speed and direction may be of interest\
    \ to IoT irrigation systems such as for the proposal\nin [46], that utilized the\
    \ SEN-08942 sensor manufactured by Sparkfun. Barometric pressure can be of\ninterest\
    \ as well and can be measured by the BME280 sensor manufactured by Bosch [157].\n\
    Movement detection is often related to security measures or to the aim of scaring\
    \ animals to\navoid crop damage. The most utilized sensor for movement detection\
    \ is a passive infrared (PIR)\nsensor [42,95]. This sensor measures the infrared\
    \ light that radiates around the objects placed at the\nfront of the sensor. The\
    \ change in infrared radiation is converted into changes in voltage that trigger\n\
    the detection. It is often utilized for intrusion and pest detection. Ultrasonic\
    \ sensors are often utilized\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n18 of 48\nto detect movement,\
    \ such as the robot proposed in [65] that is able to perform some actions to scare\
    \ the\nanimals that may enter the ﬁelds. These sensors are comprised of a transmitter\
    \ and a receiver that\noperate at the 40 kHz frequency. Its range is from 10 cm\
    \ to 30 cm. Ultrasound at lower frequencies was\nutilized in [60] to repel the\
    \ animals. Insects may cause great damage to the crops, for that reason some\n\
    systems such as [45] include a pest warning functionality. The system in [133]\
    \ is able to even detect the\ntype of insect pests that are damaging the crops.\
    \ These features are often accompanied by a buzzer to\ngenerate an alarm when\
    \ intruders or animals are detected [61].\nDepending on the type of agriculture,\
    \ the values from the measures for each environmental\nparameter can be utilized\
    \ to determine the actions of diﬀerent types of actuators. It can be part of a\n\
    model like the one proposed in [72] where the on-agriculture stage gathers the\
    \ data on temperature,\nhumidity, light, moisture and wind speed in order to activate\
    \ or deactivate fans, artiﬁcial light, a cooler\nand water pumps. Many IoT irrigation\
    \ systems have both a manual and an automatic mode to control\nirrigation. In\
    \ [64], the amount of water released by the water pumps or the duration of the\
    \ irrigation\ncan be selected in the manual mode. For the automatic mode, a preset\
    \ value is utilized at the beginning.\nThen, the data is analyzed to determine\

    \ two types depending on the purpose of\nthe IoT devices. On the one hand, we\
    \ can distinguish the devices that function as nodes that transmit\nsmall amounts\
    \ of data at short distances and have low energy consumption. On the other hand,\n\
    there are devices that can transmit large amounts of data over long distances\
    \ that have high energy\nconsumption. Therefore, range, data rate, and energy\
    \ consumption are some of the most important\naspects to consider when deciding\
    \ which technology to use.\nIf the utilized standard is considered, there are\
    \ a large number of wireless standards that are used\nin the communications of\
    \ IoT devices. A general classiﬁcation can be established between devices\nthat\
    \ communicate at short or long distances. Short distance communication standards\
    \ usually reach\ndistances of up to 100 m. Long-distance communication standards\
    \ reach distances of kilometers.\nAlso, another type of classiﬁcation can be established\
    \ based on the employed communication\ntechnology. In this way, three categories\
    \ can be established. The ﬁrst category is formed by those that\nconnect utilizing\
    \ Ethernet or cable and WAN technology. The second category is comprised of those\n\
    that connect via WiFi and WAN technology. Finally, the third category is formed\
    \ by those that connect\nusing both low power WiFi and WAN technology.\nIf the\
    \ spectrum band used is considered, we can classify them into technologies that\
    \ use the\nunlicensed spectrum or the licensed spectrum. Unlicensed spectrum bands\
    \ are known as Industrial,\nScientiﬁc, and Medical (ISM radio band bands, and\
    \ are deﬁned by article 1.15 of the International\nTelecommunication Union’s (ITU)\
    \ ITU Radio Regulations (RR) [184]. The ISM bands can vary according\nto the region\
    \ and its permits. Its main advantage is its ease of installation and the main\
    \ drawbacks are\nrelated to safety deﬁciencies and possible interferences. The\
    \ licensed spectrum bands are assigned\naccording to the diﬀerent proprietary\
    \ technologies. They oﬀer greater security, greater coverage, and\nfewer interferences.\
    \ However, the cost of using a licensed band is higher.\nThe most utilized communication\
    \ technologies among the reviewed papers are presented in\nTable 6. In many of\
    \ the proposals that we have studied, the authors combine several communication\n\
    technologies instead of using one single protocol. As an example, it is very common\
    \ for authors to\nstart using either a wired or a wireless technology to connect\
    \ the sensors with the nodes, and then, use\na wireless technology to send data\
    \ from nodes to remote or cloud storage centers.\nTable 6. Most utilized communication\

    \ is possible to connect programs that initially had not been \ndeveloped to be\
    \ connected to each other. Bandyopadhyay et al. [199] presented a classification\
    \ of the \nIoT-middleware, based on the various features and interface protocol\
    \ support. One of the reasons \nwhy middleware is needed to connect IoT devices,\
    \ which are initially autonomous, is to provide \ncloud services. We can take\
    \ advantage of existing middleware using it on different cloud platforms. \nWhen\
    \ we talk about the cloud, we identify a place where data, which is collected\

    \ In most of the articles, it is \nindicated that the data is processed in the\
    \ cloud itself, and the end-users view all the information by \nconnecting to\
    \ the cloud. Cloud storage has been done on different platforms as it can be seen\

    \ is needed to connect IoT devices, which are initially autonomous, is to provide\
    \ cloud\nservices. We can take advantage of existing middleware using it on diﬀerent\
    \ cloud platforms.\nWhen we talk about the cloud, we identify a place where data,\
    \ which is collected through sensors\nand transmitted to remote locations, will\
    \ be stored and processed. In most of the articles, it is indicated\nthat the\
    \ data is processed in the cloud itself, and the end-users view all the information\
    \ by connecting\nto the cloud. Cloud storage has been done on diﬀerent platforms\
    \ as it can be seen in Figure 27. In 24 of\nthe reviewed articles, the authors\
    \ speciﬁed that they store the monitored data in the cloud, but do not\nidentify\
    \ the utilized cloud platform (see Table 8). Most of the works in which the authors\
    \ deﬁne the\nemployed cloud platform, the utilized platform is Thingspeak (The\
    \ MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA),\nwith 14 papers. This platform is very intuitive\
    \ and provides both free and paid options for storing,\nanalyzing and displaying\
    \ the data on diﬀerent devices. Algorithms can be developed using MATLAB\n(The\
    \ MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) to generate alerts. However, there are proposals\
    \ that use other\ncloud platforms such as FIWARE (FIWARE Foundation, Berlin, Germany)\
    \ [75,149] and Dynamo DB\n(Amazon DynamoDB, Seattle, WA, USA) [117,159] with two\
    \ papers each, and MongoDB (MongoDB\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n29 of 48\nInc., New\
    \ York, NY, USA) [28], Ubidots (Ubidots, Doral, FL, USA) [5], Amazon (Amazon,\

    These less-used platforms are either more expensive, provide fewer services or\
    \ are less intuitive than\nThingspeak. Table 4 lists the cloud platforms that\

    \ 2020, 20, 1042\n30 of 48\n7. Discussion\nIn this section, current trends regarding\
    \ IoT irrigation systems for agriculture are going to\nbe presented.\n7.1. Big\
    \ Data Management and Analytics for Irrigation Optimization\nIoT systems, in general,\
    \ generate a great amount of data due to monitoring diﬀerent parameters\nin real-time,\
    \ and IoT irrigation systems generate big data as well. Therefore, it is necessary\
    \ to provide\nmechanisms to manage and analyze big data. Ahad et al. [202] comment\
    \ on the need for sustainable\nmanagement of big data to avoid overusing natural\
    \ resources. Using blockchain, powering IoT devices\nwith solar energy, selecting\
    \ useful data and discarding unnecessary and redundant data, employing\nclustering\
    \ techniques to reduce the volume of the information, implementing time-eﬃcient\
    \ algorithms\nand the utilization of sustainable resources as alternatives to\
    \ the components that are employed\nnowadays are some of the suggestions they\
    \ provide.\nAlthough the data gathered from the sensors is already a big source\
    \ of information, the analysis\nof this data is paramount to optimize the IoT\
    \ irrigation system according to the crop and the weather\nconditions. For this\
    \ purpose, Tseng et al. [203] presented a big data analysis algorithm to aid farmers\n\
    in the crop selection process. Their proposal satisﬁed the ﬁve Vs (volume, velocity,\
    \ variety, veracity,\nand value) of big data. They performed a 3D correlation\
    \ analysis that evaluated the irrigation cycle to\nidentify the irrigation practices\
    \ performed by the farmer. Then, they calculated the soil moisture content\nto\
    \ detect irrigation and to evaluate if the farmer applied pesticides or fertilizers.\
    \ This information was\ncoupled with data on the weather conditions and other\
    \ aspects of the soil to provide the farmer with\nthe cultivation risks of each\
    \ type of crop. Nonetheless, there are other technologies that are currently\n\
    being utilized to analyze the big data produced by IoT irrigation systems for\
    \ agriculture.\nArtiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is currently the type of technology\
    \ most companies are interested in for\nvarious purposes. In the case of irrigation,\
    \ the use of AI is tied to the optimization of the available\nresources such as\
    \ water, fertilizers or energy or to obtain information from the crops such as\
    \ the\npresence of diseases or the correct growth of the plants, vegetables, and\
    \ fruits. One of the techniques\nemployed to analyze the data gathered from the\
    \ sensors so as to perform decisions on the irrigation\nsystems is fuzzy logic.\
    \ Fuzzy logic has been employed to improve irrigation scheduling in greenhouses\n\
    and control the drainage implementing it on the controller of the system [100].\
    \ The fuzzy rules were\nprovided according to the water availability utilizing\
    \ the QtFuzzyLite software ((FuzzyLite Limited,\nWellington, New Zealand). Another\
    \ fuzzy logic controller is employed to determine the coverage\nerror for the\
    \ resources so as to determine if the eﬀective watering of the plants can be guaranteed\
    \ [96].\nThe system presented in [136] utilized fuzzy logic to determine the duration\
    \ of the irrigation process\nonce the soil moisture values go below the 20% threshold.\
    \ Light and temperature lead to the least\naccuracy in irrigation (40%) whereas\
    \ any combination with the soil moisture values reached an accuracy\nfrom 62 to\
    \ 81%. The authors conclude that the subsoil moisture sensor is the most important\
    \ sensor to\ndetermine irrigation. The irrigation time was predicted in [162]\
    \ as well, using the adaptive neuro fuzzy\ninterference system (ANFIS) to predict\
    \ the irrigation time. This fuzzy logic technique was implemented\nemploying the\
    \ MATLAB software. However, outdoor temperature and light are important to avoid\
    \ the\nevaporation of the water. Another irrigation system utilizes iterative\
    \ learning control (ILC) arithmetic\nto make decisions regarding the opening of\
    \ the water valves [67].\nMachine learning is another technique that is utilized\
    \ in irrigation systems to perform predictions.\nThe prediction algorithm in [120]\
    \ for soil moisture prediction obtained an accuracy of 96%. Prediction\ntechniques\
    \ can also be utilized to estimate the amount of available water for irrigation\
    \ such as the case\nof [119], where the authors employ Fisher’s LDA method for\
    \ that purpose. Water usage is predicted as\nwell in [50] employing regression\
    \ algorithms. The regression algorithms consider the temperature of\nthe environment\
    \ and the water ﬂow to produce a water consumption forecast that is then visualized\n\
    by the user through a mobile app.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n31 of 48\nFeedforward\
    \ neural networks and the structural similarity index were employed in [204] to\n\
    develop an optimized smart irrigation system. The authors compared gradient descent\
    \ and variable\nlearning rate gradient descent optimization techniques to predict\
    \ soil moisture and they determined\nthat the latter was the best one. Furthermore,\
    \ a study on machine learning applied to agriculture so as\nto perform predictions\
    \ on irrigation was performed in [205]. Diﬀerent machine learning techniques\n\
    were applied to the data on the soil and the environment collected from jojoba\
    \ plantations. The authors\nconclude that the boosted tree classiﬁer was the best\
    \ classiﬁcation model was and the gradient boosted\nregression trees was the best\
    \ regression model. They had a 95% and 93% accuracy respectively.\nThe authors\
    \ suggest as well that diﬀerent feature-sets would be better for diﬀerent plots\
    \ as some\nconﬁgurations achieved better results for diﬀerent types of plots such\
    \ as organic ones. Furthermore, the\nmodels considerably reduced their accuracy\
    \ when deliberated soil drying was performed. Moreover,\nthe authors state that\
    \ the data on the weather and the saturation could be not considered without it\n\
    substantially aﬀecting the accuracy of the models.\n7.2. Low-Cost Autonomous Sensors\n\
    As we have seen in Section 2, the majority of the countries that dedicate more\
    \ eﬀort to researching\nIoT irrigation systems are countries where the farmers\
    \ cannot aﬀord commercial solutions. Therefore,\nmost of the solutions for irrigation\
    \ management are comprised of low-cost sensors and controllers so\nas to increase\
    \ the scope of the beneﬁts of utilizing smart irrigation systems. Apart from individual\n\
    sensors, some shields integrate several sensors and connectors for irrigation\
    \ and agriculture speciﬁc\nIoT systems such as the OpenGarden shield ((Libelium\
    \ Comunicaciones Distribuidas S.L., Zaragoza,\nSpain) [136]. It can be connected\
    \ to an Arduino UNO and it is comprised of an LDR, a DHT22 connector\n(SparkFun\
    \ Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA), a soil moisture connector, a hydroponics connector,\
    \ digital\nand analog pins, a DS18B20 connector (Adafruit Industries, New York,\
    \ NY, USA) and an antenna\nconnector. This type of solution allows the easy implementation\
    \ of low-cost smart irrigation systems.\n7.3. Sustainable Irrigation Systems\n\
    Most irrigation systems do not have access to the power grid, therefore there\
    \ is a need for\nalternative means of powering up the devices that conform the\
    \ system. Even irrigation systems with\naccess to the power grid may only receive\
    \ power during a constrained time period. In India, for\nexample, the system presented\
    \ in [29] determines when access to electricity is available to turn on\nthe irrigation\
    \ motors. This system was designed to help farmers when access to electricity\
    \ happens\nat irregular hours or even at night, when farmers may not be present\
    \ in the ﬁeld. To address the\nneed for alternative ways of powering the irrigation\
    \ systems in agricultural ﬁelds that are too far to\naccess the power grid, many\
    \ systems incorporate a solar energy functionality, making the system\nmore sustainable\
    \ [41]. Furthermore, the use of solar energy reduces the energetic costs which\
    \ is\nan advantage for irrigation systems intended for developing areas.\nConsidering\
    \ those reasons,\na total of 22 of the surveyed papers chose to utilize solar\
    \ energy to power their proposed irrigation\nsystem [4,38,41,46,50,56,63,66,69,88,90–92,96,99,101,140,145,171,178,181].\n\
    7.4. Frequency of the Data Acquisition\nThe frequency at which the parameters\
    \ are monitored may be diﬀerent for each proposal. Real-time\nmonitoring [31,71]\
    \ has been surging as the cost of the devices, whether they are processors, devices\n\
    for data storage or sensors, has experienced a considerable reduction. Some proposals\
    \ decide not to\nmonitor the parameters in real-time so as to reduce energy consumption.\
    \ Some authors have decided\nto take a measure every 10 s [58].\n7.5. New Forms\
    \ of Data Acquisition\nThe advances in technology as lead to new ways of obtaining\
    \ the data from the sensors deployed\nin the ﬁelds. One of the new ways of gathering\
    \ data from the sensor nodes is by utilizing drones [31].\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n\
    32 of 48\nDrones also allow obtaining new data that could not be obtained in other\
    \ ways such as aerial images\nof the ﬁelds.\nAnother new form of data acquisition\
    \ is the use of robots that can incorporate both sensors and\nactuators to perform\
    \ activities such as soil moisture sensing, weeding, spraying water or scaring\
    \ the\nanimals [65]. Robots can be utilized for the irrigation of precise areas\
    \ due to their ability to travel to\nthe desired location [38]. This robot is\
    \ able to measure soil moisture and include proximity sensors\nto avoid collisions.\
    \ The robot has a sprinkler system to irrigate the desired area. Furthermore,\
    \ the\nwireless robot in [66] is comprised of both environmental and soil monitoring\
    \ sensors and performs\ntasks such as water spraying, scaring animals and moving\
    \ through the ﬁeld. In order to improve the\nnavigation of the robots for irrigation,\
    \ the authors in [55] provided the robot with a coverage path\nplanning (CPP)\
    \ algorithm that has a map of the static elements and environmental data. The\
    \ robot\noperating system (ROS) was utilized to develop the control system of\
    \ the robot which is divided into\nthree layers. The ﬁrst layer reads the data\
    \ from the sensors and controls the actuators, the second\nlayer performs the\
    \ communication among the elements of the system and the third layer performs\
    \ the\ndecision making and the path planning. This robot performs irrigation as\
    \ a linear shower. Furthermore,\nthese robots can be powered by solar panels [38,66]\
    \ to provide them with more autonomy.\n7.6. Security in IoT Systems for Irrigation\n\
    Depending on the characteristics of the environment where the implementation of\
    \ the IoT system\nis carried out, securing the system may become a challenging\
    \ task as diﬀerent types of threats must be\nconsidered. On the one hand, all\
    \ the security issues of any IoT system can be applied to an IoT irrigation\n\
    system for agriculture. Therefore, current works with their focus on securing\
    \ IoT describes the security\nchallenges that IoT irrigation systems may face.\
    \ For example, organizations such as the Internet\nEngineering Task Force (IETF)\
    \ study the diﬀerent problems that aﬀect this. Furthermore, authors\nsuch as Garcia-Morchon\
    \ et al. [206] present in their work the following list of security threats and\n\
    managing risks: vulnerable software/code, privacy threats, cloning of things,\
    \ malicious substitution\nof things, eavesdropping attacks, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attack, ﬁrmware attacks, extraction of private\ninformation, routing attack,\
    \ elevation of privilege, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Regarding DoS\nattacks,\
    \ Kamienski et al. [50] highly stressed the importance of protecting the irrigation\
    \ system from\nDoS attacks or avoiding attackers from accessing the collected\
    \ data or the system with the intention of\ndamaging the crops.\nIn order to face\
    \ the above threats, it is necessary to apply the appropriate security measures,\
    \ but\nas new threats and attacks appear daily, [206] propose using methodologies\
    \ such as analyzing the\nbusiness impact of the attack, assessing the threats\
    \ considering their impact and probability, its impact\non the privacy of the\
    \ collected information and the process of reporting and mitigating incidents.\n\
    However, on the other hand, when considering just the currently available studies\
    \ on securing\nIoT irrigation systems speciﬁcally, it is possible to discern which\
    \ aspects of IoT security are prioritized\nfor this type of system.\nJimenez et\
    \ al. [207] identiﬁed the security threats speciﬁc to an intelligent wastewater\
    \ puriﬁcation\nsystem for irrigation. Apart from the previously mentioned security\
    \ threats [206], the authors of [207]\ncontemplate physical attacks that the IoT\
    \ deployment may face. The IoT devices must be protected\nfrom the weather and\
    \ possible animals that access the ﬁelds. However, strong weather conditions\n\
    such as ﬂoods or animals such as wilds boars may result in the IoT device being\
    \ damaged or lost.\nFurthermore, the IoT devices may also be damaged by the operators\
    \ when they are performing their\nactivities or be the aim of a person with malicious\
    \ intentions. Another threat to the devices deployed\non the ﬁeld is the possibility\
    \ of them being replaced to malicious nodes, providing the attacker with\naccess\
    \ to the network [29]. The deployed devices may also be susceptible to malicious\
    \ code and false\ndata injection, leading to wrong results and the malfunction\
    \ of the system. Sleep deprivation attacks\nare aimed at depleting the battery\
    \ of the devices. The deployed nodes are susceptible to booting attacks\nas well.\
    \ Furthermore, attackers may also perform eavesdropping and interfere with the\
    \ deployed\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n33 of 48\ndevices. The concern of securing\
    \ the physical devices deployed on the ﬁelds has led to many systems\nincorporating\
    \ PIR sensors, scarecrows, and buzzers to detect intruders, either humans or animals,\
    \ and\nto alert of their presence [59,208].\nPrivacy is another aspect to consider.\
    \ The data managed by IoT irrigation systems may not need as\nmuch privacy as\
    \ the data managed by other IoT applications such as those for health. In fact,\
    \ Jimenez\net al. [207] remark that it may not be necessary for the gathered data\
    \ of some irrigation IoT systems to\nremain private, but the correct performance\
    \ of the system must be ensured, which is avoiding DoS\nattacks. However, the\
    \ owners of the ﬁelds may be implementing new techniques they would prefer to\n\
    remain private or the water quality management system could be regarded as a critical\
    \ infrastructure\nas the produce that results from the ﬁelds irrigated with that\
    \ water would be consumed by people.\nTherefore, considering this aspect, Ahad\
    \ et al. [202] and Barreto et al. [209] remark the need for user\nprivacy, as\
    \ the obtention of this information may lead to attacks to the owner or the personnel\
    \ of the\nfarm. Ahad et al. [202] consider data and device privacy as well, because\
    \ of the need for guaranteeing\nthe ownership of the data to avoid repudiation\
    \ and ensuring data availability. Barreto et al. [209]\nremark on the burden that\
    \ could be originated from the exposure of the GPS locational data captured\n\
    by IoT devices as attackers may gain information on the location of the farm to\
    \ perform physical attacks.\nLastly, Ahad et al. [202] also comment on the need\
    \ for a secure storage system for the information,\nwith particular emphasis on\
    \ distributed data storage systems. Attacks such as SQL injections can lead\n\
    to the obtention of private information from storage systems [210].\nAs cloud\
    \ computing often goes hand in hand with IoT systems, threats to cloud services\
    \ may\ncompromise the IoT irrigation system as well. Flooding attacks and cloud\
    \ malware injection are some\nof the attacks that can be intentionally executed\
    \ to compromise the data and the performance of the\ncloud [210].\nRansomware\
    \ is another security threat that could aﬀect irrigation systems for agriculture\
    \ [209].\nAll the data regarding pesticides and the fertigation system could be\
    \ encrypted until a ransom is paid.\nFor this reason, having a back-up in a remote\
    \ location is greatly advised.\nBarreto et al. [209] also remark some security\
    \ threats that are not usually commented on when\ndiscussing the security of IoT\
    \ systems for agriculture. One of these threats is the damage that can be\ncaused\
    \ by social engineering as the users of the IoT irrigation system could provide\
    \ login information\nto people posing as technicians or click on malicious links\
    \ on their e-mails. The other threats are\nagroterrorism, cyber-espionage, mostly\
    \ related to accessing intellectual property or conﬁdential\ninformation regarding\
    \ aspects such as genetically modiﬁed crops.\nBlockchain is a new technique that\
    \ is being applied to secure IoT systems [210], which allows\nsecure data storage\
    \ and communication. In agriculture, it is mostly utilized to secure the supply\n\
    chain [211], although there are other proposals that use it to secure a greenhouse\
    \ [212] or to secure\nthe overall smart agriculture framework [213]. Regarding\
    \ IoT irrigation systems for agriculture,\nblockchain has been applied in [214]\
    \ to track and trace the information exchange of their proposed\nsmart watering\
    \ system.\n7.7. Common Architecture Designs for IoT Irrigation Systems for Agriculture\n\
    In this subsection, an overview of the most frequent architectures for these systems\
    \ is going to\nbe discussed.\nMulti-agent architectures are popular in IoT solutions\
    \ for irrigation management [175,180].\nThese types of architectures make a distinction\
    \ among the diﬀerent elements they are comprised of.\nTypically, the distinction\
    \ is made according to the layer of the architecture the elements are encompassed\n\
    in. For example, nodes positioned higher in the hierarchy may act as a broker\
    \ for those lower in the\nhierarchy [175].\nMost architectures are divided into\
    \ layers or functional blocks that represent the main actions to\nbe carried out\
    \ [215]. These blocks or layers can be considered as generic and are utilized\
    \ in most of the\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n34 of 48\navailable architecture designs\
    \ for IoT systems intended for irrigation management. The main elements\nof these\
    \ architectures are devices, communications, services, management, applications,\
    \ and security.\nIoT systems are comprised of devices located in a certain environment\
    \ to perform multiple\nactivities such as detection, monitoring, control, and\
    \ action. The devices must have interfaces that allow\ntheir connection with other\
    \ devices to transmit the necessary information. The data obtained through\ndiﬀerent\
    \ sensors will generally be treated and their results will be applied to diﬀerent\
    \ actuators. Then, it\nis necessary to transmit the monitored data and response\
    \ actions between the devices. Communication\nprotocols are used for this task.\
    \ In most cases, diﬀerent communication protocols are used working\ntogether on\
    \ the same IoT system. In order to perform activities such as device discovery,\
    \ device control\nor the analysis of the collected data, the use of services may\
    \ be necessary as well. The applications allow\nthe interaction of the user with\
    \ the system. From the applications, the user will be able to visualize\nthe information,\
    \ both obtained by monitoring and that extracted from the data once they have\
    \ been\nprocessed. On many occasions, the user can execute the actions that he\
    \ considers appropriate to the\nsituation presented by the data, the actions can\
    \ also be carried out automatically. Lastly, providing\nsecurity to the system\
    \ may also be considered.\nTraditionally, the IoT architecture has been considered\
    \ to be divided into three layers, which are\nthe perception, network, and application\
    \ layer. Later on, an intermediate layer placed between the\nnetwork and application\
    \ layers has been introduced in multiple studies. This layer, called service layer,\n\
    is employed to store and process data using cloud and fog computing. For the last\
    \ few years, authors\nsuch as Ferrández-Pastor [216] presented a new architecture\
    \ proposal, based on four layers: things,\nedge, communication, and cloud. In\
    \ these latest architectural proposals, the authors use the edge layer\nto locate\
    \ critical applications and perform basic control processes. Also, as indicated\
    \ by [216], cloud\n(internet/intranet) can provide Web services, data storage,\
    \ HMI interfaces or analytic applications.\nFigure 29 shows an image where one\
    \ can see the architecture models.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n34 of 48 \n \nelements\
    \ of these architectures are devices, communications, services, management, applications,\
    \ \nand security.  \nIoT systems are comprised of devices located in a certain\
    \ environment to perform multiple \nactivities such as detection, monitoring,\
    \ control, and action. The devices must have interfaces that \nallow their connection\
    \ with other devices to transmit the necessary information. The data obtained\
    \ \nthrough different sensors will generally be treated and their results will\
    \ be applied to different \nactuators. Then, it is necessary to transmit the monitored\
    \ data and response actions between the \ndevices. Communication protocols are\
    \ used for this task. In most cases, different communication \nprotocols are used\
    \ working together on the same IoT system. In order to perform activities such\
    \ as \ndevice discovery, device control or the analysis of the collected data,\
    \ the use of services may be \nnecessary as well. The applications allow the interaction\
    \ of the user with the system. From the \napplications, the user will be able\
    \ to visualize the information, both obtained by monitoring and that \nextracted\
    \ from the data once they have been processed. On many occasions, the user can\
    \ execute the \nactions that he considers appropriate to the situation presented\
    \ by the data, the actions can also be \ncarried out automatically. Lastly, providing\
    \ security to the system may also be considered.  \nTraditionally, the IoT architecture\
    \ has been considered to be divided into three layers, which are \nthe perception,\
    \ network, and application layer. Later on, an intermediate layer placed between\
    \ the \nnetwork and application layers has been introduced in multiple studies.\
    \ This layer, called service \nlayer, is employed to store and process data using\

    \ subsection, we present an architecture proposal for an IoT irrigation system\
    \ for irrigation.\nIn order to ensure the correct performance of the IoT irrigation\
    \ system for precision agriculture, the\narchitecture should provide interoperability,\
    \ scalability, security, availability, and resiliency.\nAfter having carried out\
    \ an exhaustive study of works presented by other researchers, our\narchitecture\
    \ proposal is divided into four layers that we deﬁne as devices, communication,\
    \ services,\nand application, as shown in Figure 30. Furthermore, the aspects\
    \ related to management and security\nshould be treated jointly between the communication\
    \ and services layers.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n36 of 48 \n \nFigure 30. Architecture\
    \ proposal for an IoT irrigation system for agriculture. \n7.9. Future Challenges\
    \ of IoT Irrigation Systems \nThe Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is a new\
    \ view of the IoT [221]. It consists of \ndeploying both underground and above\
    \ ground IoT devices that communicate among themselves \nwith underground-underground,\
    \ underground-above ground, and above ground-above ground \ncommunication. It\
    \ is especially useful and applicable to irrigation and precision agriculture\
    \ IoT \nsystems as the devices would not be impeding the work of machines and\
    \ farmers and it would reduce \nthe amount of physical damage the nodes deployed\
    \ on the fields may receive. Although WiFi \nsurprisingly allows underground-above\
    \ ground communication in short distances and depths above \n30 cm [222], it would\
    \ be necessary to study the performance of other existing protocols or even the\
    \ \ncreation of a new protocol that employs lower frequency bands to transmit\
    \ the information through \nthe soil medium.  \nThe use of LoRa is increasing\
    \ for irrigation and precision agriculture applications due to its long-\nrange,\
    \ which allows wireless communication to remote fields. However, the advances\
    \ in 5G may lead \nto a decrease in the interest in LoRa technology. On the one\
    \ hand, if the designed irrigation system \nproduces lower amounts of data, as\
    \ these types of systems present low variability in the data, LoRa \npresents\
    \ itself as a very good solution. However, on the other hand, for IoT systems\
    \ that require the \ntransmission of large amounts of data, 5G would solve the\
    \ problem of the limited amount of data \nthat LoRa can transmit. Considering\
    \ these aspects, a possible future is the use of LoRa and 5G hybrid \nwireless\
    \ networks to attempt in satisfying those needs [223]. \nThere are diverse opinions\
    \ on the existence and effects of climate change on earth. However, \nthere is\
    \ no doubt that many governments, companies and the citizens themselves are increasing\
    \ their \nawareness regarding sustainable consumption. This not only affects their\
    \ view on the energy \nconsumption of IoT systems for irrigation but also, the\
    \ origin of the components of the devices and \nthe impact of IoT devices on the\
    \ environment and the fauna of the area where they are deployed. \nTherefore,\
    \ the reduction in energy consumption and the use of alternative powering methods\
    \ will \ncontinue to be a research trend. Furthermore, it may be a challenge to\
    \ find new materials that are \nweather-resistant and do not increase severely\
    \ the cost of the devices, but the use of recyclable \nmaterials in some of the\
    \ elements of the IoT devices is to be expected [203]. \nAs it has further been\
    \ commented on Subsection 7 1 blockchain and AI will be incorporated into\nFigure\
    \ 30. Architecture proposal for an IoT irrigation system for agriculture.\nThe\
    \ ﬁrst layer is the Device layer, where all the devices that will perform the\
    \ functions of detection,\nmonitoring, control, and action are located. We would\
    \ have four types of nodes. The water monitoring\nnode would monitor water quality\
    \ to determine if the water is apt for the irrigation of the crops.\nThe soil\
    \ monitoring node would monitor soil moisture, soil temperature and other parameters\
    \ that\naid in the irrigation schedule decision process. The weather monitoring\
    \ node would measure air\ntemperature and humidity, precipitation, luminosity,\
    \ radiation, and wind parameters so as to aid in\nthe decision making process.\
    \ Lastly, the actuator nodes would perform the actions resulting from the\ndecision-making\
    \ process.\nThe second layer is the communication layer, comprised of three blocks.\
    \ The Hop-to-Hop\ncommunication block allows deﬁning data link layer technologies\
    \ and to transmit the frames that\ncontain the data of the device layer. From\
    \ this block the frames will be sent to the network communication\nblock, to reach\
    \ the remote locations. The routing function can be assumed in this block in mesh\n\
    networks, such as 802.15.4 networks. The end-to-end communication block is responsible\
    \ for delivering\nthe capabilities of the transport and application layers of\
    \ the TCP/IP model when communication\ncrosses diﬀerent network environments.\
    \ Finally, the network communication block is responsible for\nthe communication\
    \ (routing) between the networks, of the hop-to-hop at end-to-end blocks, using\n\
    the address, for example, IPv4 and IPv6, and the ID resolution. In addition, it\
    \ will be responsible for\nmanaging the QoS.\nThe next layer is the services layer,\
    \ which is comprised of three blocks. The services block includes\nthe IoT services\
    \ and operability for their discovery and search. The organization block performs\
    \ the\nassignment of the services according to the needs of the users or the available\
    \ resources. At last,\nin business environments that relate to IoT, the modeling\
    \ and execution of service block will be invoked\nfrom the execution of the applications.\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 1042\n36 of 48\nThere are two blocks, management and security,\
    \ that act on both the previously described\ncommunication and services layers.\
    \ The management block is based on the fault, conﬁguration,\naccounting, performance,\
    \ security (FCAPS) model and framework.\nThis is a model of the ISO\nTelecommunications\
    \ Management Network [220].\nThe security block guarantees both the security and\
    \ privacy of the systems and is comprised\nof four blocks. The authentication\
    \ block is responsible for the authentication of users and services.\nThe authorization\
    \ block manages access control policies. Furthermore, access control decisions\
    \ will\nbe made based on access control policies. The key exchange & management\
    \ block is used to achieve\nsecure communications between peers. Finally, the\
    \ trust & reputation block is responsible for scoring\nthe user and calculating\
    \ the level of trust of the service.\nThe last layer is the application layer.\
    \ It allows users to interact with the IoT system. From this\nlayer, users can\
    \ receive alarms, visualize the gathered data in real-time or activate the actuators\
    \ or\nactions that have not been programmed automatically.\n7.9. Future Challenges\
    \ of IoT Irrigation Systems\nThe Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is a new\
    \ view of the IoT [221].\nIt consists of\ndeploying both underground and above\
    \ ground IoT devices that communicate among themselves\nwith underground-underground,\

    systems as the devices would not be impeding the work of machines and farmers\
    \ and it would\nreduce the amount of physical damage the nodes deployed on the\

    As it has further been commented on Section 7.1, blockchain and AI will be incorporated\
    \ into most\nIoT services [210], including those aimed at irrigation and precision\
    \ agriculture. These technologies\nprovide not only increased security but also\
    \ optimization to the management of the IoT systems.\nThis will lead to an increased\
    \ understanding of the crops and a faster way to characterize genetically\nmodiﬁed\
    \ crops and the eﬀects of new fertilizers and pesticides. Furthermore, it will\
    \ aid in optimizing\nand reducing water consumption and improving the new mechanisms\
    \ that are being proposed to\ndetermine if treated wastewater can be used for\
    \ irrigation and which crops can be irrigated with\nwastewater depending on its\
    \ composition.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n37 of 48\nLastly, farmers usually have\
    \ a very small proﬁt and thus, these IoT systems may not be aﬀordable\nto them.\
    \ Therefore, the cost of IoT devices and the overall system implementation should\
    \ have a\ndecreasing tendency for these types of systems to have a commercial\
    \ future.\n8. Conclusions and Future Work\nWater management is paramount in countries\
    \ with water scarcity. This also aﬀects agriculture, as\na large amount of water\
    \ is dedicated to this use. The rising concerns about global warming have led\n\
    to the consideration of creating water management measures to ensure the availability\
    \ of water for\nfood production and consumption. Thus, the researches on water\
    \ usage reduction for irrigation have\nincreased over the years. In this paper,\
    \ we have provided an overview of the actual state of the art\nregarding IoT irrigation\
    \ systems for agriculture. We have identiﬁed the most monitored parameters to\n\
    characterize water quality for irrigation, soil and weather conditions. We have\
    \ also identiﬁed the most\nutilized nodes to implement IoT and WSN systems for\
    \ the irrigation of crops and the most popular\nwireless technologies. Furthermore,\
    \ the current trends in the implementation of IoT systems for crop\nmanagement\
    \ and irrigation have been discussed as well. We have provided a 4-layer architecture\n\
    proposal as well for the management of crop irrigation.\nAs future work, we are\
    \ developing a smart irrigation system that evaluates water quality prior to\n\
    irrigation based on the proposed architecture.\nAuthor Contributions: Methodology,\

    \ has opened productive ways to cultivate soil with the use\nof low-cost hardware\
    \ (sensors/actuators) and communication (Internet) technologies. Remote\nequipment\
    \ and crop monitoring, predictive analytic, weather forecasting for crops or smart\
    \ logistics\nand warehousing are some examples of these new opportunities.\nNevertheless,\
    \ farmers are\nagriculture experts but, usually, do not have experience in IoT\
    \ applications. Users who use IoT\napplications must participate in its design,\
    \ improving the integration and use. In this work, different\nindustrial agricultural\
    \ facilities are analysed with farmers and growers to design new functionalities\n\
    based on IoT paradigms deployment. User-centred design model is used to obtain\
    \ knowledge and\nexperience in the process of introducing technology in agricultural\
    \ applications. Internet of things\nparadigms are used as resources to facilitate\
    \ the decision making. IoT architecture, operating rules\nand smart processes\
    \ are implemented using a distributed model based on edge and fog computing\n\
    paradigms. A communication architecture is proposed using these technologies.\
    \ The aim is to help\nfarmers to develop smart systems both, in current and new\
    \ facilities. Different decision trees to\nautomate the installation, designed\
    \ by the farmer, can be easily deployed using the method proposed\nin this document.\n\

    1. Introduction\nPrecision Agriculture (PA) is a whole-farm management approach\
    \ using information technology,\nremote sensing and proximal data gathering. These\
    \ technologies have the goal of optimising returns\non inputs while potentially\
    \ reducing environmental impacts. Farmers and agronomists have already\nbegun\
    \ employing technologies in order to improve the efﬁciency of their work. Sensors\
    \ placed\nin greenhouses allow farmers to obtain detailed data on real-time as\
    \ variables such as soil and\nambient temperature, irrigation water and soil conductivity,\
    \ soil and irrigation water PH, nutrient\ncomposition data, irrigation water properties,\
    \ etc. These data can be transmitted and analysed using\ncommunication technologies\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) paradigms could be applied. Farmers use\ntheir\
    \ smartphones to remotely monitor their crops and equipments and to run some statistical\
    \ data.\nAll of these techniques help make up PA. Nowadays, the farmers are using\
    \ resources developed by\ninformation and communication technologies. These ﬁrst\
    \ resources are easy to use but they are general\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731; doi:10.3390/s18061731\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n2 of 21\npurpose and, therefore,\
    \ not adapted to the speciﬁc needs of each farmer. In this work an user-centred\n\
    method is proposed to design intelligent and adapted services where each farmer\
    \ decides its own\ninstallation using edge and fog paradigms (distributed computing)\
    \ on Internet of Things technologies\n(Figure 1). This method is designed on different\
    \ use cases and tested in an automated greenhouse as\nan example of utility. The\
    \ work is an expanded version presented in [1]. This paper is organized as\nfollows:\
    \ Section 2 reviews precision agriculture scenarios, how to use centred design\
    \ methodologies,\nIoT technologies and their deployment, the capabilities and\
    \ potential of edge and fog computing\nparadigms in these scenarios. Different\
    \ greenhouses are analysed and farmers are consulted. Section 3\nproposes a method\
    \ to deploy distributed IoT architecture using edge and fog nodes that offer a\
    \ set\nof new resources that can be used in any type of installation which facilitates\
    \ the involvement of\nthe farmer. In Section 4, experiments including services\
    \ on edge and fog nodes, connected by IoT\ncommunication protocols, are performed.\
    \ Finally, Section 5 provides conclusions and future works.\nFigure 1. Agricultural\
    \ System.\n2. Related Works\nAlthough more complex deﬁnitions exist, the simple\
    \ description of the PA is a way to “apply the\nright treatment in the right place\
    \ at the right time” [2].\nPrecision agriculture comprises a set\nof technologies\
    \ that combine sensors, information systems, enhanced machinery and informed\n\
    management to optimize production by accounting for variability and uncertainties\
    \ within agricultural\nsystems. It is a farming management concept based upon\
    \ observing, measuring and responding to\ninter and intra-ﬁeld variability in\
    \ crops [3]. Methods and technologies to decide how, where and when\nto use sensors\
    \ and machinery should involve all the main actors: that is, farmers and information\n\
    and communication technicians. User-centred methods and IoT communication technologies\
    \ applied\non precision agriculture are revised in this section. Finally, different\
    \ greenhouses are analysed and\nfarmers are consulted.\n2.1. User-Centred Design\
    \ Models\nIn PA context, User-Centred Design (UCD) describe a design process where\
    \ farmers inﬂuence the\nprocess of how the design takes shape. There are several\
    \ ways in which the user (agricultural specialist)\ncan be involved in the process.\
    \ This term describes a set of methods to create models on which\ndesign adapted\
    \ solutions. The user-centred design process works against subjective assumptions\n\
    about user behaviour. It requires proof that the design decisions are effective.\
    \ If user-centred design is\nproperly done, applications becomes an outcome of\
    \ actively engaging users. Therefore, any design\ndecisions that were made by\
    \ observing and listening to them will not be based on personal preferences.\n\
    User experience (UX) is one of the many focuses of UCD. It includes the user’s\
    \ entire experience with\nthe product, including physical and emotional reactions.\
    \ UCD is objective and often relies on data\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n3 of 21\n\
    to support design decisions [4]. According to [5], user centred design is a development\
    \ method that\nguarantees that product, software or web site will be easy to use.\
    \ The International Usability Standard\n(ISO 13407) [6], speciﬁes the principles\
    \ that underlie user centred design:\n•\nRequirements gathering, understanding\
    \ and specifying the context of use\n•\nRequirements speciﬁcation, specifying\
    \ the user and organisational requirements\n•\nDesign, producing designs and prototypes\n\
    •\nEvaluation, carrying out user-based assessment of the site\nThe design is based\
    \ upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments. Users are\n\
    involved throughout design and development. The process is iterative. The design\
    \ is driven and\nreﬁned by user-centred evaluation. The design addresses the whole\
    \ user experience. The design team\nincludes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.\n\
    2.2. Internet of Things: Architectures and Protocols\nIot is developed using architectures\
    \ based on layers capable of connecting a huge number of\ndevices with each other\
    \ and with the established services. The basic model of IoT has a 3 layer\narchitecture\
    \ which are of Perception, Network and Application Layers. IoT faces several challenges,\n\
    especially in the ﬁeld of privacy and security, so to overcome these issues new\
    \ standard architectures\nneed to be more focused on many essential factors like\
    \ Quality of Services (QoS), data integrity,\nsustainability, conﬁdentiality,\
    \ etc. The IAB (Internet Architecture Board) has published the RFC\n7452 document:\
    \ Architectural Considerations in Smart Object Networking. This document offers\n\
    guidance to engineers designing Internet-connected smart objects. A Request for\
    \ Comments (RFC),\nin the context of Internet governance, is a type of publication\
    \ from the Internet Engineering Task Force\n(IETF) and the Internet Society (ISOC),\
    \ the principal technical development and standards-setting\nbodies for the Internet.\n\
    Table 1 illustrates different works that apply the layer model in the\nIoT architecture.\n\
    Table 1. IoT architecture: Layers.\nLayers Proposed\nCharacteristics\n3\nPerception,\
    \ Network, Application [7,8]\n4\nThings, Edge, Network, Application [9]\n5\nBusiness,\
    \ Application, Service, Object abstration, Objects [10]\nIoT needs protocols adapted\
    \ to the new requirements. Traditional protocols are extended and\nnew protocols\
    \ are proposed offering different options on different contexts. IoT has now a\
    \ wide\nrange of applications. A smart devices can have wired or wireless connection.\
    \ As far as the wireless\nIoT is the main concern, many different wireless communication\
    \ technologies and protocols can be\nused to connect the smart device such as\
    \ Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), over Low power Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks\
    \ (6LoWPAN), ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Z-Wave and Near Field\nCommunication\
    \ (NFC). They are short range standard network protocols, while SigFox and Cellular\n\
    are Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN).standard protocols. In [11] a review and\
    \ comparison of\ndifferent communication protocols in IoT is realised. This comparison\
    \ aims at presenting guidelines\nfor the researchers to be able to select the\
    \ right protocol for different applications. Table 2 illustrates\ndifferent protocols\
    \ used in the architecture layers.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n4 of 21\nTable 2.\
    \ IoT protocols.\nLayer\nProtocols\nSession/Application\nMQTT, CoAP, AMQT, HTTP,\

    WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy, Z-Wave, ZigBee, LoraWan, IEEE 802.15.4, LTE, ...\n\
    Choosing the most appropriate protocol depends on several facts of which most\
    \ important are:\nenvironmental conditions, network characteristics, the amount\
    \ of data to be transferred, security levels\nand quality of service requests\
    \ [12]. CoAP network is primarily a one-to-one protocol for transferring\nstate\
    \ information between client and server while MQTT is a many-to-many communication\n\
    protocol for exchanging messages between multiple clients. CoAP runs over UDP\
    \ which means\nthat communication overhead is signiﬁcantly reduced. If constrained\
    \ communication and battery\nconsumption is not an issue, RESTful services can\
    \ be easily implemented and interact with the Internet\nusing the worldwide HTTP\
    \ [13]. If the targeted ﬁnal applications require massive updates of the same\n\
    value, MQTT protocol is more suitable. In this work different protocols (MQTT,\
    \ HTTP, Bluetooth, WiFi,\nLTE, ...) can be used to develop proposed architecture.\n\
    2.3. Internet of Things Technologies Applied on PA Scenarios\nAdvance in electronics,\
    \ computing and telecommunications are allowing the development of\nnew devices\
    \ (sensors, actuators and computing nodes) with wireless communication capabilities,\n\
    installed at any location, smaller, energy efﬁcient, autonomous, more powerful\
    \ and low cost [14–18].\nIoT works using user-driven service modeling is proposed\
    \ in [19]. Low-cost IoT devices that need\nto gather and transmit sensor data\
    \ and receive remote commands is shown in [20–22]. IoT uses the\nconnection between\
    \ devices to improve their efﬁciency and user experience, being the communication\n\
    one of the main elements for a proper IoT network. A review of the most common\
    \ wired and wireless\ncommunication protocols, discussion of their characteristics,\
    \ advantages and disadvantages as well as\na comparison study to choose the best\
    \ bidirectional sensor network composed by low power devices is\nrealised in [23].\
    \ Previous works show the degree of development of IoT technology, which has also\n\
    been experienced in precision agriculture in recent years.\nIoT technologies are\
    \ proposed in PA scenarios. In [24] this paradigm is analysed as a solution in\n\
    precision farming. IoT Smart farming application include farm parameters tracking,\
    \ monitoring, ﬁeld\nobservation and storage monitoring. The work Internet of Things\
    \ Platform for Smart Farming [25]\npresents a platform based on IoT technologies\
    \ that can automate the collection of environmental, soil,\nfertilisation, and\
    \ irrigation data; automatically correlate such data and ﬁlter-out invalid data\
    \ from\nthe perspective of assessing crop performance; and compute crop forecasts\
    \ and personalised crop\nrecommendations for any particular farm. This platform\
    \ (SmartFarmNet) can integrate virtually any\nIoT device, including commercially\
    \ available sensors, cameras, weather stations, etc., and store their\ndata in\
    \ the cloud for performance analysis and recommendations. An evaluation of the\
    \ SmartFarmNet\nplatform and the experiences and lessons learnt in developing\
    \ this system concludes the paper.\nSmartFarmNet is the ﬁrst and currently largest\
    \ system in the world (in terms of the number of\nsensors attached, crops assessed,\
    \ and users it supports) that provides crop performance analysis\nand recommendations.\n\
    In [9] a greenhouse with hydroponic crop production was designed, developed and\
    \ tested using\nUbiquitous Sensor Network monitoring and control on Internet of\
    \ Things paradigm. The experimental\nresults showed that the Internet technologies\
    \ and Smart Object Communication Patterns can be\ncombined to encourage development\
    \ of Precision Agriculture. They demonstrated added beneﬁts\n(cost, energy, smart\
    \ developing, acceptance by agricultural specialists) when a project is launched.\n\
    Other related work is shown in [26] with Zig Bee technology: Artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ and decision\nsupport approaches have been developed. This work develop technology\
    \ for real-time monitoring\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n5 of 21\nof citrus soil moisture\
    \ and nutrients and the research on the integration of fertilization and irrigation\n\
    decision support system. The results showed that the system could help the grower\
    \ to scientiﬁcally\nfertilize or irrigate, improve the precision operation level\
    \ of citrus production, reduce the cost and\nreduce the pollution caused by chemical\
    \ fertilizer. A review into the state-of-the-art of Big Data\napplications in\
    \ Smart Farming is performed in [27]. Malche et al. [28] proposed a prototype\
    \ IoT system\nfor water level monitoring which can be implemented in future smart\
    \ villages in India. Manufacturers\nof the agricultural sector highlights the\
    \ importance of IoT in [29–32]. PA is effectively a suite of\nmethods, approaches\
    \ and instrumentation that farmers should examine in detail to decide which is\n\
    the most suitable for their business.\n2.4. Internet of Things, Cloud and Machine\
    \ Learning Evolution: Edge and Fog Computing Paradigms\nInternet of Things (IoT)\
    \ aims to bring every object (e.g. smart cameras, environmental sensors,\ncontrol\
    \ appliances, machine learning analysis) on line, hence generating massive amounts\
    \ of data that\ncan overwhelm storage systems and data analytic applications.\
    \ Cloud computing offers services at\nthe infrastructure level that can scale\
    \ to IoT storage and processing requirements. However, there are\napplications\
    \ such as sensor monitoring, control and analysis response that require low latency\
    \ therefore,\ndelay caused by transferring data to the cloud and then back to\
    \ the application can seriously impact\ntheir performances. To overcome this limitation,\
    \ Fog and Edge computing paradigms have been\nproposed, where cloud services are\
    \ extended to the edge of the network to decrease the latency and\nnetwork congestion\
    \ [33]. Both fog computing and edge computing involve pushing intelligence and\n\
    processing capabilities down closer to where the data originates from pumps, motors,\
    \ sensors, relays,\netc. The key difference between the two architectures is exactly\
    \ where that intelligence and computing\npower is placed:\n•\nFog computing pushes\
    \ intelligence down to the local area network level, processing data in a fog\n\
    node or IoT gateway\n•\nEdge computing pushes the intelligence, processing power\
    \ and communication capabilities of an\nedge gateway or appliance directly into\
    \ devices like programmable automation controllers (PACs)\nWith IoT implementation\
    \ now becoming more widespread, devices will generate a lot of data at\nthe end\
    \ of the network and many applications will be deployed at the edge to process\
    \ the information.\nCisco Systems predicts that an estimated 50 billion devices\
    \ will connect to the Internet by 2020 [34–36].\nSome of the applications they\
    \ run might require very short response times, some might involve private\ndata,\
    \ and some might produce huge quantities of data. Cloud computing cannot support\
    \ these IoT\napplications. Edge and Fog computing paradigms, on the other hand,\
    \ can do so and will promote\nmany new IoT applications.\nThe work done in [37]\
    \ concludes that the wireless sensor and actuator networks based on Edge\ncomputing\
    \ are experiencing fast development and opportunities in the post-Cloud era, and\
    \ are used\nin more and more applications. In [38] a Fog Computing Based on radio\
    \ access networks is proposed\nfor smart-cities services.\n2.5. Automated Technologies\
    \ in Greenhouses\nDifferent greenhouses in the south east of Spain have been visited\
    \ to analyse the type of installation\nand to ask expert users. The greenhouse\
    \ with the highest level of automation showed a complete\nnumber of sensors and\
    \ actuators; however, not all the sensors could be related. There are two large\n\
    subsystems in self-assembled greenhouses that are not interoperable. These subsystems\
    \ install different\ntypes of control and technologies:\n•\nIrrigation and nutrition\n\
    •\nAir conditioning and ventilation.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n6 of 21\nIn these\
    \ facilities, an ambient temperature sensor of the air conditioning system is\
    \ not related to\nan irrigation water temperature sensor of the irrigation system.\
    \ Figure 2 shows different automated\ngreenhouses where main subsystems are listed.\n\
    Figure 2. Automated greenhouses: main subsystems in current facilities.\n3. User\
    \ Centred and Computing Method Model: Distributed Computing Architecture Based\
    \ on\nEdge and Fog Nodes\nThe current agricultural facilities are divided in subsystems\
    \ (irrigation, light, climate, soil, crop\nand energy) that are not interconnected.\
    \ Industrial logic programmable controllers and specialised\nsensors give basic\
    \ automation services in each subsystem. Internet and electronic devices (smartphones)\n\
    provide new functionalities based on information access, control and monitoring.\
    \ Human interfaces\non smartphones connected to web servers are examples of new\
    \ services developed over the past years.\nAgricultural technician and farmers\
    \ have knowledge that can be converted on expert rules for device\ncontrol. These\
    \ rules are programmed and implemented on actual programmable devices; however,\n\
    they are static rules which means that do not evolve when new conditions occur,\
    \ neither do they\nadapt to the singularities of each installation. The farmer\
    \ has to decide how to set the rules: what pH\nthe irrigation water must have,\
    \ how much water should be programmed in irrigation process, etc.\nAlso, each\
    \ rule only has effects in a subsystem (irrigation, climate), there is no interoperability.\n\
    Considering this context, new facilities design and development method are proposed\
    \ in this\nwork. The aim is that the farmer participates in the automated activities\
    \ and that the subsystems\nbecome interoperable. A method that implement automatic\
    \ rules and automate the decision making\nconsidering the behaviour of the installation\
    \ itself are also proposed. The phases of the proposed\nmodel are shown in Figure\
    \ 3.\n•\nAnalysis: two kind of users are identiﬁed in this phase (agriculture\
    \ user expert and ICT technician).\nExpert users in agriculture are interviewed\
    \ to deﬁne main processes to control. All these issues are\nrelated with ICT expert\
    \ in a participatory design. The results of this ﬁrst approach are the things\n\
    required to design services and control. In this phase an user-centred methodology\
    \ captures the\nfarmer requirements.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n7 of 21\n•\nDesign:\
    \ the model is based on an architecture with three levels: edge, fog and cloud\
    \ services.\nIn this phase an adapted architecture using these levels is designed.\
    \ The adapted architecture is\nshown in Figure 4.\n•\nIntegration and data analysis:\
    \ Installation and Integration subsystems are developed in this phase.\nData analysis\
    \ is proposed to design machine learning services based on expert rules with farmer.\n\
    •\nStart up, measure and feedback: Test and feedback are launched.\nThe ﬁrst expert\
    \ rules\nare integrated with farmer supervision.\nNew rules are designed with\
    \ feedback processes.\nAutomatic and adapted rules are developed using artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence systems with machine\nlearning platforms.\nFigure 3. User centred\
    \ model based on design and integration of edge and fog communication levels.\n\
    Cloud services and machine learning processes are integrated using this method.\n\
    Figure 4. Architecture: communication levels with different functionality.\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 1731\n8 of 21\n3.1. User-Centred Analysis and Design\nThere are two\
    \ cases treated:\n•\nAgricultural installation with some automated facilities\
    \ already installed\n•\nNew agricultural installation\nThe method is the same\
    \ for both. Expert users in agriculture are interviewed to deﬁne new\nprocesses\
    \ to control. In this ﬁrst approach, the things (objects) required, their relationships\
    \ and the\npotential services are detected. Once objects and services have been\
    \ detected, they must be related\nto the necessary communication and control technologies\
    \ (IoT protocols). Human Interfacing are\nadjusted. Expert rules and intelligent\
    \ services are analysed (Edge and Fog computing proposal). Finally,\nthe installation,\
    \ maintenance and operation methods are designed. All this is designed between\
    \ user\nagricultural technician and information technologies expert.\nThe results\
    \ of this ﬁrst approach are the things required to design services and control.\
    \ A ﬁrst set\nof sensors, actuators, variables, processes and controllers are\
    \ designed considering production facility.\nThis set of objects will be considers\
    \ like things in the next stage.\nIn this description, a thing is formed by an\
    \ object/entity and a context with data associated.\nEach thing has a n-tuple\
    \ data structure (ID, time, date, location, relations, state) where ID, data,\n\
    location, relations with other things and states are deﬁned. Table 3 represents\
    \ different things.\nExpert users design control rules using the things deﬁned.\
    \ These control rules are part of control\nprocesses (climate, soil, irrigation,\
    \ crop, energy or image) that are distributed in different embedded\nsystems connected\
    \ to the network (intranet/internet). Things are a virtual representation of all\n\
    available resources that can be deployed in the different subsystems of the installation.\n\
    At this level all objects/things are recognized by designers. Basic control algorithms\
    \ of all\nsubsystems are designed.\nTable 3. Things context designed in smart\
    \ control processes.\nObject/Thing\nContext\nSensori\n(ID, time, date, location,\

    \ state)\n3.2. Integration: Architecture Development\nIn the previous phase objects\
    \ and their relationship with basic algorithms has been designed.\nAn architecture\
    \ adapted to the facility available is developed in this phase. Requirements are:\n\
    1.\nInterconnection and data access of all subsystems data\n2.\nFacilities and\
    \ resources to implement expert rules\n3.\nConﬁguration, operation and modiﬁcation\
    \ processes\nIoT and AI paradigms provide resources to propose an innovative architecture\
    \ that can be used in\nnew smart precision agriculture services. Edge computing\
    \ used on control devices and fog computing\nnodes installed on local network\
    \ provide powerful technologies to implement conﬁguration, operation\nand improvement\
    \ processes.\nIoT protocols provide resources to capture and communique all subsystems\
    \ data. Each subsystem\nis composed by objects/things (sensor/actuator) that can\
    \ be connected and processed using nodes on\nsensor networks with IoT protocols.\
    \ The requirements established for PA scenarios are:\n•\nStandard and interoperable\
    \ communication protocols to develop open and reusable applications.\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 1731\n9 of 21\n•\nLow-power consumption of all devices installed improve\
    \ the establishment and development.\n•\nEasy access and maintenance. Users are\
    \ not specialized in information technologies. It is important\nto improve its\
    \ acceptability.\n•\nSupport the integration of new smart modules (modularity\
    \ and scalability software and hardware).\n•\nNon-proprietary hardware-software\
    \ to reduce dependencies.\n•\nLow cost devices selection increases the level of\
    \ penetration.\nIoT protocols are designed to work on communication scenarios\
    \ and requirements established.\nThey are optimised for control and two-way open\
    \ communication channels. In these works [39–41]\nMessage Queuing Telemetry Transport\
    \ (MQTT) protocol is proposed as communication paradigm\nbetween sensors, actuators,\
    \ communication nodes, devices and subsystems. Some of the features that\nmakes\
    \ it especially suitable for this project are:\n•\nMQTT is a publish-subscribe\
    \ messaging protocol developed for resource-constrained devices [42],\na model\
    \ already in use by enterprises worldwide, and can work with legacy systems.\n\
    •\nAll messages have a topic path composed of words separated by slashes. A common\
    \ form is\n/place/device-type/device-id/measurement-type/status. The subscribers\
    \ may use wild-cards to\nsubscribe to all measurements coming from a speciﬁc class\
    \ of device.\n•\nThe bandwidth requirements are extremely low, and the nature\
    \ of the protocol makes it\nvery energy-efﬁcient.\n•\nThe programming interface\
    \ is very simple, and the client memory footprint is small, making it\nespecially\
    \ suitable for embedded devices.\n•\nThree Quality of Service (QoS) levels provide\
    \ reliable operations [43].\nUbiquitous networks allow an n-to-m nodes communication\
    \ model. Any node is able to query\nand be queried by other nodes. In addition,\
    \ any node may play the role of a base station (skin node)\ncapable of transmitting\
    \ its information to remote processing places using a gateway device. USN local\n\
    nodes can use and process local data, with a gateway these nodes have a global\
    \ accessibility and\nthey offer extended services on an IoT scenario.\nLocal and\
    \ global access over the same node\n(sensor/device/actuator) has different possibilities\
    \ and beneﬁts. Whereas a local data processing\nis necessary in basic process\
    \ control (security, system start-stop, etc.), global processing (analytic)\n\
    can be used in pattern detection and information generation. In this sense, the\
    \ proposed platform\nuses both technologies combined: different USN over a local\
    \ network area (intranet) connected to\ncloud-IoT services (internet). A computing\
    \ layer in local area, called edge computing, will serve as\ninterface between\
    \ control processes and cloud-services. This layer will be able to process data\
    \ before\ncommunicating to cloud.\n3.3. Data Analysis: Edge and Fog Computing\
    \ Conﬁguration\nThe development of edge and fog computing can be understood in\
    \ three phases:\n•\nConnection: Numerous heterogeneous, real time connections\
    \ between terminals and devices\nwill serve edge computing, as will automatic\
    \ network deployment and operation. Additionally,\nsecurity, reliability, and\
    \ interoperability of connections should be guaranteed. An application of\nthis\
    \ phase is remote automatic soil parameters and ambient conditions data reading\n\
    •\nData treatment on edge computing devices: In this phase, data analysis and\
    \ automatic services\ndevelop new capabilities that are implemented on the new\
    \ edge nodes. Applications of this\nphase can be data ﬁltering, predictive calculation\
    \ of climatic data, classiﬁcation services or\ndetection events\n•\nServices on\
    \ fog computing nodes: Enabled by technologies such as AI and IoT communication\n\
    protocols. Fog computing nodes carries out smart analysis and computing, as well\
    \ as implementing\ndynamic, real-time self-optimization, and executing policy\
    \ adjustments. Applications of this phase\nare prediction of water consumption,\
    \ smart detection or unattended production\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n10 of 21\n\
    Figure 5 shows the architecture implemented using edge and fog nodes. When automated\n\
    subsystems are already installed it is necessary to interleaved embedded devices\
    \ (edge-nodes) between\ncontrollers and sensors/actuators. This devices maintain\
    \ the initial services and allow to initiate\na supervised learning process. New\
    \ algorithms are tested and approved on edge and fog nodes.\nIn Figure 6 different\
    \ services are proposed on each node.\nFigure 5. Architecture proposed on facilities\
    \ already automated: edge nodes interleaved between\ndevices already installed\
    \ and fog nodes that interconnect all subsystems.\nFigure 6. Architecture implemented:\
    \ services proposed.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n11 of 21\n3.4. Test and Feedback\
    \ Developing\nIn machine learning systems the output is not ﬁxed. It will change\
    \ over time as the solution\nknows more and as the model on which the machine\
    \ learning system is built evolves as it is fed more\ndata. This forces the testing\
    \ professional to think differently and adopt test strategies that are very\n\
    different from traditional testing techniques. To test machine learning systems\
    \ is essential:\n1.\nObtaining data sets: This refers to a data set with main\
    \ variables captured and stored to analyse\nand design the model. In irrigation\
    \ process data set are: irrigation programming used (time and\nﬂow), ambient conditions\
    \ (humidity, temperature) and soil conditions (humidity, temperature,\npH and\
    \ conductivity) captured by sensors. All this data are monitored and stored.\n\
    2.\nTraining data sets: This refers to a data set used for training the model.\
    \ It is a subset of the\nprevious dataset. In irrigation process training data\
    \ set are: irrigation programming automated\nby the model (time and ﬂow decision)\
    \ considering ambient conditions (soil, ambient and crop).\nThis data is usually\
    \ prepared by collecting data in a semi-automated way. The results of this\nprocess\
    \ are validated with agronomists.\n3.\nTesting data sets: It is a dataset used\
    \ to to measure the model quality.\n4.\nValidation test suites on real scenarios.\
    \ Taking the irrigation example, test scenarios include\ncategorizing needs of\
    \ water for a kind of crop considering climatic conditions and its growth\nphase.\
    \ Automated irrigation decisions by the model are analysed in this phase.\n5.\n\
    Building validation suites. It is necessary to understand the algorithm. The model\
    \ has algorithm\nthat analyse the data provided, looks for speciﬁc patterns, and\
    \ uses the results of this analysis\nto develop optimal parameters for creating\
    \ the model. The model is reﬁned as the number of\niterations and the richness\
    \ of the data increase.\n6.\nCommunicating test results in statistical terms.\
    \ Models based on machine learning algorithms\nwill produce approximations and\
    \ not exact results. Quality of results must be analysed in the\nsame context.\
    \ The testing community will need to determine the level of conﬁdence within a\n\
    certain range.\n7.\nModel evolution. Support to develop new AI services or modiﬁcations\
    \ on algorithms\nimplemented. Supervised and automatic changes are processes to\
    \ maintain the operating models.\n3.5. Comparison with Industrial Facilities.\
    \ Novelty Elements Proposed\nCurrently, industrial facilities that use PA technologies\
    \ are based on integration of internet and web\nservices with automation and control\
    \ using industrial technology. Proprietary systems are designed for\nmonitoring\
    \ large production plants. Related work analysed show that the Agriculture Control\
    \ system\nfor production, irrigation, or climate proposes different monitoring\
    \ and control technologies, based on\nwireless sensor network and industrial control.\
    \ Monitoring systems analyse crop environment and the\nmethod to improve the decision\
    \ making by analysing statistics and reactive algorithms. This work\nproposes\
    \ two main novelty elements: optimization of architecture levels integration of\
    \ edge and fog\nlayers and proposes the integration the farmer in the design of\
    \ new improvements using data analysis\nobtained with the new architecture developed.\n\
    4. Experimental Work\nDifferent agricultural facilities have been analysed to\
    \ introduce the method proposed. Three kind\nof installations summarize the different\
    \ types:\n•\nInstallation automated but subsystems not interoperable\n•\nPartial\
    \ automation without any interconnection and non-interoperable systems\n•\nManual\
    \ control\nIn all of them, the services based on AI are not yet installed. In\
    \ this context, the method proposed\nusing edge-computing on basic controllers\
    \ and fog-computing on gateway nodes can design common\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\
    12 of 21\nservices for the three types of facilities cited. With this conﬁguration,\
    \ subsystems interoperability and\nAI support are achieved. Control signals of\
    \ already installed controllers in automated installations\nbecome inputs to edge\
    \ nodes and a fog node which acts as an interface for all facility nodes. In all\n\
    greenhouses, irrigation and internal environment control are basic processes.\
    \ Agronomist users know\nhow to program reactive controls and how to conﬁgure\
    \ automated devices. Optimization of these\nresources (water, energy) are two\
    \ potential services that agronomist perform through their experience.\nThis knowledge\
    \ can be transferred to intelligent systems that integrate it through techniques\
    \ based on\nAI paradigms. Interconnection of subsystems also are one of the proposed\
    \ improvement. A deployment\nfor an automated installation is designed and implemented.\
    \ This case shows how to implement\nwhen there are already automated installations.\
    \ This case also serves as a guide for other types of\ngreenhouse installations.\n\
    4.1. Analysis\nThe farmer, together with the technician in information technologies,\
    \ propose a set\nof improvements:\n•\nMonitoring and control interfaces on the\
    \ Internet (control and communication services)\n•\nEvent and change communication\
    \ service (communication services)\n•\nInterconnection of irrigation and air conditioning\
    \ subsystems (interoperability services)\n•\nIntegration of automation to optimize\
    \ water consumption (AI services)\nThe work carried out designs an installation\
    \ that deploy the necessary hardware and software\nresources using the proposed\
    \ method Figure (Figure 7) shows agricultural subsystems and model\ndeployed on\
    \ distributed nodes.\nFigure 7. Greenhouse design. Fog and edge nodes relations\
    \ on agriculture subsystems.\nIntelligent irrigation control is installed in an\
    \ experimental greenhouse based on tomato\nhydroponic cultivation (Table 4). Following\
    \ the proposed method, the experimental phases are:\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\

    \ Communication and Context\nIrrigation process, soil parameters, environmental\
    \ conditions inside and outside the greenhouse\nand energy consumption deﬁne objects\
    \ and context. Sensors, actuators and processes and their\nrelationship (context)\
    \ are shown in Table 5. Context vector are (ID, time, date, GH1, relations, state)\
    \ for\neach object/thing, where GH1 is the location ID of greenhouse.\nAll objects\
    \ are interoperable using MQTT protocol. Publisher and subscriber communication\n\
    model that implement this protocol allows interconnect all devices and things.\
    \ Broker device are\ninstalled on fog node. Publishers and subscribers are implemented\
    \ on different nodes.\n4.3. Hardware Devices and Software Modules\nTwo edge nodes\
    \ and one fog node are proposed to control climate and irrigation processes.\n\
    Objects (things) and processes are deployed on all nodes. Irrigation and climate\
    \ control are installed\nin edge nodes, AI services are implemented in fog node.\
    \ Process control architecture is used in\nthe ﬁrst node type (edge) and data-centred\
    \ architecture is used in the second node type (fog) and\nin the cloud services\
    \ implemented. In edge node the ﬂow of data comes from a set of variables\n(things\
    \ and internal variables) which control the processes execution. Agronomist and\
    \ expert users\ndesigns basic control algorithms. After learning and training\
    \ process, these algorithms will be adjusted\nand modiﬁed following the results\
    \ of the expert system (machine learning). The aim is to optimize\nresources (water,\
    \ energy) without losing productivity. Two main control processes are executed\
    \ in\ntwo edge nodes and one machine learning process is implemented in a fog\
    \ node. Table 5 shows these\nprocesses and their relationship. Algorithms are\
    \ implemented in Python and developed using open\nsource criteria. Minimal hardware\
    \ embedded devices requirements are shown in Table 6.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\

    \ and Testing\nIn facilities already automated, edge nodes are interleaved between\
    \ the installed controllers\nand actual sensors and actuators. Some new sensors\
    \ are installed to complete services designed\n(energy meter). In current facilities\
    \ edge nodes are deployed and allows:\n•\nWork in the same way as before (initial\
    \ learning stage, analysis and model selection).\n•\nChange to a new control using\
    \ new expert and automatic rules using AI processes (supervised stage\nand training)\n\
    •\nTest and reconﬁgure expert rules (testing and maintenance)\nFigure 8 shows\
    \ an edge node to irrigation control and how is deployed in the experimental\n\
    greenhouse built in this work, without previous installation. Agronomists and\
    \ farmers preferences are\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n15 of 21\nthose that drive\
    \ the design: interfaces, maintain and optimize control processes. In irrigation\
    \ process a\ntime schedule with the selected flow rate is programmed by the user\
    \ according to the period of crop\ngrowth. In learning stage, edge node captures\
    \ the data and sends it to the fog node. Fog node process\ndiary water uses, ambient\
    \ and soil conditions, type of crop and its growth. Using these data crop\ntype\
    \ is classified. Crop production results are added as data to analyse it together\
    \ with the stored ones.\nProduction, water consumption, crop growing stage, time,\
    \ date, soil parameters, current weather, forecast\nweather and ambient green\
    \ house conditions are captured as inputs to machine learning platform.\n(a) Hardware\
    \ device\n(b) Software processes\nFigure 8. Hardware and software deployed on\
    \ experimental greenhouse edge node.\nIn future crop productions the irrigation\
    \ schedule can be automated, first with human supervision\nand then automated.\
    \ Biophysical variables (plant, soil, canal flow, and weather conditions) that\
    \ are\nmeasured during the growing seasons are used as inputs to build the models.\
    \ Information about\ncrop phenology (growth stages), soil moisture, and weather\
    \ variables will be compiled. The analysis\nof irrigation decisions is important\
    \ because this can help in the estimation of short-term irrigation\ndemands. If\
    \ the automated process decisions are known, It can help canal operators to better\
    \ manage\nwater deliveries and avoid unexpected delays and operational conditions\
    \ that increase canal losses.\nInformation about these demands can also be helpful\
    \ for the evaluation of expected future agricultural\nsupplies. It can never be\
    \ possible to know the exact reasons why a farmer decided to irrigate, all farmers\n\
    are different and prefer their own decision processes. Data analysis with farmer\
    \ in in its own installation\ninfer automated farmer actions. This data is used\
    \ to build the models and these learnt frameworks will\nbe used to predict irrigation\
    \ decisions. The specific objectives planned with farmer are:\n1.\nIdentify the\
    \ main variables contributing to an irrigation behaviour by training the models\
    \ with\nrelevant data\n2.\nGroup the irrigation decisions into distinct classes\n\
    3.\nIdentify the decisions taken\n4.\nDetect the patterns in farmer decisions\n\
    5.\nInfer future irrigation decisions using the information and modelling tools.\

    \ conductivity means) that farmer decide to use in\nirrigation control to design\
    \ new rules to optimize production. Before, control irrigation was controlled\n\
    only by a time schedule. Now, it takes into account data sensors to decide if\
    \ watering and growth\ncontrol can be optimized with decision trees.\nFigure 9.\

    \ is designed by\nfarmer observing the evolution of the data during the plant\
    \ growth.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n17 of 21\nFigure 11. Decision Tree on irrigation\

    \ monitoring data accessed through a Human Machine Interface (HMI).\nIoT platforms\
    \ push data from any Internet-Enabled Device and prompt them to quickly get\n\
    started.\nSimilar platforms with similar services show the state of commercial\
    \ IoT technology:\nAzure [45], Ubidots [46], Thingspeak [47], are some examples\
    \ of companies that provide IoT\nservices. These platforms are built with similar\
    \ architectures and provide, usually, the same resources:\nApplication Programming\
    \ Interface (API) communication between clients and IoT server.\nAll these platforms\
    \ provide dashboard designs to monitor data using HMI formats pre-built.\nUsing\
    \ API services, processes in fog node are implemented to send new data to each\
    \ dashboard.\nThe API Documentation speciﬁes the structure of the data that is\
    \ exchanged between your devices and\nthe Ubidots and Mobile-Alerts Cloud, along\
    \ with code examples and libraries to speed up the project.\nFigure 12 shows a\
    \ dashboard (interface HMI) designed by users on Ubidots cloud platform. The system\n\
    can use standard protocols in the different layers and platforms that implement\
    \ these protocols.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n18 of 21\nFigure 12. Dashboards designed\
    \ for irrigation programming and monitoring.\n5. Conclusions and Future Work\n\
    In this work the state-of-the-art of PA and IoT technologies in agricultural scenarios,\
    \ have been\nanalysed. PA presents difﬁculties to be implemented by farmers. These\
    \ include cultural perception,\nlack of local technical expertise, infrastructure\
    \ constraints, knowledge and technical gaps and high\nstart-up costs. Farmers\
    \ must be involved in the design and integration of these technologies in their\n\
    facilities. To carry out this solution there must be methods to facilitate such\
    \ integration. This work\nproposes a new method to integrate the farmer in the\
    \ development of new solutions using low cost\nsensing technologies and innovative\
    \ communication paradigms. An architecture based on two new\nlevels of communication\
    \ and processing nodes (edge and fog nodes) form the technological core\nof the\
    \ proposed method. Each level performs a set of interconnected functionalities.\
    \ The proposed\ninfrastructure can be installed either in already automated installations\
    \ or in the design of new facilities.\nIn the already automated installations,\
    \ the method introduces new possibilities for the development of\nintelligent\
    \ and interconnected control. An experimental work has been carried out in a greenhouse.\n\
    In this work, communication nodes have been installed and a new service based\
    \ on a decision tree\nparadigm has been designed by expert user. The facilities\
    \ that use the proposed model make the\nclimate control and irrigation subsystems\
    \ interoperable and allow the farmer to design new integrated\ncontrol rules.\
    \ The new distributed communication model allows the farmer to analyse changes\
    \ and\nimprovements. This experimental work initiates a new methodology of work\
    \ for the farmer who can\nuse these new technologies more easily. Future control\
    \ rules and services using a machine learning\nplatform and AI paradigms will\
    \ allow to optimize and improve the results.\nAuthor Contributions: F.J.F.-P.\

    Things (IoT) and smart computing technologies have revolutionized every sphere
    of 21 st century humans. IoT technologies and the data driven services they offer
    were beyond imagination just a decade ago. Now, they surround us and influence
    a variety of domains such as automobile, smart home, healthcare, etc. In particular,
    the Agriculture and Farming industries have also embraced this technological intervention.
    Smart devices are widely used by a range of people from farmers to entrepreneurs.
    These technologies are used in a variety of ways, from finding real-time status
    of crops and soil moisture content to deploying drones to assist with tasks such
    as applying pesticide spray. However, the use of IoT and smart communication technologies
    introduce a vast exposure to cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in smart
    farming environments. Such cyber attacks have the potential to disrupt the economies
    of countries that are widely dependent on agriculture. In this paper, we present
    a holistic study on security and privacy in a smart farming ecosystem. The paper
    outlines a multi layered architecture relevant to the precision agriculture domain
    and discusses the security and privacy issues in this dynamic and distributed
    cyber physical environment. Further more, the paper elaborates on potential cyber
    attack scenarios and highlights open research challenges and future directions.

    According to the United Nations (UN), the world population is expected to exceed
    9 billion people by 2050, growing by almost a third of the current population
    [1], [2]. Such an increase in the population demands a boost of almost 70 percent
    in the food production rate, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations.1 This rapidly growing population also introduces a variety
    of other problems such as increasing competition and exploitation of land, water
    and other natural resources. These issues present an urgent need to reduce the
    dependence of food system on our environment. Consequently, the need for an evolutionary
    agricultural paradigm to keep up with growing demand of food and crop production
    is necessary to guarantee a sustainable development [3]. Smart farming technologies2
    and precision agriculture3 [4] are gaining more attraction for their potential
    to fulfill such an increasing demand and meet global food supply needs. Smart
    farming technologies involve integration of technology and data driven agriculture
    applications to increase crop yield and quality of food products. There are numerous
    smart farming use cases [5]–[7] present globally indicating the impact of this
    new paradigm of practicing agriculture. As an example, the use of remote sensors
    placed in the soil for measuring blueberry irrigation in Chile has reduced the
    volume of water used in farming by 70 percent [8]. In India, farm data has been
    used to predict and prevent crop diseases, which reduced the risk associated with
    the failure of crop production [9]. Similar data driven approaches have helped
    fruit farmers in Slovenia effectively fight against pests.4 Smart farming, however,
    goes beyond primary production. In fact, it has impacted the complete food supply
    chain, by employing big data analytics to provide useful insights about the entire
    farming process [10] by facilitating real-time operational decision making, and
    revolutionizing existing agriculture business models. Smart farming enhances conventional
    farming practices by introducing on-field smart sensors and devices. These sensors
    and devices work in a synergistic manner to provide efficient farming experiences,
    as well as, an improved crop yield. Although beneficial to the productivity of
    the industry, the use of heterogeneous, internet-connected devices has exposed
    potential cyber attacks and vulnerabilities in the agriculture sector. These attacks
    introduce the ability to remotely control and exploit on-field sensors and autonomous
    vehicles (tractors, aerial vehicles, etc). Potential agricultural attacks can
    create an unsafe and unproductive farming environment. For example, exploits that
    have the ability to destroy an entire field of standing grown crops, flood the
    farmlands, over spray pesticides using smart drones, etc. can cause unsafe consumption
    as well as economic deterioration. Such attacks in a large coordinated manner,
    also referred to as agro-terrorism [11], also have the potential of disrupting
    the economy of an agriculture-dependent nation. A report [12] released by the
    U.S. Department of Homeland Security extensively elaborates various cyber threat
    scenarios in precision agriculture, further emphasizing the need for research
    in this critical domain. The Agriculture industry adds 6.4 percent of the world’s
    economic production with a total of $5,084,800 million.5 Agriculture, food, and
    related industries contributed $1.053 trillion to U.S. gross domestic product
    (GDP) in 2017.6 At the same time, United State’s farms contributed $132.8 billion
    of this sum which is almost 1 percent of GDP. Agriculture contributed 1.2 % to
    the European Union’s (EU) GDP in 2017 whereas EU’s agricultural industry added
    gross value of EUR 188.5 billion in 20177 at a record high. Out of 226 countries,
    nine countries have agriculture sector as the dominant sector in their economy.
    The U.S. food and agriculture system has a total economic impact of $7.06 trillion8
    and one-fourth of the overall jobs in the country are connected to it. Most countries
    globally export agricultural products. As a result, cyber vulnerabilities can
    have a significant impact on global food security. A sophisticated agro-terrorism
    attack on a (large) exporting country like the U.S. could harm the health of millions
    of consumers world-wide. In addition, attacks could reduce confidence on domestic
    consumption and destroy the United State’s status as a trusted food exporter.
    A report released in 2018 by the Council of Economic Advisors,9 “The Cost of Malicious
    Cyber Activity to the U.S. Economy” suggests the agriculture sector as one of
    the 16 critical infrastructure sectors that are important to both the U.S. economy
    and national security for which cyber protection is particularly important. It
    also reported that the agriculture sector experienced 11 cyber incidents in 2016.
    According to the World Health Organization,10 420,000 people die every year from
    food-related illnesses and 600 million people fall ill as a result of food contaminated
    with bacteria, viruses, toxins or chemicals. A cyber attack on the food ecosystem
    targeted at farms, transportation system, or food processing industrial control
    systems (ICSs) may increase these numbers exponentially. Other important industries
    like energy, financial or healthcare have understood the need for resilient infrastructure
    and have hardened their defenses. However, the food and agriculture industry is
    still a low hanging fruit for threat actors. Food Protection and Defense Institute
    (FPDI) at the University of Minnesota has discovered that food industry ICSs may
    be distinctly vulnerable to cyberattacks.11 Food industry operations technology
    personnel, in particular, those responsible for operating and maintaining ICSs,
    are experts trained in food and production safety production and not in cybersecurity.
    This presents a huge gap between employing smart farm technology and securing
    it correctly and persistently. If not continuously monitored, cyber attacks on
    smart agriculture technologies can have grave implications on several stakeholders
    in the ecosystem. These groups include farmers, end consumers, food processing
    industries, agriculture co-operatives, livestock, government agencies and nations
    critically dependent on agriculture. Figure 1, shows an end to end interaction
    among various entities involved in smart farming ecosystem. Physical sensors and
    livestock in the field generate data and receive command operations via user applications.
    These on-farm devices are connected to gateway supported edge nodes, which help
    enable in-farm device communication, filter sensor data and real time agronomy
    analytics. At the same time, data lakes in the cloud hold a large amount of data
    and information including but not limited to, environmental information (e.g.
    soil moisture level and fertility status), monitoring information (e.g. sensors
    and smart machinery status), energy management data, and other sensitive information.
    In terms of security and data privacy, it is needless to say that manipulation
    and leakage of such data, as well as the impairment of physical equipment and
    software systems, can induce serious consequences. FIGURE 1. A model of end-to-end
    interaction between various stakeholders in smart farming. Show All Extensive
    research on secure IoT devices [13]–[15], smart vehicles [16]–[19], drones [20],
    [21], edge cloud [22]–[24], wireless communication [25]–[27] is already available
    and might be extended to the smart farming ecosystem. However, most of the time,
    research is conducted on these technologies without consideration of the environment
    they are used. The dynamic smart farming environment, has unique characteristics
    such as farm equipment, labor sharing, and operational decisions, influenced by
    environmental conditions. Domain specific issues such as like location, user skill
    set, insider threats, generated data, need smart-farming-specific security mechanisms.
    The development of smart farm technologies therefore, demands further research
    before wide adoption in the community. The current state of the art and our review
    (discussed in Section V) on smart farming, demands further research in security
    and privacy aspects of this evolving domain. As the research, on cybersecurity
    for smart farming is in its infancy, our objective in this review is to provide
    a holistic view of cybersecurity developments in smart farming. In this paper,
    we discuss current threats, analyze potential cybersecurity attacks, review the
    existing scattered security research, and summarize open research challenges in
    the smart farming field as illustrated in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. A roadmap of cybersecurity
    research and challenges in smart farming. Show All This paper has the following
    key contributions: It provides an overview of smart farming focused multi-layered
    architecture, highlighting multiple entry points and communication across layers.

    including next generation network security, trustworthy supply chain and compliance,
    adversarial machine learning and AI, and access control, trust and information
    sharing. The remainder of this paper is as follows. Multi-layered architecture
    for smart farming is discussed in Section II. Section III elaborates security
    and privacy issues, whereas Section IV discusses different attacks on the smart
    farming ecosystem including the supply chain side. Existing research and state
    of the art in smart farming security is discussed in Section V. Section VI highlights
    open research challenges and possible approaches to solutions. Finally, Section
    VII draws conclusion to this research paper. SECTION II. Smart Farming Landscape
    & Architecture Figure 3, depicts a multi layer architecture for the smart farming
    ecosystem. The proposed architecture adapts and extends widely discussed IoT and
    Cyber Physical System (CPS) multi-layer architectures [28]–[31]. These architectures
    recognize the use of cloud and edge services, and the infinite capabilities provided
    by them to fully harness the data generated from smart devices at the physical
    layer [32]–[37]. Our smart farming architecture, also reflects different user
    applications which can be envisioned at various layers. It also considers, vast
    amounts of data collected at edge or cloud layers, and highlights the need for
    various multi-cloud or edge-cloud scenarios. Overall the architecture consists
    of four layers: Physical layer, Edge layer, Cloud layer, and Network Communication
    layer. The latter spans across all three previous layers and connect them. FIGURE
    3. Multi layer smart farming architecture. Show All A. Physical Layer The bottom
    layer in the architecture comprises of real physical sensors and gateway devices
    which are spread across agriculture farms or in greenhouse buildings. These devices
    include drones flying in the air, autonomous tractors, sensors embedded in livestock,
    or hub devices installed to provide communication among smart objects or with
    a central cloud. These devices are responsible for data sensing and based on the
    information gathered, help in actuating other devices to realise various smart
    farming use cases. They collect real time information about weather conditions,
    soil moisture level, or cattle’s body temperature, which can be sent to the edge
    or cloud supported intelligent decision making systems to provide recommendations
    and enable automation. For example, data gathered from soil moisture sensing device
    in the field, after getting processed in the edge or cloud, can help in determining
    the amount of water needed at the farm, optimize irrigation schedule and offers
    a convenient experience to the end farmers. B. Edge Layer This layer is near to
    the end-users and end-devices for local real-time computations and decisions.
    It reduces the computation load off the centralized cloud layer and also the network
    load. Edge computing layer consists of multiple edge nodes. Each node represents
    a gateway that include services such as: data capturing, security monitoring and
    detection, prediction and real-time decision support. Data capturing services
    include, data aggregation, filtering, encrypting and encoding of real-time data
    streams. Prediction services usually rely on machine learning models trained on
    the central cloud and deployed on the edge layer. They are used to predict and/or
    categorize certain events related to plant or livestock such as, prediction of
    crop yield, categorization of plants or livestock health, predictions about the
    amount of fertilizer and water needed for a patch of land, so as to maximize yield,
    or estimating soil erosion. Security monitoring and detection mechanisms can be
    deployed for real-time monitoring of anomalous events and classifying these events
    as malicious or benign. This includes services like, anomaly detection and device
    failures prediction. C. Cloud Layer Precision Agriculture (PA) and cloud computing
    paradigms offer advances to enhance PA connectivity. The cloud layer is generally
    virtualized in data centers and communicates with the other layers using the Internet.
    Generally, these cloud layer platforms follow the Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    architecture model where the users can focus on running applications and importing
    their data. The PaaS provider runs and maintains a data broker that collects data
    being pushed in from the edge layer and saves these records in a Distributed File
    System (DFS). This stored data is used by analytic software to mine knowledge.
    This data analytics component computes insights and these are pushed to the end
    user through a client application running on the users’ machine. Popular farm
    equipment manufacturers like, John Deere,12 Farmers Business Network,13 etc. have
    created several cloud based products that help users monitor various sensors and
    vehicles used on a farm. These PaaS systems generally run on popular cloud computing
    platforms like Amazon Web Services,14 Google Cloud,15 etc. The way these farming
    PaaS systems are built using these popular cloud computing platforms also introduce
    various security challenges in smart farming ecosystem. D. Network Communication
    Layer The common theme for most, if not all, current technologies is “connectivity”.
    With a growing need for a boundary-less Internet, the idea of a network of smart
    devices has become a reality. This concept, known as the Internet of Things (IoT),
    allows connected devices to be monitored, controlled, and shared data among each
    other. This data can be analyzed and used by multiple applications. In smart farming,
    as shown in Figure 3, the network layer not only facilitates edge and physical
    layer connectivity, but also provides an interface for them to interact with the
    cloud layer. From exchanging soil temperature through a peer-to-peer sensor communication
    system, to sending farm monitoring data to the cloud data stores through high
    speed mobile networks such as 5G [38], or updating the farmer about corp quality
    via a wireless adhoc topology [39], network layer offers a means of communication
    to bind all other layers. Network layer has two main responsibilities in a smart
    farming system. Firstly, there are diverse set of heterogeneous devices in every
    layers of a smart farming system. The network layer provides a secure and efficient
    network stack where, wire, wireless and mobile sub-networks can communicate in
    a compatible and cross-layer manner. The second responsibility of the layer is
    to preserve connectivity and therefore, increase availability. From bigdata processing
    systems used to analyze collected data to individual sensors that collect information
    from the field, this layer is needed for system-wide cyber communication. Real
    World Smart Farming Use Cases: The proposed smart farming architecture is constructed
    based on multiple literature and real world smart farming use cases. It can be
    viewed as a general smart farming architecture that satisfies most of the use
    cases. However, it should be noted that not all use cases will include all four
    layers as proposed in the architecture. Blackhills Farm in New Zealand, a 400-hectare
    property with over 2000 cattle and 800 sheep, has adopted the use of SCADAfarm16
    system which allows the owners to remotely monitor water and energy consumption,
    location of irrigators, soil moisture measurements and real-time weather information.
    The farm uses Schneider Electrics’s EcoStuxture IoT architecture17 which corresponds
    to our physical layer and sensors. It also utilizes Microsoft Azure18 IoT suite
    with communication provided by the Vodafone New Zealand cellular network which
    corresponds to the cloud and network layer in out framework. Similarly, a 7,000-acre
    farm at Beltsville Area Research Center, was developed by the United States Department
    of Agriculture (USDA) to act as a testbed for smart farming technologies. The
    farm was equipped with a physical layer including sensors, drones and IoT-enabled
    farm equipment for a public-private program called Farmbeats [5]. The farm adopts
    a two-layer hybrid network: a layer based on TV White Spaces [40] technology for
    connectivity over long range which connects the farmer’s home Internet connection
    to IoT base stations on the farm, and a layer based on Wi-Fi technology which
    connects smart sensors to the IoT base stations. Such IoT base stations (gateways)
    are equivalent to the edge cloud layer (Figure 3) in our proposed general architecture.
    Additionally, the data collected at the IoT stations are pushed to the cloud layer
    which employs AI algorithms for data analysis. Another usecase is a revolutionary
    step towards smart crop health monitoring. A group of researchers19 along with
    local farmers are developing a distributed airborne monitoring system to detect
    possible zones of crop damage or nutrient deficiency at a 492-acre farm in in
    North Carolina, United States. In order to accommodate rapidly-growing food demands
    and increase the quality and quantity of agricultural production, it is necessary
    to improve farming management practices and technological developments in agricultural
    fields. Accordingly, unlike traditional crop management methods that use farmers
    or ground vehicles for assessing crop health status, this collaborative smart
    farming project is using autonomous technology to perform aerial monitoring of
    agricultural fields to save time and money, while preventing damage to crops.
    In this project, a group of drones which monitor the field are working in the
    physical layer, as depicted in Figure 3. Drones communicate with each other through
    network layer, using which they also send collected data and images to land processing
    bases (i.e. the edge layer in our proposed architecture) for initial data cleaning
    and pre-processing. Finally, pre-processed data is sent to the cloud layer for
    storing and knowledge extraction functionalities. SECTION III. Security & Privacy
    Issues The adoption of sensor based technologies and cloud supported smart applications
    in agriculture has unleashed opportunities for adversaries to orchestrate cyber
    attacks. Therefore, it is important to first understand major security and privacy
    issues in smart farming domain before discussing specific cyber attacks. In this
    section, we will elaborate these issues in detail followed by attacks in the following
    section. A. Data Security & Privacy In a smart farm, an enormous amount of complex,
    dynamic and spatial data gets generated from many heterogeneous sensors, devices
    and equipment. Leakage of such information either through unauthorized access
    or by an insider can cause potential threats. For example, leakage of agriculture
    anti-jamming devices information can help an attacker bypass these security measures,
    while leakage of soil, crop, and agriculture purchase information can cause severe
    economic losses to farmers, if such information is used by competitors or hostile
    actors. On a larger scale, aggregating important agricultural information on a
    particular country is also a potential threat. As such data security and privacy
    is a very important requirement and one of the primary objectives to ensure the
    reliable operation in a smart farming ecosystem. Data on the Edge: Smart farms
    leverage Internet of Things (IoT), state-of-the-art communications (e.g., 5G),
    and artificial intelligence. Such systems mostly require fast response times,
    than those of a traditional model in which data is transmitted to a centralized
    data center (e.g., cloud) for processing and results are returned to a user. As
    such, the need of edge cloud is on the rise. Although moving data processing and
    analytics to the edge enhances agility and efficiency, to say the least, it also
    imposes huge security risks due to the increased attack surface primarily because
    of the highly diverse use of IoT devices which are usually not built with security
    in mind. This gives attackers an easy entry point to the network since remote
    access to the edge layer, in most cases, is essential. Additionally, finding the
    IP addresses of edge endpoints become an easy task especially when considering
    websites like Shodan,20 a search engine for all IoT connected devices. Beside
    directly compromising IoT devices or edge endpoints to gain access to the smart
    farm network, an indirect attack to compromise third parties is also a potential
    risk. As an example, smart farms often use third party agronomy analytics to analyze
    the collected data which can be used in many research areas such as plant biology
    and genetics, agriculture economy, supply forecasts, and disease predictions.
    Those parties might be given direct access to smart farm data on the edge for
    real-time analytics. An attacker might phish for such third parties, compromise
    their systems and inject malicious software to redirect the data sent to external
    servers for data theft. Such attacks are very hard to detect, since attackers
    are using legitimate stolen third party credentials. B. Authorization & Trust
    In smart farming applications, connected entities including autonomous tractors,
    flying drones, on field sensors etc. communicate and interact with each other,
    and issue command and control operations to provide automated and efficient experience.
    Such communication can be direct machine to machine or via a cloud or edge assisted
    network which can support Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT21), Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP22) or other IoT communication protocols. In either
    case, it is essential to ensure that the messages are sent from a trusted authorized
    entity, rather from a malicious adversary. This exchange of information, like
    moisture level of soil, information about crop yield, cost of fertilizer, or sensitive
    data about the livestock like health, current location, breeding decision information
    and other farm related private data sent to the cloud or to a third-party application
    must be authorized by the owner of the field or a concerned party. Livestock are
    important part of agriculture, and a big component of a farmer’s income. Sensors
    can be embedded in the cattle [41]–[43] which can monitor their health and can
    be used to remotely inject medicines or enable preventive actions from a doctor.
    Even in case of livestock purchase, buyer can be given temporary access to the
    data of an animal they are interested in, which can help them analyse it before
    purchase. As these animals are kept in monitored environments, remotely controlling
    the temperature or making adverse conditions in barn can affect the yield of animals,
    and can also result in epidemics and widespread disease. Over the air (OTA) updates
    for the equipment’s firmware must be from a trusted party, a bad software patch
    received for a critical agriculture equipment can curtail a farmer from using
    it at the needed time of harvesting and planting. Cross cloud and multi cloud
    trust models [44], [45] are needed when entities associated at different cloud
    providers interact and access data remotely. In case of a mechanic trying to diagnose
    an engine of an autonomous tractor, or a doctor trying to access data of a cattle
    located in a private cloud, trust levels need to be established so as to enable
    such access. Several access control models have been proposed for IoT [46]–[58]
    like systems, however their feasability in dynamic smart farming is still to be
    investigated. Proper authorization is needed for a farmer to issue a command,
    to a smart water sprinkler, or to fetch the latest readings from a soil moisture
    sensor. Farm rivalry can exploit such connectivity to the sensors, and may flood
    a farmer’s field, or make it parched. Usually in farms, labor is hired on a temporary
    basis mostly at the time of harvesting and sowing, therefore, temporary access
    to smart equipment can be delegated to on field workers for non-critical operations.
    It may be the case that a critical operation, like running an autonomous tractor
    on the field, or flying a drone over the field to spray pesticides may need multi
    level authorization. C. Authentication & Secure Communication One of the most
    important aspects of security and privacy in smart farming is authentication of
    connected devices. Devices need to be authenticated first in order to get connected
    to various services on a smart farming system. They are usually low power devices,
    with limited processing power, memory, and storage, so legacy public-key infrastructure
    (PKI) authentication mechanisms cannot be considered as feasible solutions. Alternatively,
    secure lightweight multi-factor authentication protocols which are offered as
    a service [13], [59] are more realistic solutions in a smart farming network environment.
    In fact, an intermediary Certifying Authority (CA) can facilitate the authentication
    of a connecting device [60]. Such authentication mechanisms do not consume devices’
    limited resources for authentication processing, but also unauthorized devices
    will be prevented from connecting and accessing the network in an efficient way
    [61]. Moreover, devices may sometime join or leave different layers of a smart
    farming ecosystem. This entails dynamic authenticated mechanisms that apply authentication
    on demand to ensure that only legitimate devices are allowed to have access to
    different services spanning over different layers. Providing end to end secure
    communication in a smart farming setting requires securing the communication between
    devices in a particular layer and also securing the inter-layer communication
    [62]. While cryptography-based solutions prove their effectiveness in securing
    both intra-layer and inter-layer communications, employing them on constrained
    IoT devices is a big concern. There are, however, limited attempts to apply lightweight
    cryptography solutions to a smart farming ecosystem [14]. Additionally, quantum-based
    cryptography for a secure end to end communication for IoT devices is under active
    investigation [63] as a futuristic solution. However, the feasibility of such
    solutions have not been evaluated in real world scenarios. D. Compliance and Regulations
    Smart farming and precision agriculture raises various legal issues, which remain
    partially unanswered. The following are some of the major issues in this area.
    1) Contracts and Agreements A smart farm involves different parties like the farmers,
    the cloud service providers, the networking infrastructure providers, to name
    a few (See Section II). These different parties need to negotiate and agree on
    various parts of contracts [12], [64]. These contracts include data privacy, security
    and intellectual property protection clauses. Data protection is essential for
    the development of smart farms and is a major part of these contracts. Such contracts
    between interested parties are crucial to protect the value and confidentiality
    of the data as an important asset. Farmers who use smart farming tools also need
    to negotiate in advance finer elements of these contracts. For example, which
    party shall be responsible in case data processing and analysis lead to wrong
    decisions affecting different downstream tasks in the pipeline. Another important
    contractual element example is the decision involving use of self-driving tractors,
    which are subject to the set of obligations applicable to self-driving cars. In
    this scenario, strong compensation and limitation of liability clauses may help
    the farmers. 2) Data Security and Privacy Farmers who deploy smart infrastructure
    fear that their data might be stolen by competitors or be publicly released. Hence,
    data security is crucial and agreements with technology providers should include
    specific clauses. Although most smart farming techniques process non-personal
    data, linking of such information to a particular personally identifiable information
    (PII) poses serious concerns [12], [64]. For example, data of livestock directly
    referring to their owner; crops conditions linked to farmers’ personal details.
    In this case, privacy clauses should be included to prohibit personal data processing
    to a certain degree. Further issues may arise when smart farming equipment, such
    as drones or tractors, have the functionality to monitor their users [12], [64].
    3) Intellectual Property (IP) An important question from a compliance perspective
    is who owns the data collected on a smart farm. This is specially important as
    data privacy laws cannot solve this issue. As per the current regulatory setup,
    data itself cannot be protected, however copyright provisions can be utilized
    to achieve high level of safeguards. Most farmers include IP protection clauses
    [64] in contracts that they create with smart farming technology providers [12].
    4) Regulatory Agriculture and livestock production is a highly regulated industry.
    Various countries across the globe have many laws, regulations, and supervisory
    authorities [65]–[67]. These touch upon specific compliance requirements for producing
    and selling of products. Such compliance can be achieved easier by using smart
    farming technology that help farmers and regulators track, audit, and inspect
    every step of the production pipeline. 5) Cyber Insurance Cyber Insurance allows
    victims to protect themselves from various cyber risks. However, cyber insurance
    policies in agriculture have lagged in the coverage of cyber incidents and events.
    Most of the current available agriculture based cyber insurances are very ambiguous
    and limited in their coverage [64]. SECTION IV. Smart Farming Ecosystem Cyber
    Attacks This section elaborates possible cyber attacks in smart farming ecosystem.
    We have categorized attacks into four different classes as shown in Figure 4.
    We have discussed data specific and network specific attacks orchestrated on smart
    farms including IoT based farming sensors. We have also explored cyber attacks
    from the supply chain side to highlight the vulnerabilities as more and more systems
    get connected to the internet and generating sensitive data. FIGURE 4. Smart farming
    ecosystem cyber attacks. Show All A. Data Attacks 1) Insider Data Leakage Farmers
    fear leakage of confidential data the most among other threats as it can be used
    against them in the commodity market. An insider (like a disgruntled employee)
    can leak such data to intentionally cause harm or sell data for money. For example,
    a former engineer at Allen and Hoshall was able to access the company’s data over
    a period of two years.23 Data this employee accessed included engineering schematic,
    project proposals, and marketing information which had an estimated value of $500,000.
    2) Cloud Data Leakage Smart farming data is very sensitive and can reveal a lot
    of confidential agriculture and economic information about the entire country.
    Cloud data centers are distributed across the world and, in some instances, virtual
    machines might be placed in data centers located in different countries. Data
    might be less secure if it is stored in data centers in other countries. These
    countries could place less strict security requirements on companies. Additionally,
    their governments might also intercept or collect that data stored on servers
    within their own jurisdictions. For these reasons, countries have started adding
    laws for sensitive data localization. For instance, China has placed a new cybersecurity
    law24 into effect in 2017 stating, among other things, that personal data must
    be stored on domestic servers. As such, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon
    started taking steps to transfer control of Chinese data to Chinese firms. 3)
    False Data Injection Attack In this attack, an attacker attempts to change/falsify
    data that contributes to important real-time decisions, with the assumption that
    adversary has the knowledge of the system and its configuration. For example,
    injecting false information about the soil moisture level will result in over
    watering and, in turn, damaging the crops. 4) Misinformation Attack In this attack,
    the aim is to endanger data integrity. An attacker may release false data about
    a smart farm claiming the outbreak of a disease in crops or livestock. Such false
    data reports mimic the form of an actual report released by the targeted smart
    farm. As a result, it will take a lot of time, effort and money to prove that
    the released report is false. B. Networking and Equipment Attacks 1) Radio Frequency
    (FR) Jamming Attack In many cases, smart farming equipment rely on radio frequency
    communication, like cellular or satellite networks. A smart farming equipment
    often use global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to improve efficiency with
    products and techniques such as path planning, auto steering, seeding and spray
    rates. GNSS is achieved by combining GPS with real time kinematics (RTK) technology
    to enhance the precision of real-time position data. Attackers may jam GNSS for
    malicious purpose by deploying many distributed low power jammers to disrupt GNSS
    over wide areas and, in turn, prevent smart farming equipment from functioning
    properly. 2) Malware Injection Attack One of the most prevalent threats to smart
    farming is malware injection attack [68], where an attacker injects a malware
    into a connected smart device. Malware is a very common threat in large scale
    systems since, in most cases, it acts and propagates through the system automatically,
    hence making it a very attractive target to attackers. Precision agriculture is
    being adopted widely, meaning that more farms are connected to the internet. Typically,
    most of these farm deployments use similar software components (e.g., usage of
    LoRa25 and ZigBee26). As a result, a malware that infects a particular smart farm
    will most likely infect other farms with similar deployments. The damage caused
    by malware comes in many shapes and types. Malware can steal information about
    the consumption of agricultural materials, purchase information of fruits, vegetables
    and livestock, data about agricultural machinery etc. It can also recruit smart
    devices as part of a botnet which will be used for committing malicious acts controlled
    by an attacker. Further, malware can hinder the functions of physical smart equipment
    which, in turn, can have a devastating effect on a particular crop harvest or
    farm area. 3) Denial of Service Attack IoT devices used in smart farming environments
    can always be used to launch large scale denial of service (DoS) attacks [69]
    similar to what happened in 2016 using Mirai botnet [70]. In that occasion, an
    army of dummy CCTVs was exploited to launch one of the biggest DoS attacks that
    happened recently. There are usually a large number of inter-connected nodes and
    groups in a farm, and thus, similar type of attacks are possible in context of
    smart farming. These attacks not only can disrupt normal functions of different
    modules in an individual farm but also can be leveraged to interrupt legitimate
    cyber services in other domains. 4) Botnet With IoT everything is capable of getting
    connected to the internet. In smart farming ecosystem, there are many IoT related
    devices at each architectural layer. These devices are prone to attacks and can
    then be controlled by a central malicious system. This forms a so called ‘Botnet
    of Things’ [71]. A zombie army of infected farm IoT devices [72] can easily be
    used to infect many other networks through different mediums and hence a smart
    farm may turn out to be an internet of vulnerabilities for cyber criminals. Smart
    farm devices are not built with security as a concern and even if they do, users
    usually neglect the basic steps of setting adequate cybersecurity defense mechanisms.
    5) Side Channel Attack Attacks which have their roots in gaining information from
    how a system is implemented rather than what weakness exists in the system implementation
    are called side channel attacks. Smart farming is one of the IoT use case and
    hence it inherits some common IoT vulnerabilities including side channel attacks
    [73]. In such attacks, there are different channels which can be exploited by
    attackers. In timing channel attacks, for example, computation time along with
    cache miss and cache hit timing patterns are among those attacks vectors which
    can be exploited by adversaries. Hardware glitching in forms of voltage fluctuations
    and variances in system clock period during execution tasks are other possible
    attack channels. Other channels for launching a successful attack are power consumption
    patterns, possible electromagnetic leaks or even sound and acoustic channels.
    C. Supply Chain Attacks The entire agriculture ecosystem and the notion of ‘farm
    to plate’ involves several entities which work in tandem to provide quality food
    to the end consumer in a just-in time environment. This supply chain system [74]
    starts from the farm, which produces raw material that, in turn, is stored and
    processed by the food industry. The processed food is packed and sent to distribution
    retailer from where the end customer purchases processed goods. With IoT technology
    at each stage of the supply chain, it introduces potential cybersecurity threats
    since a security breach in just-in-time distribution system could also have a
    serious cascading effects on the entire supply chain. The massive scale of attacks
    like WannaCry27 ransomware, and the recent spate of ransomwares in cities28 across
    the US, suggest that even a breach or data freeze at a single inter-dependent
    entity will be enough to disrupt the whole chain and possibly the economy of a
    country. An attack on the agriculture equipment and fertilizer provider companies
    could potentially disable critical connected machinery needed at a prime time.
    It could manipulate the amount of nutrients in the fertilizers [64] which could
    seriously destroy the crops rather than nourishing them. The smart devices can
    be infected by malware which are controlled and commanded remotely. In such a
    scenario, large scale attacks can be orchestrated on all the smart farms utilizing
    those compromised machinery resulting in massive disruption in the sector. Needless
    to say that the suppliers of such machinery might loose trust and confidence of
    their customers. Such smart machinery needs dynamic calibration to determine the
    distance at which seeds need to be planted or the amount of fertilizers to be
    sprayed based on historical crop data. This calibration related information is
    uploaded in the machine software over-the-air (OTA), which suggests that deliberate
    uploading of false information to the machine software can have larger scale impact.
    US Foods29 has more than 250,000 customers which purchase supplies, will be affected
    badly if US Foods IT infrastructure is hit by a ransomware or a cyber attack disrupting
    its computer assisted facility and impacting critical processes. Temperature and
    conditions under which the produce is transferred is an important factor to maintain
    the freshness of the product. Smart monitors ensure that products are processed
    and packed at appropriate temperatures. Adversaries can manipulate these sensor
    readings or issue a command to change the temperature that could result in inappropriate
    temperature conditions for produce, which can impact the end consumers as well
    as the entire supply chain. These attacks are not limited to direct stakeholders,
    but for example, contaminated water from a compromised water treatment facility
    used in irrigation can destroy the whole crop field. Even attacks on smart grid
    due to sudden surge in demand and grid overloading can result in blackout which
    in-turn can spoil the stored produce in large storage houses, inducing huge losses
    to the supplier. Blockchain30 based solutions have been proposed to ensure the
    provenance of the food products in the chain, which offers transparency and assure
    quality of the food. However, the entire cost to use this system will not be clear
    unless widely adopted [75]. Smart farming goes beyond agriculture where livestock
    sector is also considered an important part. An attack on this sector can also
    have massive disruptions, where a malicious actor can publish false data about
    a disease outbreaks or unapproved genetic modifications of crops. Similarly, sensors
    and smart devices in the buildings where these livestock are kept can be attacked
    or altered to change the temperature, which can put to harm the entire livestock
    on the farm. Also, for livestock feed products, if an IT system monitoring the
    ingredients of the feed is compromised, it can potentially lead to wide-spread
    contamination in livestock which can easily reach humans as well. D. Other Relevant
    Attacks 1) Compliance and Regulation Food production and farming are a highly
    regulated industry with different countries having multiple national agencies
    monitoring food production. In the United States, Environment Protection Agency
    [65] and the Department of Agriculture [66] enforce various regulations and industry
    standards. In the European Union, Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
    [67] undertakes this responsibility with similar authorities in other countries.
    These federal authorities issue compliance directives to ensure quality food production.
    With the advent of smart farming technology these agencies are relying more and
    more on data produced by farm based sensors. An adversary attacking a smart farm
    can specifically inject false data that will then impact various compliance certification
    processes. This certification process if invalidated, can impact a nation’s food
    supply, affect crop price, etc. The complex smart farming ecosystem, creates a
    broad attack surface that needs to be protected to ensure data integrity. 2) Cyber
    Terrorism The increased use of digital interconnected system in agriculture sector
    brings new opportunities for terrorists to attack places that previously were
    too remote or difficult to strike. Cyber terrorism is a relatively low-cost venture
    with high payoff potential, making the risks of agro-terrorism too large to ignore.
    Therefore, it is important to find solutions that guarantee trust and transparency
    within smart farming concept, as well as protect critical resources. 3) Cloud
    Computing Attacks Cloud is a very diverse, decentralized, heterogeneous and powerful
    ecosystem. The enormous amount of distributed resources make the cloud a hard
    target. However, with the introduction of new cloud concepts (e.g., on-demand
    services, auto-scaling, and self provisioning), attackers have used such resources
    in their favor and, in turn, cloud has become one of the most desirable targets
    to attacker. For example, with the introduction of auto-scaling in cloud, a large
    part of the virtual machines hosted on cloud are similarly configured. If one
    of the virtual machines is vulnerable, it is highly likely that all auto-scaled
    virtual machines are vulnerable as well. As such, a malware that infected one
    virtual machine can propagate to other virtual machines quickly. The infected
    machines can be employed as a part of global botnets which, consequently, can
    be used to launch a large scale distribute DoS (DDoS) attacks enough to hinder
    the functionality of cloud. For example, in 2018, a large scale DDoS attack was
    launched on github resulting in a record-breaking sudden traffic increase to 1.35
    terabits per second. Inevitably, DDoS attacks are becoming more frequent, more
    powerful and more sophisticated. A large scale DDoS attack with an overwhelming
    number of requests, packets or messages can deny services to smart farms, thereby
    paralyzing the brain of smart farms. Further, DDoS attacks might not be specifically
    targeting smart farms’ virtual machines. Even though, an attack might be directed
    at a different target, if virtual machines used by smart farms are on the save
    physical server, it will naturally block off other’s traffic as well. SECTION
    V. Existing Research Table 1 summarizes state-of-the-art research, challenges
    and contributions with respect to security and privacy issues in smart farming.
    We have categorized the literature into different subsections based on the focus
    areas they address. TABLE 1 Projects and Research Addressing Cybersecurity in
    Smart Farming A. Cyber Attacks, Threats and Proposed Solutions Researchers and
    federal agencies have started gauging the impact cyber-attacks as more and more
    farmers and communities are adopting technologies in the farms. The U.S. Department
    for Homeland Security released a report [12] which emphasizes the importance of
    precision agriculture (PA) and associated cybersecurity threat and potential vulnerabilities.
    The report highlights the confidentiality, integrity, and availability model of
    information security in farming. It defines different technologies involved in
    PA including in-farm devices, location and remote sensing technologies, machine
    learning, etc. It briefly discusses the impacted groups by the misuse of technologies
    in farming including farmers, livestock producers, and also industries that support
    or rely on agriculture. This report also discusses hypothetical threat scenarios
    on real life examples. Another promising work [76] highlights the vulnerabilities
    and risks due to introduction of technologies in the field of precision agriculture.
    This thesis work illustrates data collection and related empirical study, however
    falls short of security solutions in the domain. The work from Jahn [64] discuss
    implications of using smart devices in the agriculture sector. The authors make
    strong argument about how the lack of a cyber insurance framework is going to
    have a big impact on various agribusinesses. They also highlight the fact that
    a regulatory response is needed to protect the interests of farmers who adopt
    the use of smart devices. Barreto and Amaral [77] use empirical methodology based
    on the analysis of information and experiences collected in the Internet Security
    Alliance,31 the European Cyber Security Organization32 and the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology33 to highlight security challenges in smart farming.
    Some major threats discussed include security and privacy issues, social engineering,
    denial of service, cyber-espionage agroterrorism, ransomware etc. The research
    also highlights a security framework to enable farmers to better understand security
    implications. However, the paper is unable to discuss open research issues, and
    challenges to secure the environment without evidence of how the discussed attacks
    are orchestrated in the domain. Peer to Peer (P2P) is a network paradigm which
    has use cases in smart farming communication. The device authentication methods
    in this type of communication, however, rely heavily on public key infrastructure.
    Although the system is trustworthy, it puts unnecessary computation load on resource
    constrained smart farm IoT devices participating in a secure P2P communication.
    Accordingly, authors in [78] proposed a lightweight device authentication solution
    in which session keys and public keys are combined to expedite the encryption/decryption
    tasks. It results in a fast and light-weight authentication solution which is
    a good fit for smart farming communication purposes. Additionally, West [79] introduced
    a framework to understand vulnerabilities in emerging technologies and the use
    of such technologies in a smart-farming-specific environment. The framework goal
    is to quantify the degree to which the use of smart farming new technologies are
    vulnerable to cyber-attacks. It uses the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS)
    for the threat prediction model assessment. The work shows the trade-offs between
    technology maturity and adaptation in the smart farming environment which can
    lead to system compromise. The approach in the paper uses three parameters: basic
    parameters, temporal parameters and environmental parameters for constructing
    a CVSS score. Basic parameters indicate the intrinsic and severity of a vulnerability,
    whereas temporal parameters indicate how a vulnerability might change and affect
    the system over time due to technical changes. Environmental parameters reflect
    the specifications of a vulnerability present in a smart-farming-specific environment.
    Although CVSS score has become a standard in the industry for understanding the
    severity of vulnerabilities and prioritizing their patches, it has some shortcomings.
    Smart farming is a diverse environment with many connected devices and systems.
    CVSS score deals with individual vulnerabilities and fails to accurately capture
    impact of connections within the entire system. B. Blockchain Related Research
    Recently, the usefulness of blockchain in domains other than cryptocurrency and
    financial transactions has been acknowledged [93]–[95]. Agriculture and food supply
    chain is one of the domains in which blockchain technology has shown its capabilities.
    Accordingly, the authors in [81] study overall implications, challenges and potential
    of existing blockchain-based projects in the field. Besides, it critically reviews
    maturity of such projects and elaborates on possible barriers and challenges,
    which hinder acceptability of such projects among farmers and existing cyber farming
    systems. Lin et al. [80] also focused on the use of blockchain technology for
    food safety. Authors created a system that tracks and monitors food production
    cycle, including the processes of raw materials, cultivation/breeding, processing,
    transporting, warehousing, and selling. The system also uses various IoT based
    sensors to replace manual recording and verification with sensor based verification.
    Other works [82], [84], [96] focused on providing case studies of using blockchain
    and smart contracts in smart farming. Awan et al. [82] proposed a framework based
    on IoT and blockchain technology for agriculture product tracking life cycle.
    They used smart contracts to eliminate the involvement of middlemen or third-party
    intermediaries and as such increase credibility and trust. The authors implemented
    a use case based on their proposed framework which included 120 IoT nodes and
    20 blockchain producers. Further, they validated their system based on it’s throughput
    considering different block sizes. However, this work has several drawbacks. Very
    few related works are included and comparison to other works in the literature
    is lacking. Additionally, the authors didn’t include much details about the nature
    of workload used in their experiments and they failed to add a baseline benchmark
    for the validation results for a fair comparison. Patil et al. [84] proposed a
    light-weight security framework for smart greenhouse farms based on blockchain.
    Every IoT node can elect cluster head leader which helps preventing a single point
    of failure in case an attacker targets the leader node. Additionally, the authors
    provided discussion of the security threats on their proposed framework following
    the traditional confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) triad model
    as well as their corresponding attacks. Although, this work is interesting, the
    framework is conceptual with no implementation or experiments. Further, the paper
    didn’t include related work nor a comparison to other proposed frameworks. Besides
    proposing blockchain-based frameworks and implementations [97], real world use
    cases of blockchain in smart farming are discussed in the blockchain research
    institute article [83]. In this work, authors explore applications of blockchain
    beyond the typical financial use cases in agriculture. Accordingly, they focused
    on three classes of applications: food safety, sustainable agriculture and the
    local economy and agriculture finance. The authors accompanied each class of applications
    with real world use cases. However, these use cases are discussed on a very high
    level aspect with no implementation details or results. C. AI and Machine Learning
    Assisted Work The advent of new age technologies such as artificial intelligence
    (AI) and machine learning (ML) not only facilitate the adaptation of advanced
    analytics in smart farming, but also create an ecosystem for improving the cybersecurity
    of services. Fusion of these technologies enable farmers to achieve higher average
    yield and better price control over their products in highly competitive markets.
    Design and implementation of a low cost IoT based security monitoring system have
    been proposed by Shabadi and Biradar [85]. The system focuses on physical layer
    of smart farming where it collects data from sensors. This data is sent to a controller
    where data is analyzed to make decisions like activating the actuators for water
    sprinkler in the farms. The proposed work is focused more on implementing the
    basic functionalities of smart farming than addressing security and privacy issues.
    It is very limited to simple threshold based decisions, like, if the soil temperature
    is above a certain threshold, then activate water sprinkler. Real time security
    monitoring for a remote farm is another current application of ML in smart farming.
    In scenarios where real time monitoring and notifications are paramount to farm
    and cybersecurity, the image(s) detected through a surveillance system can be
    processed by open-source computer vision programming supported by AI. For example,
    Abuan et al. [86] proposed a neural based face recognition system which is able
    to be invariant to changes in illumination for background and illumination conditions
    through a neural network training. The agricultural and farming industries have
    been widely influenced by the disruption of the IoT. However, the impact of the
    IoT is limited in countries with less penetration of mobile internet. The boom
    of low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) in the last decade, with technologies
    such as LoRa or NB-IoT, has mitigated this by providing a relatively cheap infrastructure
    that enables low-power and long-range transmissions. Nonetheless, the benefits
    that LPWAN technologies have the disadvantage of low-bandwidth transmissions.
    Therefore, the integration of edge and fog computing, moving data analytics and
    compression near end devices, is key in order to extend functionality. By integrating
    AI at the local network layer, referred as edge AI, authors in [87] proposed a
    system architecture and implementation that expands the possibilities of smart
    agriculture and farming applications with edge and fog computing using LPWAN technology
    for large area coverage. In another research work [88], Support Vector Machines
    (SVM) along with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used to create an integration
    platform for big data analysis for smart farming. Such a platform not only expedites
    processing huge amounts of data collected from farms and livestocks, but also
    gives smart farming stakeholders the ability to detect and respond against possible
    cyber attacks more efficiently. D. Other Relevant Literature Chi et al. [89] present
    a framework for cybersecurity approaches in precision agriculture and discussed
    challenges of using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in digital virtual farms. They
    also present a framework for secure data capture. Security challenges in agrifood
    sector has been extensively discussed in [90]. The report provides an overview
    of emerging technologies in smart farming. Most smart farms are data-driven with
    respect to automating agriculture processes, decision making, and predictions.
    It also raises important questions of how important is data security? How risk
    assessment is done considering the entire supply chain? Who should take responsibility
    and who should be involved? The report serves to raise awareness addressing the
    importance of cybersecurity in agrifood sector. Authors in [98] provide an overview
    of cross-section of cybersecurity in food and agriculture sectors. They also discuss
    cyber-terrorism, policies, and plans. Spaulding and Wolf [99] detail the needs
    for educating farmers about various cybersecurity threats. Authors in [100] show
    the impact of cyber attacks on smart farming infrastructure via simulations using
    NETA with OMNET++ framework. Huning et al. [101] created a system to enable privacy
    preserving crowd sourcing techniques to estimate different smart farming parameters.
    Cybersecurity perception is also changing among farmers and agribusiness owners.
    Geil et al. [91] conducted an assessment of cybersecurity practices in the United
    States agriculture industry. Insights from their work reflect that over half of
    the respondents have been victims of a computer security incident, demonstrating
    that even individuals working in agriculture can be impacted by cybersecurity
    incidents. Cyberbiosecurity [92] is a multidisciplinary domain consists of cybersecurity,
    bio-security, and cyber-physical security. It discusses how current and emerging
    information technologies affect the cybersecurity of large portion of U.S. economy
    which is based on food and agriculture (i.e. Bio-economy). As Peccoud et al. [102]
    discuss, food and agricultural sectors are immensely diverse and require advanced
    technologies and efficiencies that rely on computer technologies, big data, cloud-based
    data storage, and internet accessibility, at the same time are vulnerable to cybersecurity
    incidents. Based on our literature review, it can be emphasised that, there is
    a dearth of security related research done in smart farming domain. There are
    numerous unanswered important security questions and open research challenges
    as discussed in the following section. SECTION VI. Open Challenges and Research
    Areas This section discusses open research challenges for improving security and
    privacy in smart farming ecosystem, as well illustrated in Figure 5. These open
    problems have been divided into four subsections as follows. FIGURE 5. Open research
    challenges and future directions for cybersecurity in smart farming. Show All
    A. Access Control, Trust & Privacy Perspective The multi-layered architecture
    discussed in section II recognizes possibilities of cyber threat challenges, which
    needs to be addressed by extending and adapting current access control foundational
    research, as well as developing sophisticated access control solutions to assist
    dynamic and agile environments in cyber-physical systems like smart farms. In-farm
    and cross farm operations need authorized interaction among sensors and labor/farmers
    working at multiple farms operating different sets of smart devices. What kind
    of operations they can do must be checked, which may require single level or multiple
    level access control depending on the risk factor associated with the operation?
    For example, consider sowing the field with autonomous tractor as compared to
    turning ON an irrigation system during the rainy season. Delegation and revocation
    of access rights to operate on a farm must be automatically performed based on
    the contract agreement, for example, in case temporary labor hired during harvesting
    season. Such access control requirements need further investigation to be adopted
    in such dynamic environment. The notion of trust can also be developed where labor
    who has worked earlier or an equipment borrowed from a ‘known’ old friend may
    have higher trust level as compared to machine and manpower hired from co-operative
    market. Self-configurable AI assisted smart access control policies need to be
    developed in a sharing-dominated CPS domain like smart farming. Cyber physical
    systems introduce the notion of virtual objects (which can be created in cloud
    or edge environment) corresponding to real physical sensors. An important challenge
    here is the location of cyber entities created as a part of connection with cloud
    or edge environments, for example, AWS device shadows34 or Microsoft Azure device
    twins.35 Research needs to determine: a) how cyber entity will move from one cloud
    (or edge) to another if the corresponding device is borrowed from one farmer to
    another? b) how the control of virtual entities will be delegated to the lending
    farmer, whether both the farmers need to use same application? c) how the applications
    will allow to delegate access for machine operation? d) Can the virtual objects
    or equipment across farms communicate with each other, whether at the physical
    level or using the virtual entities? If it is the virtual entity across different
    accounts in the same cloud provider, how such interaction will take place? In
    case it is across different cloud providers, how cross cloud and federated cloud
    environments will ensure such trust levels? Suppose in case a farmer has borrowed
    an equipment from a friend farmer, will the original owner be able to have access
    to it, or the access will be completely revoked? Is it possible to control a device
    through different remote clouds? All are relevant questions in smart farming domain.
    Further, how to establish trust mechanisms among different cloud service providers
    which the farmer is using for services and alerts? Manufacturer of the device
    may hold digital twin [103] and the cloud used by farmers will get data from on-field
    sensor and the cloud provider via pre-defined and signed negotiations. Such negotiations
    can also define what kind of data will be shared with required permissions of
    the owner farmer. Another important question is, how to establish trust between
    physical sensor objects? One approach is sensors at the same farm trust each other
    more for the shared information as compared to sensors across different farms.
    IoT and CPS specific cross cloud access controls and related security models are
    still in infancy stage and need more attention. Livestock and animals also have
    sensors embedded, which require appropriate authorized access. However, current
    literature does not provide strong access control mechanisms that can restrict
    such operations and secure critical data sharing from cattle and livestock at
    the farm. These wearable and health monitoring devices are attached to livestock
    and collect sensitive data, which can be used by adversaries to control the animal
    or even effect the sale/purchase of a cattle, for example, having the information
    about which cow is having low milk production. Efficient access controls [104]–[106]
    are needed to safeguard such sensitive data in cloud, which needs more research
    considering the spate of breaches heard every now and then. Usually in case of
    wearable IoT devices, a human which has the device controls what kind of data
    he/she wants to be shared. However, it is not in case of livestock which has a
    master (like the owner of the farm or caretaker) to decide control. Also, as a
    cattle is sold/purchased and moves from one owner to another, relevant data sharing
    security policies need to be specified and will require automatically configured
    information sharing. Studies [107], [108] have shown vulnerabilities in human
    used fitness devices, however, such studies and research are still an open challenge
    in case of livestock devices. Since data is collected from smart devices spread
    across farms, different applications require to access to this data. Consequentially,
    it is important to limit the sharing of data across applications and across nearby
    friend farmers, who may also get some value or receive alerts for their farms.
    How and when to share such information requires adaptive security policies to
    control and supervise data transferred by sensors to the cloud platform. Further,
    if data is sharing across multi cloud systems, cross cloud trust also needs to
    be addressed. Appropriate attribute based fine grained access controls [109],
    [110] and privacy preserving schemes need to be deployed to ensure confidentiality
    of the data. Evidently, farmers must decide the level and type of data sharing
    needed to ensure the privacy of critical information. B. Data Perspective The
    most noticeable feature of smart farming is its communication ability between
    the smart devices, resulting in an unprecedented amount of generated data [7],
    [111]. This provides many challenges as discussed in section III and open doors
    for several research opportunities. Machine learning is an attractive solution
    for processing big data, and implementing effective security solutions. Insider
    data leakage detection has always been a daunting task as users already have legitimate
    access to the system, making it hard to detect and predict such attacks. Several
    research works have been conducted on insider data leakage [22], [112], [113];
    however, none has been targeting smart farming settings. Further investigation
    is needed to understand the possibility of adopting insider data leakage defense
    mechanisms into smart farming and whether unique characteristics of smart farming
    can help to improve these mechanisms. Smart farms are highly connected systems,
    which allow malware to easily propagate through the network infecting all interconnected
    devices. An interesting question is how to detect malware in smart farming IoT
    environment, especially considering all heterogeneous devices in place. For instance,
    a malware detection technique that works against a malware that infects smart
    farming equipment might not work against malware that infects edge or cloud systems
    since the malware’s end goal is different. Many AI assisted malware detection
    techniques [114]–[120] are proposed and used in practice; however, there are no
    smart-farming-specific malware detection techniques that consider the context
    and environment in which smart farms reside. Smart farms generate diverse and
    vast amount of unstructured data. It is almost impossible for one party to analyze
    and make use of the entire datasets. For this reason, threat information sharing
    is a viable approach for data security. For instance, each smart farm can employ
    a malware detection technique; however, it is guaranteed that none of these employed
    techniques is comprehensive enough to catch all types of malware. Information
    sharing between smart farms can prove very useful. It can be used as an asset
    to share threat information about attack patterns or malware that was detected
    by collaborating smart farms. In a similar case, if a deployed detection technique
    in a farm detected supplied water with high toxin content, it is relevant to share
    that information with nearby farms who may also be impacted by similar issue.
    This can save analysis cost and money for every participating smart farm as it
    prevents doing work that someone else already did before. What kind of data, meta-data
    or analysis can be shared remains an open question and what kind of threat information
    sharing process can be used remain an open question for resource constrained farmers.
    Smart farming is an emerging field, so it is highly likely to encounter zero-day
    attacks which have not been detected before. Anomaly detection [121]–[125] is
    a very appealing solution against such attacks. Anomaly detection techniques look
    for any abnormal behavior that deviates from the pre-established database of normal
    behavior. These normal behaviour profiles are constructed based on collection
    of historical observations and patterns. Building smart farms behavior profiles
    is a challenging task since their behaviors are so dynamic in nature. External
    factors are a major reason for this dynamism. For example, less irrigation is
    needed during a rainy weather than dry weather which will cause a different behavior
    for irrigation systems. Can weather forecast information be used as an indication
    of such change of behavior? What kind of data contribute to building smart farms
    behavior profiles? Do some data fields weigh more than others? These are all open
    research questions that need to be investigated. Detection mechanisms are used
    to detect faulty and compromised sensors by monitoring the data sent for any tampered
    or abnormal values. Employing a simple threshold based mechanism can easily be
    bypassed by an attacker, so in most cases, more sophisticated machine learning
    based mechanisms need to be deployed. However, smart attackers can still bypass
    these models by (1) exploiting the sensors and a little tweaking of data sent
    by these sensors just to lead the machine learning model in place to misclassify/mispredict
    the outcome (such attack is called adversarial machine learning attack), and (2)
    poisoning the model during training phase by injecting bad data into the model’s
    training database, and in turn get it to learn something it shouldn’t. Some research
    addressed mitigation against adversarial attacks; however, it is not clear whether
    these technologies can be adopted to smart farming domain which is very dominant
    on changing environment conditions. Another open research challenge is to create
    various artificial intelligence systems that collect and parse Cyber Threat Intelligence
    (CTI36) about smart devices, software, cloud systems etc. used in the smart farming
    ecosystem. These systems have been developed to collect CTI in other areas [126]–[129]
    and need to be extended to ensure coverage of various smart farming devices, equipment
    and software. C. Network Perspective Cybersecurity threats to smart farming and
    its devices include a diverse range of security risks due to certain characteristics
    of the underlying networking and communication technologies which are used in
    the domain. First, both virtual and physical communication environments get connected.
    Many IoT devices in a smart farm system are capable of functioning on the data
    they receive from their respective environments which shortens the distance between
    virtual and physical systems. While convenient for the users, it allows cyber
    threats to convert to physical consequences more quickly, thereby having a bigger
    impact. Second, devices and layers involved in a smart farm system create a complex
    communication environment. Hyper connected farming environments exist due to the
    growing availability and diversity of IoT devices. ‘Complex’ in this context means
    that large number of devices are working in a single smart farm environment such
    that dynamic interactions between them are possible. This complexity expands the
    capabilities of an environment, but at the cost of a wider attack surface. Smart
    farming like other emerging technologies is embracing new networking paradigms
    to tackle today’s sophisticated attacks. Software defined network (SDN) [130]–[132]
    is one such promising networking revolution. Through decoupling control plane
    from data plane and giving credit to network programmable, it offers interesting
    technical capabilities to network providers. This causes an intense adaption of
    SDN in almost every fields of networking, from data center networks to WANs, wireless,
    5G and recently IoT. Using SDN in smart farm networking is attracting to both
    academia and industry for certain reasons. SDN supports both physical and virtual
    networking scenarios very well. It also offers a reliable way of practicing networking
    in highly diverse and naturally heterogeneous smart farms networking environment.
    Moreover, using SDN, smart farms are able to form a holistic view of all the connected
    devices along with how they interact in a near real time manner. Such a holistic
    view not only improves agility, scalability, and manageability of smart farm networking
    but also empowers a large smart farm network to enforce robust security counter
    measure against possible sophisticated cyber attacks. It is important to research
    further the adaptability of SDN and other 5G related next generation communication
    technologies in smart farming and precision agriculture domain. SDN can enable
    smart farms to get the most benefit out of complex machine learning and AI algorithms
    to automate network management of large number of sensors, wireless and wired
    networks used in a smart farming ecosystem. It also facilitates implementing advanced,
    cross-layer network security solutions which are very time and resource consuming,
    if not impossible, otherwise. Finally, SDN expedites edge networking and hence
    cloud-based security-as-a-service delivery model becomes a more approachable solution
    in large smart farming deployments. D. Compliance and Supply Chain Perspective
    With the ubiquitous use of sensors, automated drones, blockchain, artificial intelligence
    integration, different agricultural businesses are falling back on compliance,
    regulation and cyber insurance to protect themselves [64]. With the development
    of targeted malware and other cyber threats, the entire food supply chain is at
    risk [12], [64]. A hostile actor specifically interested in disrupting the supply
    chain can target various organizations and companies that supply raw material
    to farms or process food for the end user. A potential solution to this problem
    is to develop industry standards that enable trust between various raw material
    suppliers and downstream food processors [64]. The development of these standards
    enforced by national governments through regulation, has been slow. One example
    of such a shortcoming, is the existence of a few cybersecurity standards for the
    many smart devices used in the food supply chain. Various legislation are being
    introduced to set ‘minimal cybersecurity operational standards for internet connected
    devices’. In specific cases where various governments do not wish to regulate
    these interactions, it is up to various agriculture businesses to protect themselves
    by asking their supply chain to ‘self-regulate’ cybersecurity best practices [64].
    Such developments can be pushed through market demands, competitive pressure,
    etc. The food supply chain also lacks robust cyber insurance policies. With the
    constant development of smart applications, AI, smart farming equipment, etc.
    cyber insurance providers are unable to predict and quantify various cyber risks
    involved in these systems. Specific research needs to be done so as to develop
    standard legal jargon and metrics to quantify cyber risk in smart farming. These
    will help create robust cyber insurance markets for precision agriculture. Various
    systems [133]–[136] also need to be built to make it easier for the end users
    to understand and parse these complex legal documents, cyber insurance policies,
    agreements, contracts, etc. Research on these open challenges will help wide adoption
    of precision agriculture technologies. SECTION VII. Conclusion The proliferation
    of smart devices with communication and sensing capabilities have unleashed plethora
    of user services, and at the same time made tasks more convenient and efficient
    for humans. However, wide adoption of such internet connected devices and data
    driven applications across various domains have raised security and privacy issues,
    making these systems vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper discusses such cybersecurity
    challenges in smart farming and elaborates open research questions. The paper
    first outlines a multi-layer smart farming architecture illustrating different
    entities pertinent to real time use-cases supported by edge and cloud environments.
    Based on the architecture, the paper outlines security and privacy issues and
    highlights different attacks scenarios in smart farms as well as scenarios affecting
    the entire food supply chain. Thereafter, this article surveys the state-of-the-art
    research and acknowledges important works related to cybersecurity in the domain.
    Finally, the paper illustrates several open challenges and research problems pertinent
    to security and privacy aspects in precision agriculture. We envision this paper
    will simulate research to solve platitude of security and data privacy issues
    in fast growing and economically important smart farming sector. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    \ The agriculture sector is the backbone of Pakistan’s economy, reﬂecting 26%\
    \ of its GPD and\n43% of the entire labor force. Smart and precise agriculture\
    \ is the key to producing the best crop yield.\nMoreover, emerging technologies\
    \ are reducing energy consumption and cost-effectiveness for saving\nagricultural\
    \ resources in control and monitoring systems, especially for those areas lacking\
    \ these\nresources. Agricultural productivity is thwarted in many areas of Pakistan\
    \ due to farmers’ illiteracy,\nlack of a smart system for remote access to farmland,\
    \ and an absence of proactive decision-making\nin all phases of the crop cycle\
    \ available in their native language. This study proposes an internet of\nagricultural\
    \ things (IoAT) based smart system armed with a set of economical, accessible\
    \ devices and\nsensors to capture real-time parameters of farms such as soil moisture\
    \ level, temperature, soil pH level,\nlight intensity, and humidity on frequent\
    \ intervals of time. The system analyzes the environmental\nparameters of speciﬁc\
    \ farms and enables the farmers to understand soil and environmental factors,\n\
    facilitating farmers in terms of soil fertility analysis, suitable crop cultivation,\
    \ automated irrigation and\nguidelines, harvest schedule, pest and weed control,\
    \ crop disease awareness, and fertilizer guidance.\nThe system is integrated with\
    \ an android application ‘Kistan Pakistan’ (prototype) designed in\nbilingual,\
    \ i.e., ‘Urdu’ and ‘English’. The mobile application is equipped with visual components,\n\
    audio, voice, and iconic and textual menus to be used by diverse literary levels\
    \ of farmers.\nKeywords: smart farming; precision agriculture; IoT; sensor network;\
    \ semi-literate farmers; interactive\ninterface; User Interface (UI); Android\
    \ apps\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture is considered the base for human living because\
    \ it is the primary food source\nand plays a crucial role in the global economy.\
    \ Pakistan is 79.6 million km2 and is home to a\npopulation of 192 million. The\
    \ contribution of the agricultural sector to gross domestic product\n(GDP) in\
    \ Pakistan gradually decreased to 19.3% in the year 2020–2021 from 22.04% previously\n\
    recorded in 2019 and generating employment opportunities for 38.5% of Pakistan’s\
    \ labor\nforce and valuable foreign exchange for the country [1–3]. It supports\
    \ the manufacturing and\nservices sectors of the economy by providing backward-forward\
    \ linkages in inputs-outputs\nmarkets and the most significant consumer of household\
    \ durables. Therefore, our agriculture\nsector can be considered an economic activity\
    \ in the country [4]. Farmers are facing issues in\nthe agriculture sector, so\
    \ it’s significant to research, develop of latest mechanisms, and adopt\nnew practices\
    \ to enhance production. Pressure on the agricultural system will increase with\n\
    the continuing expansion of the human population.\nMany areas of Pakistan are\
    \ trailing in agricultural productivity due to a lack of farmers’\nawareness,\
    \ timely access to crucial information, and proactive decision-making [5,6]. It\
    \ is\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 1277. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12081277\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 1277\n2 of 23\n\
    vital for human development in these underdeveloped areas to utilize information\
    \ and\ncommunication technologies (ICTs), artiﬁcial intelligence techniques, machine\
    \ learning\n(ML), and deep learning (DL) to make such information more readily\
    \ accessible to farmers,\nsigniﬁcantly increasing crop production [7–13]. Climate\
    \ change and shortage of agricultural\nresources are also signiﬁcant concerns\
    \ for the downfall of agricultural performance resulting\nin food insecurity [14–17].\
    \ This lets farmers hamper soil with intensiﬁed pesticides, which\naffect agricultural\
    \ practices in a harmful manner. Finally, ﬁelds remain barren [18–22].\nThese\
    \ are reasons for crop failure, lower production due to diseases, unpredictable\
    \ climate\nchange, and loss of soil fertility [23,24].\nIn this scenario, the\
    \ traditional agriculture trends are insufﬁcient to increase agricul-\ntural growth.\
    \ Agriculture is also out of the reach of less conventional technologies. In\n\
    this context, digital agriculture, automation, and precision farming, now termed\
    \ smart\nfarming, have arisen as new scientiﬁc ﬁelds that use intense techniques\
    \ to drive agricultural\nproductivity while minimizing its environmental impact\
    \ [25–27]. Data generated by smart\nfarming operations is provided by various\
    \ sensors that enable a better understanding of\nthe operational environment (interaction\
    \ of dynamic conditions of the crop, soil, weather,\nand environmental factors)\
    \ and the operation itself, leading to more accurate and timely\ndecision-making\
    \ [28,29]. Variability in climate and labor shortage is increasing continu-\n\
    ously, providing better insights for agricultural machinery automation. Remote\
    \ monitoring\ntechnologies facilitate farmers to access every inch of the farmlands\
    \ by creating virtual\nfences to monitor, detect and protect crops in real-time\
    \ [30–32]. IoT-based technologies\nallow farmers, among other things, to gather\
    \ data on plants’ environmental conditions like\nclimate change, soil fertility\
    \ level, humidity, temperature, and light intensity to monitor\nﬁelds and farms\
    \ remotely. These technologies assist farmers in having know-how and\nstatus of\
    \ crops anywhere and anytime [33–36].\nIn Pakistan, most farmers have android\
    \ phones [37–41] but are regrettably under-\nutilized. Our preliminary literature\
    \ study compelled us to work to facilitate farmers for\nagriculture automation,\
    \ recommendations, and guidelines in their local language, i.e.,\nUrdu, by using\
    \ the internet of agricultural things (IoAT), also known as agricultural\ninternet\
    \ of things (Ag-IoT) and artiﬁcial intelligence technologies with transliteration\
    \ and\nvoice-speech support in the local language. IoAT is the network of complex\
    \ and diverse\nagricultural objects that compute, process, and recommend solutions\
    \ intelligently based on\ndata generated from every connectable thing [42].\n\
    Previous research shows that using graphical cues, audio, speech, and video in\
    \ mobile\ninterfaces helps low-literates better adapt [43,44]. Field study experiences\
    \ reﬂect that low-\nliterates feel more challenged in understanding and interpreting\
    \ textual information than\ntheir literate peers [45]. In our research, we try\
    \ to accommodate such users by introducing\naudio, speech, Urdu language support,\
    \ and an interactive graphical interface. Researchers\nalso talked about the improvements\
    \ in information dissemination systems for less literate\nfarmers via different\
    \ means [46–50]. However, none considered interface design and\nUrdu language-based\
    \ real-time updates about agricultural guidelines using the android\napplication\
    \ and user preferences. Our choice of Urdu in this work was made by observing\n\
    that 87% of farmers preferred Urdu as a medium of information dissemination [51].\
    \ Our\nresearch is an extended form of [52–54] and primarily focuses on developing\
    \ an IoT-based\nand user-friendly system with these utilities.\n1.1. Rationale\n\
    This section reﬂects the ﬁndings and an evaluation report on information found\
    \ in\nthe literature relevant to our research domain. It represents the overview\
    \ of different ap-\nproaches used by other researchers. Integrating the Internet\
    \ of Things into the agricultural\nsystem has led to the internet of Agricultural\
    \ things (IoAT) and advanced computing\ntechniques. The researchers applied this\
    \ to obtain maximum beneﬁts and also to improve\nthe production of agriculture,\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence, and IoT [55]. The agriculture domain is\nexperiencing\
    \ new evolution and revolution motivated by cloud technology, IoT, Edge and\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1277\n3 of 23\nfog computing, sensors, IoT, and big data\
    \ [56]. A proposal was presented for agriculture\napplications by investigating\
    \ integrated platforms, including cloud computing, IoT, and\ndata mining techniques\
    \ [57]. An IoT-based smart agricultural system was developed using\ndeep learning\
    \ combined with a cloud environment comprised of four layers: data collection,\n\
    edge computing, data transmission, and cloud computing layer [58]. A scalable\
    \ network-\nbased architecture was proposed to monitor and regulate agricultural\
    \ farms in rural areas\nusing IoT-based wiﬁ, long-distance network, and fog computing\
    \ [59]. Agricultural data\nanalytics employed with IoT has transformed from speciﬁc\
    \ crops to any kind of crop. The\ndeveloped system could support various applications,\
    \ from controlling and monitoring the\ncrops to promoting them to market [60].\n\
    Literacy is the ability to read and write simple statements [61]. Illiteracy,\
    \ low education,\nand computer illiteracy are signiﬁcant concerns in developing\
    \ countries like Pakistan.\nStudies indicate that user interface (UI) would be\
    \ designed differently for literate, low-\nliterate, and illiterate users. A user\
    \ interface should also consider the cultural context, such\nas language and images.\
    \ The non-textual interface is more user-friendly than the textual\none for illiterate\
    \ users [62].\nThe inability to read and write and the illiteracy of small farmers\
    \ make them vulnerable\nto various workers and cause human health risks [63].\
    \ Previous research inferred that\ncomplex hierarchy and multi-screens become\
    \ difﬁcult for low-literates to understand\nhelpful information, so the visuals,\
    \ audio, video, speech, icons, and images are a better\napproach to passing complex\
    \ data and information to mobile users [64]. The research\nﬁndings shed light\
    \ on some user interface (UI) design guidelines for illiterate and semi-\nliterate\
    \ users that can help take advantage of information and communication technologies\n\
    ICT [51]. The most powerful design factors that should be incorporated into a\
    \ user interface\n(UI) for low-literate users are localization and graphics [65].\
    \ An android application with\naudio, textual, and visual components was designed\
    \ for farmers with diverse literacy\nlevels. It could facilitate them regarding\
    \ vital weather information [45]. Pakistani farmers\ntypically rely on traditional\
    \ sources of information, which could be a reason for their\ninformation deﬁciency.\
    \ Data analysis indicated that farmers had diverse demographic\nconditions, but\
    \ primary among them is the ordinary level of education (52.4% illiterate).\n\
    A high level of information deﬁciency was observed among farmers regarding fertilizers\n\
    application, seed rate, disease diagnosis, pests, and insects’ identiﬁcation,\
    \ and a medium\nlevel of lack in information regarding the selection of varieties,\
    \ harvesting, and pets’\nmanagement was observed [66]. Providing information access\
    \ to low-literate, linguistic\nminority, tech-shy, handicapped and marginalized\
    \ users using speech-based services is a\nviable solution. These services were\
    \ made the national weather hotline of Pakistan [50]. A\nsurvey data revealed\
    \ that farmers in the Vehari district of Pakistan have a low literary rate\nand\
    \ less technical knowledge. They are unable to read agricultural instructions,\
    \ unaware\nof pesticides persistence and toxicity (73%), unable to diagnose cotton\
    \ pests and diseases\n(86%), and unable to decide which crop to grow on cotton\
    \ adjacent farms (100%) [67]. The\nresearch was conducted to study knowledge,\
    \ attitude, and practices regarding pesticide\nusage by vegetable growers in three\
    \ districts; Dadu, Larkana, and Shikarpur of Sindh,\nPakistan. Results show that\
    \ most vegetable growers (40.90%) have low primary education\nliteracy, and 27.27%\
    \ possess a middle pass. That’s why most growers are unfamiliar with\npest and\
    \ insect damage indications and the safe handling of pesticides [68]. Pakistani\n\
    farmers’ awareness of the damaging effects of different pesticides can lead to\
    \ integrated\nand smart pest control and management [69]. Research ﬁndings reﬂect\
    \ farmers’ behavior\nand a low tendency towards reading the labels of the pesticides\
    \ due to low education,\nadvanced age, usage of too technical language, illegible\
    \ fonts, and unclear texts [70]. In [71],\nthe authors developed a basic interactive\
    \ voice response (IVR) system for agro-information\ndissemination, such as fertilizer,\
    \ pesticide information, and weather forecast. In terms\nof usability and information\
    \ extraction, their study reﬂected that simple menu-based\nnavigation interfaces\
    \ are relatively easy to use and understand.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 1277\n4 of\
    \ 23\nA remote agricultural monitoring platform was proposed in [72] after a detailed\n\
    literature study. Cyber security-based precision farming conceptual architecture\
    \ was\npresented in [73] for the frost prediction in peach production by analyzing\
    \ data captured\nby sensors implanted around an orchard. IoT-based precision farming\
    \ comprises multiple\ncontrol and monitoring applications like monitoring water\
    \ needs according to climate\nconditions, analyzing soil patterns, monitoring\
    \ crops disease and pest attacks, and assessing\noptimum time for planting, harvesting,\
    \ and tracking [74,75].\nAquaAgro offers IoT and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) enabled\
    \ solutions for precision\nfarming. Using a software or app embedded hardware,\
    \ the predictions will be made for\nthe Irrigation scheduling, Fertilizer requirement,\
    \ Pest attack prediction, and Plant disease\ndetection. The essential four services\
    \ that AquaAgro provides are irrigation scheduling,\nFertilizer requirement, Pest\
    \ attack prediction, and Plant disease detection. They have\nreceived an overwhelming\
    \ response from the people [76]. An android mobile application\nnamed ‘Mentha\
    \ Mitra’ was developed with an interactive interface with bilingual (Hindi\nand\
    \ English) for menthol mint growers [77]. Android application provides scientiﬁc\
    \ e-\nadvisories on crop-related diseases, high-yield varieties, pests, insects,\
    \ and improved\ndistillation units.\nAn IoT-based wireless sensor network (WSN)\
    \ framework was proposed to monitor\ncrops smartly by analyzing environmental\
    \ factors [78]. In [79], the authors utilized the\nbeneﬁts of IoT for the implementation\
    \ of precision agriculture by sensing required param-\neters from the ﬁeld and\
    \ making suitable decisions such as activation and deactivation of\nirrigation\
    \ valves. Parameters include soil moisture, temperature and light intensity, etc.\n\
    Sensors could also send the gathered data to the cloud, and an Android application\
    \ was\ndeveloped to access these parameters. An expert IoT-based system relies\
    \ on the stored\nknowledge base and real-time data for farmer recommendations\
    \ [80]. This system will help\nin proactive and reactive tasks to a minimum the\
    \ loss of water. Farooq et al. [81] performed\na comprehensive literature study\
    \ on state-of-the-art techniques in smart farming. They\ndiscussed agriculture\
    \ networks, platforms, architecture, and topologies to help farmers\nto enhance\
    \ the corps’ productivity. This survey paper shows that Government and many\n\
    other stakeholders are interested in deploying IoT in Pakistan’s agriculture ﬁeld.\
    \ To in-\ncrease agricultural productivity, the authors suggested that collaboration\
    \ between allied\nand agriculture activities can be built by integrating big data\
    \ into climate-smart agriculture\nwith resource utilization [82].\nIn [83], the\
    \ authors are more concerned about the water supply to the plants. They\nproposed\
    \ a system in which a farmer can water the plants with a push of a button on his\n\
    phone when he is out of the station. Machine learning algorithms and radio frequency\n\
    identiﬁcation (RFID) tags detect and measure moisture and humidity. Internationally,\n\
    many studies [12,84–86] have been conducted to improve agricultural processes\
    \ based on\nsoil fertility level, crops, weather patterns, and fertilizers. These\
    \ studies used IoT, Global\nPosition Systems (GPS), Global information systems\
    \ (GIS), Wireless Sensor Networks\n(WSN), and many machine learning techniques.\
    \ The implementation of studies results in\nincreased proﬁtability and self-sufﬁciency.\
    \ IoT enabled decision support systems based on\nreal-time farm sensors data,\
    \ improving the water consumption by crops [87–89]. Authors\nin [90] provided\
    \ the real-time farm data, weather, and crops data to a Penman-Monteith\nand crop-coefﬁcient\
    \ model to produce recommendations about irrigation schedules. An\nintelligent\
    \ approach for diagnosing crop disease was proposed in [91], capable of working\n\
    with android devices equipped with fuzzy decision-making at the backend. The system\n\
    interacts with farmers in their native language of Urdu for crop disease diagnosing.\
    \ ‘Padi2U’\nis an android application developed for farmers to manage paddy ﬁelds.\
    \ It provides\nguidelines related to paddy varieties, planting schedule, pest,\
    \ disease, weed, weather\nforecast, and yield information in their native language\
    \ ‘Malay’ [92]. In [93], the authors\ndeveloped an application named ‘BLYNK’ to\
    \ control the IoT-based hardware remotely. The\npurpose of ‘BLYNK’ was to automate\

    \ fuzzy decision support to generate a\nmoisture content distribution map of soil\
    \ and enhance affectivity [53,94–98].\nSoil having an essential quantity of macro\

    \ lack of signiﬁcant nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus,\nand Potassium) declines\
    \ crops’ cultivation, growth, and yield. To increase crop production,\nthe suitability\
    \ of a speciﬁc crop to be planted can be recommended by exploiting the soil’s\n\
    macronutrients [99–103]. Soil pH level is the major parameter for measuring soil\
    \ macronu-\ntrients (N, P, and K) and some of the micronutrients [104–108]. Smart\
    \ agro farms [109] use\nsolar power and a low-cost smart system, a perfect combination\
    \ of IoT, data mining, and\nAndroid application. The system monitors and extracts\
    \ a farm’s environmental factors\nsuch as soil moisture, humidity, and weather\
    \ and temperature parameters via data mining\nmodules, and provides optimized\
    \ guidance regarding crop cultivation, irrigation, and\nweather forecast in the\

    \ agricultural data through implanted IoT sensors, such\nas pH, soil moisture,\
    \ humidity, and temperature. The Internet plays a mediatory role in\ncommunication\
    \ and data exchange. We integrated agricultural data acquired from im-\nplanted\
    \ IoT devices with the cloud platform. Data is processed in a decision-making\
    \ system\nbased on learning prediction rules in conjunction with a rule-based\
    \ engine. Generally, a\nfarmer requires guidelines, even from the crop selection\
    \ phase to the harvesting stage. As\npresented in Figure 1, to facilitate low\
    \ literate farmers at each of these steps in their native\nlanguage, we performed\
    \ the following research objectives:\n•\nInvestigated traditional techniques and\
    \ systems with different agricultural interfaces\nto ﬁnd a research gap.\n•\n\
    Design and develop an interface in an easy-to-use format and Urdu for low-literate\n\
    farmers to facilitate their awareness and guidelines in their native language.\n\
    •\nDesign and develop a mechanism for measuring soil fertility of speciﬁc land\
    \ to recom-\nmend suitable crops according to soil fertility using fuzzy logic.\n\
    •\nProvide crops cultivation schedule, crop harvest schedule, automated irrigation\
    \ pro-\ncess, and watering guidelines to farmers.\n•\nFacilitate farmers concerning\

    \ are not facilitated with new technologies to access agricultural information\n\
    and thus rely on traditional methods to grow their crops. Related studies indicate\
    \ that there is\nno such smart system providing an interactive interface to a\
    \ low literate or illiterate farmer\nand guidelines from the crop selection phase\
    \ to the harvesting stage. Significant barriers to\naccessing modern information\
    \ systems are the low literacy of farmers, the non-availability of\nlocal-language\
    \ information systems, and systems with fewer features. Our research identified\n\
    that it is essential to equip rural and semi-literate or illiterate farmers with\
    \ updated information\nthrough ICT, IoT, Edge Computing, Cloud Computing, and\
    \ Machine learning techniques, and\nprovide them guidance in almost every phase\
    \ of the crop cycle. It is necessary to develop\nUrdu-language-based information\
    \ smart systems to enhance farmers’ comprehension, crop\nproduction, and sustainable\
    \ agriculture.\nProposed System Design and Architecture\nThe overall design and\
    \ architecture of the solution proposed to cover smart agriculture\nare depicted\
    \ in Figure 2. It comprises three layers: crop (edge) layer, fog computing layer,\n\
    data analytics, and smart management at the cloud layer. The edge and cloud layers\
    \ are\ndesigned to be deployed respectively at local crop premises and remote\
    \ data servers. The\nintermediate fog computing layer comprises a set of virtualized\
    \ control modules in the form\nof Network Function Virtualization (NFV) nodes\
    \ that can be initiated along the network path\nfrom the farm facilities to the\
    \ cloud layer. NFV is a way to virtualize network services, for\nexample, firewalls,\
    \ routers, and load balancers that have traditionally been run on proprietary\n\
    hardware. The intermediate fog layer increases the versatility of deployed solutions\
    \ and\nconnectivity performances with the edge layer. At the crop premises, suitable\
    \ sensors like\nhumidity, temperature, soil moisture sensor, light intensity,\
    \ pH sensor, and actuators like\nwater pumps, valves, and activation of devices\
    \ for smart farming automation are deployed\nand connected with wireless nodes\
    \ as shown in Figure 2. Sensors’ data is captured at the edge\nlayer through wireless\

    \ facilitation with the following\nmain features.\n3.1.1. Soil Nutrient Analysis\n\
    With increased emphasis on precision agriculture, economics, and the environment,\n\
    soil analysis is a tool to determine areas where adequate and excessive fertilization\
    \ has\noccurred.\nSoil analysis is also used to monitor past fertility practices\
    \ to changes in\na ﬁeld’s nutrient status.\nNutrient availability can be impacted\
    \ by soil chemical and\nphysical properties.\nIn determining soil nutrient contents,\
    \ soil pH analysis is one parameter. Soil pH refers\nto the acidity and alkalinity\
    \ of soil measured on a logarithmic scale; thus decrease in 1 unit\nof pH value\
    \ causes an increase in acidity by a factor of 10. Small changes in pH values\
    \ have\nsigniﬁcant consequences. Table 1 represents the range values deﬁned for\
    \ soil pH.\nTable 1. Soil pH range values.\npH Level\nRange Values\n<3.5\nUltra-Acidic\n\
    3.6–3.9\nExtremely Acidic\n4–5.5\nStrong acidic\n5.6–6\nMedium acidic\n6.1–6.5\n\
    Slightly acidic\n6.6–7\nVery Slightly acidic\n7.1–7.5\nVery Slightly alkaline\n\
    7.6–8\nSlightly alkaline\n8.1–8.5\nMedium alkaline\n8.6–10\nStrongly alkaline\n\
    Measuring the acidity and alkalinity of soil is essential for analyzing the number\
    \ of\nmacro-nutrients present in the soil, particularly nitrogen (N), potassium\
    \ (K), and phospho-\nrus (P). Crops need these macro-nutrients in their growth,\
    \ thrive, and combat diseases.\nRemoval of bases from the soil due to harvested\
    \ crops, leaching, and acidic residual left in\nsoil due to fertilizers causes\
    \ an increase in acidity of the soil. Soil acidity affects crops and\nplants in\
    \ many ways, such as whether the surface pH is very high or too low, when the\n\
    efﬁcacy of herbicides and chemical reactions may be affected. Soil analysis is\
    \ the best way\nto check pH levels, and maintaining at least a pH of 6.0 is a\
    \ realistic goal. When soil pH is\nvery low (acidity is high) following conditions\
    \ occur:\n•\nSoluble metals, especially Manganese and Aluminum, may be toxic.\n\
    •\nThe population of organisms and their activities accountable for transforming\
    \ N, P,\nand S to plant-available forms may be reduced.\n•\nDeﬁciency of Calcium.\
    \ The soil’s cation exchange capacity (CEC) is low.\n•\nSymbiotic N ﬁxation in\
    \ legume crops is signiﬁcantly impaired. The symbiotic asso-\nciation entails\
    \ a narrower range of soil reactions than does the growth of plants not\nrelying\
    \ on ‘N’ ﬁxation.\n•\nAcidic soil with less organic matter is poorly aggregated\
    \ and has poor tilt.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 1277\n8 of 23\n•\nThe availability\
    \ of mineral elements in soil may be affected. Association between soil\npH and\
    \ nutrient availability to plants can be depicted in Figure 3. The wider the blue\n\
    bar, the greater the nutrient availability. For example, for a pH range of 5.5–7.5,\
    \ the\navailability of P is highest and drops below 5.5. If the soil pH is 6,\
    \ an amount of P\napplied to it will be more available than if the same amount\
    \ is used in soil with a pH\nless than 5.5. Soil with high pH (>7.4) reduces several\
    \ nutrients such as Fe, Mn, Zn,\nand P, which is not economical for growing agronomic\
    \ crops.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n9 of 24 \n \n \nFigure 3.\

    \  \nMacronutrients are essential for plant growth and an excellent overall plant\
    \ state. The \nprimary macronutrients are nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium\
    \ (K). Nitrogen is \na principal constituent of several essential plant substances\
    \ necessary for plant develop-\nment, energy metabolism, and protein synthesis.\

    \ Recommendation\nThe recommendation system proceeds based on a decree made by\

    RAW is calculated using ETc (depletion value) and predefined crop data. Every\

    The irrigation calculation algorithm (ICA) determines whether irrigation is required\n\
    or not and calculates the volume of irrigation needed. ICA operates on two types\
    \ of data:\nreal-time data collected by sensors and predetermined static data\
    \ such as crop and soil data.\nAmbient temperature, humidity, and soil moisture\
    \ measured by sensors are dynamic as\nthey change hourly. Real-time data also\
    \ incorporate average wind data (m/s) to calculate\nET0 from an online source\
    \ [111]. Crop data comprises crop coefﬁcient, depletion factor, and\nadequate\
    \ root depth. Soil data contains soil category, water capacity, wilting point,\
    \ and\nlocation. Location data further comprises the latitude and longitude of\
    \ speciﬁc farms.\nFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [112] recommends an\
    \ essential condition\nthat ICA evaluates daily to calculate irrigation decisions\
    \ for a particular farm and crop.\nIf Dr, i ≥ RAW, there is a need for irrigation,\
    \ here Dr, i is the root zone depletion or ﬁnal\ndepletion at the end of an ith\
    \ day, and RAW is readily available water or amount of water\nin the root zone\
    \ measured in ‘mm’. To ensure proper crop growth and avoid water stress,\nRAW\
    \ must be maintained above ﬁnal depletion (Dr, i). If the above condition is good,\
    \ the\nRAW value and total farm area are used to compute the necessary irrigation\
    \ volume. RAW\nis calculated using ETc (depletion value) and predeﬁned crop data.\
    \ Every day depletion\nvalue increases due to crop evapotranspiration that cause\
    \ an irrigation need if it increases\nthan RAW. Depletion before evapotranspiration,\
    \ called initial shortage, and lack after evap-\notranspiration, represented as\
    \ the ﬁnal deﬁcit, are calculated using average soil moisture,\nwater capacity,\
    \ and adequate root depth daily. For optimistic irrigation, measuring the\nwater\
    \ amount a crop loses and requires for a speciﬁc duration is essential. Every\
    \ crop type\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 1277\n13 of 23\nand soil has different water\
    \ requirements; however, water loss occurs due to evaporation\nfrom the soil surface\
    \ and plant transpiration. Evapotranspiration is a combination of\nevaporation\
    \ and transpiration. Evapotranspiration ‘ET0’ be determined by real-time and\n\
    predeﬁned variables such as humidity, wind speed, latitude, and altitude. ET0\

    temperature, minimum temperature, longitude, and latitude are used to calculate\
    \ Rn. ‘G’ is\nthe soil heat ﬂux, the amount of thermal energy that transfers through\
    \ the soil surface per\nunit of time. As the ICA measures ET0 every 24h, the value\
    \ of soil heat ﬂux is so tiny that\nit can be neglected; thus, G ≈ 0. u2 is the\

    \ at\nevery stage of the crop cycle. This study was carried out to provide a smart\
    \ advisory\nsystem for illiterate and semi-literate farmers of Pakistan that could\
    \ provide them guidance\nfrom crop selection to the harvest stage phase. In this\
    \ research work, we built a cost-\neffective smart system equipped with multiple\
    \ sensors and devices related to the internet\nof things (IoT) technologies. We\
    \ also developed an android application named ‘Kistan\nPakistan’ that allows illiterate\
    \ and low-literate farmers to manage their farms remotely. The\ninterface of the\
    \ android application is interactive due to its visual, audio, voice, and iconic\n\
    components. The proposed solution is applicable globally as all information and\
    \ guidelines\nare disseminated in both the ‘Urdu’ and ‘English’ languages. Edge-cloud\
    \ computing\ndelivers more accurate guidelines in less time and in almost every\
    \ phase of the agricultural\ncycle, increasing productivity and making the agricultural\
    \ ecosystem more robust. We\nexperimented on a small-scale farm, but the results\
    \ reﬂect that it will be efﬁcient for medium\nto large-scale ﬁelds.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    water management scheme for irrigated crops requires an integrated approach, which
    accounts for water, soil, and crop management. SIMETAW# is a user friendly soil
    water balance model that assesses crop water use, irrigation requirements, and
    generates hypothetical irrigation schedules for a wide range of crops experiencing
    full or deficit irrigation. SIMETAW# calculates reference evapotranspiration (ETo),
    and it computes potential crop evapotranspiration (ETc), and the evapotranspiration
    of applied water (ETaw), which is the amount of irrigation water needed to match
    losses from the effective soil root zone due to ETc that are not replaced by precipitation
    and other sources. Using input information on crop and soil characteristics and
    the distribution uniformity of infiltrated irrigation applications in full or
    deficit conditions, the model estimates the mean depth of infiltrated water (IW)
    into each quarter of the field. The impact of deficit irrigation on the actual
    crop evapotranspiration (ETa) is computed separately for each of the four quarters
    of the cropped field. SIMETAW# simulation adjusts ETo estimates for projected
    future CO2 concentration, and hence the model can assess climate change impacts
    on future irrigation demand allowing the user to propose adaptation strategies
    that potentially lead to a more sustainable water use. This paper discusses the
    SIMETAW# model and evaluates its performance on estimating ETc, ETa, and ETaw

    Agriculture is vulnerable to weather conditions and future climate change can
    be detrimental (Jiménez Cisneros et al. 2014). Especially in those areas already
    affected by water scarcity, the need for more water resources could grow, and
    increasing water scarcity will necessitate a more sustainable approach to water
    resource management. An accurate computation of the seasonal crop water requirement
    (CWR) is important for water resource planning, and the assessment of the evapotranspiration
    of applied water (ETaw) is even more important for developing crop management
    strategies that are economically convenient in terms of water usage, crop yield,
    and profits. The CWR is the amount of water that a crop needs for optimal production,
    which was defined by Doorenbos and Pruitt (1977) as the volume of water needed
    to meet the water loss from the root zone through evapotranspiration, whereas
    the ETaw is the volume of required irrigation water to infiltrate into the quarter
    of the cropped field receiving the least amount of water to achieve optimal production.
    Water shortages are common in the State of California, and in the early 2000s,
    this led the University of California, Davis (UCD) and the California Department
    of Water Resources (DWR) to develop the Simulation of Evapotranspiration of Applied
    Water (SIMETAW) application program (Snyder et al. 2004; Snyder et al. 2012a),
    which is a user friendly soil water balance model that is able to estimate the
    CWR, generate hypothetical irrigation schedules for a wide range of irrigated
    crops, and output ETaw for use in water resources planning. The SIMETAW application
    is used to assess the ETaw of crops in a microclimate area having approximately
    the same evaporative demand over the entire region. Later, a program to apply
    SIMETAW to all microclimatic regions in California, i.e., Cal-SIMETAW, was developed
    (Orang et al. 2013). While SIMETAW and Cal-SIMETAW are useful for irrigation planning
    in California, where adequate water supplies are available in most years, it is
    likely that water deficit will occur in the future. Also, deficit irrigation is
    common in many arid and semi-arid climates and rain-fed agriculture is common
    in many developing counties. Consequently, the SIMETAW model was modified and
    renamed “SIMETAW#” in collaboration with the University of Sassari (Italy). The
    improvements include revised crop coefficient (Kc) values to ETc, and stress coefficient
    (Ks) values to account for water deficit effects on evapotranspiration and yield.
    In addition, SIMETAW# corrects midseason Kc values for the effect of climate,
    which was not included in SIMETAW or Cal-SIMETAW. SIMETAW# also addresses the
    impact of rising CO2 concentration on reference evapotranspiration (ETo), so it
    is useful for planning responses to climate change. The earlier models stopped
    with the calculation of ETaw, and the seasonal irrigation water diversion was
    calculated separately. The ability to compute the seasonal water diversions for
    irrigation based on the distribution uniformity fraction (Du) of the irrigation
    systems and estimated surface runoff (Roff) was added to SIMETAW#. The ETaw, or
    irrigation requirement, represents the portion of CWR that is supplied by irrigation
    and not by water tables, effective precipitation, i.e., rainfall, dew, and fog
    (Moratiel et al. 2013), and the reduction in water storage in the crop root zone
    from pre- to post-season. Determining ETaw requires a daily water balance throughout
    the season to estimate effective precipitation, contributions from water tables,
    and the change in soil water content during the season. In SIMETAW#, the ETaw
    is calculated as the sum of the mean depth of water infiltrating into the low
    quarter of the irrigated field, but ETaw is also equal to the difference between
    the seasonal CWR and sources of water other than irrigation. For the irrigated
    crop, the mean depth of infiltrated water (IW) over the field is calculated as
    the quotient of ETaw and the Du. Then, the gross application (GA), or diverted
    irrigation water, is calculated as the sum of the IW and Roff, if any. Using this
    approach results in a net application (NA) depth that matches the mean infiltration
    of water into the low quarter of the soil. When adequate water is available, the
    NA should return the soil water content in the low quarter back to near field
    capacity. The remaining 75 % of the cropped soil infiltrates more water than needed
    to refill to field capacity, and the excess water mainly contributes to deep percolation
    of water below the rooting zone. For most crops, this approach to scheduling is
    likely to result in the highest productivity. This paper discusses the processes
    and features of the SIMETAW# model, assesses its potential applications, and reports
    on its performance. 2 The SIMETAW# Model Description In SIMETAW#, ETaw (mm) is
    determined as the sum of the net irrigation applications, but it can also be estimated
    as the seasonal cumulative total of daily crop evapotranspiration (CETc, mm) minus
    effective rainfall during the season, as well as the decrease in soil water content
    from the beginning to the end of the season, and any contributions to ETc (mm)
    coming from fog, dew, light rainfall, and water tables. Crop and soil characteristics,
    climate data, water contributions from all sources, and irrigation system distribution
    uniformities are the basic inputs needed to compute ETaw. 2.1 Climate Input Data
    and ETo Computations SIMETAW# computes ETo (mm d−1) using the daily (24-h) standardized
    reference evapotranspiration equation for short canopies (Allen et al. 1998; Allen
    et al. 2005b, 2006). At the time when the Penman-Monteith equation (Monteith 1965)
    was developed, the global CO2 concentration was about 372 ppm and it is projected
    to reach about 550 ppm by 2050 and more than 800 ppm by 2100 considering the most
    critical CO2 concentration pathway scenario (IPCC 2013). Studies have shown that
    the stomatal conductance (gs, mm s−1) of many C3 plants decrease by about 20 %
    when the CO2 concentration increases from 372 to about 550 ppm (Drake et al. 1997;
    Long et al. 2004; Ainsworth and Long 2005). Therefore, if the CO2 concentration
    changes from 372 to 550 ppm, the stomatal conductance of 0.12 m tall C3 species
    grass with a stomatal resistance (rs) of 100 s m−1 should decrease from about
    10 mm s−1 to 8 mm s−1. Assuming the relationship remains linear beyond the 550
    ppm concentration, Snyder et al. (2011) expressed the canopy resistance (rc, s
    m−1) as a function of CO2 concentration (ppm) as: $$ {\mathrm{r}}_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{1000}{1.44\left(14.18-0.0112\kern0.5em
    {\mathrm{CO}}_2\right)} $$ (1) This equation is used in SIMETAW# to adjust the
    canopy resistance for the effect of projected CO2 concentration. 2.2 Crop-Soil
    Input Data Soil characteristics and crop-irrigation management practices are input
    to the model to calculate the soil water balance and determine hypothetical irrigation
    schedules. The SIMETAW# model follows the basic soil water balance concepts as
    described in Snyder et al. (2012a) and Orang et al. (2013). The potential crop
    rooting depth (mm), the allowable depletion (AD, %) of available water, and the
    volumetric available water holding capacity (θA, mm mm−1) are input or selected
    and used to determine the plant available water (PAW, mm) within the soil rooting
    depth. There is a 50 % default value for AD which is widely used for many field
    and horticultural crops, but it can be overridden. A user can select whether to
    use only precipitation, deficit irrigation, or full irrigation. Default values
    for application rate (AR, mm h−1) and Du of infiltrated water (Center for Irrigation
    Technology 2011) are included in the program. 2.3 Crop Coefficient Values and
    Corrections In SIMETAW#, the seasonal crop coefficient trends are determined following
    a similar approach as was presented in Doorenbos and Pruitt (1977) and Allen et
    al. (1998). Default crop coefficient values are included in SIMETAW# using information
    provided by the FAO 24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt 1977), FAO 56 (Allen et al. 1998),
    and several recent papers. The SIMETAW# Kc method differs from the FAO methods
    in that the ends of the growth periods are identified as a percentage of the length
    of the season (Snyder et al. 2012a), whereas FAO uses estimates of the number
    of days within each growth periods to identify the end points. The advantage from
    using the percentages is that the number of days within growth periods is unknown
    for many crops and regions, and growers often have little or no information to
    identify when the trend changes from the midseason to late-season period. Initially,
    SIMETAW# extracts the tabular midseason Kc values from data stored in the program.
    Midseason Kc values, however, are known to vary depending on the climate (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt 1977; Allen et al. 2005a), so a climate correction was included. The
    climate correction equation is: $$ {\mathrm{K}}_{\mathrm{cmid}}={\mathrm{K}}_{\mathrm{ctab}}+0.261\left({\mathrm{ET}}_{\mathrm{o}}-7.3\right)\left({\mathrm{K}}_{\mathrm{ctab}}-1\right)
    $$ (2) where Kcmid is the corrected midseason crop coefficient and Kctab is the
    tabular midseason Kc value that is expected during midseason in a climate with
    ETo = 7.3 mm d−1 (Guerra et al. 2014). The SIMETAW# model also has corrections
    to determine the Kc values for immature trees and vines as percentage shading
    of the ground in relation to the growth date, and it has corrections for cover
    crops between the rows of orchards and vineyards as described in Snyder et al.
    (2012a). 2.4 Crop Evapotranspiration During the off-season and the initial-growth
    period, the SIMETAW# model estimates ETc as the product of ETo and Ke, which is
    the bare soil evaporation coefficient (Snyder et al. 2012a). Afterwards, based
    on crop data input, soil, and irrigation information, a Kc curve from the beginning
    of rapid growth to the end of late season is determined, and the daily crop evapotranspiration
    is calculated as the product of ETo and Kc. 2.5 Water Balance Calculations The
    SIMETAW# model computes the daily soil water balance for major crops. Because
    the soil water balance is calculated each day, rainfall runoff is ignored. The
    assumption is that storms with sufficiently heavy precipitation to have runoff
    are also likely to recharge the soil water content to field capacity after a heavy
    rainfall. The soil water depletion (SWD, mm) is updated daily using: $$ {\mathrm{SWD}}_{\mathrm{i}}={\mathrm{SWD}}_{\mathrm{i}-1}+{\mathrm{ET}}_{\mathrm{ci}}+{\mathrm{P}}_{\mathrm{cpi}}+{\mathrm{C}}_{\mathrm{i}}-{\mathrm{D}}_{\mathrm{i}}-{\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{offi}}+{\mathrm{I}}_{\mathrm{i}}
    $$ (3) The variable ETc is the potential crop ET, Pcp is precipitation, C is capillary
    rise from water tables, D is deep percolation below the root zone, Roff is runoff,
    I is irrigation depth, the subscripts i and i-1 represent the current and previous
    day, respectively, and all units are in mm. In the model the SWDi is defined as
    θfc-θi, where θfc and θi are the soil water holding contents at field capacity
    and on the ith day (mm mm−1), respectively. For deficit irrigated crops, ETa is
    substituted for ETc in Eq. 3. Any in-season Pcp that is stored in the root zone
    and potentially contributes to evapotranspiration is called effective rainfall
    (Re). If rainfall occurs and the Pcp exceeds the SWD, the Re = SWD and the soil
    returns to field capacity. If the Pcp event does not exceed the SWD, the Re =
    Pcp and the SWD is reduced by an amount equal to the Re. Identifying the net irrigation
    application (NAc, mm) for a well-watered crop is the first step for the water
    balance computation. The NAc is estimated at the beginning of midseason (date
    C) as: $$ {\mathrm{NA}}_{\mathrm{c}}=\left(1-{\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{off}}\right)\cdot
    \mathrm{R}\mathrm{T}\cdot \mathrm{A}\mathrm{R}\cdot {\mathrm{D}}_{\mathrm{u}}
    $$ (4) where RT is the irrigation system runtime (hh). During initial-growth (from
    date A to B), the NAc depends on the mean ETo rate, the crop coefficient for bare
    and nearly bare soil (Ke), and the days between irrigation. The Ke values were
    determined using the method of Ventura et al. (2006) with a typical soil hydraulic
    factor 2.6, mean daily ETo rates ranging from 1 to 10 mm d−1, and wetting frequencies
    of 2, 4, 7, 10, and 20 days. The equation for Ke based on the cumulative ETo (CETo,
    mm) is: $$ {\mathrm{K}}_{\mathrm{e}}=\frac{2.54}{\sqrt{\mathrm{CE}{\mathrm{T}}_{\mathrm{o}}}}
    $$ (5) Assuming that the ETc during initial-growth, i.e., with ground shading
    less than 10 %, is nearly equivalent to the evaporation from bare soil, the NAc
    during initial-growth is estimated as: $$ {\mathrm{NA}}_{\mathrm{c}}=\overline{{\mathrm{ET}}_{\mathrm{o}}}\cdot
    {\mathrm{K}}_{\mathrm{e}}\cdot {\mathrm{d}}_{\mathrm{e}} $$ (6) where de is the
    number of days from one irrigation to the next during initial-growth, and \( \overline{\mathrm{E}{\mathrm{T}}_{\mathrm{o}}}
    \)(mm) is the mean daily ETo rate during initial-growth. One option in SIMETAW#
    is to select if a crop is pre-irrigated or not. If a crop is pre-irrigated, then
    the SWD is set equal to zero on the day preceding the season. If it is not pre-irrigated,
    then the SWD on the day preceding the season is determined by the soil water balance
    during the off-season before planting or leaf-out. Some crops are frequently irrigated
    with sprinklers during the initial-growth period, and the irrigation frequency
    and mean ETo rate affect the initial-growth crop coefficient as was discussed
    earlier. Following the initial-growth period, irrigation events occur whenever
    the SWD reaches the “management allowable depletion” (MAD, mm). This approach
    forces the soil water depletion to generally fall between the yield threshold
    depletion (YTD, mm) and the permanent wilting point (PWP, mm) at the end of the
    season. A pressurized irrigation system normally maintains similar distribution
    uniformity regardless of the water amount applied, so during deficit water conditions,
    the best management practice is to maintain the same irrigation timing and reduce
    the depth applied for each irrigation event. Deficit irrigation will generally
    increase the application efficiency because less applied water goes to deep percolation
    and runoff. However, this may be untrue for surface irrigation if insufficient
    water is applied to obtain an even infiltration. SIMETAW# keeps the same irrigation
    dates for full and deficit irrigations, but less irrigation water is applied at
    each irrigation event. To do this, the program first calculates a schedule assuming
    there is adequate water available to avoid water stress. In this process, the
    model ‘estimates’ the ETaw for a well-watered crop (ETawe, mm) considering CETc
    during the season, (i.e., from growth date A to E for field crops or date B to
    E for orchard and vine crops) as: $$ {\mathrm{ET}}_{\mathrm{awe}}={\mathrm{CET}}_{\mathrm{c}}-\left({\mathrm{YT}\mathrm{D}}_{\mathrm{c}}-\frac{\mathrm{YT}{\mathrm{D}}_{\mathrm{os}}}{2}\right)
    $$ (7) where YTDc and YTDos (mm) are the maximum yield threshold depletion estimates
    during midseason and off-season, respectively. During the off-season, it is assumed
    that only half of the PAW in the top 0.30 m of soil can be depleted, so the YTDos
    is estimated as the product of the θA and 300 mm. Because the seasonal water balance
    is unknown prior to the end of the season, it is impossible to determine the real
    ETaw until the seasonal soil water balance is computed. However, Eq. 7 provides
    an early estimate for ETaw assuming that there is little effective rainfall and
    the soil is fairly dry at the end of the season. The ideal number of irrigation
    events (Nic) for a fully irrigated field is computed as: $$ {\mathrm{N}}_{\mathrm{ic}}=\frac{\mathrm{E}{\mathrm{T}}_{\mathrm{awe}}}{{\mathrm{MAD}}_{\mathrm{c}}}
    $$ (8) where the MADc (mm) is the management allowable depletion for a well-watered
    crop during the midseason period, which is equal to NAc. Since water application
    to a cropped field is non-uniform, the SIMETAW# program divides the field into
    four quarters. The low (1st) quarter application is the mean depth of water applied
    to the one quarter of the field receiving the least amount of water. The high
    (4th) quarter application is the mean depth of water applied to the one quarter
    of the field receiving the most water, and the 2nd and 3rd quarters are the mean
    depths of water applied to the intermediate quarters of the field. After computing
    the MADc and Nic, the program calculates the soil water balance for a well-watered
    crop and the ETaw as: $$ {\mathrm{ET}}_{\mathrm{aw}}=\sum_{\mathrm{i}=1}^{\mathrm{n}}{\mathrm{NA}}_{\mathrm{c},\mathrm{i}}
    $$ (9) for i = 1 to n, where n is the number of irrigation events and NAc,i (mm)
    is the net application or mean depth of water infiltrated into the low quarter
    on the ith day. Therefore, ETaw is equivalent to the seasonal mean depth of irrigation
    water infiltrated into the low quarter. Typical values for Du and Roff values
    are used to estimate the seasonal sum of gross application amounts (applied water)
    for the fully watered crop from the ETaw as: $$ \sum {\mathrm{GA}}_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{\mathrm{E}{\mathrm{T}}_{\mathrm{aw}}}{{\mathrm{D}}_{\mathrm{u}}}/\left(1-\frac{{\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{off}}}{100}\right)=\frac{{\displaystyle
    \varSigma {\mathrm{NA}}_{\mathrm{c}}}}{{\mathrm{D}}_{\mathrm{u}}}/\left(1-\frac{{\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{off}}}{100}\right)
    $$ (10) where Roff is the percentage of ΣGAc (mm) that contributes to runoff.
    For well-designed sprinkler, drip, and micro-sprinkler systems, the Roff should
    equal zero. The water allocation (WA, mm) is the mean depth of water that is available
    for the irrigation during a season. It is computed from the depths of infiltrated
    water (IW, mm) to the four quarters (IW1, IW2, IW3, and IW4): $$ \mathrm{W}\mathrm{A}=\frac{\mathrm{I}{\mathrm{W}}_1+{\mathrm{I}\mathrm{W}}_2+{\mathrm{I}\mathrm{W}}_3+{\mathrm{I}\mathrm{W}}_4}{4}=\sum
    {\mathrm{GA}}_{\mathrm{c}}\left(\frac{\mathrm{PIR}}{100}\right) $$ (11) where
    PIR is the percentage of the full irrigation requirement for the crop that is
    allocated for the cropping season. The user can set PIR = 100 for full irrigation,
    PIR < 100 % for water deficit conditions, and PIR = 0 for rain-fed crops. The
    low quarter mean depth applied is computed as: $$ {\mathrm{IW}}_1=\mathrm{W}\mathrm{A}\cdot
    {\mathrm{D}}_{\mathrm{u}} $$ (12) The high (4th) quarter mean depth applied is
    computed as: $$ {\mathrm{IW}}_4=\mathrm{W}\mathrm{A}+\left(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{A}-{\mathrm{IW}}_1\right)
    $$ (13) The 2nd quarter mean depth applied is equal to the sum of IW1 and 1/3
    of the difference between the high and low quarter mean depths applied, so: $$
    {\mathrm{IW}}_2={\mathrm{IW}}_1+1/3\left({\mathrm{IW}}_4-{\mathrm{IW}}_1\right)
    $$ (14) The 3rd quarter mean depth applied is equal to the sum of the low quarter
    depth and 2/3 of the difference between the high and low quarter mean depths applied:
    $$ {\mathrm{IW}}_3={\mathrm{IW}}_1+2/3\left({\mathrm{IW}}_4-{\mathrm{IW}}_1\right)
    $$ (15) When water deficit conditions are considered, the water allocation is
    less than for a fully irrigated crop (PIR < 100 %). Thus, the sum of the irrigation
    depths to the low quarter of a deficit irrigated crop (ΣNAa, mm) is computed as:
    $$ \Sigma {\mathrm{NA}}_{\mathrm{a}}=\sum {\mathrm{GA}}_{\mathrm{c}}\left(\frac{\mathrm{PIR}}{100}\right)=\mathrm{W}\mathrm{A}\cdot
    {\mathrm{D}}_{\mathrm{u}} $$ (16) When using pressurized irrigation systems, the
    number of irrigation events in water deficit conditions (Nia) is equal to Nic,
    and the MAD for the deficit irrigation (MADa, mm) is estimated as function of
    the PIR and MADc as: $$ {\mathrm{MAD}}_{\mathrm{a}}={\mathrm{MAD}}_{\mathrm{c}}\left(\frac{\mathrm{PIR}}{100}\right)
    $$ (17) Because the distribution uniformity of surface (gravity) irrigation depends
    greatly on the opportunity time to infiltrate water across the field, it is difficult
    to change the application amount for any given irrigation event. Therefore, SIMETAW#
    forces surface irrigation to have a similar management allowable depletion as
    the fully irrigated crop. During deficit water supply conditions, the number of
    irrigation events is reduced, but the depth of water applied is similar for each
    irrigation event. Therefore, for gravity irrigation, MADa = MADc and Nia < Nic,
    where Nia is the sum of the net applications in deficit condition divided by the
    management allowable depletion for the fully irrigated crop as: $$ {\mathrm{N}}_{\mathrm{ia}}=\frac{{\displaystyle
    \varSigma {\mathrm{N}\mathrm{A}}_{\mathrm{a}}}}{{\mathrm{MAD}}_{\mathrm{c}}} $$
    (18) 2.6 Determination of the Stress Coefficient and Fraction of Potential Yield
    Since the SIMETAW# program is able to compute the soil water balance in full irrigation
    and water deficit conditions, ETa is computed as the product of ETc and the stress
    coefficient. The Ks is computed as function of the SWD under deficit water conditions
    as: $$ {\mathrm{K}}_{\mathrm{s}}=1-\frac{100\left(\frac{\mathrm{SWD}}{\mathrm{PAW}}\right)-\mathrm{AD}}{100-\mathrm{AD}}
    $$ (19) If Ks = 1.00, there is no water deficit, while a Ks < 1.00 implies a water
    deficit. The CETc and cumulative actual crop evapotranspiration (CETa, mm) are
    computed by summing the daily ETa rates from the first through the last day of
    the season. Since water application to a cropped field is non-uniform, the SIMETAW#
    program estimates yield separately to each of the four quarters of the field based
    on infiltrated water. For a fully irrigated crop, with CETa = CETc, then IW1 =
    ETaw. When there is stress, CETa < CETc and IW1 < ETaw. SIMETAW# calculates the
    seasonal CETa for the deficit irrigated crop of the low quarter. The difference
    between CETa and IW1 is the amount of CETa coming from sources other than irrigation,
    e.g., effective precipitation, water table, dew and fog, and stored soil water.
    The ratio of CETa to CETc is computed for each quarter of the field, and reductions
    in yield due to water stress are computed for each of the four quarters of the
    field following the procedures in FAO 33 (Doorenbos and Kassam 1979). For each
    quarter, the actual to potential yield ratio (Ya/Yc) is computed as: $$ \frac{{\mathrm{Y}}_{\mathrm{a}}}{{\mathrm{Y}}_{\mathrm{c}}}=1-{\mathrm{K}}_{\mathrm{Y}}\left(1-\frac{\mathrm{CE}{\mathrm{T}}_{\mathrm{a}}}{\mathrm{CE}{\mathrm{T}}_{\mathrm{c}}}\right)
    $$ (20) where KY is a coefficient that relates the relative reduction in cumulative
    ET to the relative reduction in yield. Finally, the mean of the four yield ratios
    is computed to provide an estimate of yield as affected by deficit irrigation.
    This approach accounts for the irrigation system in addition to the irrigation
    deficit. The FAO 33 publication contains KY values for several crops, but KY values
    are not known for all crops. If the KY value is unknown for a particular crop,
    then KY = 1.0 is used in SIMETAW#. For crops with unknown KY values, assuming
    KY = 1.0 is equivalent to assuming that a 1 % reduction in transpiration due to
    stress will lead to a 1 % reduction in biomass production. For crops that produce
    reproductive parts rather than biomass alone, this is still a fair assumptions
    because, unless there is a severe irrigation deficit, the reduction in transpiration
    typically occurs later in the season when biomass is accumulating more in the
    reproductive parts. Thus, this modified version of the FAO 33 approach provides
    estimates of the actual to potential yield ratio for a large number of crops.
    2.7 Rain-fed Agriculture When a crop is grown in rain-fed conditions, the SIMETAW#
    program still calculates the daily water balance for a fully irrigated crop because
    the CETc information is needed to determine the well-watered yield for the crop.
    However, the stress function is determined using the SWD, AD, and PAW as previously
    discussed. The CETc and CETa are determined as in the deficit irrigated crop case.
    Finally, the Ya/Yc is still determined using the CETa and CETc calculations. 3
    Materials and Methods 3.1 Datasets The SIMETAW# model was designed to estimate
    the irrigation needs, thus its performance was tested employing data from three
    field studies. 3.1.1 Site 1 The first experimental study used in this paper was
    carried out by Bryla et al. (2005) in a peach field [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch],
    planted at the University of California Kearney Agricultural Research and Extension
    Center near Fresno, California (Johnson et al. 2002). The soil was fine sandy
    loam, and the rooting depth was around 1 m. Irrigation was applied by furrow and
    drip systems, and the schedule was based on ETc measured hourly on two well-watered
    peach trees growing in the same weighing lysimeter. The lysimeter contained trees
    of the same variety, age, and planting density as trees in the orchard. Furrow
    irrigation was applied to the orchard weekly while drip irrigation was applied
    every day. Irrigation application occurred from the beginning of April through
    mid-October. The research project was conducted during 2002 through 2004 and the
    results were used to assess the accuracy of the SIMETAW# model in estimating monthly
    ETc and ETaw. Weather data necessary to estimate ETo (Allen et al. 2005b) were
    obtained from the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS)
    station (Snyder and Pruitt 1992) nearby the experimental site (Parlier, 36°35′52″N;
    119°30′11″W; 103 m a.s.l.). The development dates were B (1 Mar), C (23 Jun),
    D (22 Set), and E (15 Oct), and the percentages for each growth stage from data
    B were 50 % (A-C), 90 % (A-D), and 100 % (A-E) and the Kc values were Kc1 = 0.55
    on date B, Kc2 = 1.05 on dates C and D, and Kc3 = 0.65 on date E. Using crop,
    soil, and management data reported in the experimental study, ETaw and the monthly
    ΣNAc for furrow and drip irrigation were estimated. 3.1.2 Site 2 The second experiment
    was carried out by Snyder and O’Connel (2007) on navel orange orchard [Citrus
    sinensis (L.) Osbeck] near Lindsay, California. The soil was a fine sandy loam,
    and the rooting depth was around 1.2 m. Irrigation was applied with micro-sprinklers
    every 4–6 days during summer. There was no irrigation from October/November through
    mid-March. Evapotranspiration was measured using the residual of the energy balance
    where the sensible heat flux was determined using the calibrated surface renewal
    method (Snyder and O’Connel 2007). A surface renewal (SR) station was set up inside
    the orchard to measure daily ETc, while weather data used to calculate ETo (Allen
    et al. 2006) came from the CIMIS station at the University of California Lindcove
    Field Station (36o21’26″N; 119o03’31″W; 146 m a.s.l.). The percentages for each
    growth stage from data B were 33 % (A-C), 67 % (A-D), and 100 % (A-E) and the
    Kc values were Kc1 = 1.00 on date B, Kc2 = 1.00 on dates C and D, and Kc3 = 1.00
    on date E. Results of daily ETc, monthly ΣNAc, and monthly number of irrigation
    events for the 2003 and 2004 seasons were used to assess the performance of the
    SIMETAW# model. 3.1.3 Site 3 The third experimental study was carried out by Snyder
    et al. (2012b) at the Campbell Tract at the University of California, Davis. Wheat
    (Triticum aestivum L.) was cultivated in rain-fed conditions from November 2011
    until June 2012. The soil was a Yolo silty clay loam with infiltration rate of
    about 28.6 mm h−1 and θA = 0.20 mm mm−1. Rooting depth was about 1.7 m. The development
    dates were A (26 Nov), B (10 Jan), C (20 Mar), D (15 May), and E (10 Jun), and
    the percentages for each growth stage from data A were 23 % (A-B), 58 % (A-C),
    87 % (A-D), and 100 % (A-E) and the Kc values were Kc1 = 0.33 on date B, Kc2 =
    1.05 on dates C and D, and Kc3 = 0.15 on date E. The ETa was computed by using
    data from a weighing lysimeter and a combination of the SR and eddy covariance
    (EC) methods. During initial-growth, because of the low ETa values, precipitation,
    and fog, data were only collected by the lysimeter. From mid-February on, the
    EC and SR methods were also used to estimate ETa. In early May, ETa from the lysimeter
    dropped dramatically. The EC and SR methods did not measure a drop in ETa until
    about two weeks later. The crop was not irrigated, and the early decrease in ETa
    observed in the lysimeter running out of water earlier than in the deeper soil
    surrounding the lysimeters. The wheat inside the lysimeter clearly senesced approximately
    two weeks prior to the wheat outside of the lysimeter. Thus, considering that
    the EC and SR observations clearly showed that the season was longer than indicated
    by the lysimeter data, an accurate computation of the ETa was possible by using
    the EC and SR data at the end of the season. Weather data and ETo estimates came
    from the CIMIS station (Davis, 38o32’09″N; 121o46’32″W; 18 m a.s.l.). Observed
    daily ETa data from the lysimeters (early growth), SR and EC (end of the season)
    where compared with those estimated by the SIMETAW# model. 3.2 Statistics The
    performance of the model in estimating the ETc, ETa, and ETaw was determined by
    statistical analyses. Several indexes, including the calculation of correlation
    and differences between estimated and measured series, were used. The simulated
    data were analyzed calculating the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r), root
    mean squared error (RMSE), and mean relative error (MRE). The Pearson’s correlation
    coefficient provides a measure of how strong is the correlation between simulated
    and observed series, and its range is between −1 and 1. The RMSE, which is a measure
    of how closely two variable match (Loague and Green 1991; Xevi et al. 1996) was
    used to test the accuracy of the model: $$ \mathrm{RMSE}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{\mathrm{n}}{\sum_{\mathrm{i}=1}^{\mathrm{n}}\left({\widehat{\mathrm{Z}}}_{\mathrm{i}}-{\mathrm{Z}}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)}^2}
    $$ (21) where n is the number of samples and Zi and Ẑi are the observed and estimated
    values for n observations. The MRE was used to measure the absolute error between
    simulated and observed data: $$ \mathrm{M}\mathrm{R}\mathrm{E}=\frac{1}{\mathrm{n}}\sum_{\mathrm{i}=1}^{\mathrm{n}}\frac{\left|{\mathrm{Z}}_{\mathrm{i}}-{\widehat{\mathrm{Z}}}_{\mathrm{i}}\right|}{{\mathrm{Z}}_{\mathrm{i}}}
    $$ (22) The MRE statistic indicates the match of estimated to observed values,
    but the value is relative to the observed data. 4 Results 4.1 Site 1 It was assumed
    that the peach orchard was irrigated with sufficient frequency and depth of water
    applied to avoid water stress, so the symbol ETc rather than ETa is used here.
    The SIMETAW# model estimated the CETc for peach equal to 1026, 1020, and 1058
    mm, while the observed values were equal to 1100, 1081, and 1041 mm, in 2002,
    2003, and 2004, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, the estimated and observed monthly
    ETc values followed a similar trend. For all three seasons, the model tended to
    overestimate ETc values during April through June and to the under predict ETc
    during July through September. The early difference is likely due to a later leaf
    out and, therefore, lower ETc than the default input value in the model (March
    1). The midseason ETc difference is clearly related to the choice of midseason
    Kc. If the model midseason Kc were increased, to what was observed, the model
    prediction would be nearly perfect. In general, the match between predicted and
    observed ETc values during the irrigation season was good. Nearly perfect ETc
    estimates were observed during May and June 2002 (Fig. 1a) and July and August
    2004 (Fig. 1c). Fig. 1 Monthly observed (obs) and estimated (est) crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) and applied water (ΣNAc) data for peach orchard in 2002 (a), 2003 (b), and
    2004 (c) Full size image Results of the statistical analysis of peach ETc estimates
    are shown in Table 1. The Pearson’s coefficient values were significant to less
    than 0.025. Taking into account the indices based on differences between expected
    and measured data, a relatively low RMSE was observed for ETc. The highest RMSE
    value was observed in 2003 (32.69 mm month−1), while the lowest value was 16.51
    mm month−1 in 2004. These results confirm a good predictive efficiency of the
    model. The model showed a tendency to underestimate ETc in 2002 and 2003. On the
    contrary, a slight overestimation of ETc was observed in 2004. These relationships
    would change if the model crop coefficients and growth dates were modified to
    better match the observed values. Table 1 Summary of predicted and observed monthly
    peach crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and sum of the net applications (ΣNAc) data
    during three growing seasons, and daily citrus ETc and monthly ΣNAc data by year
    Full size table The estimated ETaw in 2002 was 990 and 1005 mm for drip and furrow
    irrigation, respectively, compared with an observed ETaw = 1029 mm. For this example,
    the observed ETaw was set equal to the depth of water applied to the lysimeter,
    so distribution uniformity was not considered as it would be in a commercial field.
    The highest mismatch between observed and estimated data was noticed in June and
    September for both drip and furrow irrigation (Fig. 1a). The difference between
    observed and estimated monthly ΣNAc during the following years was less marked
    (Fig. 1b, c) with a nearly perfect match in 2004 (Fig. 1c). The summary statistics
    (Table 1) shows that the ETaw estimate in 2002 gave the highest RMSE values for
    both irrigation methods compared with the following irrigation seasons. The ETaw
    was underestimated in 2002, whereas it was overestimated in 2003 and 2004. In
    fact, the ETaw in 2004 was 1007 and 1013 mm for drip and furrow irrigation, respectively,
    compared with 992 mm for the observed data. In 2003, ETaw was 959 and 954 mm for
    drip and furrow irrigation, respectively, compared with 935 mm of the observed
    data. In general, the observed and predicted monthly ΣNAc values followed similar
    trends. 4.2 Site 2 The model estimated CETc values for citrus were 936 and 972
    mm for 2003 and 2004 respectively, whereas the observed CETc values were 975 and
    945 mm, respectively. The model showed some under-prediction of citrus ETc, especially
    during October and November in 2003 (Fig. 2a) and during March in 2004 (Fig. 2b).
    Since a fixed Kc = 1.00 was used all year in the SIMETAW# model, the canopy resistance
    in the ETo equation is fixed, and the canopy resistance of the crop was reduced
    when the foliage was wetted by fog or light rainfall, which is common in spring
    and fall, it likely explains the higher observed than modelled ETc values from
    late fall through early spring. In addition, the differences between modelled
    and observed ETc might result from measurement errors due to frequent light rainfall
    and fog interception during these months. In general, observed and predicted values
    followed the same trend, with a particular good fit when spikes in the ETc values
    were observed. Fig. 2 Estimated (est) and observed (obs) daily crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) and monthly applied water (ΣNAc) data of citrus in 2003 (a) and 2004 (b)
    Full size image The observed ETaw was estimated as the ΣNAc during the season
    assuming no runoff or deep percolation, and the estimated citrus ETaw was determined
    using SIMETAW#. The model estimated citrus ETaw values were 1060 mm (2003) and
    1124 mm (2004) without considering the contribution of November through April
    fog, dew, and light rainfall; this compares with the observed ETaw values 1153
    mm (2003) and 903 mm (2004). The model is predicting an optimal ETaw for the orchard,
    and the observed ETaw was 93 mm higher than ETaw (2003) and 121 mm lower than
    ETaw (2004). The yield of top quality fruit from the research orchard was 58 %
    higher in 2003 than in 2004, and the 2004 yield was considerably higher than the
    regional average (Snyder and O’Connel 2007). The statistics (Table 1) confirmed
    the good predictive capability of the model in estimating ETc and the amount of
    water necessary during the irrigation season. The RMSE and MRE values for estimated
    ETc, calculated during the main irrigation season, i.e., when ETo was substantial,
    were good for both seasons. The model simulation indicated the need for one irrigation
    event in January and February 2003, however, the contribution of fog, dew, and
    light rainfall was not included in the calculations. It is likely that the soil
    water extraction was overestimated during winter because the estimates did not
    include the contributions of fog, dew, and light rainfall. Because of the inaccuracy
    in trying to determine ETo during the winter, when ETo < 2.0 mm d−1 was common,
    we did not attempt to account for the contribution of fog interception, which
    is appreciable in the San Joaquin Valley from November through March. The irrigation
    season ended in mid-October 2004 compared with mid-November 2003, however, the
    model predicted two irrigation events in November 2014 and one irrigation event
    in November 2003. The actual irrigation events were independently controlled by
    the grower, but the predicted and actual number of irrigation events over the
    seasonal were comparable. During the irrigation season of 2003, the model estimated
    39 irrigation events and 38 were actually applied. In 2004, the model estimated
    38 irrigation events, and there were 36 actual applications. 4.3 Site 3 SIMETAW#
    estimated the seasonal CETa for wheat equal to 475 mm, while the observed value
    was 465 mm. As shown in Fig. 3, the mismatch between observed and simulated values
    was noted during the end of the growing season. In fact, a relatively small difference
    of about 20 mm month−1 of ETa was estimated in May. Taking into consideration
    the simulated daily soil water balance data, the wheat started to exhibit water
    stress after May 9 and the stress factor decreased from 1.00 to 0.42 at the end
    of the season. Around May 14, the stress factor was Ks = 0.76 and the drop of
    ETa values became apparent. Overall, the model simulation followed the observed
    trend well. The statistical analysis showed correlation r = 0.94, which was significant
    at P ≤ 0.001. The RMSE = 0.70 mm d−1 was relatively low and demonstrated a good
    predictive difference between expected and observed data. As further demonstrated
    by the MRE (0.51 mm d−1) value, the model showed a good performance for estimating
    daily ETa. Fig. 3 Daily estimated and observed ETa data of wheat Full size image
    5 Discussion Unlike other soil water balance models, SIMETAW# allows climate corrections
    for ETo and crop coefficient data in order to get more reliable water balance
    calculations. Moreover, SIMETAW# accounts for non-uniformity of the irrigation
    application, and it can be applied to rain-fed, deficit irrigated, and fully irrigated
    crops. SIMETAW# is a model to estimate irrigation water demand, and it provides
    some potential yield information for a wide number of crops rather than giving
    detailed crop production information as provided by more specific crop production
    and growth models. SIMETAW# does not require experimental data for the calibration
    and evaluation processes that are essential for using crop models. 6 Conclusions
    SIMETAW# is a soil water balance model that is able to simulate the evapotranspiration
    of the applied water. The daily water balance is an essential part of the program
    because it helps to determine the timing of the first and last irrigation events
    to insure that the soil water content starts and ends at levels that are reasonable.
    The model determines when the crop should be irrigated and how much water should
    be applied in terms of net and gross application depending on the irrigation system.
    Then, the sum of the computed net applications during a season provides information
    on how much water is needed to match the seasonal evapotranspiration to produce
    the crop. The possibility to choose the percentage of the full irrigation requirement
    to apply to a crop permits the simulation of adaptation strategies aimed to increase
    the use of irrigation water in an efficient way. Moreover, the application helps
    to assess irrigation demand in relation to future CO2 concentration. Results of
    the ETaw simulation indicate that the SIMETAW# model could be used efficiently
    to evaluate different irrigation strategies that enhance irrigation planning.

    Decision Making Based on IoT Data

    Collection for Precision Agriculture

    Christine Dewi and Rung-Ching Chen

    Abstract Internet of Things (IoT) is a shared network of things which can associate

    with each other through the internet connection. IoT plays a vital role in the
    agri-

    culture industry which can feed 9.0 billion people by 2050. Precision Agriculture

    provides a novel solution using a systems approach for today’s agricultural issues

    such as the need to balance productivity with environmental concerns. This paper

    proposes IoT for local information data collection on Precision Agriculture and
    uses

    some case study for examples. In this paper, we aim that the internet of things
    can

    be used to collect local information data on precision agriculture. The farmer
    could

    get the real time data for monitoring his ﬁeld. Moreover, by using this technology,

    farmers can effectively use the information to achieve higher yields and therefore

    earn higher proﬁts.

    Introduction

    As of now the total population of the world is presumed to be approximately 7
    billion

    and is projected to increase by 2.0 billion in just 40 years, reaching 9.0 billion
    by

    2050 [1]. This global resident growth affects the problem of food shortfall, and
    it

    becomes a world-scale problem. As the world’s population grows, farmers will need

    to supply more food. Moreover, there are some innovations in the agricultural
    ﬁeld,

    for example, the concept of Precision Agriculture. Precision Agriculture provides

    a novel fulﬁllment using a systems approach for today’s agricultural issues such
    as

    the need to balance productivity with environmental concerns. It is based on the

    implementation of foremost information technologies. It includes describing and

    modeling variation in soils and plant species and integrating agricultural practices
    to

    meet site-speciﬁc requirements.

    Furthermore, Precision Agriculture is the concept of using new technologies and

    collected ﬁeld information. The main activities of Precision Agriculture are data

    collection, processing and variable rate applications of inputs. In addition,
    Internet

    of Things (IoT) technology is currently shaping different aspects of human life.

    Precision agriculture is one of the paradigms which can use the IoT advantages
    to

    optimize the production efﬁciency across the agriculture ﬁelds, optimize the quality

    of the crops, and minimize the negative environmental impact [2]. The use of Wireless

    Sensor Networks (WSNs) in precision agriculture upgrades the overall efﬁciency,

    productivity, and proﬁtability of the agricultural system. WSNs are key components

    the IoT in which different pieces of information gathered from almost anywhere
    and

    anything in the world is accessible through the Internet [2]. Of the various advantages

    that IoT brings to the table, its ability to innovate the current scenario of
    farming

    methods is absolutely ground-breaking. Mostly, we come across ideas that suggest

    a wireless sensor network that collects data from the various sensors present
    in the

    ﬁeld and sends the data to the main central server. This method focuses on studying

    the environmental factors to improve crop yield [3].

    This paper proposes IoT for local information data collection on Precision Agri-

    culture. This paper aims to implement IoT technology to get the data for monitoring

    systems such as crop and soil monitoring, weather and air monitoring and working

    machine monitoring. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect.
    2,

    we review the related work and the proposed local information collection. The
    case

    study of IoT architecture is presented in Sect. 3. The paper is concluded in Sect.
    4.

    Related Work

    There are many types of research about the use of Internet of Things on Precision

    Agriculture. Prasad et al. [4] propose an approach combining the advantages of
    the

    signiﬁcant characteristics of emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things

    (IoT) and Web Service to construct an efﬁcient approach to handle the enormous
    data

    involved in agrarian output. The method uses the combination of IoT and cloud
    com-

    puting that promotes the fast development of agricultural modernization and helps

    to realize the smart solution for agriculture and efﬁciently solve the issues
    related

    to farmers. This research use connectivity using existing 3G, 4G networks using

    the available hardware is one signiﬁcant advantage for Smart agriculture. Internet

    of things paradigms are used as resources to facilitate decision making. IoT archi-

    tecture, operating rules, and smart processes are implemented using a distributed

    model based on edge and fog computing paradigms. A communication architecture

    is proposed using these technologies. The aim is to help farmers to develop smart

    systems both, in current and new facilities [5]. The important things to do in
    this

    paper describe how to collect the local information data use the IoT before analyzing

    the other step.

    The Internet of Things (IoT) is one network which contains physical objects

    that are embedded with the electronic devices, software, connectivity and sensors
    to

    achieve a higher value and provide some services regarding the exchange of details

    with the product manufacturer, operator [4]. IoT is developed using architectures

    based on layers capable of connecting a huge number of devices with each other

    and with the established services. The basic model of IoT has a three layer archi-

    tecture which is of Perception, Network and Application Layers [5]. Protocols
    are

    important depends on several facts such as environmental conditions, network char-

    acteristics, the total of data to be transferred, quality of service requests
    and security

    levels [6]. Furthermore, in this work different protocols such as Hypertext Transfer

    Protocol (HTTP), Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Bluetooth, and

    Wiﬁ can be used to develop proposed architecture. IoT technologies are proposed

    in PA scenarios. Moreover, in [7] this model is described as a solution in precision

    farming. IoT Smart farming application include farm parameters tracking, monitor-

    ing, ﬁeld observation, and storage monitoring. The work Internet of Things Platform

    for Smart Farming presents a platform based on IoT technologies that can automate

    the collection of environmental, soil, fertilization, and irrigation data; automatically

    correlate such data and ﬁlter-out invalid data from the perspective of assessing
    crop

    performance; and compute crop forecasts and personalized crop recommendations

    for any particular farm [6].

    Local Information Data Collection

    Local information system describes in this paper can see in Fig. 1. The data from

    the local system divided by three part, ﬁrst crop and soil monitoring, weather
    and air

    monitoring, and last working machine monitoring.

    Data are facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis. Data
    col-

    lection is the most important in precision agriculture because the farmer can

    their crop real time and improve their crop productivity. There many research
    about

    precision agriculture in a different crop. In [8] explain and give an example
    about

    yield monitoring over time creates a unique GIS database that assists farmers
    to

    easily identify yield variability within a ﬁeld, to make better variable-rate
    decisions,

    and create a history of spatial ﬁeld data. Yield monitoring has become a common

    practice in traditional grain crops and corn-soybean rotation systems. This technol-

    ogy is being researched and commercialized for other crops such as potato, onion,

    sugar beet, tomato, hay, citrus, grape, and sugarcane. There are various elements
    of

    precision farming that play their necessary role in cropping systems. Yield monitor-

    ing is being used to measure the yield variability of corn, soybean, potato, tomato,

    onion, sugar beet, hay, orange, grape, sugarcane and has become the most widely

    used component of precision farming. Besides yield variability, crop variety com-

    parisons, yield damage reports, and ﬁeld efﬁciency are being assessed with the
    use

    of yield monitoring systems.

    Soil preparation is the ﬁrst step before growing a crop. The ultimate objective
    is to

    produce a ﬁrm and weed-free seedbed for rapid germination and emergence of the

    crop. One of the most important tasks in soil preparation is tilling (or ploughing):

    turning the soil and loosening it. Besides, soil preparation is one of the most
    energy-

    consuming parts of agriculture, requiring signiﬁcant inputs of fuel and time.
    Depend-

    ing on the ﬁeld’s location, it may also increase the risk of soil erosion. Nowadays,

    precision farming equipment exists that helps farmers to use considerably less
    fuel

    and time in soil preparation by improving the accuracy, efﬁciency, and sustainability

    of the process.

    According to Pavithra [9] the distinctive sensors which are utilized in the research

    are the Temperature sensor, Humidity sensor, Soil sensor, Water-level sensor,
    and

    Light Dependent Resistor can be seen on the Fig. 2.

    Sensed data inputs produce several data. First, Temperature control is considering

    high radiation, while the temperature is evolving, and a few yields may get harmed,
    so

    it needs some ventilation strategy to control the temperature. Depending on the
    agri-

    cultural product being grown temperature can affect growth, germination, sprouting,

    ﬂowering, and fruit development. Next, Water vapor is the fundamental issue that
    is

    inﬂuencing the development of products. Due to high humidity, odds of the ailment

    are expanding. Mugginess may affect hydria push, shutting the stomata and hence

    it might let down the procedure of photosynthesis which relies upon the osmosis.

    Moreover, soil water likewise inﬂuences the yield development. The best possible

    water systems and preparations of the product are differed according to the sort,
    age,

    stage, and atmosphere. Some key parameters for water level are pH esteem, dampness

    contains, electric conductivity and the temp of dirt. Furthermore, the Light dependent

    resistor is a photograph conductive sensor [9]. Based on Gaikwad and Galande [10],

    a wireless sensor network (WSN) is an infrastructure comprised of sensing, comput-

    ing and communication elements that allow the administrator to monitor and control

    of the speciﬁed parameters in the network. A typical application of WSN includes

    data collection, monitoring, surveillance and medical telemedicine. It is also
    used in

    the irrigation system, Greenhouses for monitoring and controlling parameters like

    water ﬂow, temp, humidity, moisture, etc. Based on the previous research, the
    type

    of sensor for local information data collection could be seen in Table 1.

    There were many type of sensors that can be used to get local information data

    like temperature sensor (LM35, DHT11, SHT75, SHT-3x DIS), humidity sensor

    (P-Hs-220, DHT11, HH10D, CMOS chip, SHT-3x DIS), Soil sensor (SN-M114,

    10HS, DHT11), Water-level sensor (pH measurement sensor), and Light Dependent

    Resistor. This research proposed a system model that could be seen in Fig. 3.

    Figure 3 shows the system model on local data information to collect data from
    the

    various crop (Potato, Onion, Sugar Beet, Tomato, Hay, Citrus, Grape, and Sugarcane,

    etc.). First, the process starts with sensors detection such as water level, temperature,

    humidity, soil moisture, andlight. Thedatawill collect, process, andsaveondatabase.

    The next step, the data will be processed and create a decision model (for example

    Decision tree and Markov). Furthermore, Decision tree is an efﬁcient tool in machine

    learning for classiﬁcation problems. The decision tree is based on a hierarchical

    decision scheme or a tree like structure. Each node of the decision tree structure

    makes a binary decision that separates either one class or some of the classes
    from

    the remaining classes. The processing is generally carried out by moving down
    the

    tree until the leaf node is reached. This is known as a top–down approach. Moreover,

    this analysis will help the farmer to monitor his crop real time. The system could
    give

    warning and alarm if something happened in the ﬁeld as the change of temperature

    and humidity, so the farmer could make an action to solve this problem quickly,
    for

    instance, automation irrigation. The decision model analysis can help the farmers

    maximize their proﬁt margin by providing predictions on crops that will give the

    maximum output in a particular area and in the future.

    Case Study

    Chavan and Karande [12] focuses on ﬁeld monitoring using IoT devices which would

    provide real-time soil moisture, humidity, and temperature of the ﬁeld to the
    farmers.

    An Arduino Microcontroller board with soil, temperature and humidity sensors is

    used to collect the data from the ﬁled on the ﬂy from a remote ﬁeld. The sensors

    are deployed in the wheat crop for data capturing. The results are carried out
    and

    analyzed in the form of temperature, moisture and humidity from the wheat crop

    ﬁeld for the invocating alarm to the farmer when required.

    Figure 4 shows that as the temperature raises the humidity decreases alarmingly.

    Near 110 days the humidity falls to around 35. This again can be a trigger an
    alarm

    to the farmer to water the ﬁelds. Since the system can be on auto mode, the pump

    could start on its own. Moreover, the other case study describes wireless monitoring

    of soil moisture, temperature and humidity using Zigbee in Agriculture [13]. This

    38

    research concludes Zigbee-based agriculture monitoring system serves as a reliable

    and efﬁcient system for monitoring agricultural parameters. The corrective action

    can be taken. Wireless monitoring of ﬁeld not only allows the user to reduce the

    human power, but it also allows the user to see accurate changes in it. It is
    cheaper

    and consumes less power. Nirmal Kumar et al. [17], presented a real-time paddy

    crop ﬁeld monitoring using Zigbee Network. This paper proposed an idea about

    monitoring the crop ﬁeld area without human interaction. Besides, this research
    use

    four Zigbee nodes to form a Zigbee network. Temperature sensor and pressure sensor

    were connected to two Zigbee devices via microcontroller and humidity sensor was

    connected to another Zigbee via a microcontroller. The result of the experiment
    can

    be seen in Table 2 and Fig. 3.

    The graph on Fig. 5 describes the temperature and humidity readings when imple-

    mented in real-time environment. The result shows that the temperature and humidity

    is a varying quantity in the paddy crop ﬁeld area. A farmer can use this data
    to make

    decision support in the future to improve their productivity. For examples, Veenad-

    hari et al. [18] focused on decision tree to evaluate the effect of climatic factors
    on

    the soybean crop yield. The study implement the potential use of this process
    for

    extracting useful information from existing secondary data of climatic factors.
    The

    decision trees suggested there exists a correlation between climatic factors and
    soy-

    bean crop productivity and these variables inﬂuence on the soybean crop productivity

    were conﬁrmed from the rule accuracy. The decision tree analysis indicated that
    the

    productivity of soybean crop was mostly inﬂuenced by Relative humidity followed

    by temperature and rainfall. Figure 6 shows decision tree for inﬂuence of climatic

    factors on soybean yield.

    Based on Shakoor et al. [19], in most of the cases, Decision Tree Learning-ID3

    algorithm gives a less value for percentage error than the KKNR algorithm without

    omitting the outliers of the dataset. The research suggests area based beneﬁcial
    crop

    rank before the cultivation process. The prediction is based on analyzing a static
    set

    of data using Supervised Machine Learning techniques (Decision Tree Learning-ID3

    and K Nearest Neighbors Regression algorithms). ID3 uses the decision tree table

    which consists of the ranges of the rainfall, temperature and yield data. The
    goal

    of this research is to help the farmers maximize their proﬁt margin by providing

    predictions on crops that will give the maximum output in a particular area. The

    dataset contains of details on crops’ yield per hectare, average of minimum and

    maximum temperature, rainfall, year range, and region. Analyzing these data, the

    algorithms give the result which predicts the preferred proﬁtable output. For
    the

    accuracyoftheprediction,dataofpasttwelveyearsisbeingusedbythealgorithmsfor

    the purpose of learning and result analysis. Example of decision tree implementation

    could be seen on Fig. 7.

    In [20], a WSN-based outlier detection and irrigation management system is

    developed to assist farmers in handling crop irrigation schedules. The proposed

    system collects environmental and soil-related data through sensor nodes that
    are

    examined by the outlier detection module. The proposed noise detection algorithm

    is implementedtoimprovethesystem‘s accuracy. Afterward, DSSfurther examines it

    to identify water deﬁcient sites in agricultural ﬁelds. After identiﬁcation, the
    alarming

    unit is activated, and text messages are sent over a local area network (LAN)
    to inform

    farmers. The other research use a wireless decision support system for the optimized

    management of the irrigation in agriculture has been presented. The properties
    of

    the WSAN technology have been exploited to acquire heterogeneous environmental

    parameters and to control the functioning of the irrigation system. The FL-based

    methodology has been designed and calibrated according to the indications of the

    farmers in order to mimic the human experience and to properly understand the

    status of the crop [21]. Monitoring based on IoT is a reliable and fast system
    which

    41

    helps farmers in monitoring the ﬁelds effectively. This helps them to take corrective

    measure for the protection and better yield of the crop.

    Conclusion and Future Work

    In this paper, we aim that the internet of things can be used to collect local
    information

    data on precision agriculture. The farmer could get the real-time data for monitoring

    his ﬁeld. The important local information data are water level, temperature, humidity,

    soil moisture, and light from the various crop (Potato, Onion, Sugar Beet, Tomato,

    Hay, Citrus, Grape, and Sugarcane, etc.). There are many types of sensors could

    be used to get the important data in the agriculture ﬁeld in Table 1. The decision

    model analysis, decision tree can help the farmers maximize their proﬁt margin
    by

    providing predictions on crops that will give the maximum output in a particular
    area

    and the algorithms give the result which predicts the preferred proﬁtable output.
    In

    the future, the monitoring system could be connected and information exchanged

    via sensors is available to the farmer on the website and desktop application
    and

    mobile phones. Furthermore, a farmer can use this data to make intelligent decisions

    for planting, fertilizing, and harvesting crops. Finally, using this technology,
    farmers

    can effectively use the information to achieve higher yields and therefore earn
    higher

    proﬁts.

    \ \n1.1. A worldwide dilemma of food security\nFood security is a multifaceted\
    \ notion that aims to eliminate hunger by \nassuring a steady supply of nutritious\
    \ food. It is defined by a four-pillar para-\ndigm, each of which is necessary\
    \ to provide food security [1]. Food security \nis becoming a severe global concern\
    \ as a result of anthropogenic factors such \nas rapid population expansion, urbanization,\
    \ industrialization, farmland loss, \nfreshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation.\
    \ This is due to the fact that \n424\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthese factors have a direct impact on the agricultural industry,\
    \ which is the \nworld’s principal source of agri-food production. By 2050, it\
    \ is expected that \nthe global population will rise from 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion,\
    \ urban population \nwill rise by 66 percent, arable land will decline by approximately\
    \ 50 million \nhectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO 2 – promote crop disease\
    \ and \npest growth) will rise by 50 percent, agri-food production will decline\
    \ by 20%, \nand food demand will rise by 59 to 98 percent, posing an imminent\
    \ threat. To \nmeet rising food demands, agricultural practitioners around the\
    \ world will need \nto increase crop and livestock production to maximize agricultural\
    \ output. The \nemphasis of this review paper is crop farming, which includes\
    \ the production \nof both food and cash crops. \nA typical agri-food value chain\
    \ displaying three key stages in the production \nof agricultural products: pre-field\
    \ (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and \nharvesting stage), and post-field\
    \ (post-harvesting stage). All of the stages are \nimportant in the value chain,\
    \ but in this examination, we will focus on the sec-\nond stage, in-field, which\
    \ includes numerous crop-growing operations such as \nploughing, sowing, spraying,\
    \ and harvesting, among others. Traditional agricul-\ntural approaches are now\
    \ used in these procedures, which are labor-intensive, \nrequire arable land,\
    \ time, and a significant quantity of water (for irrigation), and \nmake it difficult\
    \ to produce enough food [5]. A part of the problem is also due \nto the improper\
    \ application of pesticides and herbicides, as well as the misuse \nof available\
    \ technologies, both of which hurt crops and ultimately result in \nagricultural\
    \ waste [6]. These problems can be solved by combining advanced \ntechnologies\
    \ and computer-based applications that ensure higher crop yields, \nless water\
    \ use, better pesticide/herbicide use, and improved crop quality. This \nis where\
    \ the concept of smart agriculture comes into play.\n1.2. Smart Agriculture\n\
    Every industry is being revolutionized and reshaped by Industry 4.0. It’s a \n\
    strategic initiative that combines emerging disruptive digital technologies like\
    \ \nthe Internet of Things (IoT), big data and analytics (BDA), system integration\
    \ \n(SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous robotic systems (ARS),\
    \ \naugmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless sensor networks\
    \ \n(WSN), cyber-physical systems (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive manu-\n\
    facturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. \nAgriculture 4.0,\
    \ also known as smart agriculture, smart farming or digital \nfarming [7], is\
    \ the next phase of industrial agriculture, fueled by the integra-\ntion of these\
    \ technologies in agriculture. Farmers can use smart agriculture to \naddress\
    \ a variety of agricultural food production concerns such as farm pro-\n425\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nductivity,\
    \ environmental impact, food security, crop losses, and sustainability. \nFarmers,\
    \ for example, can connect to farms remotely, regardless of location \nor time,\
    \ using IoT-enabled equipment based on WSNs to monitor and control \nfarm operations.\
    \ Drones outfitted with hyper spectral cameras can collect data \nfrom a variety\
    \ of sources on farmlands, while autonomous robots can assist \nor complete repetitive\
    \ chores on farms. Data analytics techniques can be used \nto examine the obtained\
    \ data, and computer programs can be utilized to help \nfarmers make decisions.\n\
    Similarly, smart agriculture can monitor and analyze a wide range of pa-\nrameters\
    \ related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production status, \nwater\
    \ management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides and pes-\nticides,\
    \ and controlled environment agriculture to increase crop yields, reduce \ncosts,\
    \ improve product quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of \nmodern\
    \ systems [8].\n1.3. Research Motivation and Contribution \nThe reason for writing\
    \ this assessment is that digital technologies in agri-\ncultural systems provide\
    \ new strategic solutions for increasing farm output ef-\nficiency and effectiveness.\
    \ Furthermore, digital transformation paves the door \nfor modern farming technologies\
    \ like vertical farming (hydroponics, aquapon-\nics, and aeroponics) to be used,\
    \ which has the potential to solve food security \nissues. However, there are\
    \ a number of issues and restrictions connected with \nthis change from a technological,\
    \ socioeconomic, and management perspective \nthat must be overcome in order to\
    \ fully realise the potential of agricultural 4.0 \n[9].A number of publications\
    \ [9–18] have examined developing trends in the \ndevelopment of agriculture 4.0\
    \ by offering concise information on essential \nuses, benefits, and research\
    \ problems of smart farming. These studies’ research \nfocuses on either explaining\
    \ more general technical aspects while focusing on \nonly one or a few digital\
    \ technologies, or improving agricultural supply chain \nperformance, or developing\
    \ an agriculture 4.0 definition, or achieving sustain-\nable agronomy through\
    \ precision agriculture, or proposing a smart farming \nframework. Nonetheless,\
    \ these studies do not include an explicit discussion of \nthe tools and techniques\
    \ utilized to construct various systems, as well as their \nmaturity level. There\
    \ are also few studies that look at the consequences of dig-\nital technology\
    \ in modern soilless farms including hydroponics, aquaponics, \nand aeroponics\
    \ (indoor/outdoor). As a result, in order to promote conversation \nin this field,\
    \ it is necessary to examine the emergence of agriculture 4.0 from \nmany angles.\
    \ This research seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of dig-\nital technologies\
    \ used in the second stage of the agricultural production value \n426\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nchain (in-field)\
    \ for various farm types as described in section 1.1. The study’s \nkey theoretical\
    \ contribution is the analysis and dissemination of the tools and \ntechniques\
    \ used, as well as the farm type, maturity level of produced systems, \nand potential\
    \ obstacles or inhibiting factors in agriculture 4.0 development. Re-\nsearchers\
    \ and agricultural practitioners will benefit from the review’s insights \nin\
    \ future study on agriculture 4.0. \n1.4. Paper organization \nThe following is\
    \ the structure of the paper after the introduction: \nSection 2 discusses the\
    \ methodology used to collect relevant literature; Sec-\ntion 3 then presents\
    \ the statistical results obtained after a general analysis of the \nselected\
    \ research studies; Section 4 then provides a detailed overview of the \ncore\
    \ technologies used in agricultural digitization; Section 5 then highlights the\
    \ \ntechnical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital integration in agriculture;\
    \ \nand finally, Section 6 outlines a discussion of the research questions.\n\
    2. Research Methodology \nA systematic literature review (SLR) is a technique\
    \ for organizing and iden-\ntifying research related to a specific topic [19].\
    \ SLR is used in this study to look \ninto the state of Industry 4.0 technologies\
    \ in the agricultural industry. Cases \nwhere the phrase ‘agricultural’ occurred\
    \ in the title, abstract, or keywords of \nan article with any of the ‘Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies’ described in section 1.2 \nare specifically sought. A review\
    \ procedure is established prior to conducting \nthe SLR to ensure a transparent\
    \ and high-quality research process, which are \nthe features that distinguish\
    \ a systematic literature review [20]. By conducting \nthorough literature searches,\
    \ the review methodology also helps to reduce bias. \nThe creation of the research\
    \ questions, the defining of the search method, and \nthe specification of inclusion\
    \ and exclusion criteria are all part of this process. \nTo conduct SLR, this\
    \ paper uses a recommended reporting item for system-\natic reviews and meta-analysis\
    \ (PRISMA) approach. PRISMA is a minimum \ncollection of items based on evidence\
    \ that is used to guide the construction of \nsystematic literature reviews and\
    \ other meta-analyses [19].\n2.1. Review Protocol \nBefore doing the bibliographic\
    \ analysis, a review methodology is estab-\nlished to identify, analyze, and interpret\
    \ data that are relevant to the research \nfocus. To begin, research questions\
    \ are developed in order to provide insight \ninto the study of published studies\
    \ in the research area of interest from many \nperspectives. These are the questions\
    \ that must be addressed in the research. The \nsearch strategy is then created,\
    \ which aids in the identification of appropriate \n427\nSiberian Journal of Life\
    \ Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nkeywords later in the search equation,\
    \ as well as the identification of relevant \ninformation sources, such as academic\
    \ databases and search engines that allow \naccess to vast amounts of digital\
    \ documentation. Science Direct, Scopus, and \nIEEE Xplore are three online research\
    \ archives that are utilized to find relevant \nstudies. Finally, boundaries are\
    \ created by predefining inclusion and exclusion \ncriteria for further inquiry\
    \ and content assessments of selected articles in order \nto narrow the search\
    \ results of each database.\n2.2. Evaluation Process \nIdentification, screening,\
    \ eligibility, and inclusion are the four stages of the \nliterature search process\
    \ that are evaluated. Consolidation is done for the re-\nmoval of duplicate items\
    \ in the identification step after initial metadata filtering \nby the use of\
    \ search expressions. After this phase, the number of publications is \nreduced.\
    \ The titles and abstracts of the papers are reviewed during the screening \n\
    stage, and the most relevant publications are chosen for integral reading. In\
    \ the \nthird stage, full-text screening of these papers is done to ensure that\
    \ they are \neligible for this paper’s goal.\n2.3. Threats to Validity \n(i) SLR\
    \ replication: Because the current search is confined to only three on-\nline\
    \ repositories, the provided SLR is vulnerable to risks to validity. \nAdditional\
    \ sources could potentially lead to the discovery of more pub-\nlications. Validity\
    \ can be regarded satisfactorily addressed because the SLR \nprocess is clearly\
    \ defined in sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2. However, it is possible \nthat slightly\
    \ different publications will be found if this SLR is replicated. This \nvariation\
    \ could be due to various personal choices made throughout the PRIS-\nMA screening\
    \ and eligibility phases, but it’s highly improbable that the overall \nresults\
    \ would alter.\n(ii)The search string used to discover the relevant papers covers\
    \ the entire \nspectrum of SLR; however it’s possible that some important studies\
    \ were over-\nlooked. More research may be found if more keywords and synonyms\
    \ in the \nsearch are included.\n3. Digitization Trends in Agriculture \nAlthough\
    \ the agriculture business is making significant progress in terms \nof digital\
    \ technology adoption, it is still lagging behind other industries such \nas healthcare,\
    \ manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, and others [15]. The \ncrop farming\
    \ method considered while designing an application or framework \nis referred\
    \ to as the farm type. The farming method, for example, can be soil-\nbased or\
    \ soilless. Open-air fields (conventional outdoor agricultural farms) and \n428\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ngreenhouse\
    \ farms are included in the soil-based farming category (indoor). The \nsoilless\
    \ farming category, on the other hand, includes modern farming tech-\nniques such\
    \ as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor). In \nthe recent\
    \ decade, autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned guided \nvehicles and\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), the internet of things, and \nmachine learning\
    \ appear to be the most commonly used technology in agricul-\nture. Agriculture’s\
    \ growing sectors include big data, wireless sensor networks, \ncyber-physical\
    \ systems, and digital twins. Furthermore, in contrast to indoor \nfarms, open\
    \ air farms are the most usually examined in research investigations. \nFew publications\
    \ exist for soilless farming systems (aquaponics, aeroponics, \nand hydroponics),\
    \ implying that these modern farming practices are still in \ntheir infancy. Similarly,\
    \ each use case’s services are identified and classified \ninto nine service categories:\
    \ I crop management, CM (estimation/harvesting \nperiod and seed plantation/prediction\
    \ of crop yield/ growth rate/harvesting/ \npollination/ spraying (fertilizer/\
    \ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM \n(fresh weight, green biomass,\
    \ height, length, width, leaf density, piment content \n(chlorophyll), and phytochemical\
    \ composition); iii) water and environmental \nmanagement, WEM (monitoring and\
    \ control of flow rate, water level, water \nquality (nutrients), temperature,\
    \ humidity, CO2, and weather forecasts, among \nother things); iv) irrigation\
    \ management, IM (water stress detection and sched-\nuling); v) farm management,\
    \ FM (monitoring of farm operations, tracking and \ncounting products, determining\
    \ production efficiency, financial analysis, energy \nconsumption analysis, technology\
    \ integration, and decision-making);\nPDM (pest and disease management) is a term\
    \ used to describe the man-\nagement of pests and diseases (pest identification\
    \ and disease detection) SM \n(Soil Management) vii) (moisture content, soil nutrients,\
    \ fertilizer needs and \napplication) WUVM (weed/unknown vegetation mapping, classification,\
    \ and \npesticide application) viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management FDC\
    \ \n(fruit detection and counting), and ix) \nThe role of various digital technologies\
    \ in smart farming is depicted in \nthese categories. Crop management characteristics\
    \ such as crop yield prediction, \ngrowth rate estimation, and harvesting period\
    \ evaluation are the most 4.0 in the \nprevious decade, whereas soil management,\
    \ fruit identification and counting, \nand crop quality management receive very\
    \ less attention. The European Union’s \nTRL scale, which divides system maturity\
    \ into three generic categories [21], is \nused to assess the technology readiness\
    \ level (TRL) of all use cases. The first \nlevel is conceptual, which corresponds\
    \ to European TRL 1–2 (use case is in \nconcept phase), the second level is prototype,\
    \ which corresponds to Europe-\n429\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nan TRL 3–6 (use case is functional even without all planned\
    \ features), and the \nthird level is deployed, which corresponds to European\
    \ TRL 7–9. (Use case \nis mature with all the possible functions). Each use case’s\
    \ TRL was produced \nin a few experiments. It has been noticed that smart agricultural\
    \ systems have \nmade little progress from the concept and prototype stages to\
    \ the commercial \nstage. The majority of use cases, for example, are still in\
    \ the prototype stage.\n4. Agriculture 4.0 enabling technologies \n4.1. Internet\
    \ of Things driven agricultural systems \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a network\
    \ of interconnected computing de-\nvices, sensors, appliances, and machines that\
    \ are all connected to the internet \nand have their own unique identities and\
    \ capacities for remote sensing and \nmonitoring [21]. Network layer (communication),\
    \ perception layer (hardware \ndevices), , middleware layer (device management\
    \ and interoperability), service \nlayer (cloud computing), application layer\
    \ (data integration and analytics), and \nend-user layer are the six layers of\
    \ the IoT reference architecture (user-inter-\nface). IoT devices on the physical\
    \ layer in the agricultural domain collect data \non environmental and crop characteristics\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, pH \nvalue, water level, leaf colour, fresh leaf\
    \ weight, and so on. The network layer is \nresponsible for transmitting this\
    \ information, and its architecture is determined \nby the field size, farm location,\
    \ and type of farming method. ZigBee, LoRa, and \nSigfox, for example, are widely\
    \ utilized and employed in outdoor fields because \nthey are less expensive, have\
    \ low energy consumption, and have a long trans-\nmission range [22, 23]. Bluetooth,\
    \ despite being a secure technology, is only \nemployed in indoor farms due to\
    \ its limited transmission range [22]. Due to its \nhigh costs and high energy\
    \ consumption, Wi-Fi is not a promising technology \nfor agricultural applications\
    \ [22]. On the other hand, RFID (radio frequency \nidentification) and NFC (near\
    \ field communication) technologies are increas-\ningly being used in agricultural\
    \ systems for product tracking [24]. For periodic \nmonitoring of environmental\
    \ and soil characteristics, GPRS or mobile commu-\nnication technology (2G, 3G,\
    \ and 4G) is utilized. Furthermore, HTTP, WWW, \nand SMTP are the most commonly\
    \ utilized communication protocols in agri-\ncultural contexts. Similarly, middleware\
    \ HYDRA and SMEPP are commonly \nused in agricultural systems to enable interoperability\
    \ and system security for \ntheir context-aware functionalities [25]. \nCloud\
    \ computing approaches are used in the service layer to store data. \nThis information\
    \ is then used on the application layer to create smart apps that \nfarmers, agriculture\
    \ experts, and supply chain professionals can use to improve \n430\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nfarm monitoring and productivity.\
    \ The use of IoT in agriculture is intended to \nprovide farmers with decision-making\
    \ tools and automation technologies that \nallow them to seamlessly integrate\
    \ knowledge, products, and services in order to \nincrease production, quality,\
    \ and profit. A slew of research have been conduct-\ned and presented on the incubation\
    \ of IoT concepts in the agricultural industry. \nThe development of IoT-based\
    \ agricultural systems has addressed a variety of \ntechnological and architectural\
    \ concerns. However, most of these technologies \nare now in the conceptual stage\
    \ or in prototype form (not commercial). Farm \nmanagement, irrigation control,\
    \ crop development, health monitoring, and dis-\nease detection are all priorities.\
    \ \nSome of these studies also explained how IoT is being used in current ag-\n\
    ricultural systems like vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics, hydro-\n\
    ponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Furthermore, the\
    \ \nmajority of studies have been focused on a single issue.\n4.2. Wireless sensor\
    \ networks in agriculture \nA wireless sensor network (WSN) is a technology that\
    \ is utilized in an Inter-\nnet of Things (IoT) system. It is defined as a collection\
    \ of spatially distributed \nsensors for monitoring environmental physical conditions,\
    \ temporarily storing \nobtained data, and transferring the information to a central\
    \ point [22]. A wire-\nless sensor network (WSN) for smart farming is made up\
    \ of multiple sensor \nnodes connected by a wireless connection module. These\
    \ nodes have a variety \nof skills that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,\
    \ and self-diagnose (for \nexample, processing, trans- mission, and feeling).\
    \ There are various varieties of \nWSNs, which are classified based on the environment\
    \ in which they are used. \nTWSNs (terrestrial wireless sensor networks), WUSNs\
    \ (wireless underground \nsensor networks), UWSNs (underwater wireless sensor\
    \ networks), WMSNs \n(wireless multimedia sensor networks), and MWSNs (mobile\
    \ wireless sensor \nnetworks) are a few examples [26]. TWSN and UWSN are commonly\
    \ utilized \nin agricultural applications. TWSN nodes are sensors that collect\
    \ data from \nthe environment and are located above ground. The second type of\
    \ WSN is \nWUSNs, which are WSNs with sensor nodes embedded in the soil. Lower\
    \ fre-\nquencies easily enter the soil in this environment, whereas higher frequencies\
    \ \nare severely attenuated [27]. Because of the limited communication radius,\
    \ the \nnetwork requires a larger number of nodes to cover a big area. Many research\
    \ \npublications on the use of WSN for various outdoor and indoor farm applica-\n\
    tions, such as irrigation management, water quality testing, and environmental\
    \ \nmonitoring, are accessible in the literature. The goal of these experiments\
    \ was \nto create WSN architectures that were simple, low-cost, energy-efficient,\
    \ and \n431\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    scalable. However, several aspects of WSNs, such as minimum maintenance, \nrobust\
    \ and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability, require more study. \n\
    4.3. Cloud computing in agriculture \nCloud computing (CC) is defined as a model\
    \ for enabling convenient, ubiq-\nuitous, on-demand network access to a shared\
    \ pool of configurable computing \nresources (e.g., networks, servers, storage,\
    \ applications, and services) that can \nbe rapidly provisioned and released with\
    \ minimal management effort or ser-\nvice provider interaction, according to the\
    \ National Institute of Standards and \nTechnologies (NIST) [28]. The datacenter\
    \ (hardware), infrastructure, platform, \nand application layers make up the primary\
    \ architecture of CC [29]. Each of \nthese layers corresponds to one of three\
    \ cloud service models: SaaS (software \nas a service), PaaS (platform as a service),\
    \ and IaaS (infrastructure as a service) \n(IaaS). In the agriculture sector,\
    \ cloud computing has gotten a lot of attention in \nthe last decade because it\
    \ provides: 1) low-cost storage for data collected from \nvarious domains via\
    \ WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale \ncomputer systems\
    \ to make intelligent decisions by converting raw data into \nusable knowledge,\
    \ and 3) a secure platform for developing agricultural based \nIoT applications\
    \ [30]. \nCC is used to develop various agricultural applications in conjunction\
    \ with \nIoT and WSN. CC technology is also utilized to develop operational farm\
    \ man-\nagement systems (FMSs) that help farmers and farm managers monitor farm\
    \ \nactivities more efficiently. The traceability of agri-product quality is another\
    \ \narea of interest that is being investigated in global research [31]. However,\
    \ only \npreliminary research has been done to see if traceability complies with\
    \ food \nsafety and quality criteria. The usage of cloud-based agricultural systems\
    \ has \nthe potential to address issues such as rising food demand, pollution\
    \ from pes-\nticides and fertilizers, and the safety of agricultural products.\
    \ These FMSs, on \nthe other hand, lack the flexibility to offer run-time customization\
    \ in response \nto specific farmer needs. Furthermore, because most farm data\
    \ is fragmented \nand distributed, recording farm operations accurately in existing\
    \ FMSs systems \nis problematic [32].\n4.4. Edge/fog computing in agriculture\
    \ \nThe rapid expansion of IoT has resulted in an explosion of sensors and smart\
    \ \ndevices, creating massive amounts of data. The processing and analysis of\
    \ such a \nlarge volume of data in real time is difficult since it puts a strain\
    \ on the cloud serv-\ner and slows response times. When dealing with such a massive\
    \ data set, a cloud \nserver alone will not be able to offer real-time responses.\
    \ Furthermore, because \nIoT applications require a constant exchange of information\
    \ between devices and \n432\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthe cloud, they are susceptible to network latency, making\
    \ CC unsuitable for these \napplications [23]. The introduction of the edge computing\
    \ idea has the potential \nto overcome the CC issues. This novel computing architecture\
    \ places computa-\ntional and storage resources (such as cloudlets or fog nodes)\
    \ closer to data sources \nlike mobile devices and sensors at the network’s edge.\
    \ This allows for real-time \nanalytics while maintaining data security on the\
    \ device [23]. Although edge com-\nputing has exciting potential for smart agriculture,\
    \ its applications in agricultural \nsystems are still in their infancy. As a\
    \ result, there are limited research studies in \nthis field. The majority of\
    \ the edge computing-based agricultural systems covered \nin these papers are\
    \ prototypes that solve a small number of challenges across a \nvariety of agricultural\
    \ disciplines. Interoperability and scalability issues haven’t \ngotten enough\
    \ attention so yet. Agricultural robots combine emerging technolo-\ngies such\
    \ as computer vision; wireless sensor networks (WSNs), satellite navi-\ngation\
    \ systems (GPS), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing (CC), and the \n\
    Internet of Things (IoT) to help farmers improve productivity and quality of ag-\n\
    ricultural products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile or fixed [33]. Mobile\
    \ \nAARS can move around the working field. Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) \n\
    and unidentified aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the two types of mobile AARSs, as\
    \ \ndiscussed in the following sections. \n4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in\
    \ agriculture\nUnmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that work\
    \ with-\nout the use of a human operator on the ground. A platform for locomotive\
    \ ap-\nparatus and manipulator, navigation sensors, a supervisory control system,\
    \ an \ninterface for the control system, communication links for information exchange\
    \ \nbetween devices, and system architecture for integration between hardware\
    \ and \nsoftware agents are the main components of UGVs [34]. The control architec-\n\
    ture of a UGV can be remote-operated (controlled via an interface by a human \n\
    operator) or totally autonomous (operated without the use of a human control-\n\
    ler using artificial intelligence technology) [34]. Locomotive systems, likewise,\
    \ \ncan be based on wheels, tracks, or legs [34]. Legged robots are uncommon in\
    \ \nagriculture, despite their great terrain flexibility, inherent Omni directionality,\
    \ \nand soil protection. These robots, however, offer a disruptive locomotion\
    \ mech-\nanism for smart farms when paired with wheels (wheel-legged robots).\
    \ UGVs \nshould meet specific requirements, such as small size, maneuverability,\
    \ resil-\nience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety, in addition\
    \ to the nec-\nessary features for infield operations, in order to improve crop\
    \ yields and farm \nproductivity. A 4WD locomotive system is used in the majority\
    \ of agricultural \nrobotic systems due to its ease of manufacture and control.\
    \ \n433\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    The disadvantage of 4WD is that terrains with stone elements and/or voids \nhave\
    \ a significant impact on the wheels [34]. As a result, other mechanisms, \nsuch\
    \ as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems, should be investigated. \nAlthough\
    \ some robots include computer vision systems, most of these robots \nare designed\
    \ with a low-cost computer vision system, such as traditional RGB \ncameras, due\
    \ to the difficulties of establishing an accurate and dependable sys-\ntem that\
    \ can replace manual labour. Furthermore, the majority of the systems \nmentioned\
    \ above are still in the research phase, with no large-scale commer-\ncial application.\n\
    4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture \nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\
    \ sometimes known as aerial robots, are \nplanes that do not have a human pilot\
    \ on board. There are many different types \nof UAVs [35] depending on the technology\
    \ used to fly (wing structure) and the \nlevel of autonomy. Fixed-wing (planes),\
    \ single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid system \n(vertical takeoff and landing), and\
    \ multi-rotor UAVs are examples of wing types \n(drone). Drones (multi-rotor technology),\
    \ which are raised and driven by four \n(quad-rotor) or six (hex-rotor) rotors,\
    \ have grown in popularity in the agricul-\nture sector because to their mechanical\
    \ simplicity in comparison to helicopters, \nwhich rely on a much more complex\
    \ plate control mechanism [36]. Similarly, \nUAVs can be tele-operated or tele-commanded,\
    \ depending on their autonomy \nlevel, with the pilot providing references to\
    \ each actuator of the aircraft to con-\ntrol it in the same way that an onboard\
    \ pilot would, or tele-commanded with the \naircraft relying on an automatic controller\
    \ on board to maintain a stable flight \n[35]. Agricultural UAVs with the right\
    \ sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, \nand hyper spectral cameras, for\
    \ example) can collect data (vegetation, leaf area, \nand reflectance indexes)\
    \ from their fields to monitor dynamic changes in crops \nthat aren’t visible\
    \ from the ground [37]. Farmers can deduce information about \ncrop illnesses,\
    \ nutrient deficits, water level, and other agricultural growth char-\nacteristics\
    \ using this data. Farmers might plan possible cures using this knowl-\nedge (irrigation,\
    \ fertilization, weed control, etc.). \nThe majority of the systems mentioned\
    \ above are still in the research stage, \nwith no large-scale commercial use.\
    \ Other issues with these UAVs include bat-\ntery life and flight time [35]. Lithium-ion\
    \ batteries are currently in use because \ntheir capacity exceeds that of conventional\
    \ batteries. \nHowever, increasing the battery capacity increases the weight of\
    \ the drone, \nand research is currently underway to overcome this issue. \nFurthermore,\
    \ existing UAVs have complicated user interfaces that can only \nbe used by experts\
    \ to accomplish agricultural chores. People who are elderly \n434\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nor unfamiliar with UAV\
    \ technology will be able to control it more readily if \nthe user interface is\
    \ improved and made more human-centered with multimod-\nal feedback. \n4.6. Big\
    \ data and analytics in agriculture \nRapid advancements in IoT and CC technologies\
    \ have massively expanded \nthe amount of data available. Textual content (structured,\
    \ semi-structured, and un-\nstructured) and multimedia content (e.g., videos,\
    \ photos, and audio) are included \nin this data, also known as Big Data (BD)\
    \ [38]. Big data analytics is the practice \nof analyzing large amounts of data\
    \ to find hidden patterns, unknown relationships, \nmarket trends, client preferences,\
    \ and other important information (BDA). Big \ndata is usually classified into\
    \ five dimensions, each of which is represented by a V. \nThe concept of BD-driven\
    \ smart agriculture is very new, but its trend is \ngood because it has the potential\
    \ to make a dramatic change in the food supply \nchain and boost food security\
    \ through higher productivity. Agricultural big data \nis typically generated\
    \ from a variety of sources in agriculture, including ground \nsensors, aerial\
    \ vehicles, and ground vehicles equipped with special cameras and \nsensors; governmental\
    \ bodies in the form of reports and regulations; private \norganizations through\
    \ online web services; farmers in the form of knowledge \ngained through surveys;\
    \ and social media [39]. Depending on the agricultural \ndomain, the data can\
    \ be environmental (weather, climate, moisture level, etc.), \nbiological (plant\
    \ disease), or geospatial, and it comes in a variety of volumes, \nspeeds, and\
    \ formats [40]. The information is acquired and stored in a computer \ndatabase,\
    \ where it is analyzed using computer algorithms for seed characteris-\ntics,\
    \ weather patterns, soil attributes (such as pH or nutrient content), marketing\
    \ \nand trade management, consumer behaviour, and inventory management. In \n\
    agriculture, a range of strategies and tools are used to examine large data. The\
    \ \nmost often employed techniques include machine learning, cloud-based plat-\n\
    forms, and modelling and simulation. Machine learning technologies are used \n\
    to solve problems like prediction, clustering, and classification, while cloud\
    \ \nplatforms are utilized for large-scale data storage, preprocessing, and visual-\n\
    ization. There are still numerous potential areas where BDA can be used to \n\
    address various agricultural concerns that are not well covered in existing lit-\n\
    erature. For example, data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical farming \n\
    systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and indoor\
    \ \nfarms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to help farmers design\
    \ \nindoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers to help them\
    \ make \ndecisions about the physical ecosystem’s sustainability. Finally, the\
    \ majority of \nsystems are still in the prototype stage.\n435\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n4.7. Artificial intelligence\
    \ in agriculture \nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the study of theories and computer\
    \ systems that \ncan perform activities that need human intelligence, such as\
    \ sensory percep-\ntion and decision-making [41]. AI, particularly in the areas\
    \ of machine learning \n(ML) and deep learning (DL), is seen as one of the primary\
    \ forces driving the \ndigitization of agriculture when combined with CC, IoT,\
    \ and big data. These \ntechnologies have the potential to increase crop production,\
    \ harvesting, pro-\ncessing, and marketing in real time [42]. ML and DL algorithms\
    \ are being used \nto determine various parameters such as weed detection, yield\
    \ prediction, and \ndisease identification in a number of intelligent agricultural\
    \ systems. The fol-\nlowing two sub-sections go through these systems.\n4.7.1.\
    \ Machine learning in agriculture \nsupervised learning (linear regression, regression\
    \ trees, non-linear regres-\nsion, Bayesian linear regression, polynomial regression,\
    \ and support vector \nregression), and unsupervised learning (hierarchal clustering,\
    \ k-means cluster-\ning, neural networks (NN) anomaly detection, principal component\
    \ analysis, \nindependent component analysis, a-priori algorithm, and singular\
    \ value decom-\nposition (SVD)). Weed detection, Crop yield prediction, disease\
    \ and weather \nprediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation ( moisture content,\
    \ type, pH, \ntemperature, etc.), water management, fertilizer amount determination,\
    \ and \nlivestock production and management all use machine learning techniques\
    \ and \nalgorithms [2, 43]. According to the study of these publications, “crop\
    \ yield \nprediction” is an extensively researched area, with the most widely\
    \ utilized ML \napproaches to allow smart farming being linear regression [4],\
    \ neural network \n(NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM)\
    \ [2]. \nThe presented use cases are still in the research phase, and no commercial\
    \ \nuse has been recorded as of yet. Furthermore, AI and machine learning ap-\n\
    proaches are found to be underutilized in greenhouse and indoor vertical farm-\n\
    ing systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are \n\
    only a handful publications that use machine learning techniques. To enable \n\
    digital farming, new methodologies such as federated learning and privacy \npreserving\
    \ methods are being developed in light of the digital transformation’s \ncyber-security\
    \ and data privacy problems [44]. These methods create machine \nlearning models\
    \ from local parameters rather than sharing private data samples, \nreducing security\
    \ concerns.\n4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture \nDeep learning (DL) is an extension\
    \ of classical machine learning (ML) \nbecause extra “depth” (complexity) is added\
    \ to the model, it can accomplish \n436\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ndifficult tasks (predictions and classification)\
    \ extraordinarily well and quick-\nly. DL’s main benefit is feature learning,\
    \ which includes extracting features \n(high-level information) from big datasets\
    \ automatically [45]. Long short term \nmemory (LSTM) networks, convolutional\
    \ neural networks (CNNs), recurrent \nneural (RNN) networks, generative adversarial\
    \ networks (GANs), radial basis \nfunction networks (RBFNs), multilayer perceptron\
    \ (MLPs), feed-forward ar-\ntificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing maps\
    \ (SOMs), deep belief net-\nworks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),\
    \ and autoencoders are \nexamples of deep learning algorithms Various sites [46]\
    \ provide a full overview \nof these methods, popular architectures, and training\
    \ systems. DL algorithms \nare commonly used in agriculture to solve problems\
    \ related to computer vision \napplications that aim to predict key parameters\
    \ such as crop yields, soil mois-\nture content, weather conditions, and crop\
    \ growth conditions; detect diseases, \npests, and weeds; and identify leaf or\
    \ plant species [47]. Computer vision is an \ninterdisciplinary field that has\
    \ exploded in popularity in recent years thanks to \nthe rise of CNNs. It provides\
    \ methods and techniques for accurately process-\ning digital images and allowing\
    \ computers to analyze and comprehend the vi-\nsual world [48]. CNNs, generally\
    \ is known as Convet and its derivatives, are \nthe most widely used deep learning\
    \ algorithms in agricultural applications. \nRegion-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN,\
    \ Faster-RCNN, YOLO, and Mask-\nRCNN are some of the CNN variants, with the first\
    \ four being the most typi-\ncally used to address object detection issues. On\
    \ the other side, Mask-RCNN \nis utilized to overcome instance segmentation issues.\
    \ The reader can find a \nthorough explanation of these algorithms and their applications\
    \ in the exist-\ning bibliography [47]. Other DL approaches have been employed\
    \ in a few re-\nsearch. When it comes to datasets, the majority of deep learning\
    \ models are \ntrained on photographs, with only a few trained on sensor data\
    \ collected in the \nfield. This demonstrates that DL can be used on a wide range\
    \ of datasets. It’s \nalso worth noting that the majority of the research is focused\
    \ on outdoor farms, \nwith next-generation farms (environment-controlled) receiving\
    \ less attention. \nThough digital farming has the potential to be enabled by\
    \ DL, most systems \nare still in the prototype stage. Furthermore, the additional\
    \ obstacles created \nby cyber-security and privacy concerns necessitate the improvement\
    \ of current \ndeep learning and computer vision technologies.\n4.8. Agricultural\
    \ decision support systems \nA decision support system (DSS) is a smart system\
    \ that assists stakehold-\ners and potential users in making decisions in response\
    \ to specific needs and \nchallenges by offering operational responses based on\
    \ meaningful informa-\n437\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\ntion retrieved from raw data, documents, personal knowledge,\
    \ and/or models \n[49]. Data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven,\
    \ and \nknowledge-driven DSS are all possibilities. The following source [50]\
    \ lists the \nkey features of these DSSs. The volume of farming data has exploded\
    \ as a re-\nsult of the advent of agriculture 4.0. Platforms like agricultural\
    \ decision support \nsystems (ADSS) are necessary to convert this heterogeneous\
    \ data into practical \nknowledge in order to make evidence-based and precise\
    \ judgments about farm \nmanagement and facility layout [51]. ADSSs have gotten\
    \ a lot of interest in the \nagriculture industry over the last few years. A variety\
    \ of agricultural concerns, \nsuch as farm management, water management, and environmental\
    \ management, \nhave been addressed by a number of ADSSs. Most ADSSs have been\
    \ found \nto ignore expert knowledge, which is extremely useful since it enables\
    \ for the \nconstruction of systems that are tailored to the demands of the users.\
    \ Complex \nGUIs, insufficient re-planning components, a lack of prediction and\
    \ forecasting \nabilities, and a lack of ability to adjust to unpredictable and\
    \ dynamic elements \nare some of the other identified faults with some of these\
    \ ADDSs. It’s also worth \nnoting that all of the ADSSs are for outside agriculture\
    \ systems and are still in \ndevelopment. In comparison, the use of ADSS in indoor\
    \ soilless agriculture is \ncurrently underutilized.\n4.9. Agricultural cyber-physical\
    \ systems \nA cyber-physical system (CPS) is an automated distributed system that\
    \ inte-\ngrates physical processes with communication networks and computing infra-\n\
    structures [52], and it is one of the key technologies of Industry 4.0. There\
    \ are \nthree standard CPS reference architecture models: 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA,\
    \ \nwhich may be found in full at the following source [53]. Among these, the\
    \ 5C \nis a well-known and widely used reference model. CPS takes advantage of\
    \ a \nnumber of existing technologies, including agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented\
    \ \nreality, big data, and machine learning (ML) [54]. Scalability, flexibility,\
    \ au-\ntonomy, reliability, resilience, safety, and security are all improved\
    \ as a result \nof its adoption.\nOne of the most difficult domains that can benefit\
    \ from CPS technology is \nagriculture. Agricultural cyber-physical systems (ACPSs)\
    \ combine advanced \nelectronic technology with agricultural infrastructure to\
    \ create integrated farm \nmanagement systems that interact with the physical\
    \ environment to keep crops \ngrowing at their best [55]. ACPSs collect high-accuracy\
    \ data regarding climate, \nsoil, and crops and utilize it to manage watering,\
    \ humidity, and plant health, \namong other things. For the management of various\
    \ services, a range of ACPSs \nhave been created; however, most of these systems\
    \ are still in the prototype and \n438\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nconceptual stages. Furthermore, the majority\
    \ of studies are for outdoor farms, \nwith only a few publications published on\
    \ soil-based greenhouse systems. There \nhas been no research on indoor soilless\
    \ agricultural methods. Since of its pro-\nspective applications in a variety\
    \ of fields, ACPSs have sparked a lot of academ-\nic interest; nevertheless, deploying\
    \ CPS models in real-world applications is \nstill a difficulty because it requires\
    \ the right hardware and software [56]. When \ndesigning ACPSs, special emphasis\
    \ should be paid to autonomy, robustness, and \nresilience in order to deal with\
    \ the unpredictable nature of the environment and \nthe unknown characteristics\
    \ of agricultural facilities. ACPSs are influenced by \na variety of factors,\
    \ including humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data.. ACPSs \nmust be properly\
    \ and extensively developed to provide a seamless operation \nwhile avoiding conflicts,\
    \ errors, and disturbances.\n4.10. Digital twins in agriculture \nA digital twin\
    \ (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical) \nobject that mimics\
    \ its behaviours and states across multiple stages of the ob-\nject’s lifecycle\
    \ by combining real-world data, simulation, and machine learning \nmodels with\
    \ data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning \n[57]. The\
    \ physical and virtual entities, the physical and virtual environments, \nthe\
    \ metrology, and realization modules that perform the physical to virtual and\
    \ \nvirtual to physical connection or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate,\
    \ and \nthe physical and virtual processes are all required for a complete description\
    \ of \nthe DT concept for any physical system [58]. Because of advancements in\
    \ tech-\nnology such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ and \ncloud computing, the DT concept has gained traction. This is due to the\
    \ fact that \nthese technologies enable real-time monitoring of physical twins\
    \ at high spatial \nresolutions using both small devices and distant sensing,\
    \ which generate ev-\ner-increasing data streams [21]. In comparison to other\
    \ fields, the notion of DT \nin agricultural applications is relatively new, with\
    \ the first references appearing \nin 2017; as a result, its added value has not\
    \ yet been thoroughly studied [21]. \nBecause of its reliance on natural circumstances\
    \ (temperature, soil, humidity), \nas well as the presence of living and non-living\
    \ physical twins (plants and an-\nimals), framing is a very complex and dynamic\
    \ realm (indoor farm buildings, \ngrow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural\
    \ machinery). \nNon-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with\
    \ plants and \nanimals (living physical twins), posing more obstacles for DT in\
    \ agriculture, \nwhereas non-living physical twins are the focus of DT in other\
    \ domains such \nas manufacturing. The majority of research has been on open-air\
    \ agricultur-\nal systems. There is just one study that proposes DT for a soil-based\
    \ vertical \n439\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6,\
    \ 2022\nfarming system and one study that implements DT for a soilless vertical\
    \ farm-\ning system (aquaponics). This could be due to the difficulty of designing\
    \ and \nmanaging modern farming systems. Furthermore, the majority of DTs are\
    \ still \nin the research phase, with no commercial deployment planned. Cost savings,\
    \ \ndisaster prevention, clearer decision making, and efficient management oper-\n\
    ations are all reported benefits of DT applications in agriculture, which can\
    \ be \napplied to a variety of agricultural subfields such as plant and animal\
    \ breeding, \naquaponics, vertical farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming.\
    \ While \nDT technology offers a lot of promise, achieving synchronization between\
    \ the \nreal and digital worlds is difficult. Due to the quirks of living physical\
    \ twins, \nthe intricacy of this procedure is magnified in agricultural settings.\
    \ As a result, \nagricultural DT should begin with micro-farms, which can then\
    \ be gradually up-\ngraded to a more intelligent and autonomous form by adding\
    \ more components.\n4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry \n\
    This section outlines a series of interconnected hurdles to a wider adoption of\
    \ \ndigital technologies in agriculture. Following a review of the literature,\
    \ 21 barri-\ners were found, which were divided into technical and socioeconomic\
    \ categories.\n4.12. Technical roadblocks \n•Interoperability: Data is regarded\
    \ as a critical component in the success of \nsmart systems. Agricultural data\
    \ is typically gathered from a variety of sources, \nincluding thousands of individual\
    \ farmlands, animal industries, and business ap-\nplications. Data can be in a\
    \ variety of formats, making data integration difficult. \nAs a result, after\
    \ systematic data collection, storage, processing, and knowledge \nmining, data\
    \ interoperability is critical to increasing the value of this widely \ndistributed\
    \ data [59]. Interconnected and interoperable devices are also required \nfor\
    \ successful communication between heterogeneous devices. The system’s in-\nteroperability\
    \ can be improved through cross-technology communication [60].\n•Standardization:\
    \ Standardization of devices is required to fully use digital \ntechnologies for\
    \ smart farming applications. Differences in output can occur \nas a result of\
    \ misinterpretation and changes over time. Device, application, and \nsystem interoperability\
    \ concerns can also be overcome by standardization [25].\n•Data quality: Data\
    \ quality, as well as data security, storage, and openness, \nare essential for\
    \ producing meaningful outcomes. Another impediment to the \nadoption of smart\
    \ farming technologies is the lack of decentralized data man-\nagement systems\
    \ [9]. Multiple actors’ willingness to exchange farm data is be-\ning harmed as\
    \ a result of this problem.\n•Hardware implementation: It is incredibly difficult\
    \ to establish a smart agri-\ncultural setup in large-scale open areas. This is\
    \ due to the fact that all hardware, \n440\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nincluding IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ sensor nodes, machinery, and \nequipment, is directly exposed to harsh environmental\
    \ conditions such as heavy \nrainfall, extreme temperatures, extreme humidity,\
    \ high wind speeds, and a vari-\nety of other dangers that can destroy electronic\
    \ circuits or disrupt their normal \nfunctionality [61]. A possible answer is\
    \ to construct a sturdy and lasting casing \nfor all of the expensive devices\
    \ that can withstand real-world conditions [62].\n•Adequate power sources: Typically,\
    \ wireless gadgets used on farms func-\ntion for an extended period of time and\
    \ have a limited battery life. \nBecause replacing a battery in the event of a\
    \ failure is difficult, especially in \nopen-air farms where devices are strategically\
    \ located with limited access [61], a \nproper energy-saving system is required.\
    \ Low-power sensors and proper commu-\nnication management are two viable strategies\
    \ for reducing energy consumption \n[24, 63]. Other intriguing technologies to\
    \ eliminate the need for battery renewal by \nrecharging batteries using electromagnetic\
    \ waves include wireless power transfer \nand self-supporting wireless systems.\
    \ In most agricultural applications, however, \nlong-distance wireless charging\
    \ is required [9]. Another potential alternative is to \ncapture ambient energy\
    \ from rivers, fluid flow, vehicle movement, and the ground \nsurface using sensor\
    \ nodes; however the converted electrical energy is current-\nly restricted, necessitating\
    \ the need to enhance power conversion efficiency [64].\n•Reliability: The dependability\
    \ of devices, as well as the software applica-\ntions that run on them, is critical.\
    \ This is due to the fact that IoT devices must \ncollect and transmit data from\
    \ which judgments are made utilizing a variety of \nsoftware packages. Unreliable\
    \ sensing, processing, and transmission can result \nin erroneous monitoring data\
    \ reports, significant delays, and even data loss, all \nof which can have a negative\
    \ impact on agricultural system performance [25].\n •Adaptability: Agriculture\
    \ is a complicated, dynamic, and continuously \nchanging environment. As a result,\
    \ when building a system, it is critical for de-\nvices and applications to react\
    \ proactively with other entities in the face of un-\nknown and dynamic elements\
    \ in order to provide the required performance [65].\n•Robust wireless architectures:\
    \ Low-cost, wide-area coverage, enough net-\nworking flexibility, and high scalability\
    \ are all advantages of wireless networks \nand communication technologies. However,\
    \ in a dynamic agriculture environ-\nment, such as temperature swings, the movement\
    \ of live objects, and the ex-\nistence of impediments, dependable wireless connection\
    \ is a major difficulty. \nFor example, multipath propagation effects cause signal\
    \ strength oscillations, \nresulting in unstable connectivity and insufficient\
    \ data transmission [66]. These \nelements have an impact on the agricultural\
    \ system’s performance. As a result, \nrobust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures\
    \ with proper sensor node place-\n441\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nment, antenna height, network topology, and communication\
    \ protocols are re-\nquired, as well as low-maintenance wireless systems [11].\n\
    •Interference: Because of the extensive deployment of IoT devices and wire-\n\
    less sensor networks, another difficulty is wireless interference and quality\
    \ of \nservice degradation. Effective channel scheduling between heterogeneous\
    \ sens-\ning devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and upcoming networking prim-\n\
    itives like concurrent transmission [67] can all help to solve these problems.\
    \ \nBecause agriculture equipment are dispersed in indoor greenhouses, outdoor\
    \ \nfarmlands, underground locations, and even aquatic areas, cross-media com-\n\
    munication between underground, underwater, and air is also necessary for full\
    \ \nintegration of smart technologies [68].\n•Security and privacy: Because smart\
    \ agricultural systems are dispersed, \nthey are vulnerable to cyber-attacks such\
    \ as eavesdropping, data integrity, de-\nnial-of-service assaults, and other sorts\
    \ of disruptions that could jeopardize the \nsystem’s privacy, integrity, and\
    \ availability [69]. With various privacy-preserv-\ning techniques and federated\
    \ learning approaches, cyber-security is a funda-\nmental concern that needs to\
    \ be addressed in the context of smart farming [44].\n•Compatibility: in order\
    \ to meet the fragmentation and scalability standards, \nthe models or software\
    \ applications developed must be adaptable and able to \nrun on any equipment\
    \ in the agricultural system [13]. \n•Resource optimization: To boost farm profitability,\
    \ farmers need a resource op-\ntimization procedure to determine the ideal number\
    \ of IoT devices and gateways, \ncloud storage size, and volume of transmitted\
    \ data. Resource optimization is diffi-\ncult since farms vary in size and require\
    \ different types of sensors to assess different \nvariables [70]. Second, most\
    \ farm management systems do not support run-time \nchanges to match the demands\
    \ of individual farmers. To estimate adequate resource \nallocation, complicated\
    \ mathematical models and algorithms are necessary [32].\n•Scalability: Due to\
    \ technological improvements, the number of gadgets, \ngear, and sensors put on\
    \ farms is continually expanding. \nGateways, network applications, and back-end\
    \ databases should all be de-\npendable and scalable in order to serve these entities\
    \ [71].\n•Human-centered user interfaces: Existing agricultural software and gadgets\
    \ \nhave complicated user interfaces, which are limiting smart farming methods.\
    \ \nThe majority of graphical user interfaces are constructed in such a way that\
    \ \nonly specialists can use them to accomplish agricultural activities. By making\
    \ \nthe user interface more human-centered and providing multimodal feedback,\
    \ a \nbigger group of individuals will be able to use it to complete various agricul-\n\
    tural tasks [35].\n442\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.13. Socio-economic roadblocks \n•Gap between farmers and researchers:\
    \ Farmers’ engagement is critical to \nthe success of the agriculture industry’s\
    \ digitization. Agricultural specialists are \nfrequently unaware of the concerns\
    \ that farmers encounter during the agri-food \nproduction process, which smart\
    \ technologies could solve [16]. Furthermore, it \nis critical to completely comprehend\
    \ the nature of problems in order to create \nan appropriate smart solution. \n\
    As a result, bridging the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, \n\
    and AI researchers is critical.\n•Expenses connected with smart systems: the costs\
    \ associated with adopt-\ning smart technology and systems are a major impediment\
    \ to the agriculture \nsector’s digitization. These expenses typically include\
    \ deployment, operation, \nand maintenance. Smart system deployment costs are\
    \ typically significant since \nthey include: I hardware installation, such as\
    \ autonomous robots and drones, \nWSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure,\
    \ and ii) paying trained labour \nto do particular agricultural tasks [72]. Similarly,\
    \ subscriptions to centralized \nnetworks and software packages are necessary\
    \ to support data processing, con-\ntrol of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge\
    \ exchange, which eventually \nraises operating expenses [73]. Even if service\
    \ providers occasionally provide \nfree subscription packages with limited capabilities,\
    \ storage capacity is limited. \nPeriodic maintenance is essential to ensure the\
    \ proper operation of the smart \nsystem, which adds to the total costs.\nEnvironmental,\
    \ ethical, and societal costs may also be connected with the \nadoption of smart\
    \ devices. Initiatives focusing on cooperative farming are need-\ned to overcome\
    \ cost-related roadblocks by providing: I support services for \nbetter cost management\
    \ and needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to \ntransform conventional\
    \ equipment into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce \nhigh initial costs [73].\n\
    •Digital division: a lack of awareness of digital technology and their appli-\n\
    cations is another problem limiting the digitalization of the agriculture sector.\
    \ \nThe majority of farmers have no understanding what digital technologies are,\
    \ \nhow to install and utilize them, or which technology is appropriate for their\
    \ farm \nand matches their needs [14]. As a result, farmers must be educated on\
    \ current \nfarming technologies and processes. \nFurthermore, various tactics\
    \ are required to develop tools that use natural \nlanguage and are easily understood\
    \ by farmers with low levels of education [74]. \n•Return on investment: In agriculture,\
    \ like in other industries, the profit \nmargin is critical. When it comes to\
    \ implementing modern technologies, farm-\n443\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\ners are concerned about the time it will\
    \ take to recoup their investment and the \ndifficulty in assessing the benefits\
    \ [12].\n•Building faith in the effectiveness of smart technology in agriculture\
    \ is \ndifficult, unlike in other disciplines, because many decisions influence\
    \ systems \nthat involve both living and non-living elements, and the results\
    \ can be difficult \nto reverse [16]. In addition, the lack of verification of\
    \ the influence of digital \ntools on farm productivity exacerbates the current\
    \ difficulties.\n•Legal frameworks: different regions and nations have distinct\
    \ legal frame-\nworks that influence the deployment of digital technologies in\
    \ agriculture, par-\nticularly in monitoring and agri-food supply [31]. Similarly,\
    \ laws governing \nresource allocation (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy,\
    \ and security \ndiffer from country to country [31].\n•Connectivity infrastructure:\
    \ In most developing nations, connectivity in-\nfrastructure is poor, limiting\
    \ access to advanced digital technologies that could \nhelp turn data from disparate\
    \ sources into useful and actionable insights [10].\n4.14. Discussion \nThe goal\
    \ of this study was to describe the new digital technologies that are \nbeing\
    \ used in the agricultural industry in order to predict the future trajectories\
    \ \nof agriculture 4.0. Big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-phys-\n\
    ical systems, and digital twins are among the technologies that have yet to be\
    \ \nfully explored in agriculture. This disparity could be due to the fact that\
    \ install-\ning advanced technologies with more complex processes can be costly,\
    \ at least \nin the early stages of their acceptance. The agricultural industry’s\
    \ development \nof these technologies is expected to speed up in the next years.\
    \ The findings of \nSLR also reveal that IoT is widely used in farms. This is\
    \ owing to the IoT’s di-\nverse capabilities, which include monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and tracing, agricultural \nmachinery, and precision agriculture [21]. One of\
    \ the key research aims within \nthe farm 4.0 techniques can be regarded to be\
    \ IoT. Nonetheless, when building \nan intelligent agricultural system, only a\
    \ few researches have examined data \nsecurity and dependability, scalability,\
    \ and interoperability. The outcomes of \nthe study also revealed that the majority\
    \ of use cases are still in the prototype \nstage. The reason for this could be\
    \ that most agricultural activities involve live \nsubjects, such as animals and\
    \ plants, or perishable products, and establish-\ning systems for living subjects\
    \ is more difficult than developing systems for \nnon-living human-made systems.\
    \ Another explanation could be that, due to the \ntrans-disciplinary character\
    \ of agriculture, it is a late adopter of technology. As a \nresult, in order\
    \ to construct intelligent systems, the agricultural community must \nbecome conversant\
    \ with all digital technologies. Finally, differences in plant/\n444\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ncrop species and\
    \ growth conditions complicate agricultural system digitaliza-\ntion [55]. In\
    \ contrast to indoor farms, the majority of the technologies created \nby SLR\
    \ are for open-air soil-based farms (soilless and soil-based). This is owing \n\
    to the complicated design and maintenance of indoor farms, particularly soilless\
    \ \nfarms, where the parameters and elements to be maintained are numerous (pH,\
    \ \nair temperature, humidity, etc.) [5]. However, by incorporating digital technol-\n\
    ogy and data-driven computer applications into indoor farms, a more reliable \n\
    control of the process can be attained. Furthermore, SLR reveals that insufficient\
    \ \nresearch is undertaken in three of the nine service areas described in section\
    \ 3 \n(soil management, fruit detection and counting, and crop quality management).\
    \ \nThis supports the notion that significant research and development is required\
    \ \nin some areas to ensure the successful digitization of the agriculture business\
    \ \nin both developed and developing countries. The agriculture ecosystem’s com-\n\
    plexity creates a set of interrelated hurdles that prevent full integration of\
    \ digital \ntechnology for agriculture 4.0 implementation. As a result, identifying\
    \ possible \nbottlenecks is critical in order to devise strategic strategies to\
    \ overcome them. \nThis research aims to figure out what these stumbling barriers\
    \ are. Following \nthe investigation, 21 barriers were found and characterized\
    \ on both a technical \nand socioeconomic level. These impediments are addressed\
    \ in section 5, which \noutlines what needs to be done on a bigger scale to digitize\
    \ the agricultural \neconomy. However, it is still unknown how much removing or\
    \ mitigating these \nhurdles aids in the successful integration of digital technologies.\
    \ \n4.16. Added value of agricultural digitization \nSeveral benefits that can\
    \ inspire framers and other actors to assist agriculture \nindustry digitization\
    \ have been discovered and outlined based on analysis. The \nbenefits described\
    \ here have the potential to increase farm productivity and im-\nprove product\
    \ quality, but they should not be viewed as a cure for the problems \nthat come\
    \ with smart agriculture [73]. \n•Improved agility: Farm operations can now be\
    \ more agile thanks to digital \ntechnologies. Farmers and agricultural professionals\
    \ can quickly respond to \nany anticipated changes in environmental and water\
    \ conditions using real-time \nsurveillance and forecasting technologies to save\
    \ crops [72].\n•Green process: By lowering the use of in-field fuel, nitrogen\
    \ fertilizers, \npesticides, and herbicides, digital technologies make farming\
    \ more ecologically \nfriendly and climate-resilient [75].\n•Resource efficiency:\
    \ By increasing the quantity and quality of agricultural \noutput while reducing\
    \ the use of water, energy, fertilizers, and pesticides, digital \nplatforms can\
    \ improve resource efficiency [3]. \n445\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n•Time and cost savings: By automating various\
    \ tasks such as harvesting, sow-\ning, or irrigation, managing the application\
    \ of fertilizers or pesticides, and sched-\nuling irrigation, digital technologies\
    \ provide significant time and cost savings [76].\n•Asset management: digital\
    \ technologies enable real-time observation of \nfarm holdings and equipment,\
    \ allowing for theft prevention, component re-\nplacement, and routine maintenance\
    \ [10].\n•Product safety: By eliminating fraud [17, 18] linked to adulteration,\
    \ coun-\nterfeiting, and artificial enhancement, digital technologies maintain\
    \ appropriate \nfarm output and ensure a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food\
    \ products [69].\n4.17. Considerations and future prospects \nThe agricultural\
    \ industry would see major benefits as a result of the planned \nmeasures. However,\
    \ the impediments identified in section 5 must be solved first \nin order to make\
    \ things sustainable for small and medium-scale growers. Some \nof the above hurdles\
    \ can be mitigated by awareness campaigns emphasizing the \nimportance of smart\
    \ agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and \nencouraging\
    \ novel techniques (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders \nto take\
    \ an active role in the digital transformation [9]. Initiatives at the federal\
    \ \nlevel, grants and endowments, public-private collaborations, data transparency,\
    \ \nand regional research efforts can all help overcome potential hurdles. Finally,\
    \ \nwhen constructing a smart agriculture system, a roadmap can be used, starting\
    \ \nwith a basic architecture with few components and simpler functionality and\
    \ \ngradually adding components and functionality to develop a sophisticated sys-\n\
    tem with full digitization potential [21]. These issues can pave the road for\
    \ ag-\nriculture 4.0’s successful adoption. The use of explainable artificial\
    \ intelligence \nto monitor crop development, estimate crop biomass, evaluate\
    \ crop health, and \ncontrol pests and diseases is one of the future prospects\
    \ of digital technologies \nin smart agriculture. Explainable AI eliminates the\
    \ old black-box approach of \nmachine learning and allows for a better understanding\
    \ of the reasoning behind \nany given decision [15]. The use of common semantics\
    \ and ontologies to de-\nscribe big data, as well as the adoption of open standards,\
    \ has the potential to \naccelerate research and development in the field of smart\
    \ farming. Similarly, \n5G technology must be thoroughly investigated in order\
    \ to enable improved \nconnectivity and live streaming of crop data [6]. By executing\
    \ precise crop in-\nspections remotely, 5G technology will reduce internet costs\
    \ and enhance the \nentire user experience of farm management and food safety\
    \ [77]. It would also \nhelp to close the gap between stakeholders by keeping\
    \ them informed about \ncrop availability. Finally, blockchain can be used in\
    \ conjunction with IoT and \nother technologies to address data privacy and security\
    \ concerns [78]. \n446\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 \nThe agriculture sector has\
    \ traditionally had a breakthrough during industri-\nal revolutions. Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 offers significant potential to offset rising food \ndemands and prepare\
    \ for the future by reinforcing agricultural systems with \nWSN, IoT, AI, and\
    \ other technologies, as formally mentioned in preceding \nsections. While agricultural\
    \ 4.0 is still being implemented, agriculture 5.0 is \nalready being discussed.\
    \ \nAgriculture 5.0 builds on agriculture 4.0 by incorporating industry 5.0 prin-\n\
    ciples to provide healthy, affordable food while also ensuring that the environ-\n\
    ments on which life depends are not degraded [79]. Industry 4.0 focuses less \n\
    on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability and more on dig-\n\
    italization and AI-driven technologies for increasing efficiency and flexibility,\
    \ \nthe European Commission formally called for the Fifth Industrial Revolution\
    \ \n(industry 5.0) in 2021 [80]. Industry 5.0 adds to and expands on the industry\
    \ 4.0 \nconcepts by emphasizing human-centricity, sustainability, and resiliency\
    \ [81]. \nIt entails improving human-machine collaboration, decreasing environmental\
    \ \neffect through the circular economy, and designing systems with a high degree\
    \ \nof robustness to reach an ideal balance of efficiency and productivity. Among\
    \ \nthe enabling technologies of industry are cobots (collaborative robots), smart\
    \ \nmaterials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient\
    \ \nand secure data management, renewable energy sources, and others 5.0[80].\n\
    Farm production efficiency and crop quality can be improved in agriculture \n\
    5.0 settings by delegating repetitive and boring activities to machines and those\
    \ \nthat need critical thinking to humans. For this reason, agricultural cyber\
    \ physical \ncognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment and conduct\
    \ ap-\npropriate actions, comparable to those established for the manufacturing\
    \ sector, \nshould be developed. This might include collaborative farm robots\
    \ that work in \nthe fields to aid crop growers with time-consuming operations\
    \ like seed sowing \nand harvesting. Similarly, digital twins in agriculture 5.0\
    \ can add substantial value \nby recognizing technical difficulties in agricultural\
    \ systems and resolving them \nmore quickly, detecting crop illnesses, and producing\
    \ more accurate crop output \nestimates. This demonstrates that agriculture 5.0\
    \ has the potential to pave the way \nfor climate-smart, sustainable, and resilient\
    \ agriculture, but it is still in its infancy. \n5. Conclusions \nConcerns about\
    \ global food security have heightened the demand for \nnext-generation industrial\
    \ farms and agricultural intensive production systems. \nDigital technologies,\
    \ such as those given by the Industry 4.0 programme, are at \n447\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nthe vanguard of this modern\
    \ agricultural period, providing a wide range of in-\nnovative solutions. Disruptive\
    \ technologies are being integrated into traditional \nagriculture systems by\
    \ scientists and researchers in order to boost crop yields, \ncut costs, reduce\
    \ waste, and sustain process inputs. This report includes an SLR \nthat discusses\
    \ the current state of various technologies in the agriculture sector. \nSeveral\
    \ findings are drawn, including the fact that big data and analytics inte-\ngration,\
    \ wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins in \nagriculture\
    \ are still in their infancy, with the majority of use cases still in the \nprototype\
    \ stage. Similarly, 21 technological and socioeconomic impediments \nare found\
    \ and categorized. These impediments must be identified and addressed \nif the\
    \ agriculture industry is to be digitalized. The report also identifies and \n\
    presents the additional value of digital technology in the agriculture industry.\
    \ \nOverall, this research contributes to the ongoing research on agricultural\
    \ 4.0. \nThe review’s principal restriction is twofold: first, only three online\
    \ reposito-\nries (Scopus, IEEE, and Science Direct) are considered for literature\
    \ searches, \nand second, new keywords and synonyms may return more papers. The\
    \ main \nconclusions are highly unlikely to alter in either scenario. Additional\
    \ research \ndatabases and areas can be considered for future study in order to\
    \ provide a \ncomplete overview of the agriculture industry in terms of digitization.\
    \ In addi-\ntion, papers focusing on agriculture 5.0 in general will be featured.\n\

    Abstract: In the last few years, the Internet of Things, and other enabling technologies,\
    \ have been\nprogressively used for digitizing Food Supply Chains (FSC). These\
    \ and other digitalization-enabling\ntechnologies are generating a massive amount\
    \ of data with enormous potential to manage supply\nchains more efﬁciently and\
    \ sustainably. Nevertheless, the intricate patterns and complexity embedded\n\
    in large volumes of data present a challenge for systematic human expert analysis.\
    \ In such a data-\ndriven context, Computational Intelligence (CI) has achieved\
    \ signiﬁcant momentum to analyze, mine,\nand extract the underlying data information,\
    \ or solve complex optimization problems, striking a\nbalance between productive\
    \ efﬁciency and sustainability of food supply systems. Although some\nrecent studies\
    \ have sorted the CI literature in this ﬁeld, they are mainly oriented towards\
    \ a single\nfamily of CI methods (a group of methods that share common characteristics)\
    \ and review their\napplication in speciﬁc FSC stages. As such, there is a gap\
    \ in identifying and classifying FSC problems\nfrom a broader perspective, encompassing\
    \ the various families of CI methods that can be applied in\ndifferent stages\
    \ (from production to retailing) and identifying the problems that arise in these\
    \ stages\nfrom a CI perspective. This paper presents a new and comprehensive taxonomy\
    \ of FSC problems\n(associated with agriculture, ﬁsh farming, and livestock) from\
    \ a CI approach; that is, it deﬁnes FSC\nproblems (from production to retail)\
    \ and categorizes them based on how they can be modeled from\na CI point of view.\
    \ Furthermore, we review the CI approaches that are more commonly used in\neach\
    \ stage of the FSC and in their corresponding categories of problems. We also\
    \ introduce a set of\nguidelines to help FSC researchers and practitioners to\
    \ decide on suitable families of methods when\naddressing any particular problems\
    \ they might encounter. Finally, based on the proposed taxonomy,\nwe identify\
    \ and discuss challenges and research opportunities that the community should\
    \ explore to\nenhance the contributions that CI can bring to the digitization\
    \ of the FSC.\nKeywords: food supply chain; computational intelligence; fish farming;\
    \ agriculture; livestock; machine\nlearning; neural networks; deep learning; meta-heuristics;\
    \ fuzzy systems; probabilistic methods\n1. Introduction\nCurrently, one worldwide\
    \ challenge is how to sustainably guarantee global food needs\nin the face of\
    \ a growing population that is projected to be 9–10 billion by 2050 [1]. In this\n\
    sense, the enhancement of production and management of the current Food Supply\
    \ Chains\n(FSCs) is a crucial factor that contributes to accomplishing such an\
    \ aim. Nowadays, new\nInformation and Communication Technologies (ICTs) (e.g.,\
    \ the Internet of Things) play\nan active role in the digitization of FSCs [2].\
    \ As a result, large volumes of data are being\ngenerated in all FSC stages, ranging\
    \ from production to retail. The analysis of such data\nwould enable FSC actors\
    \ to extract relevant information or to optimize speciﬁc processes,\nallowing\
    \ improvement of the FSC administration, productivity, and sustainability.\nNevertheless,\
    \ the high volumes of available data and their complex patterns raise\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ challenges when analyzing and extracting values. In this context, Computational\n\

    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n2 of 34\nIntelligence (CI) seems to be a successful paradigm\
    \ to build intelligent systems that are\nable to leverage this high availability\
    \ of data. CI is the ability of a digital system or\nalgorithm to perform tasks\
    \ commonly associated with intelligent beings [3]. Within such\ntasks, we can\
    \ ﬁnd speech recognition, visual perception, decision-making, prediction, and\n\
    translation, among others [4]. Over the last few years, the number of academic\
    \ publications\nconcerning CI applied to FSC has rapidly increased [5–7]. Within\
    \ the most representative\nCI methods applied to FSCs, we ﬁnd Neural Networks,\
    \ Fuzzy Logic, Swarm Intelligence,\nor Probabilistic Reasoning.\nThe scientiﬁc\
    \ literature reports different studies that aim to review and order the\napplication\
    \ of CI methods in different FSC stages. The variety of CI methods has led to\
    \ the\nemergence of research papers (published between 2012 and 2020), which select\
    \ a partic-\nular family of CI techniques and review their application in speciﬁc\
    \ FSC stages [2,6–12].\nHowever, these papers focus on only one or two families\
    \ of CI methods at most, and in the\nmajority of cases, do not cover all FSC stages.\
    \ Therefore, there is a lack of comprehensive\nstudies that review the application\
    \ of the most important families of CI methods in all FSC\nstages (from production\
    \ to retail). Additionally, few efforts have been made to classify FSC\nproblems\
    \ from a CI perspective. Hence, there is no categorization of the typologies of\
    \ FSC\nproblems to help determine how they can be modeled from a CI view (e.g.,\
    \ optimization,\nuncertain knowledge handling, reasoning) and what CI methods\
    \ can be most suitably used\nto approach them. Thus, despite the progress made\
    \ in organizing and systematizing the\nexisting literature at the point where\
    \ CI and FSCs meet, to the best of our knowledge, no\ntaxonomy has been proposed\
    \ in this regard.\nWith the above-mentioned ideas in mind, we propose a novel\
    \ taxonomy of FSC\nproblems from a CI perspective. Speciﬁcally, we focus on the\
    \ supply chain of agriculture,\nﬁsh farming, and livestock. The latter is justiﬁed\
    \ based on the fact that these supply chains\nprovide most of the food consumed\
    \ by the population of the world [13] and, therefore, they\nare the most studied\
    \ and researched FSCs in the scientiﬁc and academic literature. The\nmain contributions\
    \ of this article are:\n•\nA new taxonomy that provides a comprehensive view of\
    \ different FSC problems\nlocated in the chain stages typically studied in the\
    \ scientiﬁc literature (production,\nprocessing, distribution, and retail). This\
    \ taxonomy represents a new and broader\nproposal in order to identify and deﬁne\
    \ FSC problems that have been approached\nusing CI in the four aforementioned\
    \ stages. Besides, although some research articles\nhave described diverse FSC\
    \ problems, their deﬁnitions are not uniﬁed and vary\nfrom one paper to another.\
    \ Thus, this taxonomy also represents an effort to unify\nand consolidate deﬁnitions\
    \ of the FSC problems available in the literature, which\nrepresents a valuable\
    \ source of information for FSC researchers and practitioners\nworking in this\
    \ domain.\n•\nTo classify the FSC problems from a CI perspective. This classiﬁcation\
    \ allows FSC\nproblems to be mapped into common categories of problems in the\
    \ CI domain. Thus,\nwe provide a framework that helps display the similarities\
    \ and differences among\nFSC problems depending on how they can be modeled under\
    \ a CI perspective. To the\nbest of our knowledge, in this regard, no classiﬁcation\
    \ has been previously proposed.\n•\nTo establish a set of guidelines for the use\
    \ of CI in the FSC ﬁeld. These guidelines\naim to help FSC researchers and practitioners\
    \ to identify which FSC problems can\nbe addressed using CI, and the most appropriate\
    \ families of techniques to solve\nthem. Thus, these guidelines represent a ﬁrst\
    \ attempt to deﬁne a general framework\nto support the model selection problem\
    \ at the point where the ﬁelds of FSC and\nCI converge.\n•\nTo identify and discuss\
    \ challenges and research opportunities in the FSC domain,\nwhich are directed\
    \ towards more robust, explainable, interoperable, and accurate CI\nsolutions\
    \ that support FSC management and operation.\nThe rest of this paper is structured\
    \ as follows. Section 2 provides background in-\nformation on FSC and CI to facilitate\
    \ the understanding of the article. Furthermore, it\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n\
    3 of 34\nsummarizes other efforts directed at reviewing and categorizing the scientiﬁc\
    \ literature at\nthe point where FSC and CI meet in order to highlight how this\
    \ paper complements and\nenhances previous studies. Section 3 presents the proposed\
    \ taxonomy, its structure, and the\nclassiﬁcation of FSC from a CI perspective.\
    \ Afterwards, Section 4 gives FSC researchers and\npractitioners a set of guidelines\
    \ for the use of CI within the FSC domain. Lastly, Section 5\nsummarizes the main\
    \ conclusions and sets a research agenda for CI in the FSC ﬁeld.\n2. Background\
    \ and Motivation\nThis section provides some contextual and relevant background\
    \ information to facili-\ntate the understanding of the paper, and to assess similar\
    \ studies in this area. We start by\nintroducing the basic FSC stages examined\
    \ in this study (Section 2.1). Then, Section 2.2\npresents the main families of\
    \ CI approaches typically considered in FSC research. Finally,\nSection 2.3 reviews\
    \ similar works at the point where FSC and CI converge, which have\nidentiﬁed\
    \ and classiﬁed CI-based problems and methods. Section 2 ends with a discussion\n\
    of the main contributions of this research article.\n2.1. Food Supply Chain\n\
    FSC refers to the system that encompasses all activities, organizations, actors,\
    \ tech-\nnologies, information, resources, and services involved in producing\
    \ agri-food products for\nconsumer markets (e.g., fresh food, meat, and processed\
    \ food products) [14]. The upstream\nand downstream sectors form the supply of\
    \ agricultural inputs (such as seeds, fertilizers,\nfeed, medicine, or equipment)\
    \ to production, post-harvest handling, processing, transporta-\ntion, marketing,\
    \ distribution, and retailing [15]. They also include support services such as\n\
    extension services, research and development, and market information.\nBefore\
    \ the ﬁnal consumption of food products, FSC can include diverse stages wherein\n\
    production, processing, distribution, and retail are the stages most commonly\
    \ studied in\nthe scientiﬁc literature [16]. First, the production stage forms\
    \ the initial set of processes to\nobtain raw products derived from agriculture,\
    \ ﬁsh farming, or livestock. Agriculture refers\nto farming applications, including\
    \ the cultivation of soils for the harvest of crops [17]. Fish\nfarming involves\
    \ raising ﬁsh commercially in tanks or ﬁsh ponds, usually for consumer\nmarkets\
    \ [18]. Meanwhile, livestock is devoted to practices related to animal husbandry\
    \ for\nmeat, milk, eggs, or wool [19]. Continuing further down the production\
    \ chain, we ﬁnd\nthe processing stage, wherein the produced raw materials are\
    \ exposed to diverse transfor-\nmation processes (e.g., meat curing, washing and\
    \ disinfecting vegetables, fermentation),\nwhich allow consumable food products\
    \ to be obtained.\nOnce food products are ready to be delivered to the end-users,\
    \ the following FSC\nstages are distribution and retail. Their main purpose is\
    \ to connect the production and\nprocessing stages with the food users to complete\
    \ the supply chain loop [16]. Consequently,\nin the distribution stage, the processed\
    \ food is sent to distribution centers and warehouses.\nFrom such locations, different\
    \ distribution channels start to deliver the products to retail\nstores for sale.\
    \ Thus, retail is the end stage of the FSC and represents the link to consumers.\n\
    FSCs consist of a wide range of enterprises, ranging from smallholders, farmers’\n\
    organizations, co-operatives, and start-up companies to multinational enterprises\
    \ through\nparent companies or their local afﬁliates [14,15]. In this context,\
    \ FSC companies relate\nto each other through a variety of arrangements. Downstream\
    \ companies in the supply\nchain may engage in various types of relationships\
    \ with producers to secure access to\nagricultural products. They can impose standards\
    \ and speciﬁcations on producers with\nlittle involvement beyond a buying contract.\
    \ However, they can also become more actively\ninvolved, particularly through\
    \ contract farming, to coordinate production and ensure\nquality and safety [14].\
    \ In the new circular chain schemes, this type of relationship becomes\nmore complex,\
    \ involving more than one enterprise from the chain in the decision-making\nprocess\
    \ [20].\nCurrently, an appropriate and effective strategy to address this challenge\
    \ is the digiti-\nzation of FSCs, both of their internal processes and of their\
    \ relationships with other actors\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n4 of 34\nin the chain\
    \ [2]. Digitization has led to the generation of big volumes of data throughout\
    \ the\nentire supply chain. The exploitation of such data would allow FSC actors\
    \ to extract knowl-\nedge that could improve their internal processes in terms\
    \ of productivity and sustainability,\nas well as that of the FSC as a whole.\
    \ However, the data obtained through digitization\nusually contain complex and\
    \ intricate patterns that stand out as diverse challenges for\nprocessing and\
    \ analysis to extract value from it. Thus, CI arises as a solution that could\n\
    leverage and mine the underlying patterns of such data in order to obtain the\
    \ maximum\nvalue of the information, according to the analyses made.\n2.2. Computational\
    \ Intelligence Approaches\nCI is centered on the ability of a computer or algorithm\
    \ to learn speciﬁc tasks (e.g.,\npattern recognition, forecasting) from data that\
    \ is typically related to experimental observa-\ntions without human intervention\
    \ [3]. In the context of FSC, diverse IoT devices and data\nmanagement systems\
    \ sense and gather such data, which they then deploy in each supply\nchain stage.\
    \ After obtaining data, different CI approaches are used to process, analyze,\
    \ and\nextract information. In this section, we introduce the relevant background\
    \ information in\nrelation to families of CI-based methods that are typically\
    \ used in FSC applications. Fol-\nlowing the guidelines and classiﬁcation proposed\
    \ in [3], we have grouped the CI methods\ninto ﬁve families that are presented\
    \ in more detail below. They are CI-based Statistical\nLearning Methods, Artiﬁcial\
    \ Neural Networks and Deep Learning, CI-based Optimization\nMethods, Fuzzy Systems,\
    \ and Probabilistic Reasoning. These groups of CI-based methods\nare presented\
    \ below.\n2.2.1. CI-Based Statistical Learning Methods\nStatistical Learning Methods,\
    \ also known as Machine Learning (ML) methods are\nalgorithms that are able to\
    \ learn a speciﬁc task without being explicitly programmed. More\nformally, according\
    \ to Mitchell [21], these types of methods learn from experiences E,\nrelated\
    \ to a task T, and their performance is evaluated by a metric P. The performance\
    \ in T\nimproves according to P, with experience E. Classically, these methods\
    \ can be classiﬁed\naccording to the three basic learning approaches presented\
    \ below: unsupervised learning,\nsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n\
    Unsupervised learning looks for patterns in data with no pre-existing labels.\
    \ Its\ncentral approach is usually focused on organizing X data points into speciﬁc\
    \ groups [22].\nData points that are in the same group should have similar properties,\
    \ while data points\nin different groups should have highly different features.\
    \ It is important to note that\nthese potential groups are not previously deﬁned\
    \ and it is the purpose of unsupervised\nlearning algorithms to discover them.\
    \ Some examples of unsupervised learning methods\nare hierarchical clustering,\
    \ k-means, anomaly detection techniques, among others.\nSupervised learning is\
    \ the other fundamental area of Statistical Learning Methods [23].\nIt consists\
    \ of algorithms that learn a function ( f : X 7→ Y) by training with a ﬁnite number\n\
    of input-output pairs, X being the input domain and X the output co-domain. This\
    \ learning\nstage can be seen as E in Mitchell’s deﬁnition [21], and the speciﬁc\
    \ task T usually involves\npredicting an output given a new and unseen input [24].\
    \ Common families of methods that\nstand out in supervised learning are decision\
    \ tree-based (e.g., Decision Tree, Extra Trees),\ninstance-based (e.g., K-Nearest\
    \ Neighbors), kernel-based (e.g., Support Vector Machine), or\nensemble-based\
    \ methods (Random Forest, AdaBoost).\nSupervised learning problems can usually\
    \ be divided into classiﬁcation and regres-\nsion [25,26]. In both cases, the\
    \ basis is an input data-set, X, and their difference is the\ntype of target variable,\
    \ Y, to be predicted. In the classiﬁcation case, Y is divided into\ndiscrete categories,\
    \ while in regression, the aim is to predict continuous values. Standard\nclassiﬁcation\
    \ problems can be either binary or multi-class problems [27]. In the former\n\
    case, an instance can only be associated with one of two values: the positive\
    \ or negative\nequivalent to 0 or 1; whereas, in multi-class problems, there are\
    \ more than two classes\nunder consideration. A multi-class problem means that\
    \ a given instance belongs to one of\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n5 of 34\nthe multiple\
    \ possible categories. Diversely, a supervised regression problem [28] consists\n\
    of ﬁnding a function that can predict, for a given example, a real value in R.\n\
    The third learning approach is reinforcement learning [29]. In this case, the\
    \ focus is\non developing a learning agent able to observe the environment and\
    \ obtain some input\nfrom it. Then, the agent makes an action and it changes to\
    \ a new environment, receiving an\nevaluation value (award or penalty) related\
    \ to the action made. Unlike the unsupervised\nlearning approach, the agent receives\
    \ guidance from an external evaluation. Moreover,\ndifferent to supervised learning,\
    \ in reinforcement learning, the agent is provided with an\nevaluation value regarding\
    \ the action made and not with a clear speciﬁcation about the\ncorrespondence\
    \ between input and output data. Relevant approaches within reinforcement\nlearning\
    \ are value-based [30], policy-based [31], and model-based [32].\nLastly, it is\
    \ important to note that Artiﬁcial Neural Networks are not considered within\n\
    this family of methods. We will treat them as a separate class of methods because\
    \ of their\nimportant role in CI.\n2.2.2. Artiﬁcial Neural Networks and Deep Learning\n\
    Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computing systems with an inner structure\n\
    that is based on a set of connected units, named neurons, as they are inspired\
    \ by a biological\nbrain. Just as is the case for animals, wherein two neurons\
    \ are connected by means of a link\n(synapses), the neurons of an ANN are connected\
    \ through edges that transmit signals from\none artiﬁcial neuron to another. The\
    \ signals transferred between neurons are represented by\nreal numbers, and the\
    \ output of each neural unit is computed by some non-linear function\nof the sum\
    \ of its inputs.\nEvery edge that connects two neurons (usually) has a weight\
    \ that is adjusted as the\nlearning process of the ANN is underway. The role of\
    \ such edges is to increase or decrease\nthe strength of the signal at the connection\
    \ of two neurons. Additionally, neural units are\naggregated into layers, and\
    \ they may carry out diverse transformations on the inputs that\nthey receive.\
    \ Thus, the purpose of ANNs is to process input data from the ﬁrst layer (input\n\
    layer) to the last layer (output layer), while approximating linear or non-linear\
    \ functions\nthat are generally unknown. The collection of neuron units arranged\
    \ in layers, edges, and\nweights forms a network topology that is usually called\
    \ an architecture (Figure 1). ANNs\nhave evolved into a broad family of architectures\
    \ that depend on the speciﬁc application\ndomain. The feed-forward neural network\
    \ is a type of classical architecture. In this network,\nthe input data moves\
    \ from the input layer directly through any hidden layers (intermediate\nlayers\
    \ located in-between the input and output layers) to the output layer.\nFigure\
    \ 1. Basic architecture of an ANN. It is composed of edges and neural units arranged\
    \ using\nan input layer (blue neural units), a hidden layer (white neural units),\
    \ and an output layer (yellow\nneural units).\nBecause of their ability to reproduce\
    \ and model nonlinear processes, ANNs have been\napplied in diverse supervised\
    \ learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning\nproblems. Application\
    \ areas may include time series forecasting, pattern recognition, signal\nclassiﬁcation,\
    \ among others. However, as more complex problems (e.g., image processing,\nspeech\
    \ recognition) have arisen in the last few years, further development in the ANN\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n6 of 34\narea is required to deal with resulting challenges.\
    \ The common denominator of these ﬁelds\nis the high complexity and enormous volumes\
    \ of data generated and managed in them.\nAs a result, a subset of ANNs, named\
    \ Deep Learning (DL) [33] has emerged to cope with\nthis complexity.\nA deep neural\
    \ network is a classical ANN composed of multiple layers between the\ninput and\
    \ output layers. Theoretically, DL architectures allow any non-linear function\
    \ to be\napproximated [34]. Therefore, this approach has become dominant in multiple\
    \ application\nﬁelds like computer vision [35] and natural language processing\
    \ [36]. Between the most\ncommon deep neural networks, we can ﬁnd recurrent neural\
    \ networks, convolutional\nneural networks, and long short-term memory neural\
    \ networks [37]. The main strength\nof this approach lies in its ability to learn\
    \ automatically from raw data and to learn more\ncomplex representations of data\
    \ than other Statistical Learning methods [38]. The latter\ncould be valuable\
    \ for research areas characterized by having complex data, which can\nbarely be\
    \ analyzed by human reasoning and classical data preprocessing approaches. The\n\
    other relevant characteristics of Deep neural architectures come from their architectural\n\
    ﬂexibility that enables data fusion, as they allow different data formats to merge,\
    \ combining\ndata from multiple sources and therefore extracting more valuable\
    \ knowledge. In other\nwords, DL facilitates the use of multi-dimensional data,\
    \ which is quite difﬁcult to achieve\nwith classical ANNs and ML methods.\n2.2.3.\
    \ CI-Based Optimization Methods\nThe growing computational capabilities and the\
    \ fact that some problems of great\npractical value (e.g., scheduling, routing,\
    \ facility location) can not be solved optimally\n(because they are NP-Hard problems)\
    \ has led to increased use of approximating algorithms.\nMeta-heuristics are a\
    \ suitable approach in situations where exact algorithms can not give an\nanswer\
    \ using a reasonable amount of time or memory [39]. These methods arose with the\n\
    idea of extracting the best parts of different successful heuristics to create\
    \ generic methods\nthat could be applied to a more signiﬁcant number of problems\
    \ and contexts. Due to the\nwide variety of meta-heuristics, different classiﬁcation\
    \ categories have been proposed [40].\nWe group these techniques according to\
    \ the next categories: Evolutionary Computation\n(EC) [41], Swarm Intelligence\
    \ (SI) [42], and other meta-heuristics (local search-based meta-\nheuristics [43]).\
    \ These groups are presented with more detail as follows.\nEC is a group of meta-heuristic\
    \ optimization algorithms inspired by biological evolu-\ntion. Within this family\
    \ of methods, they operate from an initial set of candidate solutions\n(initial\
    \ generation), which are updated in an iterative way. Then, each new generation\n\
    is generated by randomly removing candidate solutions according to predeﬁned criteria\n\
    and by inserting random changes. After a set of iterations, the population of\
    \ solutions\nwill gradually evolve to increase its competitiveness, framed by\
    \ a ﬁtness function that is\ndetermined by each algorithm. Following the described\
    \ procedure, EC algorithms can\nproduce highly optimized solutions for complex\
    \ real-world optimization problems like the\ntraveling salesman problem [44].\
    \ Some well-known examples of EC meta-heuristics are\nGenetic algorithms [45]\
    \ and Differential evolution [46], among others.\nThe second biggest category\
    \ of meta-heuristics is the category of Swarm Intelligence\n(SI). This approach\
    \ consists of a population of agents interacting with each other and their\nenvironment.\
    \ The agents follow a set of basic rules, and although there is no centralized\n\
    control structure guiding the agents on how they should behave, the interaction\
    \ between\nthem leads to the emergence of intelligent global behavior. SI is inspired\
    \ by biological\nsystems such as ant and bee colonies and is commonly used to\
    \ solve combinatorial and\ncontinuous optimization problems (e.g., shortest path\
    \ problems for delivery or optimization\nof unknown parameters in time series).\
    \ Two of the most well-known SI algorithms are Ant\nColony [47], and Particle\
    \ Swarm [48] methods.\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n7 of 34\nThe third category groups\
    \ together the rest of the meta-heuristics, which are outside\nof the domains\
    \ of EC and SI but are still relevant for solving optimization problems. For\n\
    example, this is the case for local search-based meta-heuristics that are focused\
    \ on ﬁnding\na solution that maximizes a criterion among a set of candidate solutions.\
    \ These meta-\nheuristics move from one solution to another in the search space\
    \ of candidate solutions\nby applying local changes until an optimal solution\
    \ is found or a time budget is reached.\nWithin this category of meta-heuristics,\
    \ representative methods include Tabu Search [49],\nand Greedy Randomized Adaptive\
    \ Search Procedure (also known as GRASP) [50].\n2.2.4. Fuzzy Systems\nClassical\
    \ logic is based on the crisp set concept, where a group of objects is considered\n\
    to be a collection. In this sense, a crisp subset can be deﬁned from a broader\
    \ set where its\nelements belong to the subset according to some particular condition.\
    \ Thus, we can deﬁne\nthe concept of membership wherein a value of one is assigned\
    \ to the elements of the subset\nand a value of zero to the elements that do not\
    \ belong to that subset. Unlike crisp sets, a\nfuzzy set allows partial belonging\
    \ to a set through a degree of membership, denoted by\na function µ, that maps\
    \ all the elements in the set to a value in the real interval between\nzero and\
    \ one [51]. Then, as in the crisp case, a value of zero means that the element\
    \ under\nconsideration does not belong to the set, and a value of one represents\
    \ that the element\nbelongs entirely to the set. However, unlike in the crisp\
    \ case, a value greater than zero\nand lower than one represents a partial membership\
    \ to the subset. Consequently, the set’s\nmembership function is the relationship\
    \ between the elements of the set and their degree\nof belonging.\nHaving introduced\
    \ the basic notions of fuzzy sets, the next key concept is fuzzy\ninference systems.\
    \ A fuzzy system is a repository of fuzzy expert knowledge that can\nreason the\
    \ data in vague terms instead of precise Boolean logic. This expert knowledge\
    \ is a\ncollection of fuzzy membership functions and a set of fuzzy rules that\
    \ is formed as follows:\nIF (conditions are fulﬁlled) THEN (consequences are inferred).\
    \ The basic conﬁguration of a\nfuzzy system is shown in Figure 2, and it can be\
    \ divided into four main parts: a fuzziﬁer, a\nknowledge base, an inference engine,\
    \ and a defuzziﬁer [52].\nFigure 2. Structure and components of a Fuzzy System.\n\
    The Fuzziﬁer maps a real crisp input to a fuzzy function and, therefore, determines\n\
    the degree of membership of the input to a vague concept (categories using the\
    \ fuzzy sets).\nThe values of the input variables are mapped to the range of values\
    \ of the corresponding\nuniverse of discourse. The range and resolution of input-fuzzy\
    \ sets and their effect on the\nfuzziﬁcation process are considered to be factors\
    \ that affect the overall performance of\nthe system.\nThe knowledge base comprises\
    \ the knowledge of the application domain. It can be\nsplit into a database of\
    \ deﬁnitions used to express linguistic control rules in the controller\nand a\
    \ rule base that describes the knowledge held by the experts in the domain. Intuitively,\n\
    the knowledge base is the core element of a fuzzy controller as it will contain\
    \ all the\ninformation necessary to accomplish its execution tasks.\nThe Inference\
    \ Engine provides the decision-making logic of the controller. It deduces\nthe\
    \ fuzzy control actions by employing fuzzy implications and fuzzy rules of inference.\
    \ In\nmany aspects, it can be viewed as an emulation of human decision-making.\
    \ Finally, the\nDefuzziﬁcation process converts fuzzy control values into crisp\
    \ quantities; that is, it links\na single point to a fuzzy set, given that the\
    \ point belongs to the support of the fuzzy set.\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n8 of\
    \ 34\nThere are many de-fuzziﬁcation techniques, the most famous being the center-of-area\
    \ or\ncenter-of-gravity.\n2.2.5. Probabilistic Reasoning\nProbabilistic Reasoning\
    \ states that users can infer plausible models to explain input\ndata. Thus, a\
    \ model can predict an output based on new, unknown input data, which allows\n\
    decisions to be made regarding future actions. In this context of predictions,\
    \ uncertainty\nplays a relevant role for three reasons [53]. First, uncertainty\
    \ can be introduced from noisy\ninput data into the training process of a model.\
    \ Secondly, input data can be consistent with\ndifferent models, and therefore\
    \ which model is more appropriate for the data at hand is\nuncertain. And third,\
    \ a model can have diverse parameters (e.g., the coefﬁcients of linear\nregression)\
    \ and/or different inner structures (e.g., the architecture of ANNs); hence, there\n\
    is uncertainty regarding the speciﬁcations for a concrete model [54].\nFrom a\
    \ general perspective, the basic foundations of Probabilistic Reasoning are\n\
    condensed in the Bayesian learning paradigm [54]. Primarily, probability distributions\
    \ are\nconsidered to represent all uncertainties that can interfere in a model\
    \ (e.g., noise in the input\ndata, the model’s parameters). Then, the basic rules\
    \ of probability theory are considered\nto infer unobserved quantities given the\
    \ observed data. Thus, the process of learning\nfrom data occurs through the transformation\
    \ of the prior probability distributions (deﬁned\nbefore having the input data)\
    \ into posterior distributions (after observing the data).\nThe assumptions mentioned\
    \ above are supported by two of the basic rules of prob-\nability theory. They\
    \ are the sum rule and the product rule, which can be expressed as\nP(x) = ∑y∈Y\
    \ P(x, y) and P(x, y) = P(x)P(y | x), respectively. Here x and y correspond to\n\
    observed or uncertain quantities, taking values in sets X and Y. P(x) is the probability\
    \ of x\nregarding the frequency of observing a particular value. P(x, y) is the\
    \ joint probability of\nobserving x and y, and P(y|x) is the probability of y\
    \ conditioned on observing a concrete x\nvalue. Keeping these two probability\
    \ theory rules in mind, x and y can be integrated into\nthe Bayes’ theorem to\
    \ describe the probability of an event based on the prior knowledge\nof conditions\
    \ that might be related to the event. In the context of Statistical Learning,\
    \ this\ntheorem is stated as P(θ | D, m) = P(D|θ,m)P(θ|m)\nP(D|m)\n. Here, P(D\
    \ | θ, m) is the likelihood of\nparameters θ in model m, P(θ | m) is the prior\
    \ probability of θ, and P(θ | D, m) is the\nposterior probability of θ given data\
    \ x.\nThus, learning is the transformation of prior knowledge or assumptions regarding\
    \ the\nparameters P(θ | m), through data D, into the posterior knowledge about\
    \ the parameters\nP(θ | D, m). Such a posterior distribution then becomes prior\
    \ knowledge for future data\npredictions. Within this framework, the most typical\
    \ methods used over the last few years\nwere Bayesian networks [55]. Other representative\
    \ techniques are Markov networks and\nRandom Fields [56].\n2.2.6. Summary of CI-Based\
    \ Approaches\nHaving presented the families of CI methods usually considered in\
    \ FSC, this section\nintroduces a summary of the methods presented above and their\
    \ strengths and weak-\nnesses (Table 1). First of all, we would like to point\
    \ out that this list of advantages and\ndisadvantages does not refer to a comparison\
    \ between the different categories of methods\nconsidered in this paper, as they\
    \ are often used to solve different types of problems and\ntherefore the comparison\
    \ is not straightforward. Instead, these strengths and weaknesses\nrefer to a\
    \ comparison between CI-based approaches versus non CI-based approaches that\n\
    are used to solve similar categories of problems.\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n9 of\

    \ are two-fold. First, it reviews the related work at the\npoint where FSC and\
    \ CI meet, in order to identify previous contributions regarding the\nclassiﬁcation\
    \ of FSC problems, and the CI methods used to solve them. Having already\nintroduced\
    \ these previous studies, the ﬁnal part of this section is devoted to presenting\
    \ the\nmain novelty and contributions of this paper.\nIn 2012, Grifﬁs et al. [11]\
    \ focused on the distribution stage of an FSC to present an\noverview of CI-based\
    \ optimization methods that can play a relevant role for problems like\nvehicle\
    \ routing, supply chain risks, and disruptions. The authors emphasized how meta-\n\
    heuristic techniques provide near-optimal solutions to logistics problems. Following\
    \ this\nline of research, in 2016, Wari and Zhu [12] presented an updated survey\
    \ on applying meta-\nheuristics to solve optimization problems in the processing\
    \ (e.g., fermentation, thermal\ndrying, and distillation) and distribution (e.g.,\
    \ warehousing location, production planning,\nand scheduling) stages of an FSC.\
    \ More recently, in 2017, Kamilaris et al. [7] reviewed\narticles on smart farming\
    \ to show how digital technologies can enhance the circularity of\nthe FSC at\
    \ the production stage. They highlighted the problems that can be approached by\n\
    utilizing CI-based Statistical Learning, ANNs, and DL methods.\nComplementary\
    \ to the advances reported by Kamilaris et al. [7], in 2020, Sharma et al. [15]\n\
    and Misra et al. [2] carried out a bibliometric analysis and a review, respectively,\
    \ of CI-\nbased Statistical Learning applications over the whole FSC. Based on\
    \ their results, the\nauthors designed a series of recommendations to design and\
    \ deploy Statistical Learning-\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n10 of 34\nbased solutions\
    \ for data-driven decision-making processes in the FSC. In the same year,\nCamarena\
    \ [10] made a critical analysis of what can be done with Artiﬁcial Intelligence,\n\
    without emphasizing any single method in particular, for the transition to a sustainable\n\
    FSC. Lastly, the studies of Liakos et al. [6] and Saiz-Rubio and Rovira-Mas [9],\
    \ in 2018 and\n2020, respectively, presented comprehensive reviews of research\
    \ directed at the application\nof ML in the FSC production stage. The authors\
    \ surveyed how ML can help farmers make\nmore informed decisions on the management\
    \ of agriculture and livestock systems.\nFigure 3 presents a synthesis of the\
    \ studies described above and highlights how this\narticle complements and extends\
    \ the existing literature. Each cited paper is represented\nby a grey circle,\
    \ which can have one or two inner circles (green and blue). Green circles\nrepresent\
    \ FSC stages covered by a study, while blue circles depict the CI approaches\n\
    considered within it. The size of the circle is determined by the number of FSC\
    \ stages and\nCI techniques considered in each article. Thus, a green circle would\
    \ have the biggest size if\nthe paper to which it belongs addresses the four basic\
    \ stages of the FSC. The same logic is\nused for the blue circles: the more families\
    \ of methods a paper considers, the bigger the\ncircle’s size would be. Furthermore,\
    \ we can ﬁnd our research article in the center of the\nﬁgure in the violet circle.\n\
    Figure 3. Motivations and state-of-the-art concepts at the point where FSC and\
    \ CI meet.\nAccording to Figure 3 we can see that there are no research articles\
    \ that present a\ncomprehensive taxonomy at the point where FSC problems and CI\
    \ converge. This means\nthat there are no research studies that consider the problems\
    \ of the four basic FSC stages,\nnor the diversity of the CI methods that can\
    \ be applied to solve them. Instead, most of the\npapers focus on one or two FSC\
    \ stages, and they tend to review the role a unique CI family\nof methods has\
    \ over them. Therefore, we propose a new taxonomy that embraces the\ncomplete\
    \ FSC and the ﬁve families of CI methods most commonly used in the FSC stages.\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n11 of 34\nFurthermore, our proposal extends the previous\
    \ classiﬁcation efforts by adding a new\ncategorization attribute, which indicates\
    \ the type of FSC problem being addressed from\na CI perspective. In addition\
    \ to increasing the classiﬁcation capacity of our taxonomy,\nthis attribute allows\
    \ us to establish a novel mapping between the FSC problems and the\ntypologies\
    \ of CI problems that can be used to approach the former ones. By doing so,\n\
    we contribute to facilitating the choice of the most convenient family of CI methods\
    \ to\nuse depending on the FSC problem at hand. This represents a valuable and\
    \ novel source\nof information for FSC researchers and practitioners who aim to\
    \ incorporate CI-based\nsolutions into their FSC applications.\n3. A Taxonomy\
    \ of CI-Based Problems in the Food Supply Chain\nThis section introduces details\
    \ of the taxonomy proposed. First, Section 3.1 presents\nthe methodology followed\
    \ to design the taxonomy. Then, Sections 3.3 and 3.4 show the\ntaxonomy’s structure\
    \ and describe its parts. Finally, Section 3.5 gives an overview of the\ncategorization\
    \ of FSC problems, from a CI perspective, using the taxonomy.\n3.1. Methodology\
    \ for the Design of the Taxonomy\nThis section introduces the methodology followed\
    \ to build the taxonomy proposed.\nFirst, we note that this research paper does\
    \ not aim to carry out a systematic literature\nreview or survey. Instead, our\
    \ scope lies in searching and reviewing the representative\nliterature to propose\
    \ a taxonomy that describes and categorizes FSC problems and how\nthey are solved\
    \ from a CI-based perspective. As such, the taxonomy proposed does not seek\n\
    to identify all details associated with the FSC problems to maintain its comprehensibility\n\
    and size. It is designed according to core characteristics that may alter the\
    \ complexity and\nmodeling of FSC problems from the CI perspective.\nWith these\
    \ ideas in mind, Figure 4 shows the methodology followed to build the\ntaxonomy\
    \ introduced in this research paper. This methodology follows a structure-based\n\
    literature review that includes the steps depicted in Figure 4. The ﬁrst step\
    \ is named Scope\n& Research Question, which aims to limit the areas of knowledge\
    \ to be consulted; that is,\nthe point where FSC and CI converge. For this step,\
    \ the research questions that guided\nour search were: “What are the most common\
    \ FSC problems reported in the literature?”,\n“What are the CI methods typically\
    \ used to approach these problems?”, “How can FSC\nbe categorized from a CI perspective?”,\
    \ and “Is there any taxonomy to categorize FSC\nproblems considering a CI approach?”.\n\
    Figure 4. Steps followed to build the proposed taxonomy.\nThe following step deﬁned\
    \ the search set-up. We deﬁne the keywords, periods,\nonline resources, and criteria\
    \ to search and review the scientiﬁc literature. The keywords\nconsidered were:\
    \ Food Supply Chain(s), agrifood, ﬁsh farming, agriculture, livestock,\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 6910\n12 of 34\nproduction, processing, distribution, logistics, retail,\
    \ computational intelligence machine\nlearning, deep learning, meta-heuristics,\
    \ fuzzy systems, and probabilistic methods. The\nperiod was between 2012 and 2020,\
    \ and the bibliographic resources searched were the\nWeb of Science, Scopus, and\
    \ Google Scholar. Finally, the main criteria for selecting and\nreviewing the\
    \ literature was that they be review or survey papers. The latter is based on\n\
    the fact that this type of paper offers a general and consolidated overview of\
    \ the state-of-\nthe-art concerning CI-based FSC problems reported in the literature.\
    \ Moreover, these types\nof papers allowed us to know if any taxonomy was previously\
    \ proposed to classify the\nFSC problems.\nThe next stage in Figure 4 is search,\
    \ select, and review. Using the search set-up\nmentioned above, we identiﬁed the\
    \ survey and review papers introduced in the Motivation\nSection 2.3. Next, we\
    \ analyzed the FSC problems considered in these papers, the FSC stages\nwhere\
    \ the problems were located, and the families of CI methods usually considered\
    \ to\napproach these FSC problems.\nBased on the ﬁndings mentioned above, we moved\
    \ to the ﬁnal step of the methodology\nshown in Figure 4. The objective was to\
    \ design a new taxonomy that embraces the\ncomplete FSC and the ﬁve families of\
    \ CI methods most commonly used in the FSC stages.\nThis taxonomy also intends\
    \ to expand the previous classiﬁcation efforts by adding a\nnew categorization\
    \ attribute, indicating the type of FSC problem addressed from a CI\nperspective.\
    \ Thus, we characterized how the FSC problems identiﬁed in the previous\nstep\
    \ can be modeled from a CI perspective. To do so, we considered the typologies\n\
    of problems in the CI domain (problem-solving, uncertain knowledge and reasoning,\n\
    knowledge discovery and function approximation, and communication and perception)\n\
    that better suited the families of CI methods considered in the studies reviewed.\n\
    Having built the taxonomy, we checked its robustness and ability to discriminate\n\
    papers that approached different FSC problems. To accomplish this aim, we extracted\n\
    relevant references cited by the review and survey papers previously identiﬁed,\
    \ as well as\nthe recent literature, and mapped them into the proposed taxonomy.\
    \ This is shown in the\nfollowing section, where the taxonomy is introduced, to\
    \ validate its classiﬁcation power.\n3.2. The Taxonomy Overview\nThe taxonomy\
    \ aims, ﬁrstly, to extend the previous classiﬁcation efforts on FSC prob-\nlems\
    \ to cover all stages of Agrifood supply chains; and, secondly, to add a new level\
    \ of\ncategorization that allows typologies of FSC problems to be mapped to typologies\
    \ of CI\nproblems. We can see the structure of the proposed taxonomy in Figure\
    \ 5. As we can see,\nin level one, the taxonomy includes the four basic stages\
    \ of an FSC that were introduced in\nSection 2.2.1; that is, production, processing,\
    \ distribution, and retail. Then, in level two, it\ncontains the different categories\
    \ of FSC problems that we can ﬁnd in each stage. It is impor-\ntant to clarify\
    \ that although these FSC problems have been reported previously, in related\n\
    studies [2,6–12], to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that their\
    \ deﬁnitions are\nuniﬁed and consolidated in one taxonomy. Lastly, in level three,\
    \ the taxonomy introduces\nthe typologies of problems from a CI perspective. Speciﬁcally,\
    \ this level seeks to classify\nthe FSC problems depending on how they can be\
    \ modeled and solved by CI methods.\nHaving presented the structure of the taxonomy,\
    \ the following Section 3.3 details\nthe FSC problems identiﬁed for the production,\
    \ processing, distribution, and retail stages.\nThose problems represent the second\
    \ level of the taxonomy. They are formally deﬁned\nfrom a purely FSC perspective,\
    \ and we clearly state the key objective of each problem\nwithin the particular\
    \ chain stage where it is identiﬁed. Afterwards, Section 3.4 presents\nthe third\
    \ level of the taxonomy that contains the attributes to categorize the FSC problems\n\
    of level 2 under a CI approach. These attributes correspond to the four typologies\
    \ of CI\nproblems that are more commonly used in the literature to address FSC\
    \ problems. Finally,\nSection 3.5 introduces the classiﬁcation and mapping of\
    \ FSC problems according to how\nthey can be modeled by CI typologies.\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 6910\n13 of 34\nFigure 5. A taxonomy of computational intelligence\
    \ in an FSC.\n3.3. Level 2: Identiﬁcation and Deﬁnition of Food Supply Chain Problems\n\
    In this section, we present the FSC problems identiﬁed for each of the FSC stages\n\
    shown in Figure 5, which corresponds to the second level of our taxonomy. These\
    \ problems\nare formally deﬁned in more detail below.\n3.3.1. Production Problems\n\
    The FSC production stage can be split into three main production systems: ﬁsh\n\
    farming, agriculture, and livestock. These three production systems and their\
    \ associated\nproblems can be observed in Figure 6 and they are deﬁned below.\n\
    Figure 6. FSC problems in the production stage.\nFish farming (also known as pisciculture)\
    \ is the production system concerned with\nraising ﬁsh in closed environments,\
    \ such as ponds or tanks, for human consumption. Nowa-\ndays nearly half of the\
    \ ﬁsh consumed in the word are raised in artiﬁcial environments [57].\nFish farming\
    \ production has a high degree of complexity as it involves interrelated physical\n\
    (e.g., water and nutrient supply), chemical (e.g., pH, oxygen), and environmental\
    \ (e.g.,\nwaste generated) elements. Therefore, the management of this process\
    \ requires advanced\nsensing, control, and communication technologies as well\
    \ as expert knowledge to make\nefﬁcient and sustainable decisions, and maximize\
    \ the productivity. Within this context, the\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n14 of 34\n\
    most typical CI-based processes reported in the literature are ﬁsh weight estimation\
    \ [58],\nproduction estimation, and optimization [59]. Their deﬁnitions are presented\
    \ below.\n•\nFish weight estimation: This process estimates ﬁsh weight considering\
    \ morphological\nfeatures (e.g., length, width, and mass).\n•\nProduction estimation\
    \ and optimization: This process is centered on the optimiza-\ntion of ﬁsh production\
    \ and forecasting of seasonal demand to adjust the production.\nTo accomplish\
    \ such aims, the optimization of production is carried out by monitoring\ncrucial\
    \ elements of ﬁsh ponds, like water oxygen levels, nutrients, and food supply,\n\
    which inﬂuence the growth of ﬁsh. Meanwhile, historical records of seasonal de-\n\
    mand are stored and continuously analyzed to determine the most suitable levels\
    \ of\nproduction depending on the year and season.\nThe following production system\
    \ considered in this study is agriculture, in particular,\nhorticulture. Horticulture\
    \ is the greenhouse industry dedicated to plant cultivation and\nprocessing of\
    \ different types of crops for food and commercial consumption (e.g., ﬂowers,\n\
    fruits and nuts, vegetables and herbs). The main challenges of these production\
    \ systems\nare to improve plant growth, yields, quality, nutritional value, and\
    \ resistance to insects,\ndiseases, and environmental stress.\nIn order to achieve\
    \ these improvements, different processes are managed to try and\nmaintain a balance\
    \ between efﬁciency, productivity, and sustainability, such as monitoring\nand\
    \ controlling indoor-outdoor climate conditions, crop management, and production\
    \ fore-\ncasting, among others. They are commonly approached in the specialized\
    \ literature [6,9,60]\nin open-ﬁeld agriculture and intensive horticulture. Within\
    \ the most representative pro-\ncesses, we ﬁnd the crop yield and harvest forecasting\
    \ [60–62], crop protection [63,64],\nweather prediction and irrigation management\
    \ [65,66], and site-speciﬁc nutrient manage-\nment [67,68]. These processes, which\
    \ are shown in Figure 6, are deﬁned as follows.\n•\nCrop yield and harvesting\
    \ prediction: This problem is focused on yield estimation\nto match crop supply\
    \ with demand and on crop management to increase productivity.\n•\nCrop protection:\
    \ This is based on the identiﬁcation and diagnosis of biotic (infesta-\ntions,\
    \ diseases, and weeds) and abiotic (nutrients, water deﬁciency) stress factors\
    \ that\naffect crop productivity.\n•\nWeather prediction and irrigation management:\
    \ This problem is mainly concerned\nwith weather forecasting for the optimal use\
    \ of water, which enables the design and\ndeployment of crop irrigation scheduling\
    \ and planning.\n•\nSite-speciﬁc nutrient management: This is based on the management\
    \ of soil quality\nto determine which nutrients need to be supplied in order to\
    \ maintain the chemical\ncharacteristics required for the crop under consideration.\n\
    Lastly, the third production system considered for the production stage is livestock.\n\
    This production system is dedicated to the growth and management of domestic animals\n\
    (e.g., cattle, sheep, and goats) raised in agricultural settings to generate food\
    \ products like\nmeat, eggs, or milk, among others. Livestock can be carried out\
    \ through either extensive or\nintensive systems. Extensive systems involve animals\
    \ roaming grasslands (usually under\nthe supervision of a herdsman). Diversely,\
    \ intensive livestock is located in closed infras-\ntructures and is equipped\
    \ with ICT technology, which enables animals to be monitored\nin real-time. Within\
    \ these production systems the most typical problems we come across\nare grassland\
    \ monitoring [69], animal welfare [70], animal behavior tracking [71], and\nlivestock\
    \ production prediction and optimization [72,73], as shown in Figure 6. The formal\n\
    deﬁnitions of these problems from an FSC perspective are listed below.\n•\nGrassland\
    \ monitoring: This problem is related to the accurate identiﬁcation of grass-\n\
    land inventories in order to discriminate between the most suitable types for\
    \ live-\nstock purposes.\n•\nAnimal welfare: This is focused on the pattern classiﬁcation\
    \ of ingestive behavior in\ngrazing animals for studies of animal nutrition, growth,\
    \ and health.\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n15 of 34\n•\nAnimal behavior tracking:\
    \ This is based on the use of behavior analysis to detect\nearly signs of health\
    \ issues and promote early intervention.\n•\nLivestock production: This problem\
    \ is centered on predictions and estimations of\nfarming parameters to optimize\
    \ the economic-energy efﬁciency and sustainability of\nproduction systems.\n3.3.2.\
    \ Processing Problems\nOnce the raw materials of food products have been grown,\
    \ they are delivered to the\nnext step of the FSC, or ‘processing’. Different\
    \ industrial processes (e.g., washing, disinfect-\ning, packaging) are carried\
    \ out in this stage to transform the raw output of production into\nedible food\
    \ products. Depending on the production system under consideration and the\nfood\
    \ products obtained from them, diverse industrial processes can be followed to\
    \ obtain\nthe goods that move on to the distribution stage. However, in spite\
    \ of such production\nparticularities, we have identiﬁed a set of common problems\
    \ that could occur in the three\nproduction systems presented in the section above.\
    \ These problems are shown in Figure 7\nand they are: demand prediction [74],\
    \ production planning for distribution [75], prediction\nof post-harvest losses\
    \ [76], and manufacturing industry processes, such as cooking, drying,\nand others\
    \ [77].\nFigure 7. FSC problems in the processing stage.\n•\nDemand prediction:\
    \ This problem in concerneed with the demand prediction of food\nrequirements\
    \ to avoid overstocking, overproduction, and over-utilization of resources.\n\
    The key idea is to estimate the quantity of food products that will be sold to\
    \ deﬁne\nhow much raw material needs to be processed.\n•\nProduction planning\
    \ for distribution: This is centered on production planning to\nmatch distribution\
    \ requirements. This problem is mostly determined by the sale\nvolumes that a\
    \ particular food product is expected to have.\n•\nPrediction of post-harvest\
    \ losses: This is focused on making estimations of food\nlosses associated with\
    \ the processing procedures carried out after harvesting raw\nmaterials coming\
    \ from the production stage.\n•\nFood manufacturing industry: This is associated\
    \ with the optimization of the pro-\ncessing technologies required to transform\
    \ raw foods into edible food (e.g., thermal,\ndrying, contact cooking, microwave\
    \ heating, etc.). These processes are performed\nusing industrial machinery.\n\
    3.3.3. Distribution Problems\nIn the third step of the food supply chain, food\
    \ products ready for human consumption\nare received from the processing stage\
    \ to be delivered to end-consumers. Speciﬁcally,\nﬁnished products arrive at warehouses,\
    \ and from there, the shipment department is\nin charge of deﬁning the most suitable\
    \ strategy to deliver products to end-consumers.\nThe essential purpose is to\
    \ distribute food products on time by the date speciﬁed in the\nretail stage.\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n16 of 34\nFor this particular stage of the FSC, the most\
    \ common problems reported in the spe-\ncialized literature are shown in Figure\
    \ 8 and deﬁned below. These problems include vehicle\nrouting and ﬂeet management\
    \ [78,79], storage location assignment [80,81], prediction of\nsupply chain risks\
    \ and disruptions [82,83], shelf life prediction and maturity level [84–86],\n\
    demand forecasting [87], and last mile delivery [88].\nFigure 8. FSC problems\
    \ in the distribution stage.\n•\nVehicle routing and ﬂeet management: This is\
    \ focused on determining the most\noptimal route for the delivery of food under\
    \ different scenario constraints (e.g., size of\nthe ﬂeet, fuel availability,\
    \ etc.).\n•\nStorage location assignment problem: This problem is concerned with\
    \ deciding the\nmost suitable way to store food products in a set of warehouses\
    \ in order to cope with\ndaily demand operations.\n•\nPrediction of supply chain\
    \ risks and disruptions: This is concerned with the fore-\ncasting of potential\
    \ disruptions in the logistics of food products and their associated\nfood losses.\n\
    •\nShelf life prediction and maturity level: This problem is related to the forecasting\
    \ of\nshelf life based on data sensed during the distribution process.\n•\nDemand\
    \ forecasting: This consists of understanding demand behaviors and forecast-\n\
    ing user demand generated from the retail stage. Thus, it is possible to optimize\
    \ the\ndelivery routes and warehouse locations used during the distribution stage.\n\
    •\nLast mile delivery: This problem is dedicated to the delivery of food products\
    \ using\nthe local road transport network (last mile) of cities.\n3.3.4. Retail\
    \ Problems\nIn the ﬁnal part of the FSC, we ﬁnd the retail stage. At this point,\
    \ food products are\nreceived through the distribution channels, ready for sale.\
    \ This stage encompasses the\nconcept of an ’end-consumer’, which could be supermarkets\
    \ or clients that go to these\nplaces to buy food products. The most common problems\
    \ identiﬁed in the literature for\nthis stage of the supply chain are deﬁned below\
    \ and are also summarized in Figure 9.\nLastly, we characterized the retail stage\
    \ (Figure 5). Retail-related problems commonly\naddressed with CI, in this link\
    \ of the FSC, are diet and nutrition applications [89,90],\nfood consumption and\
    \ food waste [91,92], consumer demand, perception and buying\nbehavior [93,94],\
    \ dynamic discounting based on the sell-by date [95], and day demand\nprediction\
    \ and inventory management [74].\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n17 of 34\nFigure 9.\
    \ FSC problems in the retail stage.\n•\nDiet and Nutrition: This is based on estimating\
    \ nutrient values using the classiﬁcation\nof food dishes and dietary assessment.\n\
    •\nFood consumption and food waste: This problem is associated with the identification\n\
    and prediction of food waste based on the buying and storage behavior of end-customers.\n\
    •\nConsumer demand, perception, and buying behavior: This problem is focused on\n\
    determining consumer proﬁles in order to predict buying behaviors and support\
    \ the\nmanagement of shop counters.\n•\nDynamic discounting based on sell-by date:\
    \ This is centered on automated price\nchanges at supermarkets based on the sell-by\
    \ date. The objective is to offer larger\ndiscounts for items with the shortest\
    \ remaining shelf life.\n•\nDaily demand prediction and inventory management:\
    \ This problem consists of\npredicting daily demand to better manage product stocks\
    \ at supermarkets.\n3.4. Level 3: Typologies of CI Problems\nIn this section,\
    \ we introduce the attributes that represent the most typical typologies\nof CI\
    \ modeling approaches used in the FSC literature. The attributes correspond to\
    \ the\nthird level of the taxonomy shown in Figure 5, and they are presented below.\n\
    •\nProblem-solving: This category is related to problems of complex decision-making\n\
    processes that need to be solved, keeping two key objectives in mind: quality\
    \ of the\nsolution and the computational time required to solve it. As a common\
    \ denominator,\nthis attribute categorizes problems that are NP-hard. Thus, this\
    \ class embodies FSC\nproblems for which there is no certainty that the method\
    \ can optimally solve them\nin a polynomial time (time complexity [96]) with respect\
    \ to the input data size. This\ncategory includes, for example, optimization or\
    \ search problems such as the vehicle\nrouting problem in the transportation stage\
    \ of the FSC.\n•\nUncertain knowledge and reasoning: This category corresponds\
    \ to FSC problems\ncharacterized by having partially observable, non-deterministic,\
    \ vague, or imprecise\ndata. In such uncertain scenarios, this attribute represents\
    \ problems that can be\naddressed in two possible ways. First, by using an approach\
    \ that acts based on\nassumptions of uncertain input data in order to give a probabilistic-based\
    \ solution\nto the problem at hand. Or second, by representing and reasoning with\
    \ the partially\navailable information in a manner similar to the way that humans\
    \ express knowledge\nand summarize data. This second approach allows non-exact\
    \ data to be represented\nin linguist terms in order to make decisions within\
    \ certain margins of correctness.\n•\nKnowledge discovery and function approximation:\
    \ This class represents FSC prob-\nlems that are distinguished by having large\
    \ volumes of data, which enable under-\nstanding and useful knowledge to be extracted\
    \ from them. Such knowledge could be\nused to make either predictions of future\
    \ events or discrimination and recognition of\npatterns. These types of problems\
    \ can usually be addressed with methods that can be\ntrained using the available\
    \ data to learn a speciﬁc task.\n•\nCommunication and perception: This category\
    \ consists of FSC problems focused\non the automatic extraction, analysis, and\
    \ understanding of information obtained\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n18 of 34\nfrom\
    \ digital images, texts, or voice recordings. It is worth noting that within the\
    \ FSC\ndomain, most problems solved using a communication and perception approach\
    \ are\nfocused on designing and developing autonomous computer vision systems.\
    \ These\nsystems are able to process high-dimensional data to support decision-making;\
    \ from\nobject detection to video tracking and object recognition.\n3.5. Mapping\
    \ Process between Level 2 and Level 3: Classiﬁcation of FSC Problems from a\n\
    CI Perspective\nThis section presents the categorization of FSC problems previously\
    \ identiﬁed in\nSection 3.3 from a CI perspective. Speciﬁcally, every problem\
    \ is categorized according\nto the four typologies of CI problems that we described\
    \ above: problem-solving, uncer-\ntain knowledge and reasoning, knowledge discovery\
    \ and function approximation, and\ncommunication and perception. In addition,\
    \ using relevant work from the recent FSC\nliterature, we show how the taxonomy\
    \ is able to effectively and robustly discriminate these\npapers. Thus, Section\
    \ 3.5.1 is devoted to classifying the FSC problems coming from the\nproduction\
    \ stage. Then, Section 3.5.2 introduces the classiﬁcation of problems deﬁned for\n\
    the processing stage. Lastly, Sections 3.5.3 and 3.5.4 expose the categorization\
    \ of problems\nfor the distribution and retail phases, respectively.\n3.5.1. Classiﬁcation\
    \ of Production Problems\nFigure 10 presents the categorization of production\
    \ problems for the ﬁsh farming\nand livestock cases. The attributes of the taxonomy\
    \ are depicted on the left in Figure 10,\nwhereas the ﬁsh farming (in purple)\
    \ and livestock (in red) problems are found on the right.\nThe problems and attributes\
    \ are connected by gray bars that connect the ways in which a\nspeciﬁc problem\
    \ can be modeled from a CI perspective. Fish weight estimation, grassland\nmonitoring,\
    \ animal welfare, and animal behavior tracking are problems that are classiﬁed\n\
    using the communication and perception attribute. This is justiﬁed due to the\
    \ fact that\nthese problems are usually characterized by having image and video\
    \ records as input\ndata (non-structured data). Having such data implies the use\
    \ of automatic information\nextraction by means of computer vision systems, based\
    \ on DL, which allow extraction of\nhigh-dimensional patterns embedded in image\
    \ and video data [97–103].\nFigure 10. Fish farming and livestock problems classiﬁed\
    \ by the proposed taxonomy.\nThe production estimation and optimization and livestock\
    \ production problems in\nFigure 10 are classiﬁed using the knowledge discovery\
    \ and function approximation and\nuncertain knowledge and reasoning attributes.\
    \ Such categorization is determined by the\ncentral characteristics of these problems,\
    \ which are concerned with the prediction and\noptimization of production values\
    \ using historical data records (structured data) [104,105].\nBesides, production\
    \ forecasting contains uncertainties regarding external factors of the\nproduction\
    \ systems, which encourage the use of probabilistic methods, such as the studies\n\
    carried out by [106,107].\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n19 of 34\nFigure 11 shows the\
    \ categorization of agriculture problems. As we can seen, crop\nprotection, which\
    \ usually involves video and image records, is categorized as a com-\nmunication\
    \ and perception problem commonly used in DL methods like convolutional\nand recurrent\
    \ neural networks [108–110]. On the other hand, the remaining agricultural\nproblems\
    \ can be categorized under knowledge discovery and function approximation,\nproblem-solving,\
    \ and uncertain knowledge and reasoning attributes as explained below.\nIn terms\
    \ of knowledge discovery and function approximation, this attribute categorizes\n\
    problems focused on the prediction of greenhouse conditions for the optimal management\n\
    of crop production, nutrients, and irrigation supply. This can be done using supervised\n\
    learning techniques that forecast variables of interest like temperature, water,\
    \ or nitro-\ngen [6,111]. Secondly, the problem-solving attribute categorizes\
    \ the weather prediction and\nirrigation management and the site-speciﬁc management\
    \ problems. These problems can be\ndeﬁned as optimization scenarios in which we\
    \ can ﬁnd concrete values associated with\nweather, irrigation, and nutrients.\
    \ In this case, the most common approach to solving them\nis based on meta-heuristics\
    \ [112–114].\nFinally, the uncertain knowledge and reasoning attributes characterize\
    \ the same prob-\nlems that fall into the knowledge discovery and function approximation\
    \ attribute. The\ndifference lies in the fact that the agriculture problems are\
    \ approached as decision systems\nunder uncertainty. In this case, fuzzy logic\
    \ is the most suitable strategy to accomplish such\nan aim [115–117] Speciﬁcally,\
    \ the fuzzy approach allows us to evaluate whether particular\nactions need to\
    \ be taken according to sensed and predicted conditions coming from agri-\nculture\
    \ systems (e.g., optimal management strategies for the control of temperature\
    \ control\ninside greenhouse systems).\nFigure 11. Agriculture problems classiﬁed\
    \ by the proposed taxonomy.\n3.5.2. Classiﬁcation of Processing Problems\nHaving\
    \ presented the production stage, Figure 12 features the categorization of prob-\n\
    lems in the processing stage. Any of the depicted FSC problems are classiﬁed using\
    \ the\ncommunication and perception attribute, mainly because the type of input\
    \ data they handle\nis not associated with images or video records. In contrast,\
    \ when the aim is to determine\nfuture scenarios based on the available data,\
    \ all problems tend to have historical data as\ntheir input data.\nPrecisely,\
    \ the knowledge discovery and function approximation attribute categorizes\nthe\
    \ prediction of post-harvest losses and demand prediction problems as being super-\n\
    vised learning problems, whose aims are to claasify and forecast the objective\
    \ variable.\nFor instance, we consider research from [8,118] to be within this\
    \ category. Following the\ntaxonomy’s attributes in Figure 12, the problem-solving\
    \ attribute can represent and model\ndemand predictions, the food manufacturing\
    \ industry, and production planning for dis-\ntribution problems. In this scenario,\
    \ they are classiﬁed as being optimization problems,\nwith the objective of optimizing\
    \ procedures related to the problems listed. An example, for\ninstance, could\
    \ be the optimization of industrial manufacturing processes, like heating and\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n20 of 34\ndrying, using meta-heuristic techniques. Examples\
    \ of studies categorized by the taxonomy\nof the previously mentioned approaches\
    \ are found in [119,120].\nLastly, the uncertain knowledge and reasoning attribute\
    \ system also classiﬁes produc-\ntion planning for distribution problems. Probabilistic\
    \ methods tend to be used to approach\nthese kind of problems as production planning\
    \ can incorporate uncertainty coming from\nprocesses that are not directly related\
    \ to the production process, which can cope with\nprobability theory [121]. An\
    \ example of this last situation could be a change in the delivery\ndate due to\
    \ delays attributable to the weather [122].\nFigure 12. Processing problems classiﬁed\
    \ by the proposed taxonomy.\n3.5.3. Classiﬁcation of Distribution Problems\nFigure\
    \ 13 exhibits the classiﬁcation of FSC problems in the distribution stage. Unlike\n\
    the two previous stages (production and processing), the predominant approaches\
    \ here are\nthe ones imposed by the problem-solving and knowledge discovery and\
    \ function approxi-\nmation attributes. The former attribute categorizes vehicle\
    \ routing and ﬂeet management,\nthe storage location assignment problem, and last\
    \ mile delivery problems, as they are\ndevoted to optimizing routing and delivery\
    \ situations. The purpose of these applications\nis to optimize, using meta-heuristics,\
    \ a concrete goal under different constraints; for in-\nstance, ﬂeet size, available\
    \ fuel, and others. Representative studies that fall in this category\nare [123–127].\n\
    The knowledge discovery and function approximation attribute includes prediction\n\
    of chain and disruptions, a shelf life prediction and maturity level, and demand\
    \ forecasting\nproblems. This attribute classiﬁes these problems under a supervised\
    \ learning perspective,\nwhere the aim is to predict expected values, such as\
    \ we can see in research carried out\nin [84,128–131]. For instance, potential\
    \ disruptions to the cold food products chain, or an\nestimation of how much product\
    \ volume needs to be distributed to meet retail demands.\nFigure 13. Distribution\
    \ problems classiﬁed by the proposed taxonomy.\n3.5.4. Classiﬁcation of Retail\
    \ Problems\nFinally, Figure 14 introduces the classification of problems in the\
    \ retail stage of\nthe FSC. In this last step, the communication and perception\
    \ attribute appears once\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n21 of 34\nagain to represent\
    \ the problems in which the input data correspond to non-structured\ndata, such\
    \ as images (dynamic discounting, daily demand prediction, and inventory\nmanagement)\
    \ [95,132–135]. For these particular cases, the problems can be modeled using\n\
    DL techniques to determining price discounts based on stock levels inside supermarkets\n\
    and by managing inventories according to food product existence.\nContrarily,\
    \ the knowledge discovery and function approximation attribute includes\nproblems\
    \ associated with the extraction of patterns (food consumption and food waste),\n\
    the prediction of future values related to consumer demand and buying behavior,\
    \ and the\ngeneration of healthy menus or estimating nutritional values. Research\
    \ articles on this\nattribute include [89,90,136–139]. Furthermore, this attribute\
    \ can also classify the dynamic\ndiscounting and daily demand prediction and inventory\
    \ management problems when\ntheir input data corresponds to structured information\
    \ like historical records.\nIn addition to the attributes mentioned above, the\
    \ uncertain knowledge and reasoning,\nand problem-solving attributes can be used\
    \ to categorize a couple of problems in the retail\nstage. Those problems are\
    \ consumer demand, perception, and buying behavior, as well\nas daily demand prediction\
    \ and inventory management. Consumer demand, perception,\nand buying behavior\
    \ can be approached with a probabilistic system [140–142], for instance,\nuncertainty\
    \ concerning what food products are expected to be bought. Meanwhile, daily\n\
    demand prediction and inventory management can be addressed with an optimization\n\
    paradigm [143,144]. For this case, the aim is to optimize stock levels in such\
    \ a way that\nfood waste can be decreased or even to avoiding over-stocking issues\
    \ completely.\nFigure 14. Retail problems classiﬁed by the proposed taxonomy.\n\
    4. Guidelines for the Use of Computational Intelligence Approaches in the Food\n\
    Supply Chain\nHaving presented and validated the taxonomy of FSC problems, this\
    \ section presents\na set of guidelines for researchers and practitioners in FSC\
    \ for the use of CI within this\ndomain (Figure 15). Concretely, we try to guide\
    \ the users to (1) select the typology of a\nCI problem that they are addressing;\
    \ and (2) identify what families of CI methods could\nbe more suitable for the\
    \ problem at hand. The latter does not mean that in all cases the\nfamily of methods\
    \ suggested is the most appropriate, as this may depend on the speciﬁc\ncharacteristics\
    \ of the problem being addressed.\nThe guidelines depicted in Figure 15 start\
    \ with a basic question posed to the user:\n“What is the purpose and modeling\
    \ characteristics of the problem at hand?” (it could be\ncommunication and perception,\
    \ uncertain knowledge and reasoning, knowledge discovery\nand function approximation,\
    \ and problem-solving). If the purpose is the automatic analysis\nand extraction\
    \ of information from digital images to decide on the action to be taken\nregarding\
    \ the management of food supply systems (communication and perception), the\n\
    suitable family of methods would be deep neural networks (e.g., convolutional\
    \ neural\nnetworks). This family of CI methods enables the creation of computer\
    \ vision systems,\nwhich allows the environment of object characteristics to be\
    \ perceived in a visual way.\nBased on this visual analysis, these systems communicate\
    \ or recommend actions that\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n22 of 34\nachieve desired\
    \ states or match predeﬁned conditions (e.g., identify the quality of potatoes\n\
    in order to evaluate the units that are either damaged or edible).\nFigure 15.\
    \ Guidelines for the method selection problem in the food supply chain. Pd: production,\
    \ Ps:\nprocessing, D: distribution, R: retail.\nIf the objective of the user is\
    \ to handle problems characterized by partially observable,\nnon-deterministic,\
    \ or imprecise data (uncertain knowledge and reasoning), fuzzy systems\nor probabilistic\
    \ methods are recommended. For the former CI approach, it is important\nto highlight\
    \ that fuzzy systems need to be paired with hardware (e.g., PID controllers)\n\
    to work properly in food applications. This is due to the fact that hardware components\n\
    allow decisions made by fuzzy systems to be translated into actions (e.g., management\n\
    of nutrients and irrigation supply inside a greenhouse system depending on conditions\n\
    associated with temperature). Probabilistic methods are suitable for making estimations\
    \ of\nrelevant variables (e.g., planning production according to seasonal demand)\
    \ in scenarios\nwith partially observable data.\nWhen the users’ aim is directed\
    \ at making predictions from historical data, making\nclassiﬁcations that discriminate\
    \ between data categories, or ﬁnding hidden patterns in data,\nthe best modeling\
    \ approach to use is knowledge discovery and function approximation.\nFirstly,\
    \ for predictions and classiﬁcations, the user should determine the type of input\n\
    data at hand. In general terms, the input data can be structured (e.g., historical\
    \ records,\ntabular data) or unstructured (e.g., video, images). In the former,\
    \ and depending on the\ndata size, the supervised learning techniques are the\
    \ CI methods to be used when facing\nsmall, medium, and large data no bigger than\
    \ 40–50 gigabytes. Supervised DL, how-\never, is the recommended approach for\
    \ big datasets. In terms of making predictions and\nclassiﬁcations when using\
    \ unstructured data, supervised DL would be the most suitable\nlearning approach;\
    \ while unsupervised ML or unsupervised DL are the recommended\nCI approaches\
    \ for pattern analysis. Finally, as we can see in Figure 15, the other category\n\
    of problems that users might face is problem-solving. In this case, the user’s\
    \ aim is to\noptimize particular values in order to achieve a desired level of\
    \ performance. As such,\nthe above-suggested approaches are therefore all meta-heuristics\
    \ (e.g., EC, SI, and local\nsearch-based techniques).\nIn addition to the analyses\
    \ presented above, the bottom part of Figure 15 also depicts\nwhich FSC stages\
    \ the four CI modeling approaches (and their associated methods) are\nusually\
    \ applied in. Fuzzy systems and probabilistic approaches are typically considered\
    \ for\ncontrol applications in the production, processing, and retail stages.\
    \ In contrast, optimiza-\ntion with meta-heuristics and prediction-classiﬁcation-pattern\
    \ analysis with ML and DL\nare modeling perspectives that are considered in the\
    \ entire FSC process. The contributions\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n23 of 34\nof\
    \ communication and perception approaches using DL methods tend to be more typically\n\
    focused on the production and retail stages.\n5. Conclusions\nThis ﬁnal section\
    \ introduces the main reﬂections drawn from the research carried out\nin this\
    \ paper. Section 5.1 introduces the summary and conclusions. Then, Section 5.2\
    \ details\na set of challenges and research opportunities to encourage further\
    \ exploration and use of\nthe possible contributions that CI might bring to the\
    \ FSC ﬁeld.\n5.1. Summary\nThis paper has proposed a new and comprehensive taxonomy\
    \ of FSC problems\nunder a CI paradigm for three representative supply chains:\
    \ agriculture, ﬁsh farming,\nand livestock. The taxonomy was built based on three\
    \ levels in order to categorize FSC\nproblems according to how they can be modeled\
    \ using CI approaches. The ﬁrst and second\nlevels are focused on identifying\
    \ the chain stage (production, processing, distribution,\nand retail) and the\
    \ speciﬁc FSC problem to be addressed (e.g., vehicle routing problems\nin the\
    \ distribution stage). The third level presents the typologies of FSC problems\
    \ from\na CI perspective, and aims to categorize FSC problems depending on how\
    \ they can be\nmodeled and solved by CI methods. In the third level of the taxonomy\
    \ we have deﬁned\nfour attributes, presented as follows, (1) problem solving,\
    \ which is in charge of classifying\nFSC problems focused on optimizing processes;\
    \ (2) uncertain knowledge and reasoning,\nwhich concers problems that have partially\
    \ observable, non-deterministic, incomplete, or\nimprecise data; (3) knowledge\
    \ discovery and function approximation, which has the role\nof categorizing problems\
    \ that aim to make predictions of future scenarios, classiﬁcation of\nvariables,\
    \ or analysis of patterns embedded in data; (4) communication and perception,\n\
    groups FSC problems that involve computer vision systems to sensing and suggesting\n\
    plausible actions to take in order to intervene in such environments.\nTo check\
    \ the robustness of the taxonomy, we categorized FSC problems with CI\nmethods,\
    \ especially in the production, processing, distribution, and retail stages. Here,\
    \ it is\nrelevant to highlight that we introduced a set of uniﬁed deﬁnitions for\
    \ these problems. As\na result, we were able to draw some interesting conclusions.\
    \ In the ﬁsh and livestock cases\nof the production stage, using the DL and the\
    \ communication and perception attribute\nsigniﬁcantly inﬂuences applications\
    \ (e.g., ﬁsh weight estimation, grassland monitoring,\nanimal welfare) where the\
    \ input data is determined by image and video records (non-\nstructured data).\
    \ In contrast, we have the case of classic ML, which is narrowed to FSC\nproblems,\
    \ and for which, the objective is to make production predictions using historical\n\
    data records (structured data). In the case of agriculture production systems,\
    \ the scope of\nthe CI approach is broader. Speciﬁcally, we found that DL, ML,\
    \ FL, and Meta-heuristics are\nmethods for modeling production problems related\
    \ to crop protection and yield, weather\nprediction, and irrigation and nutrient\
    \ management.\nIn the processing stage, ML, meta-heuristics, and probabilistic\
    \ methods are the CI\napproaches commonly used. In terms of ML, the aim is to\
    \ extract patterns and forecast\nobjective variables like demand prediction and\
    \ prediction of post-harvest losses. As for\nmeta-heuristics and probabilistic\
    \ techniques, they aim to optimize food manufacturing\nprocesses (e.g., heating,\
    \ drying) and production planning for distribution. Further down\nin the supply\
    \ chain, the predominant family of CI methods is meta-heuristics, found in\nthe\
    \ distribution link. This data-driven approach is devoted to optimizing the routing\n\
    and delivery problems under various constraints such as ﬂeet size and available\
    \ fuel.\nLastly, DL is the principal CI approach in problems with non-structured\
    \ input data (e.g.,\ndynamic discounting, diet, and nutrition) in the retail stage.\
    \ Classical ML has been used to\nextract patterns (food consumption and food waste)\
    \ and predict consumer demand and\nbuying behavior.\nThe taxonomy allowed us to\
    \ ﬁgure out which modeling approaches are more typically\nconsidered when dealing\
    \ with problems at the four supply chain stages. In this manner,\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 6910\n24 of 34\nwe gave a general overview of well-established tendencies\
    \ regarding CI across the three\nsupply chains considered. Thus, the deﬁnition\
    \ and classiﬁcation of FSC problems helped\nus introduce guidelines for the incorporation\
    \ and use of CI in the food industry. These\nguidelines are built upon CI’s primary\
    \ purposes in the food supply chain: communication\nand perception, uncertain\
    \ knowledge and reasoning representations, knowledge discovery\nand function approximation,\
    \ and problem-solving. These guidelines aim to help non-expert\nCI users to identify\
    \ families of methods that can supply a solution for their particular CI-\nbased\
    \ needs in different FSC problems.\nIn summary, the taxonomy analysis suggests\
    \ that there is no family of CI methods\nthat best suits all FSC problems. However,\
    \ we state the need for a comparison framework\nthat allows the description and\
    \ analysis of the performance of different CI methods in\ndiverse supply chain\
    \ problems. In this context, the taxonomy presented sets up the basis\nfor a common\
    \ framework that, in further research, will facilitate experimentation in order\n\
    to determine which CI approaches are more appropriate for each type of FSC problem.\n\
    This may also help determine a suitable baseline of methods to make fair comparisons,\n\
    depending on the family of CI methods chosen for the FSC problem at hand.\n5.2.\
    \ Challenges and Research Opportunities\nAs industry 4.0 is ﬂourishing for the\
    \ FSC management and operation, emerging re-\nsearch paths arise for CI to yield\
    \ more robust, interoperable, and accurate methods [145,146].\nTherefore, this\
    \ section points out challenges and research opportunities that the community\n\
    should explore to enhance the contributions that CI can bring to the digitization\
    \ of the FSC.\nThese challenges are motivated by the gaps located at the intersection\
    \ of FSC and CI, which\nwere identiﬁed through the proposed taxonomy.\n5.2.1.\
    \ Data Fusion from Different Data Sources\nSigniﬁcantly, few CI methods can incorporate\
    \ data from different types of sources.\nBesides, in real scenarios, the data\
    \ available from a unique type of sensor might not be\nsufﬁcient to fully represent\
    \ the FSC problem that is intended to be addressed. For instance,\ndifferent Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) devices (e.g., agricultural environment monitoring sys-\ntems,\
    \ GPS, cameras) provide diverse data for the optimum management of production\n\
    systems [147–149]. Amongst the relevant data for the aforementioned example, we\
    \ ﬁnd\ntemperature, humidity, localization coordinates, crop images, and others.\n\
    As a common denominator, all the data associated with the aforementioned variables\n\
    can have a different format, ranging from historical records in the form of tables,\
    \ to non-\nstructured data like images. Additionally, all of them offer valuable\
    \ information for the\npurpose at hand (e.g., prediction of crop production or\
    \ management of pest diseases). In\nthis context, the challenge lies in deﬁning\
    \ guidelines for the harmonizing and fusion of\ndata from diverse sources. Such\
    \ guidelines should consider that each FSC stage can add\nparticularities to the\
    \ data for the CI-based problem under consideration. How to properly\ncollect\
    \ and generate a single dataset with information obtained from varied and different\n\
    sources, which are fed into a CI method, is a research opportunity that must be\
    \ addressed\nto further enhance CI contributions in the FSC domain.\nIf the integration\
    \ process is not done correctly, inconsistencies will appear, resulting in\na\
    \ decrease in the performance of CI approaches [150]. Hence, merging data from\
    \ different\ninput sources presents a notorious problem that commonly attracts\
    \ more issues, such as\ninconsistent, duplicate, redundant, and correlated data.\
    \ One potential research direction\nto take to help cope with this challenge could\
    \ be designing automatic preprocessing\napproaches that fuse and harmonize data\
    \ sources to provide the accepted input format\nof CI methods. For the latter,\
    \ it is important to note that every CI approach requires\ndifferent input data\
    \ formats, which could split the design of the aforementioned automatic\ndata\
    \ preprocessing methods into diverse paths depending on the particular family\
    \ of CI\nmethods under consideration.\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n25 of 34\n5.2.2.\
    \ Real-Time Data and Incremental Learning\nIn supervised learning, the input data\
    \ is available before starting any training pro-\ncesses. Here, the task is to\
    \ build up a model from that data using a batch approach. The\nlatter means that\
    \ DL and ML methods use all available samples in the input data to build\nand\
    \ train a model to make predictions or classiﬁcations when new data comes into\
    \ the\ntrained model. Currently, most DL and ML applications are focused on the\
    \ batch learning\napproach, wherein data are given before training the ML models\
    \ [151]. In this context,\nmodel training and optimization processes are purely\
    \ based on the aforementioned in-\nput dataset, whose data distribution is supposed\
    \ to be static. Nevertheless, such a static\napproach is not the case for real\
    \ CI-based applications within the FSC.\nDL and ML methods must real FSC scenarios,\
    \ wherein different IoT devices continu-\nously generate new data streams. For\
    \ instance, dynamic discounts in the retail stage or the\nmanagement of greenhouse\
    \ systems whose conditions must be constantly monitored to\nguarantee the optimal\
    \ control of crops are examples of real-time data streams. Therefore,\nthe key\
    \ challenge is to design ML and DL methods that adapt to real-time data, and work\n\
    with limited resources (e.g., memory), while maintaining their predictive capacities.\n\
    Further research is needed to deal with the aforementioned challenge, and should\n\
    include the concepts of incremental learning [152,153] in the design and deployment\
    \ of\nDL and ML methods in FSC problems. Furthermore, although incremental learning\
    \ is a\nsuitable strategy when dealing with the adaptation of DL and ML to real-time\
    \ data streams,\nthe concept of incremental learning brings up other issues that\
    \ must be considered when it\nis included in the FSC context. These issues are\
    \ introduced in more detail below.\nThe ﬁrst issue is related to the concept of\
    \ drift, which is associated with changes in\nthe new input data’s statistical\
    \ properties (e.g., statistical distribution), which can highly\ninﬂuence the\
    \ performance of pre-trained DL or ML methods [154]. Secondly, we have\nthe stability-plasticity\
    \ dilemma that, in noisy environments, refers to when and how to\nadapt the current\
    \ model to the new data stream [155]. On the one hand, quick updates\nenable fast\
    \ adaptations of the model according to new data; however, at the same time, old\n\
    information that could be useful later in the process is forgotten just as quickly.\
    \ On the\nother hand, slow adaptations can be made, and old data is retained longer,\
    \ causing the\nmodel’s reactivity capacity to decrease; thereby, affecting the\
    \ model’s forecasting power.\nThus, deﬁning policies to balance the two scenarios\
    \ mentioned above is a relevant challenge\nto support the inclusion of CI approaches\
    \ in real-time data environments.\nFinally, the third challenge associated with\
    \ incremental learning is adaptive model\ncomplexity [156]. This issue is concerned\
    \ with the fact that as concept drift events become\nmore frequent, increasing\
    \ model complexity is required. Although the latter improves the\nmodel’s performance,\
    \ increasing its complexity leads to an increase in the need of more\ncomputational\
    \ resources, which are not always affordable or available in different domains,\n\
    such as FSC.\n5.2.3. Explainability of Computational Intelligence Methods\nNowadays,\
    \ CI systems have increased their capacity to carry out different tasks (e.g.,\n\
    predictions, classiﬁcation) with almost no human intervention and are achieving\
    \ high\nproﬁciency levels. In a narrow scope, if the only objective when evaluating\
    \ CI methods is\nperformance, such an object has clearly been achieved thanks\
    \ to this increasing capacity.\nNonetheless, when decisions derived from CI-based\
    \ techniques affect the dynamics of hu-\nman life (e.g., social, cultural, environmental\
    \ dimensions), understanding how CI systems\nhave achieved this performance becomes\
    \ necessary [157].\nWhile some CI approaches, such as fuzzy logic and ML methods\
    \ (e.g., rule-based\nlearners, decision trees), can provide different degrees\
    \ of interpretability and transparency\nof decisions made in their inner structure;\
    \ other methods cannot provide this information\n(e.g., black-box decision systems\
    \ [158]). In these cases, there are no clues regarding the\nsystems’ decisions\
    \ to obtain the ﬁnal result. One example is DL methods, whose complex\ninner structure\
    \ is full of intricate connections between layers and neurons and have a broad\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n26 of 34\nspace of hyperparameters. Therefore, understanding\
    \ where the high performance of DL\nmethods comes from is quite tricky.\nAs DL\
    \ is increasingly being employed in diverse FSC applications due to its per-\n\
    formance capacities, the demand for interpretability, explainability, and transparency\
    \ is\ngrowing between diverse FSC stakeholders. Such demand lies in the fact that\
    \ decisions\nmade based on CI systems can lead to actions, which can not be justiﬁed\
    \ or that require\ndetailed explanations [159] in order to enhance the management\
    \ of the supply chain. For\nexample, the shelf-life of perishable products needs\
    \ to be predicted in the distribution\nstage. However, understanding the factors\
    \ that inﬂuence the deterioration or preservation\nof food products is vital to\
    \ improve the management of distribution chains. The latter is\nknown as explainable\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence (XAI) and is widely acknowledged as a crucial\nconcept\
    \ to be taken into account in the practical deployment of CI methods [160].\n\
    In this sense, as stated by [160], the challenge of XAI in different knowledge\
    \ domains,\nsuch as FSCs, is creating more explainable methods while maintaining\
    \ their output perfor-\nmance. Besides, it is crucial to facilitate stakeholder\
    \ understanding and trust in decisions\nsupported by CI systems whose outputs\
    \ become the basis for different actions along the\nwhole supply chain.\n5.2.4.\
    \ The Method Selection Problem\nAs shown in this research paper, depending on\
    \ the FSC problem at hand, different\ntypes of CI methods could be used. In this\
    \ sense, Section 4 provides helpful information\nto guide non-expert CI users\
    \ when choosing the most suitable CI family of methods\ndepending on the purpose\
    \ to be pursued (e.g., prediction, classiﬁcation, optimization). In\nthis context,\
    \ keeping in mind the no-free-lunch theorem [161] (which states that there is\n\
    no unique algorithm that can be competitive in all problems), the proposed guidelines\n\
    contribute to dealing with the model selection problem in the FSC area. Nevertheless,\n\
    having identiﬁed the most suitable families of CI methods, it is still difﬁcult\
    \ to choose the\nbest method within each family.\nFor instance, if the objective\
    \ is to optimize a food production process in the processing\nstage, the critical\
    \ question would be to ask what meta-heuristic approach is the most\nsuitable\
    \ for the considered problem. The answer to this question could be to use an\n\
    EC, SI, or local-based approach. However, solving such a decision requires a thorough\n\
    experimentation that demands a large amount of effort and is time-consuming [162].\n\
    Another similar example of the method selection problem is the case of ML. FSC\
    \ data\nallows different variables of interest to be predicted under diverse scenarios,\
    \ ranging from\nﬁsh farming production to agriculture. These characteristics of\
    \ the production context\ninﬂuence ML method performance, and selecting the most\
    \ appropriate method from a\npool of candidates is a time-consuming task. Thus,\
    \ the automation of choosing the best CI\ntechnique from a predeﬁned set of methods\
    \ of the same family is a crucial challenge that\ncould help increase inclusion\
    \ of CI into the FSC.\nCurrently, there are well-established automated approaches\
    \ focused on ML and DL.\nTherefore, we can use the automation of complete ML or\
    \ DL workﬂows, known as Auto-\nmated Machine learning (AutoML) [163] and Automated\
    \ Deep learning (AutoDL) [164].\nSuch approaches are considered to be promising\
    \ strategies to reduce human effort and\ntime cost of ML and DL in research areas\
    \ in which specialized knowledge is an asset\nthat is not always available or\
    \ affordable. Particularly, AutoML and AutoDL seek to ﬁnd\ncompetitive ML pipelines\
    \ (the workﬂow from data preprocessing to model selection) and\nneural network\
    \ architectures automatically without almost any human intervention. The\ncentral\
    \ purpose is maximizing or minimizing a performance metric on input data without\n\
    it having to be specialized in the problem domain where the data comes.\nAutoML\
    \ and AutoDL methods have been successfully used in other areas [165,166].\nHowever,\
    \ an extensive analysis to determine their strengths and weaknesses has not been\n\
    carried out in very diverse learning tasks, such as FSCs. Additionally, the concept\
    \ of\nAutoML and AutoDL could be extrapolated to an even broader space, such as\
    \ automated\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n27 of 34\ncomputational intelligence. In\
    \ this case, the focus would be on supporting non-expert\nusers in selecting other\
    \ CI techniques like meta-heuristics and its sub-families (e.g., EC,\nSI, local-based\
    \ approaches). In this context, the research challenge lies in the design and\n\
    development of automated methods for other families of CI methods, including fuzzy\n\
    logic, meta-heuristic, probabilistic methods, and others.\n5.2.5. Interoperability\
    \ and Deployment of CI with Information and\nCommunication Technologies\nCI is\
    \ only one part of the entire ICT ecosystem required to digitize processes in\
    \ the\nFSC. IoT technologies, information storage and management technologies,\
    \ data analytic\nand visualization tools, or decision support technologies are\
    \ other relevant components\nwithout which CI cannot reach its full potential.\
    \ All these technologies have switched the\nfocus from traditional automation\
    \ of FSC processes to a cloud-based paradigm where all\nICTs operate efﬁciently\
    \ and intuitively [167]. Within the cloud-based approaches, major\ntechnologies\
    \ must be able to interoperate with each other and themselves. Thus, such\ninterconnectivity\
    \ and exchange of information are some of the main challenges raised\nwhen incorporating\
    \ CI and other industry 4.0 approaches into the daily operation and\nmanagement\
    \ of FSCs [168].\nOne of the latent issues is the lack of standardization of the\
    \ data models with CI\nmethods. Ultimately the goal of Industry 4.0 in FSCs is\
    \ to incorporate semantic interoper-\nability, which enables systems to exchange\
    \ information with unambiguous meaning [169].\nHowever, the study of interoperability\
    \ standards for CI approaches is a research area that\nstill needs to be fully\
    \ exploited. The demand for these standards is also growing at a\npace never seen\
    \ before, as the current trend of Industry 4.0 is characterized by complex\nautomation\
    \ and production systems where CI works with a wide variety of standards,\ncomponents,\
    \ and services in a cloud-based environment [170]. Despite such challenges, re-\n\
    cent advances have been made in interoperability standards for cloud-based environments.\n\
    Some examples are the interoperable cloud-based manufacturing system [171], the\
    \ hybrid\nmanufacturing cloud framework [172], and the new generation artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence-driven\nintelligent manufacturing architecture [173].\nAnother\
    \ big challenge of CI in integration with ICTs lies in the manufacturing pro-\n\
    cesses of the FSC production stage. Nowadays, CI approaches are usually focused\
    \ on\nmaximizing accuracy without considering the resources they consume. Nevertheless,\
    \ with\nthe increasing demand of developing a globally low carbon economy, the\
    \ need to build an\nintelligent and environmentally friendly food industry is\
    \ becoming more urgent [174,175].\nIn this sense, CI approaches require that a\
    \ balance be struck between the computational\nresources they use, the energy\
    \ they consume, and the performance they can achieve in the\ntime-frame allowed\
    \ by food manufacturing processes [176]. Furthermore, the aforemen-\ntioned resources\
    \ are assets that are not always available in small- and medium-sized food\nindustries.\
    \ Therefore, more research is required to develop CI methods that are capable\n\
    of being deployed in IoT devices and smart manufacturing industries under different\n\
    constraints like energy efﬁciency and computational resources. In conclusion,\
    \ this research\npath could imply bringing in the concepts of edge computing and\
    \ fog computing [177] for\nthe efﬁcient inclusion of CI in food manufacturing\
    \ processes [178].\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.S.A.-Z., A.A.-V.\

    \ technology, there has been a surge in interest in agricultural data. However,\
    \ these\ndata are notoriously chaotic, and analysts are concerned about their\
    \ authenticity because there is a big possibility that others\nmay have infuenced\
    \ data quality at various points along the data stream. Tis article suggests a\
    \ new blockchain architecture to\nprotect the integrity of agricultural data.\
    \ Te goal of this architecture is to provide farmers with safe storage. Te agriculture\n\
    data inserted cannot be modifed without some rules. Many procedures are completed\
    \ automatically using smart contracts to\nlimit the danger of manipulation. One\
    \ of the suggested architectures is the proof of concept. It connects a traditional\
    \ farm\nsystem with the blockchain accompanied by smart contracts to facilitate\
    \ the entire agri-supply chain. Te conceptual ar-\nchitecture will eliminate the\
    \ faws discovered in prior studies. Sensors are used in this approach to provide\
    \ us with envi-\nronmental data. As a result, we store our data in blocks using\
    \ the blockchain system. Ten, we built some unique agricultural\nsmart contracts\
    \ to handle all transactions and automatize decisions based on the source code\
    \ of these automated contracts. Tis\nstrategy would be more efcient and secure.\n\
    1. Introduction\nAgriculture is a big part of the economy of any country because\n\
    it helps feed the entire population. It connects and commu-\nnicates with all\
    \ of the related industries. If the agriculture base is\nstrong, it is generally\
    \ regarded as a socially and politically stable\nsociety. Many modern farms make\
    \ use of cutting-edge tech-\nnology and scientifc and technological ideas [1].\n\
    Te following are some of the reasons for food supply\nchain problems and processing\
    \ environment challenges.\nTe maximization of the profts relies on some farmers’\n\
    vegetables and fruits with chemicals. Chemical fertilizers,\ninsecticides, and\
    \ other compounds are used in several plants\nand fruits.\nAs a result, pesticide\
    \ residues in vegetables and fruits\nbecome excessive. It is a signifcant health\
    \ risk.\nFood gets contaminated with heavy metals. Te irriga-\ntion water source\
    \ of crops is polluted by the excessive\nintrusion of heavy metal elements such\
    \ as lead, tin, mercury,\nand zinc, which are dangerous to human health.\nFood\
    \ additives are used excessively in food processing.\nSome nefarious enterprises\
    \ use excessive food additives,\nantibiotics, hormones, and harmful substances\
    \ [2].\nTe following are some of the most common blockchain\napplications [1]:\n\
    (i) Agribusiness insurance.\n(ii) Smart farming.\n(iii) Traceability.\n(iv) Land\
    \ registration.\n(v) Food supply chain.\n(vi) Security and safety farms.\n(vii)\
    \ Agricultural product e-commerce.\nAs a formal defnition, the blockchain is a\
    \ distributed\nledger to share transactions or sensitive data across\nHindawi\n\
    Applied Computational Intelligence and So Computing\nVolume 2022, Article ID\
    \ 8011525, 23 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2022/8011525\nuntrusted multiple\
    \ stockholders in a decentralized network.\nTe data are recorded in a sequential\
    \ chain of hash-linked\nblocks that facilitate the data distribution to be more\n\
    manageable than other traditional data storage formats. Te\nblocks are veriﬁed\
    \ and uploaded into the chain-like system\nby selected nodes via an agreed consensus\
    \ protocol. Tis\nconsensus mechanism allows all the parties to engage in the\n\
    monitoring process when adding data ﬂow. In addition, the\nduplicates of these\
    \ data are stored in all involved nodes to\nensure no tampering.\nTo make agricultural\
    \ applications more eﬃcient and\nreliable, we can divide blockchain applications\
    \ into four\ncategories. Te ﬁrst is the provenance of traceability and\nfood authenticity.\
    \ Te second category is smart agricultural\ndata management. Te third category\
    \ is trading ﬁnance in\nsupply chain management. Te last is the category of other\n\
    information management systems [3].\nIn agriculture, collecting data is frequently\
    \ prohibitively\nexpensive. Te blockchain provides a dependable source of\ntruth\
    \ about the state of crops, inventories, and contracts.\nFood provenance is tracked\
    \ using blockchain technology,\nwhich aids in the creation of trustworthy food\
    \ supply chains\nand develops trust between producers and consumers. It also\n\
    enables timely payments among stakeholders generated by\ndata changes when used\
    \ conjointly with smart contracts [4].\nMany characteristics of the blockchain\
    \ make it unique\nand promising for future industrial applications. For example,\n\
    blockchain is decentralized, transparent, immutable, irre-\nversible, autonomous,\
    \ open-source, ownership, provenance\n(authenticity and origin), and task automation.\n\
    Contract automation (smart contracting) eliminates the\nneed for a traditional\
    \ contract while improving security and\nlowering transaction costs. Smart contracts\
    \ are designed\nwith rules and actions that applied to all parties participating\n\
    in the transaction [5].\nE-agriculture, or smart farming, refers to building in-\n\
    novative methods to use modern information and com-\nmunication technologies (ICTs),\
    \ such as the Internet of\nTings (IoT), cloud computing, machine learning, big\
    \ data,\nand blockchain, to move towards more feasible agricultural\nand farming\
    \ practices. Blockchain technology in agriculture\nis gaining traction because\
    \ of its ability to move away from\nthe centralized approach that now governs\
    \ the farm value\nchain. Te new technologies have produced Agriculture 4.0\nor\
    \ smart farming [6].\nSmart contracts help manage the challenges in imple-\nmenting\
    \ the revenue sharing algorithm and improve pro-\nductivity, transparency, security,\
    \ traceability, and full\nintegration between supply chain levels.\nSmart contracts\
    \ are considered a ﬂexible type of plan-\nning because they provide cost metrics\
    \ that get used to\naccomplishing high productivity within plans for producing\n\
    and delivering products in the context of current market\nrestrictions and then\
    \ executing the established programs [7].\nAll innovation results from an attempt\
    \ to solve a\nproblem, and blockchain technology is no exception. After\nlearning\
    \ about the origins of blockchain technology, it is\nevident that blockchain solves\
    \ a ﬂaw in existing centralized\nagricultural systems.\nAt the security level,\
    \ we can never eliminate vulnera-\nbility; it can only be decreased and lessened.\
    \ When parties\nsought to establish an agreement, groups have always\nfunctioned\
    \ as third-party lawmakers to reduce suspicion.\nOne party expects fair goods,\
    \ while the other hopes to re-\nceive the negotiated cash. Even though the buyer\
    \ and seller\nhave no reason to trust one another, they complete the deal\nbecause\
    \ they trust the third party. Blockchain claimed to\novercome these issues by\
    \ helping apps develop in a\ndecentralized and safe way and ensuring some guaranteed\n\
    level. One of the critical reasons for blockchain’s widespread\nadoption was this.\
    \ Implementing blockchain and smart\ncontracts and proﬁting from their advantages\
    \ is a big mo-\ntivation to improve the agricultural system model and make\nit\
    \ more secure.\nOn the blockchain, all transactions are securely recor-\nded.\
    \ Te controller may use this technology with smart\ncontracts and the Internet\
    \ of Tings to control the supply\nchain management, store farm data, and manage\
    \ identity,\namong other things. On the blockchain, personal data are\nmasked\
    \ and need permission control to access them. In-\nformation gets stored over\
    \ multiple computers (distributed\nledger) rather than on a single server; this\
    \ system makes it\nharder for hackers to alter data. By maintaining a track audit,\n\
    blockchain can instantaneously trace commodities or goods,\nassisting in delivering\
    \ proof and revealing weaknesses in any\nsupply chain. Furthermore, smart contracts\
    \ will automate\ntransactions and enhance eﬃciency. Smart contracts elim-\ninate\
    \ the dependence on human intervention and ignore the\nreliance on third parties.\n\
    In our architectural scheme, IoT will play a role of\ncollecting the environmental\
    \ data. Smart contracts will play\nthe role of data science analyzer, which means\
    \ dealing with\ndata for actionable insights, while blockchain records and\nvalidates\
    \ data. Tis scheme uses algorithms created to\ngovern interactions with various\
    \ data segments. Te next\nstep of this system is to create a blockchain system\
    \ auto-\nmated by smart contracts and make the correct predictions\nafter analyzing\
    \ the collected data. Tis project will guarantee\nthe enhancement of farm production.\
    \ Te application\nplatform will allow all the participants on the network\n(providers,\
    \ farmers, customers, and distributors) to visualize\ndata and trace product growth.\
    \ Blockchain validates data\nusing a decentralized consensus algorithm and encryption,\n\
    making it nearly hard to alter owing to the massive amount\nof computer power\
    \ needed. As previously stated, block-\nchain’s validated data are organized,\
    \ comprehensive, and\nimmutable.\nWhen we talk about the tracked product, we discuss\
    \ the\ncollected environmental data in which the goods have\ngrown. Te network\
    \ members will get all the growth hu-\nmidity, temperature, light, and soil pH\
    \ details. Tey have\ncode that says “If x event occurs, perform y action.” Te\n\
    participant will receive the updated data every period. When\nthe customer knows\
    \ all data about the product that he will\nbuy, he will be satisﬁed with all this\
    \ shared information and\nglad to be a part of this commercial deal. Also, when\
    \ the\nfarmer controls all the necessary conditions to grow the\noptimum quality,\
    \ he will build the conﬁdence to share\n2\nApplied Computational Intelligence\
    \ and Soft Computing\ninformation with customers and gain their trust. Another\n\
    example of an advantage for the supply chain management\nprovided by the scheme\
    \ is allocating goods arrived and\nwhich container is in it. Blockchain allows\
    \ tracking and\nstoring information such as order receipts, product status,\n\
    shipment details, and regulatory information to increase\ntransparency and customer\
    \ satisfaction.\nSmart contracts are composed of codes that analyze\ncollected\
    \ data and display to members if the sensor results\nare on the optimum values.\
    \ Tese contracts help track the\nproduct supply chain by keeping eyes on product\
    \ identiﬁ-\ncation and detecting the member that holds the product.\nFurthermore,\
    \ the block cannot store the data until it is\nveriﬁed and validated by control\
    \ members, so the case in\nwhich an entity can be malicious is signiﬁcantly minimized\n\
    compared to other centralized systems. In general, the truth\nis that blockchain\
    \ systems and smart contracts can perform\nmiddleman duties independently.\nConcerning\
    \ the prospective research gap and research\nchallenge, we noticed that many researchers\
    \ built a scheme\nthat consists of a single blockchain that stores data about\n\
    farms, entities, products, ﬁnancial business, deals, and trades\nall in one distributed\
    \ ledger. We reckon that the data in our\nsystem need to be more structured. Te\
    \ research challenge is\nplacing data related to individuals into “the user block-\n\
    chain,” data describing products into “the product info\nblockchain,” and data\
    \ related to deals between entities into\n“the transaction blockchain.”\nAlso,\
    \ the relationship between entities builds on trust,\nand each participant knows\
    \ their responsibilities and rights.\nOn the other hand, we have seen that some\
    \ researchers do\nnot automate speciﬁc tasks, such as detecting environmental\n\
    sensor data without intervention. So after doing some\nstudies, we have decided\
    \ to work with smart contracts as a\nblockchain companion.\nGenerally speaking,\
    \ the blockchain system aids by taking\nadvantage of its solid security-protecting\
    \ approach (simul-\ntaneously dispatching the last version of data to all network\n\
    members). Since agricultural data are sensitive and essential,\nthe blockchain\
    \ helps to entirely transform how the infor-\nmation is seen by adding an end-to-end\
    \ encrypted system to\nthe blocks. It is important to remember that distributed\
    \ data\nguard against fraud and illegal behavior. Participants in the\nnetwork\
    \ get secured data, and their personal information is\nanonymized. Attackers cannot\
    \ access or alter the data be-\ncause the information is not kept on a single\
    \ server and the\nvalidated blocks have a very minimal possibility of being\n\
    reversed.\nBecause\nblockchain\nemploys\na\ndistributed\nledger,\ntransactions\
    \ are recorded identically in many places without\nthe need for synchronization,\
    \ and guaranteeing transpar-\nency is another signiﬁcant beneﬁt (improve speed\
    \ pro-\ncessing). Additionally, this method aids in data tracking for\nanalysis\
    \ and reveals weak links in any supply chain. Smart\ncontracts automate transactions,\
    \ speeding up processing\ntime and minimizing human involvement. In this study,\
    \ the\nsmart contract helps analyze the values, verify environ-\nmental data,\
    \ and identify the crops with optimal growth\nstatus.\nIn the following sections,\
    \ we will discuss how we can\ncombine these technologies to create a robust scheme.\
    \ Of\ncourse, the adoption of IoT is always advantageous since the\ndata collected\
    \ from these sensors are more exact and in real\ntime. All these elements are\
    \ unexplored areas, limit the scope,\nand deﬁne the conceptual boundaries in our\
    \ research ﬁeld,\nwhich will boost our chances of having a better research study.\n\
    We will provide further comparisons between the\nproposed and past approaches.\
    \ Previous work will be listed\nin the upcoming paragraphs for sure. Still, the\
    \ main point we\nare trying to convey is that the smart contracts developed in\n\
    our architecture are innovative and have the potential to\nobtain sensors’ values\
    \ automatically, such as the optimum\ntemperature, humidity, light composure,\
    \ and soil pH values.\nTe components of the smart contract’s Solidity script are\n\
    considered the source of the idea’s novelty. Besides, decent\ndata structure organization\
    \ on the blockchain layer con-\nstantly improves data management. Tese details\
    \ will guide\nus to generate new observations or insights based on pre-\ndiction\
    \ while incorporating other innovative technologies\nlike artiﬁcial intelligence.\n\
    1.1. Comparison between Existing Agricultural Schemes and\nthe Proposed Model.\
    \ Figure 1 shows the diﬀerence between\nthe existing agriculture supply chain\
    \ (using the centralized\ndatabase), a standard blockchain-based agricultural\
    \ supply\nchain, and the proposed blockchain-based agrarian architecture.\nTe\
    \ key reason we chose to work with blockchain and\nincorporate its features into\
    \ our architecture was the absence\nof need for third parties. Additionally, the\
    \ control over a\ndecentralized ledger stays with the user rather than a cen-\n\
    tralized authority.\nAnother beneﬁt of blockchain is that there are no data\n\
    breaches and hacks. However, the scalability of a centralized\nsystem with a single\
    \ server is limited.\nImplementing a blockchain system protects data so it\ncannot\
    \ be changed or erased. But the recorded data in the\nstandard blockchain architecture\
    \ are not well organized, and\nmany previous works did not use smart contracts,\
    \ which\nfacilitate some operations and tasks without the involvement\nof network\
    \ participants.\nTe suggested model includes several blockchain ledgers\nthat\
    \ divide the data into user information, agri product\ninformation, and transaction\
    \ information. Additionally,\nsmart contracts are considered a signiﬁcant factor\
    \ in this\nmodel, which automate many tasks.\nMost blockchain systems implement\
    \ smart contracts\nprovided by the Ethereum platform and its extension\nplatform,\
    \ Quorum: they compile using Solidity or Serpent\ninto Ethereum virtual machine\
    \ (EVM) bytecodes. Hyper-\nledger Fabric and Sawtooth, the most active platforms\
    \ in the\nHyperledger family, use Golong, Java, Python, and Java-\nScript as the\
    \ major programming languages for smart\ncontract development [3].\n1.2. Related\
    \ Work. Te only way to verify and validate\ntransactions in the system is to use\
    \ IoT devices that are\nphysical consortium members. With the RAFT consensus\n\
    Applied Computational Intelligence and Soft Computing\n3\nalgorithm, the proposed\
    \ blockchain platform becomes not\nonly energy-eﬃcient but also faster and scalable\
    \ that can\nrecord thousands of conﬁrmed transactions per second\nacross multiple\
    \ ledgers. Tird, the blockchain with the RAFT\nconsensus mechanism provides a\
    \ transparent, secure, and\ntrusted platform for faster exchange of all types\
    \ of services\namong stakeholders. Te RAFT consensus mechanism\nguarantees integrity\
    \ if more than 50% of transacting nodes\nare honest. Several consensus algorithms\
    \ are proposed for\nreaching a consensus among several action nodes, including\n\
    proof of work (PoW), proof of stake (PoS), practical Byz-\nantine fault tolerance\
    \ (PBFT), and RAFT. Te public\nblockchain generally uses PoW and PoS, although\
    \ they lack\nthe speed of conﬁrmation. As a decision, our consensus\nmechanism\
    \ decreases the use of the blockchain to connect\nvarious agri-based IoTdevices.\
    \ Te RAFTconsensus method\nis more convenient to employ in a private blockchain\
    \ [8].\n“A secure ﬁsh farm platform based on blockchain for\nagriculture data\
    \ integrity” research [9] mentioned that smart\nfarming necessitates scalable\
    \ security. Terefore, various\nstudies have focused on developing new paradigms\
    \ based on\nblockchains.\nTe technology of SkuChain focuses on establishing\n\
    direct contacts while also increasing trust in the supply\nchain. More than half\
    \ of blockchain discussions are around\nretail and agricultural input and output\
    \ tracking.\nWe can get agriculture data from many sources, such as\nsoil sensors,\
    \ weather satellites, drones, and farm equipment.\nIt can be saved in a distributed\
    \ store using the blockchain\nwith secure long-term agriculture progress.\nTe\
    \ distributed ledger records all of the activities of the\nfarm. It is tied to\
    \ the data collected by agricultural sensors.\nFurthermore, smart contracts are\
    \ used to automate agri-\nculture data processing, including outlier ﬁltering,\
    \ before\ngenerating records in the ledger. Smart contracts could\nactivate and\
    \ execute particular actions based on data\nrecorded in the blockchain.\nTe blockchain\
    \ has access control that determines who\ngets permission to reach network resources\
    \ or perform\nactions on them.\nTe blockchain is a continuously expanding collection\
    \ of\ndocuments known as blocks. A block often contained the\nhash value of the\
    \ preceding block, a timestamp, transaction\ndata, and much other information.\
    \ It is impossible to tamper\nwith the data without breaking the hash links. Te\
    \ block-\nchain network contains many peers, each of which has a\nsmart contract.\n\
    A block must include signatures from a certain number\nof people. Tis technology\
    \ eliminates the risk of data dis-\nclosure and guarantees that no unauthorized\
    \ user can\ntamper with a transaction on the blockchain.\nBlockchain\nfunctions\n\
    are\ntransaction\nveriﬁcation,\nidentity validation, and peer-to-peer communication.\
    \ Also,\nsome network services are available as web APIs, allowing\nexternal systems\
    \ or client apps to connect.\nTe smart contract is distributed across a blockchain\n\
    network in a single package. Once the contract is deployed,\nall of the smart\
    \ contracts included inside it are available to\napplications.\nTe smart contract\
    \ deﬁnes a collection of transactions.\nParticipants in the blockchain network\
    \ (for example, a\nfarmer) or assets (anything of value) are used as resources\n\
    (for example, water level data). Te supported operations are\nCREATE, READ, UPDATE,\
    \ and DELETE.\n(i) Te water level sensor can CREATE and Collect the\nWater Level\
    \ transaction.\n(ii) Te farm owner can CREATE many transactions\nsuch as Predict\
    \ Water Level, Energy Consumption,\nUser Management, and Sensor Management.\n\
    The majority of previous works did not own smart\ncontracts, hence we can observe\
    \ a lack of automation\nin various systems. Additionally, we can see more\nhuman\
    \ intervention than the suggested architecture.\nMost works are based on single\
    \ blockchain as a\ndistributed ledger. The BC is quite disorganized and\nmight\
    \ be expensive given the degree of resources\nspent because it contains all of\
    \ the data that has been\nrecorded about all of the members, the farm, and the\n\
    products.\nSensors\nThe Smart contract on the suggested system helps to\nautomate\
    \ various tasks, such as handling the recorded\ndata that has been received from\
    \ the sensors and\ndetermining whether the values are at their optimum\nlevels.The\
    \ Smart contract can organize the\ndistribution process and many other activities.\n\
    Sensors\nThe proposed system contains multiple blockchain \nledgers for more of\
    \ data organization\nUser Information BC : includes all data about\nnetwork members\
    \ like farmers,\ndistributors, costumers...\nAgri Product Information BC : includes\
    \ all data about\nthe farm and the Agri products.\nTransaction Information BC\
    \ : includes every piece of\ninter mediate data, including transactional business,\n\
    logistical data, and other aggregated data.\nTemperature, humidity, light exposure,\
    \ soil pH\nSensors\nThe data get stored in centralized ledger the\nopposite of\
    \ decentralized ledger\n(which is also the opposite of\nblockchain structure).\n\

    \ has access to ALL operations for\nthe Control Water Pump transaction.\n(iv)\
    \ Te farm owner and the farmer can READ many\ntransactions such as Water Level\
    \ History, Predicted\nWater Level History, Energy Consumption History,\nand Water\
    \ Pump History.\nTe following research represents the article “Blockchain\nand\
    \ smart contract for IoTenabled smart agriculture” [10]. It\nmentioned that seed\
    \ storage, supply stores, producers,\ndistributors, wholesalers, and retailers\
    \ are the main actors in\nthe system. In addition, the contract deployer is another\n\
    actor here. Te interaction method between the actors and\nthe system is accomplished\
    \ through several components.\nTe sections below demonstrate the role of each\
    \ actor.\n(i) Contract Owner. Te contract owner has more\ncontrol over the system\
    \ than anyone else. Te\nowner enters the contract into the system and\nchecks\
    \ to see if the rule gets correctly implemented.\n(ii) Seed Storage. Seed and\
    \ other agricultural products\nare stored in the seed storage.\n(iii) Supply Shops.\
    \ Tey collect and sell a signiﬁcant\nquantity of seed, fertilizer, and other agricultural\n\
    materials to growers.\n(iv) Producers. Te farmers are considered the most\nbasic\
    \ rung in production. Tey are in charge of all\ntasks\nrelating\nto\nagricultural\n\
    planting\nand\nharvesting.\n(v) Distributors. Distributors are in charge of safely\n\
    transporting crops from one location to another.\n(vi) Wholesalers. Wholesalers\
    \ buy a decent quantity of\ncrops and agriproducts and resell them to retailers.\n\
    (vii) Retailers. Retailers buy commodities and products\nfrom wholesalers and\
    \ sell them to consumers on a\nsmall scale in open markets.\n(viii) Consumers.\
    \ Tey are a large group of individuals\nthat rely on agricultural products. Tey\
    \ play a big\npart in the system by constantly creating demand.\nFarMarketplace\
    \ is a novel digital marketplace [6]. It fully\nexploits the advantages of blockchain\
    \ capabilities by pro-\nposing smart contract templates between farmers, con-\n\
    sumers,\nand deliverers. FarMarketplace\nis considered\ninnovative in three aspects.\n\
    FarMarketplace oﬀers three main smart contracts coded in\nSolidity programming\
    \ language. Te ﬁrst smart contract is\n“atomContract.sol.” In this contract, the\
    \ user buys the contract.\nTe funds were added to the balance. Te buyer gets identiﬁed.\n\
    After that, the buyer receives the object of the contract, and the\nseller receives\
    \ the money.\nTe second smart contract is coded in Solidity pro-\ngramming language.\
    \ Tis ﬁle creates the smart contracts, sets\ntheir value, and monitors their status.\
    \ Tis ﬁle can also\nmodify the accessibility from available to unavailable or\
    \ vice\nversa. Some methods determine if the conditions are met\nand, as a result,\
    \ generate an error.\nTe second smart contract is “ownable.sol.”\nTe ownable contract\
    \ has an owner address and provides\nsimple authorization control functions. Tis\
    \ system makes\nuser permissions easier to implement. Te ownable con-\nstructor\
    \ sets the original owner of the contract to the sender\naccount. Tis ﬁle also\
    \ can let the current owner transfer\ncontrol of the smart contract to a new owner.\n\
    Te article “Securing parked vehicle assisted fog com-\nputing with blockchain\
    \ and optimal smart contract design”\n[11] mentioned that the blockchain provides\
    \ complete se-\ncurity for parked vehicle assisted fog computing (PVFC). As\n\
    a result, PVFChain, a speciﬁc blockchain system for com-\nputation oﬄoading, is\
    \ established to record and conﬁrm\ncrucial information about requesters and performers.\n\
    Without any third parties, the decentralized PVFC is built\nby relying on a majority\
    \ of consensus nodes. Smart contracts\norganize the posting of requests, the completion\
    \ of workloads,\nthe grading of tasks, and the distribution of rewards.\nAny registered\
    \ entity to PVFChain is controlled to follow\nthe contact-based agreement via\
    \ smart contract execution.\nDue to the inbuilt transparency and accountability\
    \ of smart\ncontracts, fraudulent requesters and performers are exposed\ncompletely.\
    \ Accessible records regarding the activities of\nrequesters are tamper-resistant\
    \ because of data auditing.\nFinally, PVFChain protects against network vulnerabilities\n\
    by supporting identity authentication, request validation,\ncomputation veriﬁcation,\
    \ and reward integrity.\nTe feasibility of PVFChain depends on the identiﬁca-\n\
    tion of critical network entities. Requester, performer, and\nminer are the three\
    \ main network entities.\nWhen a mobile car runs a compute-intensive application\n\
    on the road, it sends a computing job to PVFChain. Tis\nprevious operation triggers\
    \ a smart contract. PVFChain\nsystem transmits a task to a responsible administrative\
    \ agent.\nAt the vehicular network edge, the agent organizes the\noﬄoading service.\
    \ In the PVFC environment, the agent\nlooks for a fog server near a parking lot\
    \ and uses that to\ncomplete cooperative tasks.\nTere are various business platforms\
    \ available nowadays.\nFor example, Ethereum is a common platform that facilitates\n\
    smart contracts on the blockchain. On the PVFChain, each\nsmart contract has its\
    \ address, allowing us to describe business\nlogic for constraining network behaviors\
    \ in oﬄoading activities.\nIn summary, the operations of the smart contract are\
    \ as\nfollows:\nStep 1. Te requester sends a computing task containing\ntask requirements\
    \ and a deposit to PVFChain. After that,\nthe assignment gets allocated to a particularized\
    \ agent.\nStep 2. Trough the clients, performers can see the\noﬄoading requests\
    \ and the work criteria.\nStep 3. Some performers respond positively to the\n\
    requests and upload basic task execution information\nwith their replies.\nApplied\
    \ Computational Intelligence and Soft Computing\n5\nStep 4. Te agent is authorized\
    \ to recognize and pick\nsuitable performances based on prior knowledge. Te\n\
    agent also assigns various rewards for performers.\nStep 5. Te client of the requester\
    \ oﬀers attractive\ncompensation to the performers.\nStep 6. Te performers select\
    \ a portion of the workload\nto process based on the rewards oﬀered, and the agent\n\
    provides the necessary input data for task execution.\nStep 7. Te actors distribute\
    \ computing resources to\nobtain output outcomes. Te smart contract contains\n\
    their identities, node types, a total of processing\nworkloads, and output results.\n\
    Step 8. A speciﬁc transaction in the smart contract\nauthorizes miners and analyzes\
    \ the output results. Te\nminers choose suitable third-party methods to present\n\
    evaluation ﬁndings.\nStep 9. Te agent collects all the output results and\naggregates\
    \ them into a ﬁnal result before sending it to\nthe requester.\nStep 10. Finally,\
    \ the requester oﬀers additional pay-\nments. Qualiﬁed performers get promising\
    \ prizes.\nTe article “Smart contract-based agricultural food\nsupply chain traceability”\
    \ [12] suggests that tracking and\nexecuting transactions in the agricultural\
    \ food supply chain\nnecessitates applying the Hyperledger Fabric to establish\n\
    consortium chains and smart contracts called Chaincode.\nTe entire process of\
    \ the agricultural food supply chain\nfrom farm to fork is as follows:\n(i) Agricultural\
    \ Bureau. It is an entity that keeps track\nof farmers, seed information, plot\
    \ information, and\nyield data to assure the accuracy of source data. Te\ndata\
    \ are saved in IPFS, and the blockchain con-\nserves the hash value.\n(ii) Farmer.\
    \ He is in charge of sowing crops, utilizing\nsensors to monitor and record crop\
    \ growth in the\ngrowing environment, such as water, air, sunlight,\nand soil\
    \ quality. Te farmer saves the information\nabout the crop growth process in IPFS.\
    \ Further-\nmore, the farmer is responsible for generating\nsmart contracts and\
    \ storing IPFS data hashes.\n(iii) Processor. Te farmer gathers the crop and sells\
    \ it to\nthe processor, who transforms the raw crops into\nproducts for the ﬁnal\
    \ customer and records batch\ninformation, quantity, and other information in\n\
    IPFS. Te data hash is saved in the blockchain, and\nthe data label is created\
    \ and put on the product\npackage.\n(iv) Quality Supervision Bureau. It is in\
    \ charge of\noverseeing qualities and conducting mandatory\ninspections of manufacturing\
    \ companies. All the\ntasks help respect regulations concerning stan-\ndardization\
    \ and quality and penalize rule violators.\n(v) Distributor. Before reaching the\
    \ retailer, the ﬁn-\nished product may go through several tiers of\ndistribution.\
    \ Te distributor is in charge of storing\nand selling processed agricultural products\
    \ to re-\ntailers in batches. Company information, product\nselling times, prices,\
    \ and other data are kept in\nIPFS. Te hash value is stored in the blockchain,\n\
    just as it is for the quality supervision bureau, to\nensure that the succeeding\
    \ data are unchangeable.\n(vi) Retailer. He purchases products from distributors\n\
    and then sells them to consumers in modest\namounts. IPFS stores on the blockchain\
    \ some basic\ninformation about the retailer. For example, it\nstores the time\
    \ of sale, the quantity sold, and the\nhash value.\n(vii) Consumers. Tese are\
    \ the people who buy and eat\nthe ﬁnalized agricultural food, and they can get\
    \ the\ncomplete supply chain information about it by\nscanning the barcode, RFID,\
    \ or QR code on the\nproduct package, which makes tracking food easier.\nTe smart\
    \ contracts interact with the blockchain par-\nticipants. Our network participants\
    \ and their objectives are\nlisted in the “Blockchain-based soybean traceability\
    \ in ag-\nricultural supply chain” research [13].\n(i) Seed company maintains\
    \ local records and pro-\nduces seeds. Tese seeds get labeled by the EAN-\nUCC\
    \ global standard.\n(ii) Farmer purchases recognized seeds from seed\ncompanies,\
    \ harvests the crop, and sets up the smart\ncontract. Data are also saved on the\
    \ decentralized\nﬁle system IPFS by the farmer.\n(iii) Grain elevator: a grain\
    \ elevator is an agricultural\ninstitution. Tese organizations decide the quality\n\
    of the product by managing the sensing data and\nstorage duration of the harvested\
    \ crop.\n(iv) Grain processor purchases grain from the elevator,\nreﬁnes it, removes\
    \ foreign matter, and produces the\nﬁnished product.\n(v) Distributor is in charge\
    \ of the product distribution\nprocedure.\n(vi) Retailer purchases traceable items\
    \ from manufac-\nturers and sells them in small quantities to\nconsumers.\n(vii)\
    \ Customer is the person who uses the product and\nconsumes it.\nAny smart contract\
    \ code can be handled using the\nEthereum virtual machine (EVM). Tis EVM is in\
    \ charge of\ncomprehending every command code and ensuring that the\nsmart contract\
    \ is executed on all nodes.\nTe research employs Ganache as a local Ethereum test\n\
    network rather than the whole Ethereum network. Te\npurpose of this movement is\
    \ to make the test stage easier.\nTe following are some of the most signiﬁcant\
    \ smart\nagriculture notions:\n(i) Sensors and surveillance cameras.\n(ii) Te\
    \ network participants like farmers, suppliers,\ncustomers, and so on.\n6\nApplied\
    \ Computational Intelligence and Soft Computing\n(iii) Computing equipment like\
    \ microcontroller systems\nand cloud computing.\n(iv) Applications and libraries\
    \ include mobile device\napps, machine-to-machine communication, API,\nand a blockchain\
    \ web app.\nTe agricultural zone is equipped with an IoTcontroller,\nsensors,\
    \ and cameras. Te controller will encrypt the en-\nvironmental (sensing) data\
    \ before sending them to the\nblockchain network. At this point, the controller\
    \ will use\nmachine-to-machine communication to connect with the\nblockchain network\
    \ [14].\nPrecise measurement is critical in agriculture. Te soil\ntype and the\
    \ climate inﬂuence the monitored metrics on a\nﬁeld. Te following are a few of\
    \ them [15]:\n(i) Air Temperature and Humidity. Seed germination\ngets relative\
    \ to the optimum temperature because\nthe phases of biochemical mechanisms depend\
    \ on\nenzyme activation and hydration. Also, humidity\ngets deﬁned as the water\
    \ vapor pressure in moist\nair.\n(ii) Soil Temperature and Humidity. As a carbon\
    \ storage\ntank, the soil is a considerable component in irri-\ngation scheduling.\
    \ Te watering period is deter-\nmined\nby\nthe\ndriblet\nirrigation\ntechnology\n\
    employed or the techniques of deep wells.\n(iii) Te fundamental goal of this type\
    \ of irrigation is to\nimprove plant water quality standards. Sunlight and\nhumidity\
    \ have a signiﬁcant impact on soil tem-\nperature. Te temperature of the soil\
    \ is generally\nhigher than that of the air.\n(iv) Evapotranspiration. It is a\
    \ component of the hy-\ndrologic process that is the most elemental. Con-\nsumptive\
    \ usage includes plant transpiration and\nwater evaporation from the soil.\nAgriOnBlock\
    \ [16] ensures non-repudiation and con-\nﬁrms the authenticity by encrypting and\
    \ decrypting the\ntransaction with the private key and public key of a cryp-\n\
    tography mechanism like RSA.\n(1) When a retailer wishes to get a product from\
    \ the\nwarehouse, it communicates with AgriOnBlock and\nthe bank, specifying the\
    \ identity product, the item\ncode, the quantity, and the rate per unit.\n(2)\
    \ Te retailer has adequate funds, and its credentials\nare veriﬁed. Te required\
    \ amount gets transferred\nfrom the account of the retailer to AgriOnBlock.\n\
    (3) Te bank informs AgriOnBlock that the payment\ntransaction was successful.\n\
    (4) Once AgriOnBlock receives the proof of payment\nfrom the bank, it directly\
    \ notiﬁes the warehouse to\ntransfer the requested item in the stated amount to\n\
    the retailer.\n(5) Te transaction gets recorded in the AgriOnBlock.\nTe steps\
    \ for the interactions between some agricultural\nsupply chain entities are as\
    \ follows:\n(1) Te\nfarmer\nlodges\nan\ninsurance\nclaim\nto\nAgriOnBlock.\n(2)\
    \ AgriOnBlock delivers the information to the in-\nsurance carrier when it gets\
    \ veriﬁed.\n(3) Te insurance company sends the claim to a surveyor\nfor physical\
    \ inspection.\n(4) Te surveyor physically visits the site to do the\nsurvey.\n\
    (5) Te surveyor submits a report to the insurance\ncompany, accompanied by the\
    \ amount of the in-\nsurance claim for payment.\n(6) Te insurance company notiﬁes\
    \ the bank to reim-\nburse the farmer after obtaining the report from\nsurveyor.\n\
    (7) Te bank pays the farmer.\n(8) Te insurance company informs AgriOnBlock of\
    \ the\ntransaction.\nSmart contract algorithm for AgriOnBlock supply chain\nmanagement:\n\
    Step 1. If the farmer does not have the ready harvest,\nstay on step 1; otherwise,\
    \ proceed to step 2.\nStep 2. If the farmer prepares a crop invoice and sends\
    \ it\nto the retailer, the request to pick up the crop gets\nforwarded to the\
    \ shipping company.\nStep 3. If the retailer conﬁrms the invoice received from\n\
    the farmer, it will transmit a conﬁrmation to the\nshipping company (and proceed\
    \ to phase 4); otherwise,\nit will go to the error step (error code = 1).\nStep\
    \ 4. Te shipping company picks up the produce\nfrom the farmer and delivers it\
    \ to the retailer and then\nupdates the transaction on the AgriOnBlock after re-\n\
    ceiving the invoice from the farmer and conﬁrmation\nfrom the retailer.\nStep\
    \ 5. If the transaction updated by the shipping\ncompany on AgriOnBlock is veriﬁed,\
    \ the smart con-\ntract between the retailer and the farmer gets executed\nto\
    \ inform the bank to transfer the amount from the\nretailer to the farmer, and\
    \ the transaction gets updated\non AgriOnBlock; otherwise, go to error step (error\n\
    code = 2).\nStep 6. Te retailer creates a crop invoice and sends it to\nthe distributor.\n\
    Step 7. If the distributor conﬁrms the invoice sent by the\nretailer, he submits\
    \ a request to the shipping company,\nand then the transaction gets added to the\
    \ AgriOn-\nBlock. Otherwise, you will be directed to the error step\n(error code\
    \ = 3).\nStep 8. If the shipping company validates the bill received\nfrom the\
    \ distributor, the shipping company produces the\ncrop from the retailer to the\
    \ distributor and updates the\ntransaction on the AgriOnBlock. If the shipping\
    \ com-\npany does not validate the invoice received from the\ndistributor, go\
    \ to the error step (error code = 4).\nStep 9. Go to step 11.\nApplied Computational\
    \ Intelligence and Soft Computing\n7\nStep 10. Error: if the error code is 1,\
    \ the retailer informs\nthe farmer of the reasons for refusing to accept the\n\
    invoice. If the problem code is 2, the retailer and the\nfarmer notify about a\
    \ failed bank transaction. If the\nproblem number is 3, the distributor informs\
    \ the re-\ntailer of the reasons for not accepting the invoice. Fi-\nnally, if\
    \ the problem code is 4, the shipping company\ncontacts the distributor about\
    \ the reasons for not ap-\nproving the invoice.\nStep 11. Stop.\n“Blockchain and\
    \ edge computing technology enabling\norganic agricultural supply chain: a framework\
    \ solution to\ntrust crisis” research proposed that the physical layer, edge\n\
    data layer, smart contract layer, cloud/blockchain layer, and\nuser layer are\
    \ the ﬁve levels that make up the concept. Tis\nviewpoint is from the standpoint\
    \ of data ﬂow [17].\n(i) Physical Layer. A smart contract gets placed in this\n\
    layer, consisting of numerous sensors, controllers,\nand IoT devices. Tese devices\
    \ are either encapsu-\nlated with the smart contract address of the client or\n\
    discovered by a discovery service. Furthermore,\nnumerous wireless protocols such\
    \ as Wi-Fi, Zigbee,\nor LoRa are commonly used in agricultural farms.\n(ii) Edge\
    \ Data Layer. Te edge nodes make up this layer\nfor deploying containerized microservices,\
    \ data\ninfrastructure, IoT devices, and QoS control. Te\nedge data layer takes\
    \ data from the physical layer. It\nanalyzes, compresses, transforms, and splits\
    \ the data\ninto local and cloud ones. Te data rights or the\nidentiﬁcation of\
    \ the data creator is initially com-\npleted by this layer. As a result, this\
    \ layer enables oﬀ-\nchain veriﬁcation of tracking data from a cloud-\nbased blockchain.\
    \ Local servers are in charge of\nstoring oﬀ-chain data. Tis testing overcomes\
    \ the\nblockchain\nimplementation\nproblem,\nprivacy,\ntransmission bandwidth,\
    \ energy usage, and latency,\nto name a few.\n(iii) Smart Contract Layer. Tis\
    \ layer is responsible for\nassembling a group of smart contracts. It enables\n\
    eﬀective, distributed, and heavily automated OASC\nworkﬂows. Smart law contracts,\
    \ decentralized au-\ntonomous organizations (DAO), and application\nlogic contracts\
    \ are included in this tier of smart\ncontracts, which go beyond the transfer\
    \ of simple\ncurrency values. Te law contracts specify strict legal\nremedies\
    \ to prevent contracting parties from car-\nrying out their obligations. DAO is\
    \ a blockchain-\nbased community that can design a list of norms\nexpressed in\
    \ smart contract code. Each participant\nshould respect these rules and have the\
    \ right to seek\nrecourse if the program gets stopped.\n(iv) Cloud/Blockchain\
    \ Layer. Tis layer combines a cloud\nstorage repository with a blockchain-like\
    \ ledger that\nsupports three types of blockchains: public, alliance,\nand private.\
    \ Tis layer takes advantage of the alliance\nchain to include all stakeholders\
    \ in OASCs. Tis type\nof chain combines public and private chains. Cloud/\nblockchain\
    \ layer introduces an InterPlanetary File\nSystem (IPFS) and BigchainDB. IPFS\
    \ is new content-\naddressable storage. On each computer, the same ﬁle\nhas the\
    \ same name, and any change in the data ﬁle\ncauses the modiﬁcation in the ﬁle\
    \ name. Due to data\nstorage constraints, the process only keeps the hash\nvalue\
    \ of the ﬁle content in the cloud blockchain, and\nthe ﬁle itself gets saved at\
    \ the edge. Tis layer also\nutilized BigchainDB, a data storage and search en-\n\
    gine, to suit the query speciﬁcations of ﬁles.\n(v) User Layer. Te user layer\
    \ is the main gateway for\nanyone interested in tracking organic products or\n\
    maintaining OASCs. Te blockchain ecosystem gets\nlinked to this layer via the\
    \ blockchain bridge, which\nresembles an Ethereum bridge Metamask and is\navailable\
    \ as a browser add-on. Furthermore, this\nlayer oﬀers a variety of APIs.\nTe article\
    \ “Blockchain for Internet of Tings: a survey”\n[18] mentioned that the Internet\
    \ of Tings (IoT) is a sig-\nniﬁcant part of this revolutionary transformation\
    \ by\nbridging the gap between the physical industrial system and\nthe cyber-physical\
    \ system (CPS). Because of its increased\nconnectivity, safety, protection, dependability,\
    \ and ﬂexibil-\nity, blockchain is essentially the ideal companion to IoT.\nIoT\
    \ devices are capable to interact with one another\nwithout the assistance of\
    \ a reliable third party. Smart\ncontracts can help us reach this ﬂexibility.\
    \ Contract pro-\nvisions included in smart contracts, in particular, will be\n\
    done automatically in a speciﬁc circumstance.\nMany IoT devices make up the perception\
    \ layer, such as\nsensors, QR code tags, RFID tags, smart meters, actuators,\n\
    regulators, and other wireless tools. Tese gadgets can\nperceive and gather information\
    \ about the zone.\nIoT gateways, Wi-Fi access points, small base stations,\nand\
    \ macro-base stations may link with various wireless\nsensors, RFIDs, regulators,\
    \ and other tags to establish an\nindustrial network at the communication layer.\
    \ Diﬀerent\ncommunication protocols facilitate the connection, in-\ncluding Bluetooth,\
    \ low-power wireless personal area net-\nwork (LoW-PAN), near-ﬁeld communication,\
    \ and wireless\nhighway addressable remote transducers.\nConcerning traceability,\
    \ a timestamp gets appended to\neach transaction stored on the blockchain. After\
    \ examining\nthe blockchain data with matching timestamps, users may\nquickly\
    \ check and track the provenance of the last data.\nIntegrating IoT systems with\
    \ blockchain technologies\n(such as smart contracts) can strengthen the network’s\
    \ se-\ncurity by continuously refreshing IoT device ﬁrmware to ﬁx\nsecurity ﬂaws.\
    \ However, developing smart contracts is dy-\nnamic and involves several agreement\
    \ cycles. Meanwhile, it\nalso involves several groups, including stakeholders,\
    \ regu-\nlators, and software developers.\nSoftware-deﬁned networking (SDN) technology\
    \ can\ndeliver distributed IoTwith adaptability. Networks may now\nbe more agile\
    \ and ﬂexible to serve diﬀerent application and\nperformance needs thanks to SDN\
    \ technology and network\nfunction visualization (NFV). Te mixture of blockchain\
    \ and\n8\nApplied Computational Intelligence and Soft Computing\nSDN can eliminate\
    \ the drawbacks. However, various con-\nditions in the hybrid environment are\
    \ required to enhance\nand deploy network and computer assets.\nOne of China’s\
    \ famous supply chain architectures im-\nplements both RFID and blockchain. Data\
    \ on the food\nsupply chain’s tracing are maintained by this approach. Te\nresearch\
    \ demonstrates how blockchain might sweeten food\nquality by making traceability\
    \ of goods available. Also,\nsituations showed that customers could follow the\
    \ entire\nproduct manufacturing process if blockchain formed in the\nfood supply\
    \ chain.\nTe research “Te performance evaluation of blockchain-\nbased security\
    \ and privacy systems for the Internet of Tings:\na tutorial” [19] discussed security\
    \ levels and how we can\nimplement blockchain systems and IoT in one architecture.\n\
    Te validator gathers new transactions, checks that they\nadhere to the rules,\
    \ and then adds them to the block to\nprepare it. After several durations, the\
    \ network participants\ncan no longer change the information stored in the blocks.\n\
    When a transaction appears in a validated block, it is\nregarded as proved. Each\
    \ block has a unique hash code\nstored in it as its identiﬁcation.\nTe application\
    \ of blockchain technology in IoT agri-\nculture concentrates on three aspects:\n\
    (i) Helping farmers track down the source of their fresh\nproduce.\n(ii) Enabling\
    \ peer-to-peer agro-based transactions via\nsmart contracts.\n(iii) Ensuring the\
    \ integrity of agriculture data by\nboosting sales of fresh vegetables and addressing\
    \ the\nproblem of environmental pollution.\nGiven the overall mobility and group-based\
    \ behavior,\nIoT devices in blockchain applications furnish meaningful\nconﬁdentiality.\n\
    Te four levels that made the software-deﬁned network\n(SDN) architectures and\
    \ network function virtualization\n(NFV) are the perception layer, data plane,\
    \ virtualization\nand control plane, and blockchain layer.\nData collection from\
    \ the environment completes at the\nperception layer. Data ﬂow to and from the\
    \ perception layer\nvia IoT bridges is achieved by the data plane. Resources are\n\
    typically assigned to controllers using the virtualization and\ncontrol plane.\
    \ Te blockchain layer’s duties include data\nstorage, broadcasting transactions,\
    \ and P2P network man-\nagement via a consensus mechanism.\nWe can explain some\
    \ keywords that are required to be\ndeﬁned.\nGanache is a private Ethereum blockchain\
    \ that executes\nscripts and tests, builds smart contracts, and creates apps.\n\
    Te Ganache testbed is a blockchain testing platform\ndesigned to execute data\
    \ trades and assess the charges of\nsmart contracts. Both desktop program and\
    \ command-line\ntool are available.\nA decentralized framework called Ethereum\
    \ Geth uses\nthe Ethereum protocol to operate smart contracts. Te\nprivate blockchain\
    \ network and smart contract deployment\nare carried out via the Geth Ethereum\
    \ client using the Go\nprogramming language. In addition, for calculating the\
    \ time\nrequired to pack data into the blockchain system, Ethereum\nGeth is employed.\n\
    Te Rinkeby Ethereum testnet is a development and\ntesting condition for Ethereum,\
    \ a proof-of-authority con-\nsensus-based platform. Te eﬃcacy of the blockchain-based\n\
    fog computing system is assessed using this testnet.\nFor Ethereum, Truﬄe is a\
    \ development and testing\nenvironment that includes an asset workﬂow and network\n\
    management for deploying public and private networks.\nRemix Ethereum IDE is a\
    \ browser-based compiler that\nhelps users construct Ethereum contracts in the\
    \ Solidity\nprogramming language and inspect transactions.\nTe article “Security\
    \ challenges and opportunities for\nsmart contracts in Internet of Tings: a survey”\
    \ [20] says that\nthe smart contract system is still not advanced or reliable.\n\
    Distributed autonomous organizations (also known as\nDAO), the largest blockchain\
    \ initiative to be crowdfunded\nwith assets worth roughly USD 60 million, are\
    \ responsible\nfor the most well-known smart contract accident. Te DAO\nwas hijacked\
    \ in 2016, causing a signiﬁcant loss because of a\nrecursive call that the attackers\
    \ had cruelly changed its smart\ncontract. Given that research on blockchain-based\
    \ IoT has\nbeen gaining steam recently, it is critical to investigate the\npotential\
    \ threat as soon as attainable.\nAnother frequent security issue with smart contracts\
    \ is\nprogramming vulnerabilities, particularly with a new lan-\nguage like Solidity.\
    \ Hackers would likely use these ﬂaws to\ntarget IoT and smart contract systems.\n\
    For instance, the unchecked call/send functions return a\nBoolean result to represent\
    \ the success or failure of the call.\nTe transaction performing these functions\
    \ will not get\nrolled back if the external call fails, an error will arise, and\n\
    there will not be a rollback if the return value has not yet\nbeen under complete\
    \ veriﬁcation. As a result, the attacker\ngains illegal entry into the smart contract’s\
    \ protected\noperations.\nWhen Solidity types are used for direct calls, the calling\n\
    party must deﬁne the interface of the recipient and cast it to\nthe recipient’s\
    \ address.\nAs an integer variable may only represent a speciﬁc range\nof values,\
    \ the EVM provides a ﬁxed-size data format for\nintegers.\nEvery Ethereum smart\
    \ contract has an address object\nand can contact other addresses. Te address\
    \ of the ac-\ncount that initially made the global variable tx.origin\nreturns\
    \ the query or transaction. Tis variable fully tra-\nverses the call stack. Utilizing\
    \ this variable to approve IoT\nusers is prohibited as it increases the risk of\
    \ phishing\nattacks.\nTrough constructors in smart contracts, programmers\nmay\
    \ initialize contract objects. However, since the con-\nstructor’s name diﬀers\
    \ from the contract’s name and is a\npublic type, anybody may call the absent\
    \ constructor due to\nits vulnerability. Furthermore, constructors get often used\n\
    when initializing the contract to specify the administrator’s\naddress, the number\
    \ of tokens, and other details. As a result,\nseveral parts of the IoTinfrastructure,\
    \ such as network access\nand token control, will be essentially destroyed.\n\
    Applied Computational Intelligence and Soft Computing\n9\nMany owners’ interests\
    \ have been gravely impacted by\nthe abovementioned problems, particularly in\
    \ modern IoT\nsetups. Tankfully, other academics are now looking at ways\nto address\
    \ these problems. Tey looked for solutions such as\nﬁxing block timestamps’ dependence,\
    \ the inherently vul-\nnerable particularities, and security audits for programming\n\
    vulnerabilities (using SCaaS, for example, a smart contract\naudit engine via\
    \ signature matching and machine learning\nalgorithms).\nSmart contract encryption\
    \ is a brilliant concept to ensure\nthe privacy and security of the private data\
    \ used in smart\ncontracts. For IoT service providers and customers, the\ntransaction\
    \ details of the trade entities, the contract code,\nand the blockchain processing\
    \ mechanism are precious.\nTerefore, a more dependable and cost-eﬀective IoT system\n\
    is predicted in the real world due to the adoption of privacy-\npreserving smart\
    \ contracts. Tis kind of security is achieved\nvia various encryption mechanisms,\
    \ including TEEs.\nAdopting appropriate communication protocols is a\nvaluable\
    \ element in increasing the eﬀectiveness of data\ntransmission for sporadic IoT\
    \ networks. Named data net-\nworking (NDN) is a new form of network design that\
    \ in-\ncludes useful features.\nBecause of its unique properties like data immutability\n\
    and transparency, blockchain can accomplish tasks to make\nclinical trials traceable\
    \ and increase public conﬁdence in an\nopen and equitable process, including all\
    \ stakeholders. Te\nsmart contract safely automates these clinical trial processes\n\
    while ensuring traceability and preventing a probability of\nreconstruction. Te\
    \ viability of the intended solution de-\npends on a proof of concept of Hyperledger\
    \ Fabric in clinical\nmanagement research for numerous clinical studies. Tis\n\
    model [21] is a Hyperledger Fabric type of blockchain with\npermissions,\nsmart\n\
    contracts,\nand\ngood\nsecurity\nperformances.\nClinical trials produce sizable\
    \ clinical research data to\nestablish novel medications, devices, and medical\
    \ or surgical\nprocedures. Investigators take vital signs, variations in\nsymptoms,\
    \ and side eﬀects in the study of all these recorded\ndata. In general, evaluating\
    \ the data quality is a diﬃcult task\nand keeping the data quality at an acceptable\
    \ level needs\nknowledge about the business and data modeling.\nMany stakeholders\
    \ are certiﬁed with blockchain tech-\nnology certiﬁcation to ensure secure data\
    \ transformation\nacross many parties. Without a third party, clinical trial\n\
    procedures are automated using a smart contract.\nNumerous clinical trial-related\
    \ service scenarios are\ndemonstrated to show how the smart contract can manage\n\
    tasks such as medical data gathering and audit queries. Using\nHyperledger Fabric,\
    \ a proof of concept shows how well the\nsuggested solution works by carrying\
    \ out the connected\nprocesses to clinical trials among various organizations\
    \ for\nvarious clinical trials. Additionally, a web-based application\nlets users\
    \ communicate with the blockchain platform.\nTe model’s architecture includes\
    \ three layers: the\nphysical layer, which contains all the necessary equipment,\n\
    the medical pillbox, and blood analysis tools. Tis layer is\nconnected to the\
    \ service layer, composed of the blockchain\nnetwork and its services such as\
    \ smart contracts, consensus\nalgorithms, distributed ledger, and certiﬁcate authority.\
    \ Te\nledger maintains replicated and shared data across the whole\nplatform.\
    \ Te smart contract deﬁnes the business logic\nconcerning all operations of clinical\
    \ trials. Te last layer is\nthe application layer, which manages devices, eCRF,\
    \ and\nusers and deals with audit queries.\nAll transactions are generally available\
    \ to apps after the\nsmart contract launches and conﬁgures the network. Re-\n\
    markably, the network administrator can initiate or pause\nthe network and its\
    \ functions. By calling the relevant\ntransaction, it can manage a subject’s proﬁle.\
    \ Additionally,\nthe smart contract provides a speciﬁc rule list to determine\n\
    whether or not a user is permitted to access or alter network\nresources.\nTe\
    \ experiment starts utilizing ten clients in a two-\nchannel network of 8 organizations\
    \ and 12 endorser peer\nnodes using the simulation program Hyperledger Caliper.\n\
    Te ordering service is in solo mode, and the block size sets\nto 10 transactions\
    \ per block, creating a new block every\n250 ms.\nTough it includes the medical\
    \ area, this model is the\nclosest research to my architecture. A multi-blockchain\n\
    system with smart contracts and a physical layer consists of\nthe tools required\
    \ to collect priceless data, such as pillboxes,\nblood pressure monitors, and\
    \ airﬂow sensors. Tis medical\nresearch and our research share many similarities.\
    \ However,\nwhile our research focuses on agriculture, the other is in the\nmedical\
    \ ﬁeld.\nAccording to Hang et al.’s [22] research results, the\nthroughput, latency,\
    \ number of transactions, and scalability\nwere some of the indicators used to\
    \ analyze Hyperledger\nFabric’s eﬃciency. Te increased transaction has a consid-\n\
    erable inﬂuence on network performance, notably latency.\nHowever, the throughput\
    \ closes on zero as the network hits\nits capacity. Te authors tested the eﬀectiveness\
    \ of Hyper-\nledger Fabric in terms of transaction throughput and net-\nwork latency\
    \ using various scenarios. Based on the network\nconﬁgurations, performance constraints\
    \ vary somewhat at\neach level. In these cases, the eﬀects of factors like batch-\n\
    timeout, batch size, and the number of peers are examined.\nNode.js is the programming\
    \ language utilized to develop\nthis blockchain, with smart contract implementations\
    \ and a\nmaximum of 5 clients or network participants. Te block\ncontains a maximum\
    \ of 10 transactions, and its frequency is\na maximum of 250 ms.\nTis study introduces\
    \ a unique fuzzy logic-based\ntransaction traﬃc management method that helps boost\n\
    blockchain speed. Te model automatically carries out\nvarious operations on transactions\
    \ received following cur-\nrent network circumstances; the fuzzy controller gets\
    \ em-\nbedded in the smart contract. Without the involvement of a\nthird party,\
    \ the fuzzy-based transaction traﬃc controller in\nthe smart contract may autonomously\
    \ manage the traﬃc\nﬂow following the observed network circumstances.\nTe system\
    \ architecture comprises the Hyperledger\nFabric network, the admin, a blockchain\
    \ adapter, a\nbenchmark database, and a transaction traﬃc measurement\nanalyzer.\
    \ Te distributed ledger and the smart contract get\nduplicated by diﬀerent peers\
    \ that constitute the Fabric\n10\nApplied Computational Intelligence and Soft\
    \ Computing\nnetwork. Te administrator can set up network ﬁles and\nbenchmarks\
    \ for performance analysis. A network conﬁgu-\nration ﬁle summarizes the tested\
    \ system and the conditions\nfor connecting to the network.\nA benchmark conﬁguration\
    \ ﬁle deﬁnes the user-speci-\nﬁed test ﬁles and the performance benchmark workload.\
    \ Te\nclient where the workload occurs transmits transactions to\nthe blockchain\
    \ adapter, receiving them and sending in-\nstructions to start the blockchain.\
    \ By calling the smart\ncontract functions, many clients can send transactions\
    \ to the\nnetwork and receive replies to those transactions. Te\nbenchmark ﬁndings\
    \ are stored in the benchmark DB by the\ntransaction traﬃc measurement analyzer\
    \ once it has read\npredetermined statistics. Te fuzzy controller modiﬁes the\n\
    transaction approval rate by evaluating the acceptance rate,\ntransaction throughput,\
    \ and transaction delay.\nBoth transaction throughput and latency are the fuzzi-\n\
    ﬁer’s input parameters. Te inference engine assesses rules.\nTe acceptance rate\
    \ is transformed into non-fuzzy values by\nthe defuzziﬁer. Te transaction control\
    \ module obtains the\noutput value, which then modiﬁes the transaction accep-\n\
    tance rate. Te procedure gets repeated, allowing the Fabric\nnetwork to keep a\
    \ proper degree of transaction processing\ncapabilities\ndynamically.\nTransaction\n\
    throughput\nand\ntransaction latency are speciﬁed as the fuzzy variables for\n\
    membership functions on the approach, and the acceptance\nrate is evaluated as\
    \ “low,” “acceptable,” and “high.”\nTe network model of Kumar et al.’s [23] research\
    \ has\neight core elements. Trusted authority, IoT devices, un-\nmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles, intrusion detection systems, cloud\nservers, InterPlanetary File Systems,\
    \ smart contracts, and\nblockchain networks are these eight elements.\nBefore\
    \ installation, the trusted authority must register\nIoT devices, unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles, and smart contracts.\nUsing the established session keys, the authentication\
    \ and\nkey management phase of the Internet of Tings (IoT)\nbegins with mutual\
    \ authentication and key agreement be-\ntween two IoT devices, between an IoT\
    \ device and any as-\nsociated unmanned aerial vehicle, and between associated\n\
    unmanned aerial vehicles and the cloud server.\nTe safe contact between the involved\
    \ entities is\nmaintained throughout this phase. Te IoT device installed\nin each\
    \ ﬂying zone has the potential to extract agricultural\nvalues. Unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles (UAVs) are connected to\neach ﬂying area to gather data from IoT devices.\
    \ Te cloud\nserver saves transmitted transactions. In further detail, every\n\
    cloud server mines valid transactions using smart contracts.\nTis process keeps\
    \ them in IPFS and maintains the returned\ntransaction hash in the global blockchain\
    \ network.\nEach miner packs the IPFS hashes of the validated\ntransactions into\
    \ the current block while generating the\nblock hash and Merkle root for the next\
    \ block.\nTis model has speciﬁc veriﬁcation procedures to guard\nagainst diﬀerent\
    \ kinds of threats. Te attackers impersonate a\nreal user by creating a temporary\
    \ identiﬁcation and a partial\nprivate key. However, a session-based technique\
    \ conﬁrms\neach device’s identiﬁcation. Access rights are given if all\ncredentials\
    \ match; connections are also promptly terminated.\nAs a result, this strategy\
    \ guards against spooﬁng attacks.\nTe attackers may be insiders and have access\
    \ to all\ncredentials, including timestamps, pseudo-identities, and\nIoTdevice\
    \ identiﬁcation. However, the model can only grant\naccess following session-based\
    \ entity veriﬁcation. Tus, the\nmethod avoids insider attacks by not allowing\
    \ access without\nauthorization.\nWith the strikes of man-in-the-middle (MITM)\
    \ through\nunsecured channels and communications, the attacker may\nbe able to\
    \ obtain information about IoT devices. Attackers\nmay provide information to\
    \ UAVs, so they can carry out\nspeciﬁc tasks. Te UAVs, however, verify the session\
    \ and\nlook up the timestamp. As a result, the attacker is unable to\nconduct\
    \ the MITM threat.\nFertilizers are crucial in smart agriculture by improving\n\
    proﬁt and decreasing waste. Tis paper [24] discussed the\nresearch diﬃculties\
    \ of monitoring and managing farming\nland by enhancing crop yield and lowering\
    \ resource, energy,\nfertilizer, and human interaction wastage. Information from\n\
    the agricultural ﬁeld is gathered using the multi-modal\nsensor. IoT-based agricultural\
    \ systems assist in minimizing\nhuman contact and developing new valuable methods.\n\
    Any farmer may join the blockchain network without\npermission,\na\ntype\nof\n\
    permission-less\nprogrammable\nblockchain, and they can carry out numerous transactions\
    \ in\na database. Diﬀerent users connect to knowledge support\nsystems through\
    \ an intelligent interface device. Data about\nthe land environment is gathered\
    \ from various sensors and\nsent to the database server in the cloud environment.\
    \ Te\nMYSQL cloud database stores the acquired data. Data are\ncompiled by the\
    \ system at multiple intervals and sent to a\ncloud database. Te machine learning\
    \ algorithm creates\nknowledge patterns.\nEvery edge node in the network has a\
    \ unique identity on\nthe Hyperledger blockchain. Te member service provider\n\
    (MSP), which issues cryptographic certiﬁcates using a public\nkey primitive, issues\
    \ certiﬁcates to every network partici-\npant. Te user of the network receives\
    \ a login and password.\nTe user gets enrollment and transaction certiﬁcates to\
    \ send\ntransactions. In this approach, the chain code includes the\nbusiness\
    \ logic that establishes the state of the transaction.\nTe ledger states that\
    \ matching bock numbers get stored in\nthe state database. Hyperledger oﬀers a\
    \ secure, scalable, and\nadaptable blockchain technology for agricultural knowledge\n\
    systems.\n2. The Research\nAll old concepts are in service of the suggested theoretical\n\
    architecture (see Figure 2). It is a multi-layer design, which is\nthe cause why\
    \ it will be easier to control. Te Internet of\nTings (IoT) layer is the ﬁrst.\
    \ It consists of essential sensors\nlike humidity, temperature, pressure, acceleration,\
    \ and other\nvariables connected to ARDUINO boards. Bluetooth or a\nwireless network\
    \ is used to communicate between the de-\nvices. Te Arduino features will provide\
    \ us with data, which\nwill be exploited in the subsequent layers. Te ﬁrst layer\
    \ can\nsupply us with reliable environmental data.\nTe blockchain layer contains\
    \ three particular block-\nchains, and the agri-product information blockchain\
    \ is the\nApplied Computational Intelligence and Soft Computing\n11\nﬁrst. Te\
    \ user information blockchain is the second one. It\nhas all the information about\
    \ the network participants.\nTe transaction information blockchain is the last\
    \ one on\nthe list. It holds a wealth of information, including user\npersonal\
    \ information, intermediate information, transac-\ntions, logistics, and agricultural\
    \ product data. Smart con-\ntracts are used in this paradigm. Tose automated contracts\n\
    use the highest level of data encryption currently available in\nthe security\
    \ industry. As a result, it will conﬁrm the quality of\nthe decision and guarantee\
    \ clarity and eﬀective communi-\ncation between entities [25].\nMany sides will\
    \ attempt to check the average transaction\nfees because the whole system comprises\
    \ a multi-blockchain\nsystem. But let us see the other meaning of the blockchain\n\
    model. Te suggested architecture concurrently distributes\nsecure data to all\
    \ network participants. It is regarded as\nsigniﬁcant advantage that can increase\
    \ the eﬃcacy agri-\ncultural system.\nTe block will be full of transactions containing\
    \ recorded\ndata, and we will get multiple veriﬁed transactions at once.\nCombining\
    \ numerous transactions into a single block each\nperiod is cost and space-eﬃcient.\
    \ So, batching allows for\nreducing\nper-transaction\nfees\nby\naggregating\n\
    various\ntransactions into one. Following this protocol beneﬁts you\nand keeps\
    \ the fees low across the board for everyone. We can\nuse cryptocurrencies for\
    \ frequent transfers across platforms\nif we want to add crypto money to our model.\
    \ Teir\ntransaction fees are virtually nothing, for example, Ripple or\nLitecoin,\
    \ because generally, cryptocurrencies are con-\nstructed for lowering or eliminating\
    \ fees.\nTe research does not focus on cryptocurrencies or\ntransaction fees because\
    \ the goal of our blockchain is just\nstoring and transmitting data simultaneously\
    \ to members,\nand that is all. But, if it is obligatory to mention some info,\
    \ in\nthis case, everything on Ethereum’s transaction fees was\nbased on “gas,”\
    \ and the payment system will adopt the\nEthereum payment process based on the\
    \ calculated proce-\ndure. In 2021, the average bitcoin fees were between 2 and\
    \ 5\ndollars. Te average ETH transaction fee ranges from 2 to 7\ndollars or 0.00056\
    \ to 0.002 ETH.\nTe block size is crucial because it can signiﬁcantly\nimpact\
    \ the speed and capacity of the network. After dis-\ncovering some related research,\
    \ the average block size\nneeded in our model over 24 hours is between 0.75 and\
    \ 1.25\nmegabytes. Te average transactions per block required in\nour model over\
    \ 24 hours are between 1200 and 2200. Te\naverage number of payments per block\
    \ needed to get seen in\nour model over 24 hours is between 2500 and 5500.\nTe\
    \ members of this system are farmers, providers,\ndistributors, retailers, clients,\
    \ and controllers that help as a\nprocessing node for validating transactions,\
    \ for example, to\nadministrate the data provided by sensors and check if data\n\
    (temperature, humidity, light exposure, and soil pH) are\nreasonable. Tere is\
    \ no problem with hardware devices.\nControllers can check the data traceability\
    \ and the ware-\nhouse stock and quantity.\nBlockchains layer\nSmart Contract\

    (UML) (see Figure 3) explains the structures, classes, at-\ntributes, methods,\
    \ and relationships between objects to\nprovide extra information about our model.\
    \ Class user stores\ninformation about the network’s participants, including\n\
    farmers, distributors, and customers. Te members who are\non the blockchain network\
    \ can visualize the database as well\nas place orders for the products they desire.\
    \ Te sensors send\nenvironmental information to ProductStatus, providing\nvalues\
    \ and conditions to determine whether they are at their\noptimum level or not.\
    \ Tese products belong to a unique\ncategory or sub-category. We added a class\
    \ named Order-\nDetails since the order class has a lot of data.\nTis use case\
    \ diagram (see Figure 4) represents the actors\nin the system model. It displays\
    \ the context and require-\nments of our system. It functions as an outsider’s\
    \ perspective\non a system that deﬁnes how users engage with its services.\nTe\
    \ farmer, distributor, and customer types of users are\ndescribed in the ﬁgure.\
    \ For example, farmers may provide a\nproduct that persuades a consumer to place\
    \ an order for it.\nDistributors transported the goods from the farms to the\n\
    consumer. Te user can view a wide range of information on\ncrop growth conditions\
    \ using the soil pH, humidity, tem-\nperature, and light exposure sensors.\nTe\
    \ food supply chain can be used to monitor a product\nfrom its raw material (e.g.,\
    \ tomato) on the farm to the\nﬁnished product (e.g., tomato sauce) on the shelf\
    \ in the retail\nstore. Tis solution depends on many Solidity ﬁles. Te ﬁrst\n\
    ﬁle contains Farmer Struct (Struct types are used to rep-\nresent an organized\
    \ structure). Tis structure is composed of\nthe ID and the name of the farmer.\
    \ Te second struct is the\nexpected yields which contain the location of the land,\
    \ the\ncorps, the amount, the estimated price, and the expiration\ndate. Te deal\
    \ struct is the third one, containing the terms,\nthe amount, and the addresses\
    \ of both the farmer and the\ncustomer. Tis contract can control farmers, manage\
    \ their\nyields, organize deals, and recharge wallets. Te farmer does\nnot need\
    \ to wait for a bank loan or other types of ﬁnancing to\nget started. Te consumers\
    \ could provide the fund with zero\ninterest. Furthermore, the farmers are not\
    \ susceptible to\nlengthy and complicated bank ﬁnancing procedures.\nTe food supply\
    \ chain is controlled by the second ﬁle,\nwhich contains three Solidity structs.\
    \ Te ﬁrst is the goods\nquality report, which includes the address of the inspector,\n\
    the quantity, the sample size, and any remarks about the\ngoods. Te processor\
    \ report is the second struct, containing\nthe notes, shipment data, and the received\
    \ quality report.\nTe last struct is the retailer report, which comprises the\n\
    name of products, the raw material, remarks, the manu-\nfactured date, the quantity\
    \ produced, and the processor\nreport received earlier. Companies can use the\
    \ system to\ntrack unsafe products back to their source and discover\nwhere they\
    \ got dispersed. Tese advantages can save lives\nand money by preventing diseases.\
    \ In addition, no one can\ntamper with the details of the quality reports (which\
    \ get\nstored on the blockchain network) for their gain. Te history\nof some products\
    \ can get tracked in real time from their\ninception to their current state. Consumers\
    \ may obtain high-\nquality items at lower prices because they are sponsoring\
    \ the\ncrops from the start. Consumers in the low-income category\ncan fund crops\
    \ according to their requirements and avoid\nmarket volatility in product costs.\
    \ Tere is no need for vast\nfarmlands. Even small-scale and family farmers can\
    \ sell their\nproducts and make more money.\nOn the distributed public ledger,\
    \ farmers can list their\nprospective crops. Consumers can look over the infor-\n\
    mation and assess the credibility of the farmers based on\nprevious cultivation\
    \ and supply. Tis system establishes a\ntransparent and tamper-proof digital market\
    \ platform for\nfarm products. As a result, the contract can be reached\nbetween\
    \ the farmer and the customer, allowing the\nconsumer to support particular crops\
    \ or ﬁelds and acquire\nthe production or a proﬁt percentage of its market value.\n\
    Based on previous agricultural production experiences, a\nranking system gets\
    \ adopted to enhance farmer and\nconsumer trust. Eventually, the system will create\
    \ a\ndecentralized agro-market where farmers can raise funds\nfor production while\
    \ also having clients buy their pro-\nduce. Alternatively, customers can secure\
    \ quality products\nat a lower cost by investing in crops early. Customers and\n\
    farmers will beneﬁt from establishing a trusting atmo-\nsphere for future collaboration.\
    \ Farmers will make the\nmost money from their produce, and the investors\n(consumers)\
    \ will be able to feed their families high-quality\nfood.\nNext, there is the\
    \ ownable contract, which has an owner\naddress. It provides sample authorization\
    \ control. It makes\nuser permissions easier to implement. Te OWNABLE\nconstructor\
    \ sets the sender as the OWNER (the user who\nowes the product). Te existing owner\
    \ can also transfer the\nownership of his contract to a new owner under this con-\n\
    tract. Te migration ﬁle facilitates the distribution of con-\ntracts to the network\
    \ and serves as a staging area for your\ndeployment activities. Tey get developed\
    \ with the notion\nthat your deployment requirements will evolve simulta-\nneously\
    \ with the blockchain evolution.\nAdditionally, we can embrace the product delivery\
    \ ﬁle\nand drop it on our architecture. Te food delivery ﬁle is a\nsmart contract\
    \ for a decentralized food delivery service.\nTe system uses some features of\
    \ Solidity code, such as\nthe unsigned integer UINT, which corresponds to the\n\
    product ID and cannot have a negative value. Te mapping is\nused to organize the\
    \ order of products. Te contract allows\nfor the creation of products and the\
    \ option of receiving\nthem. Various functions check the contents of the smart\n\
    contract, which the client will review and trigger if it is\ncorrect. Only customers\
    \ will be able to inspect it, and only\ncustomers will queue outside to obtain\
    \ the number of\nproducts. Te contract adds or removes traces from a\nproduct\
    \ and calculates a total of product traces for statistical\npurposes. Te system\
    \ also manages and controls tempera-\nture, retrieves an array of temperatures,\
    \ and returns the\nnumber of traced places.\nWe must not overlook the contract\
    \ that entails self-\nmonitoring the humidity, temperature, soil Ph, and light\n\
    exposure. Also, if these environmental data are beyond the\nthreshold, below the\
    \ threshold, or ideal, this ﬁle detects\nviolations and triggers alarms.\nApplied\
    \ Computational Intelligence and Soft Computing\n13\nTe next step is upgrading\
    \ the model to Ethereum 2.0, an\nupdate to the present Ethereum blockchain. It\
    \ intends to\nimprove the Ethereum network’s speed, eﬀectiveness, and\nsustainability\
    \ by boosting the number of transactions. When\ncompared to the prior version,\
    \ it features several signiﬁcant\nstructural transformations. “Proof of stake”\
    \ and “sharding”\nare these eﬀective modiﬁcations.\nValidators, rather than miners,\
    \ are used in the proof of\nstake consensus method. Teir primary function is to\n\
    propose new blocks and oﬀer computer power, storage, and\nbandwidth for transaction\
    \ validation. Validators are paid in\nETH regularly (deposit contract of 32 ETH\
    \ to validators).\nSharding is the process of breaking up a single block-\nchain\
    \ into numerous shards. As a result, the network be-\ncomes more solid since a\
    \ single validator does not need to\nhandle the entire architecture.\nTe consensus\
    \ process type is the main diﬀerence be-\ntween Ethereum 2.0 and its predecessor.\
    \ Ethereum 2.0\nemploys a proof of stake (PoS) method. In contrast,\nEthereum\
    \ utilizes a proof of work (a power procedure in\nwhich miners decode complicated\
    \ mathematical challenges\nusing high processor quality and computer equipment).\n\
    Because Ethereum 2.0 will use fragment chains, it can\nprocess up to 10,000 transactions\
    \ per second, whereas\nEthereum can only handle 30.\nBecause the cryptographic\
    \ approach is more straight-\nforward in Ethereum 2.0, it consumes signiﬁcantly\
    \ less\nenergy. Furthermore, because of its eﬀectiveness, the im-\nprovement is\
    \ projected to lower transaction fees inside the\nnetwork, allowing for smaller\
    \ transactions.\nAgricultural production is inﬂuenced by various ex-\nternal elements\
    \ such as climate and harvest quality. Te\nsystem links all of these participants\
    \ with the end pur-\nchasers, allowing anyone to intercommunicate in the\nproﬁts\
    \ while ensuring that customers get their healthy\ncrops. Ethereum 2.0 can improve\
    \ supply chain transpar-\nency and assist producers and customers in eliminating\n\
    ineﬃcient workﬂow. Validators can provide a perfect\nenvironment from the farm\
    \ to the market. As a result, the\ngoods’ transaction costs will be decreased.\
    \ Te proof of\nstake can easily locate and track a product from a local\nstore.\
    \ Tis mechanism can also determine the farm that\nprovided a crop as well as the\
    \ date of harvest. Te sharding\nprocess in Ethereum 2.0 can allow us to maximize\
    \ the\nblockchain organization level by classifying user infor-\nmation from product\
    \ information. Te mechanism did not\ndesign validators in Ethereum 2.0 to resolve\
    \ mathematical\nproblems to validate transactions; instead, they must check\n\
    data integrity.\nA technical stack, sometimes referred to as a technology\ninfrastructure\
    \ or solutions stack, is currently crucial for\ncreating scalable, maintainable\
    \ applications. A technology\nstack is a collection of technologies layered on\
    \ top of each\nother to develop any application. Te technology stack in-\nﬂuences\
    \ the sort of apps you may design, the degree of\ncustomization you can make,\
    \ and the resources you require\nto build your application.\nProof of concept\
    \ (PoC) is an essential component of\nevery software project since they reduce\
    \ possible risks and\ndemonstrate the project’s perspective.\nProof of concept\
    \ should be the foundation of every\nsoftware development process since it has\
    \ several beneﬁts for\nprojects. PoC takes care of everything, from reducing failure\n\
    risks to evaluating the possibility of scalability. To improve\nthe overall research,\
    \ we have collected all the advantages of\nthis procedure.\nRisk minimization\
    \ is by far a proof of concept’s most\nsigniﬁcant beneﬁt. Te development team\
    \ analyzes potential\nproblems before beginning the procedure.\nIt is just as\
    \ crucial to plan your scaling approach as it is to\nrelease a top-notch product.\
    \ In the long term, you need to\nknow\nhow\nto\nbuild\nyour\nsolution\ntechnically\n\
    and\ncommercially.\nDuring a seed round, supporting the idea with concrete\nevidence\
    \ of its potential is essential. Nobody pays for ab-\nstract ideas.\n- User Address\

    \ 5 shows the technology stack of the proposed\nmodel.\nTe physical or infrastructure\
    \ layer assists in gathering\nenvironmental data, such as soil pH, temperature,\
    \ humidity,\nand light exposure measurements. We also have nodes,\nwhich are network\
    \ members. A node is any device that has\npermission to access blockchain network.\n\
    Blockchain, as a concept, organizes data into user data,\nagricultural product\
    \ data, and transaction data. Blockchains\nemploy consensus methods to make sure\
    \ the nodes reach an\nagreement. It is a fantastic procedure to increase the net-\n\
    work’s eﬃciency by introducing a new degree of depend-\nability and achieving\
    \ information security.\nLarge portions of the model are at the level of smart\n\
    contracts. Te middleman got just eliminated. You will not\nhave to worry about\
    \ trust issues since there are standards\nprotecting everyone’s legal rights.\
    \ Since everything gets\ncomputerized, higher authorities cannot have any impact,\n\
    and the procedure is quite open.\nTe Kaleido interface serves as a functional\
    \ testing\nplatform. It assists in facilitating access to the decentralized\n\

    provide complete 100% security. Te blockchain network\nconsistently adheres to\
    \ best practices to guarantee the highest\ndata and transaction protection level\
    \ and reduce risks.\nFuture testing will focus on the new Web 3.0 blockchain\n\
    technology stack, which diﬀers from earlier iterations.\nHowever, transitioning\
    \ from client-server architecture to a\ndecentralized web will not be radical.\
    \ Te changes are sig-\nniﬁcant and distinct.\nWeb 3.0 blockchain technology stacks\
    \ are still devel-\noping and maturing step by step. Even though they are safer,\n\
    they are often a little bit slower. As a result, the transition\nwould initially\
    \ include building a partially decentralized\nnetwork before going decentralized.\n\
    3. Testing and Analysis\nTe ﬁgures depict the tested blockchain system. Te tested\n\
    architecture contains one environment, one member, and\nthree smart contract script\
    \ codes (ﬁnance, storage envi-\nronment, and traceability).\nFigure 6 depicts\
    \ the dashboard system, which allows the\nuser to learn about the testing environment.\
    \ Among these\ndata, we can ﬁnd information about network participants\nlike the\
    \ membership name, the membership ID, the primary\ncontact e-mail, and the joining\
    \ date.\nTe KALEIDO organization issues a membership cer-\ntiﬁcate with a common\
    \ name and a serial code. In this\nsituation, the dashboard shows a list of applications\
    \ directly\nconnecting to our blockchain system, like our smart contract\nscript\
    \ codes.\nFigure 7 shows the current condition of the blockchain\nsystem, such\
    \ as the creation date, block height, network\nparticipants, release version,\
    \ and protocol utilized (Geth/\nPoa). We established two nodes (node 1 and node\
    \ 2) for\ntesting, and one of them is inserted by smart contract codes.\nTere\
    \ is also the node that has the name system monitor.\nTese nodes have all got\
    \ started.\nTe details of the block node injected with the smart\ncontract script\
    \ are shown in Figure 8. Among these details,\nwe can ﬁnd the node name (node\
    \ 1), the node ID, the node\nsize (small), the owner, the status (started or paused),\
    \ and\nthe AWS region because we have used the Amazon Web\nServices, along with\

    \ storage environment, and traceability\nare the three aspects of smart contracts.\
    \ Solidity is the\nprogramming language used to create them. Te Solidity\nprogramming\
    \ language exists only to facilitate the creation\nof smart contracts on the Ethereum\
    \ blockchain.\nTe smart contract algorithm is depicted in Figure 10.\nTe blockchain\
    \ system now includes these algorithms. As\nyou can see, this ﬁgure shows some\
    \ functions in the storage\nenvironment Solidity ﬁle. For instance, consider the\n\
    Figure 6: Characteristics of the testing environment.\nFigure 7: Implementing\
    \ the smart contracts on node 1.\nFigure 8: Te metadata of node 1.\nApplied Computational\
    \ Intelligence and Soft Computing\n17\nprogramming method that evaluates light\
    \ exposure, soil pH,\ntemperature, and humidity. Tere are other functions, such\n\
    as the one that identiﬁes environmental violations.\nIn addition, the script code\
    \ displays the current state of\nall these factors and the variety of additional\
    \ features. Tis\nsection is concerned with creating the best possible envi-\n\
    ronment for seeds and products at farms and warehouses.\nTe quantity of resources\
    \ required to run these script\ncodes deﬁnes their complexity. Time and memory\
    \ con-\nstraints are given special attention. Tese processes should\ntake the\
    \ same time on a particular system regardless of the\ninput size. Another resource\
    \ that gets used is the number of\narithmetic operations.\nTese graphs (see Figure\
    \ 11) illustrate that injecting\nsmart contract code has a minor impact on the\
    \ resources.\nTe memory used by the smart contracts was just about 150\nmegabytes.\
    \ In addition, the smart contracts only utilized\nroughly 40 megabytes of disk\
    \ space. Tese numbers boost\neﬃciency speed and have no negative impact on the\
    \ system,\ncomputer nodes, or RAM.\nFigure 12 depicts several successful block\
    \ node trans-\nactions. Tese ﬁndings indicate that smart contracts might\nget\
    \ used on a sensor dataset in the future (temperature, light,\nhumidity, and soil\
    \ pH).\nTe system is divided into three major categories. Te\nﬁrst one is distribution\
    \ and traceability, which encompasses\nall aspects of tracking and tracing a product\
    \ from start to\nﬁnish. Te second category is ﬁnance, which involves all\naspects\
    \ of ﬁnancial transactions. Finally, storage is the third\ncategory, which covers\
    \ all violation management and reg-\nulates the environmental data of the farm\
    \ and the\nwarehouse.\nAfter employing IoT devices to insert product infor-\n\
    mation into the system, the associated authority can verify\nthe real-time temperature,\
    \ humidity, soil pH, and light\nexposure conditions. Te contract self-checks data\
    \ to keep\nFigure 9: Te blockchain includes smart contracts.\nFigure 10: Some\
    \ of the functionalities of the smart contract.\n18\nApplied Computational Intelligence\
    \ and Soft Computing\ntrack of status and violations. Te system displays tem-\n\
    perature, humidity, soil pH, and light exposure values and\nchecks whether or\
    \ not they are close to ideal conditions.\nTe suggested architecture also maintains\
    \ conﬁdence\nbetween entities. Before acquiring a product, it guarantees\nthat\
    \ the consumer is adequately informed about the repu-\ntation of other sides (the\
    \ seller). Furthermore, the early\nwarning feature is added to reduce the usage\
    \ of chemicals\nand establish the safety of agricultural produce.\nTough bitcoin\
    \ popularized blockchain transactions,\nputting it in a real-world use case still\
    \ has various diﬃculties\nand many goals to achieve. Nevertheless, blockchain\
    \ is still\nin its early phases and contains serious ﬂaws. Also, the\napplications\
    \ are a considerable challenge to optimize the\nsolutions and the entire food\
    \ supply chain.\nWe all agree that the procedures are automated and\ndependable\
    \ after these analyses. Smart contracts periodically\nself-check data, keep track\
    \ of all the details, and help save\ndata to the blockchain. When it comes to\
    \ the blockchain, the\ndate, time, and product identiﬁer allow all participants\
    \ to\ntrack products and assure that they have access to infor-\nmation about\
    \ the source of the products. Te integrity is not\nthreatened because the only\
    \ participants authorized were\nthose who could execute operations. Furthermore,\
    \ using\nsmart contracts eliminates the need for an intermediary\nparty, and no\
    \ one can alter the data inside the blockchain\nafter it is veriﬁed.\nSo, it will\
    \ be impossible to change the data if someone\ndoes something wrong or by mistake.\
    \ Also, data collection\nrelies on IoT devices; if they get broken, data collection\
    \ is\nimpossible. Furthermore, IoT devices are sometimes subject\nto security\
    \ vulnerabilities.\nPossibly, some participants cannot comprehend the\nsystem\
    \ or blockchain technology. Tey may have limited\nknowledge or a lack of understanding\
    \ of some functional-\nities. Perhaps we cannot persuade some participants to\
    \ give\ninformation. But, in general, the system oﬀers a radical\nchange in all\
    \ aspects of an existing business.\nTe comparison system (see Table 1) provides\
    \ all the\ndetails we have discussed. It is conceivable that the proof-of-\nwork\
    \ consensus mechanism is the algorithm that operates\nwhen the system employs\
    \ the Ethereum platform. However,\nwe have found that many studies neglect to\
    \ include this\npoint.\n4. Performance Evaluation\nTroughput is probably the most\

    \ and Soft Computing\nthe volume of transactions generated throughout the test.\
    \ It\nmay also be described as the minimum amount of capacity\nthat an application\
    \ or website can handle.\nAdditionally, it is typical to set a throughput goal\
    \ for the\napplication before beginning a performance test run so that\nit can\
    \ handle a certain number of requests per hour.\nTe suggested model, for instance,\
    \ uses multiple\nblockchains. User information blockchain, agri-product\ninformation\n\
    blockchain,\nand\ntransaction\ninformation\nblockchain are the three blockchains.\
    \ Let us assume that,\nregardless of the volume or quantity of the data, it always\n\
    takes one second to save a new set of three records on each\nblock of the blockchain\
    \ that we have.\nA performance report for this scenario would reveal that\nthe\
    \ throughput is three records per moment. For more\nexplanation, the user information\
    \ blockchain can save the\nﬁrst recording data, the agri-product information block-\n\
    chain can keep the second recording data, and the trans-\naction information blockchain\
    \ can save the third recording\ndata. Tis thinking is our maximum throughput,\
    \ but the goal\nnow is to increase it by updating the programming level of\nsmart\
    \ contracts by incorporating new methods and func-\ntions that reduce execution\
    \ time and work to prevent\nbottlenecks in the blockchain network.\nTe ﬁrst issue\
    \ users have represented in transaction\nlatency is the delay between initiating\
    \ a transaction or\npayment and receiving conﬁrmation that it is valid. You\n\
    would anticipate a ﬂattening of the throughput once all users\nhave logged in,\
    \ begun to work, and sent requests. In our case,\nhowever, we have not added cryptocurrency-based\
    \ ﬁnancial\ntransactions yet, and the project’s goal is to simultaneously\nreceive\
    \ data from sensors and send it to the blockchain\nnetwork. Hence, the automated\
    \ system of smart contracts\nhelps data arrive in any case and in good time for\
    \ analyses.\nWith minimal competition, throughput varies by simply\nadjusting\
    \ the load while latency remains constant. Te\nreason is that whatever comes in\
    \ comes out directly since\nthere is a reasonable minimum cost to complete a trans-\n\
    action, and the queuing time is zero at low congestion.\nEvery newly formed block\
    \ has a timestamp. Te\nblockchain system uses timestamps to count the number of\n\
    blocks added and produced during speciﬁc time intervals,\nsuch as per hour. Te\
    \ transaction latency metric can be\ncalculated by looking up each transaction’s\
    \ timing and\ncomparing the time it got completed to the time it was\napproved\
    \ and saved. Tis measure can also reveal the speed\nat which consensus methods\
    \ got used. Te outcomes of these\ntests provide evaluations of the blockchain\
    \ system’s func-\ntionality and scalability.\nA 3.5 GHz CPU device with 32 GB\
    \ RAM and a 3 TB hard\ndrive\nwill\nexecute\nthe\nmodel\n(Ethereum\nblockchain\n\
    network—8 nodes) with a margin of 100–120 seconds for\nlatency and a margin of\
    \ 235–260 transactions per second\n(TPS) for throughput. Data must wait to get\
    \ transferred\nwhen the local network’s capacity gets exceeded by traﬃc.\nNaturally,\
    \ there will be more delay as a result. Te latency\nwill increase as the network\
    \ becomes more crowded and we\nhave many activities simultaneously. However, solid\
    \ wireless\nsignals make it possible for data to be transported from the\nsource\
    \ to the destination within a short period and decrease\nlatency. Adding more\
    \ controllers or validators who conﬁrm\nblockchain transactions may boost performance.\n\
    Te analyzers must measure a large-scale distributed\nsystem to identify obstacles\
    \ or blockages and predict ex-\npected behavior under pressure.\n4.1. Security\
    \ Analysis. Now we will go on to the security\nanalysis part, where we will list\
    \ all of the model’s compo-\nnents and discuss how they can provide security services\
    \ and\nhow they operate together to secure our data and deliver\naccurate information\
    \ to all network members.\nSmart contracts, apps, and the blockchain environment\n\
    are vulnerable to attacks if the model gets weakly built. Let us\nstart with the\
    \ blockchain-based system, a public ledger of\ndata kept on all nodes, with all\
    \ participants receiving the\nsame version of information and updates in real\
    \ time as data\nchanges. Furthermore, users authenticate using public-key\ncryptography,\
    \ and validators check the data for accuracy\nbefore storing them in blocks; thus,\
    \ all data transactions\nought to have acceptance from all nodes in the network.\n\
    Finally, once transactions get preserved in blocks, no one or\nentity may edit\
    \ or alter the block’s content.\nTe level of security in the blockchain scheme\
    \ is in-\ntriguing, but let us now discuss smart contract security,\nwhich is\
    \ more than simply a software program that gets run\nautomatically. It is a part\
    \ of the system. In our example, it\ncan receive, transmit, and store data about\
    \ the environment,\nsuch as temperature, humidity, light, and soil pH. It can\
    \ also\ntrack down the merchandise and determine which company\nowns it. We must\
    \ not forget that smart contracts specify the\nextent of an agreement between\
    \ business parties by deﬁning\ncriteria that function as a trigger event in the\
    \ contractual\nterms. Te code gets performed, and the results get displayed\n\
    on all of the network’s nodes. Smart contracts get written\nconditionally, using\
    \ if-then expressions, and thus neglect\nmany of the problems caused by regular\
    \ agreements, such as\nfraud. Te use of blockchain to establish these types of\n\
    arrangements eliminates the need for an intermediary. As a\nresult, the total\
    \ expenditures of the company get reduced. To\nprevent losses, professionals make\
    \ timely code optimiza-\ntions, conduct frequent code audits, and monitor the\
    \ ab-\nerrant behavior of implemented deals.\nUnless you install protection, IoT\
    \ devices might be the\nweakest link in terms of security. For example, the IoT\n\
    confronts fake cell tower assaults and threats such as man-\nin-the-middle attacks\
    \ and SMS attempts such as phishing.\nBlockchain technology has been a remarkable\
    \ example of\nproviding safety in transactions and information transfer. It\n\
    oﬀers a unique data structure in addition to integrated se-\ncurity measures.\
    \ Consensus, decentralization, and cryp-\ntography—which ensure the trust of transactions—are\
    \ the\nfoundations of the blockchain.\nHowever, poor technical implementation\
    \ has led to\nseveral security vulnerabilities with blockchain. Although\nblockchain\
    \ has signiﬁcant security ﬂaws, cyber security\nexperts with special analytical\
    \ and technical skills may take\nsome steps to minimize these problems and implement\n\
    Applied Computational Intelligence and Soft Computing\n21\nblockchain in the safest\
    \ possible way. Although the sug-\ngested approach may not stop these attempts,\
    \ it makes it\ndiﬃcult for hackers to carry them out.\nA 51% assault happens when\
    \ one person or group of\nhackers gather more than half of the hash rate and takes\
    \ over\nthe entire system, which may be fatal for blockchains that\nhandle ﬁnancial\
    \ transactions. In this case, hackers can alter\ntransactions and stop the veriﬁcation\
    \ process. In sequence,\nthe entire model will not add the transactions to the\
    \ blocks.\nTe attackers can even undo already ﬁnished transactions,\nwhich leads\
    \ to double-spending. Tankfully, by increasing\nthe hash rate and reducing the\
    \ usage of proof-of-work\ntechniques, we can avoid 51% assaults. Te results conclude\n\
    that this particular threat does not beneﬁt the attacker itself\nbecause the main\
    \ goal of the suggested agricultural model is\nto organize farm environmental\
    \ data, distribute it to all\nnetwork participants, and provide a layer of security\
    \ and\nconﬁdentiality to these data.\nPhishing attacks are seriously impacting\
    \ blockchain\nnetworks. Te purpose of a phishing attack is for the hacker\nto\
    \ obtain the user’s login information. To the owner of the\nwallet key, they may\
    \ send emails that appear to be honest.\nTe user must enter their login information\
    \ into a false\nhyperlink that is connected. A user’s passwords and other\nsensitive\
    \ information may be compromised, which may\ncause harm to both the individual\
    \ and the blockchain\nnetwork. If blockchain network members get an e-mail\nasking\
    \ for login information, they must conﬁrm with the\npartner (other members, for\
    \ example). Additionally, in-\nstalling malicious link detection software might\
    \ aid in\ndefending against this threat. We can point out that con-\nnecting to\
    \ the blockchain through public Wi-Fi could be\nrisky.\nRouting attacks, for example,\
    \ are attacks when a hacker\nuses the anonymity of a user account to intercept\
    \ data as they\nget sent to Internet service providers. Data transfer and\nactivities\
    \ continue as usual in the case of a routing attack, so\nthe participants are\
    \ typically oblivious to the threat. How-\never, establishing a secure routing\
    \ protocol will solve this\nissue. Te users of the network must use strong passwords\n\
    and update them often. In practice, some farms are pretty\nlikely to adopt this\
    \ architecture, and there is a critical need to\nnotify every blockchain participant\
    \ of the risks related to\ndata security.\nUsers connect with the blockchain using\
    \ electronic\ndevices like computers and smartphones, which are the\nendpoints\
    \ of the blockchain network. Hackers can target\ndevices and monitor user activity\
    \ to obtain the user’s key.\nTe participants should not save blockchain keys on\
    \ com-\nputers as text ﬁles by network users. Identifying dangers and\nsecuring\
    \ the device include installing antivirus software.\nHackers could consider creating\
    \ plenty of phony net-\nwork nodes (Sybil attack). Tey can gain majority consensus\n\
    and stop the chain’s transactions using this technique.\nMassive Sybil strikes\
    \ implied a 51% attack. Te suggested\napproach utilizes suitable consensus methods\
    \ and keeps\ntrack of the actions of other nodes.\nSmart contract vulnerabilities\
    \ can be risky because they\ncan lead to security ﬂaws in the source code. In\
    \ this case, the\ncode is straightforward, only analyzes information, detects\n\
    crop growth conditions, and assesses the state of the product.\nOur smart contract\
    \ source code will continually get updated.\nFor instance, we may utilize the\
    \ Oyente Analysis Tool to ﬁnd\nvulnerabilities in contracts built on Ethereum.\
    \ Tis tech-\nnique evaluates the bytecode of the Ethereum blockchain.\nTe goal\
    \ of analyzing and measuring connectivity,\nmonitoring sensors, and making intelligent\
    \ modiﬁcations\nand enhancements is to maximize price and quality. IoT\ndevices\
    \ generally use Linux operating system, typically the\ncustomized version. Data\
    \ are protected when they ﬂow from\nthe local machine to the other scheme stages\
    \ in IoT security\n(blockchain and smart contract layer). IoTdevices frequently\n\
    have a mobile application and are used to connect to devices\nvia the Internet.\
    \ When monitoring the sensors wirelessly,\nuse a VPN to connect to them. Man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks\nwill never be possible with a VPN solution. Block unneeded\nnetwork\
    \ ports, for example, the Telnet port should be\ndeactivated to prevent further\
    \ Telnet protocol attacks. By\nallowing traceable proof of ownership of products\
    \ and by\nintegrating unique tags (e.g., RFID, NFC, and QR codes) to\ncreate smart\
    \ tags, we can add a few supply chain logistics to\nensure traceability and protect\
    \ the information exchanged\nthrough blockchain.\n5. Conclusion and Future Work\n\
    In conclusion, blockchain and IoT technologies can aid in\ndeveloping a secure,\
    \ transparent, open, and innovative\necological agriculture system that involves\
    \ all participants.\nTis work aims to provide a possible technique to build\n\
    practical blockchain-based applications and change the\nagriculture industry,\
    \ even though the evolution of block-\nchain and agriculture research studies\
    \ is still in its infancy.\nTis model is considered a prototype for reducing ﬁnancial\n\
    loss and agricultural pollution. Te system deﬁnes the three\nprimary entities\
    \ in the agriculture domain: data, process, and\nstakeholders. Adding a cryptocurrency\
    \ process for the in-\nteraction between the entities and registering/tracking\
    \ the\nseller’s land will be a big step for this blockchain system\nmodel.\nData\

    \ 51 \n \n 1 \n1. Introduction \nAs is advocated by the United Nations, efficiency\
    \ of the life cycle of production process \nis an important consideration for\
    \ sustainable development. This study aims to quantitatively \nassess the degree\
    \ to which Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sensor \nnetworks\
    \ can help increase crop yield in farmland and cut down on the consumption of\
    \ \nresources. Additionally, in agriculture, excessive application of nutrients\
    \ can be regarded as \npollution. Therefore, pollution prevention is an additional\
    \ consideration in sustainable \nagricultural development. An ICT sensor network\
    \ is an effective tool to monitor external \nconditions and collect data for making\
    \ decision for agricultural inputs allocation (i.e., watering, \nfertilizer application,\
    \ and pesticide application) for optimal outcome (i.e., crop yield).  \nIn this\
    \ study, a model to simulate the performance of farms that are equipped with ICT\
    \ \nsensor networks for controlling usage of agricultural inputs, with the data\
    \ collected from \npublications and from the service providers that focus on utilizing\
    \ ICT sensor networks in \nagriculture. With the model, an estimated value of\
    \ possible outcomes (crop yield, resource \ninputs) was calculated. \nThis study\
    \ answered a question that how to use existing technologies to increase crop \n\
    yields, while reducing agricultural inputs and the associated negative ecological\
    \ impacts. The \nresults of this study have important implications for improving\
    \ the yield and productivity of \nfarming, and for the sustainable development\
    \ of agriculture. The effects of the climatic zones in \nwhich the farms are located\
    \ on performance of ICT sensor networks are also analyzed, and the \ninfluence\
    \ of location variation proved to be insignificant.  \n \n \n \n2 \n2. Background\
    \ \n2.1 Problem statement \nA growing population and the corresponding needs for\
    \ food throughout the world have \nprompted farm owners to expand the scale of\
    \ planting. As farm size expands, it is no longer \nfeasible to rely on collecting\
    \ data manually for making decisions on agricultural activities \n(Brase, 2006).\
    \ Breakthroughs in areas of information technology, lower manufacturing and \n\
    usage cost, smaller size, and longer life span have made sensors ubiquitous items\
    \ for the public \n(Nack, 2019), and there has been a trend that ICT sensors technologies\
    \ are being widely applied \nin agriculture, controlling the usage of water, fertilizer,\
    \ and pesticide. Meanwhile, in many \nstudies that discussed wireless sensor networks\
    \ in farms, the effects of using this service were \nnot clearly mentioned. To\
    \ describe the performance of ICT usage on farms, two types of \ninformation (indicators)\
    \ should be provided: the percentage of agricultural resources that can be \n\
    saved, and the increase in crop yield that are realized by using wireless sensor\
    \ networks. Some \nof the articles listed both indicators, while some of them\
    \ only provided one or neither of these \nindicators. \nMany previous studies\
    \ on sensor networks in agriculture have focused mainly on the \ndeployment and\
    \ configuration of wireless sensor networks, and the collection of environmental\
    \ \ndata. Work by Sakthipriya(2014) is a typical example. In the study by Sakthipriya(2014),a\
    \ crop \nmanagement system has two types of functions, sensing and decision making.\
    \ The sensor \nnetwork can collect environmental parameters including temperature,\
    \ soil moisture and soil pH \nvalue. Based on these environmental parameters sent\
    \ to the backbone, decisions on whether the \nwater sprinkler should be turned\
    \ on to provide sufficient water to the field can be made. \nHowever, there has\
    \ been little quantitative analysis on the potential of wireless sensor \nnetworks\
    \ to enhance crop yield or improve efficiency of resource use. Most of the studies\
    \ claim \nthat the wireless sensor networks solution they discussed will improve\
    \ or boost the crop \nproduction. iFarm designed by Jiber et al. (2011) is a typical\
    \ example. This system provided \nirrigation management (monitoring and controlling\
    \ water usage), pest and disease detection, \ncrop yield prediction, and resource\
    \ optimization. Few studies provided the percentage or \nincremental gain in crop\
    \ production and saving on agricultural inputs. For example, Xiong et \nal.(2008)collected\
    \ a variety of environmental and animal-related data (e.g. breed, days in milk,\
    \ \n \n3 \nmilk time, milk quality, reproduction status, location), but further\
    \ utilization of the data in \npredicting animal activities or future production\
    \ was not carried out. \n2.2 Research objectives \nThe overall purpose of my study\
    \ is to evaluate how the farmland and crop would \nrespond, when wireless sensor\
    \ networks are deployed to monitor and control how much water, \nfertilizer, and\
    \ pesticide are used. I decided to carry out research based on the performance\
    \ data \ncollected from existing farms using this type of service. The goal of\
    \ my research is to determine \nthe quantitative relationships between use of\
    \ wireless sensor networks and performance \nindicators (change in crop yield\
    \ and agricultural resource usage on farms). The analysis is based \non existing\
    \ farms that have already been equipped with wireless sensor networks and that\
    \ have \ncollected performance indicator data.  \nTherefore, my major research\
    \ questions are: \n(1) To what degree can ICT sensor networks boost crop yield\
    \ by monitoring and \ncontrolling the usage of water, fertilizer, and pesticide?\
    \ \n(2) If ICT sensor networks could be deployed throughout a selected country\
    \ or area, \nhow could the annual yield of crops change?  \n \n \n \n4 \n3. Literature\
    \ review \nIn this literature review, concepts of sustainable development, an\
    \ introduction to ICT \nsensor network, and applications of ICT sensor networks\
    \ are discussed.  \n3.1 Sustainable Development and ICT sensor networks \n3.1.1\
    \ Overview of sustainable development \nThe United Nations in 1987 articulated\
    \ a need “to make development sustainable to \nensure that it meets the needs\
    \ of the present without compromising the ability of future \ngenerations to meet\
    \ their own needs” (World Commission on Environment and Development, \n1987).\
    \ This concept drew the attention of the public toward finding ways to avoid sacrificing\
    \ \nthe natural environment for economic growth. Over time, given the changing\
    \ needs of people \nwith respect to the environment, society and economy, the\
    \ practices and definition of \nsustainable development need to be up-to-date.\
    \  \nThe US Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency\
    \ defined \nsustainable agricultural development as “Agricultural sustainable\
    \ development refers to the \napplication of local intrinsic technology to achieve\
    \ the following objectives for a long time and \nstrive to form a comprehensive\
    \ production system for plant and livestock production.” (Hebei \nAcademy of Social\
    \ Sciences, 2017). These objectives include (1) to meet the needs of people's\
    \ \nfood and clothing; (2) to improve the quality of the environment and natural\
    \ resources on which \nagricultural production depends; and (3) to make the most\
    \ efficient use of non-renewable \nresources and materials available on farms,\
    \ and at the same time, comprehensive regulation of \nnatural resources management\
    \ methods is carried out if necessary; (4) maintaining the \neconomic vitality\
    \ of agricultural production entities; and (5) improving the overall quality of\
    \ \nlife of farmers and the whole society (Hebei Academy of Social Sciences, 2017).\
    \ \nA report from the United Nations claims that if the global population increases\
    \ to 9.6 \nbillion in the next 30 years, the equivalent of three planets would\
    \ be required to meet the \ndemands of humans given current lifestyles (United\
    \ Nations, 2016). Facing the challenge of \nfulfilling growing demands with limited\
    \ resource, it is essential to increase the efficiency of \nusing resources, so\
    \ the United Nations proposed a concept of Sustainable Consumption and \nProduction.\
    \ Based on the principle of higher efficiency with smaller input and more output,\
    \ this \n \n5 \nconcept improves the quality of life while reducing resource consumption\
    \ and environmental \ndegradation and pollution levels throughout the consumption\
    \ and production cycle, thereby \nenhancing the welfare benefits of economic activities\
    \ (United Nations Environment Programme, \n2010).  \nIn 2015, the General Assembly\
    \ adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals for the \nfollowing 15-year lifespan,\
    \ aiming to achieve sustainable development inclusively for everyone. \nAmong\
    \ the 17 goals, Sustainable Development Goal 12 (also known as SDG 12) is most\
    \ related \nto this study. SDG 12 was to build a more sustainable and production-efficient\
    \ world. Its major \ntargets include (1) promoting resource and energy efficiency,\
    \ and (2) promoting sustainable \ninfrastructures (United Nations, 2015). The\
    \ SDGs were intended to promote a new worldview \nand provide the beginnings of\
    \ a plan to end poverty without imposing significant costs on \nEarth’s life-support\
    \ systems. The goals may help create a fresh global narrative around a \ncommon\
    \ future to mobilise collective action and help develop a shared understanding\
    \ of \ninterconnected risks and solutions(Gaffney, 2014).  \n3.1.2 Agricultural\
    \ waste issues \nHigher production and smaller input are required for sustainable\
    \ development. To meet \nthe demand for food by a growing global population, an\
    \ expansion in agricultural production is \nneeded. As farm sizes expand, it is\
    \ no longer viable to rely on collecting data manually for \nmaking decisions\
    \ on agricultural activities (Brase, 2006). At the same time, various sensors\
    \ \nwhich have lower manufacturing and utilization costs, smaller size, and longer\
    \ life spans, have \nbecome ubiquitous items for the public (Nack, 2019).  \n\
    Another aspect of accomplishing United Nation’s SDG 12 is to reduce the solid\
    \ waste \nthat is generated from production processes, which could cut down on\
    \ the amount of raw \nmaterials that manufacturers have to obtain from nature\
    \ or artificially create (Bishop, \n2004).Relevant to this research is agriculture\
    \ waste, produced by agricultural activities. \nAgricultural waste is comprised\
    \ of animal waste (manure, animal carcasses), food processing \nwaste (only 20%\
    \ of maize is canned and 80% is waste), crop waste (corn stalks, sugarcane \n\
    bagasse, drops and culls from fruits and vegetables, pruning) and hazardous and\
    \ toxic \nagricultural waste (pesticides, insecticides and herbicides, etc.) (Ramírez-García\
    \ et al., 2019; \nObi et al., 2016). \n \n6 \nMost chemicals of agricultural waste\
    \ are water-soluble and can leach and enter water \nbodies and food, leading to\
    \ severe ecologic and human health impacts.  This can cause serious \nhealth disorders\
    \ in humans, including cancer, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, birth\
    \ \ndefects, and reproductive disorders. Pesticides can also kill non-target plants,\
    \ birds, and other \nwildlife, and have a significant negative impact on soil\
    \ quality and fertility (Ramírez-García, \nGohil, & Singh, 2019). \nFertilizer\
    \ contains massive amount of nutritive minerals including nitrogen, phosphorus,\
    \ \nand potassium which provides support for plants to grow faster and increase\
    \ yields. However, if \nthe application of fertilizer surpasses the crop/soil\
    \ system’s capacity to absorb the nutrients, the \nexcessive minerals will leak\
    \ into surface runoff, and eventually enter waterbodies such as lakes, \nrivers,\
    \ creeks, etc. (Karunanithi et al., 2016). When the excessive NPK minerals enter\
    \ the \nwaterbody, eutrophication occurs, with mass production of photosynthetic\
    \ microorganisms. \nWhen these photosynthetic microorganisms die, bacteria activity\
    \ decomposing this biomass can \ndeplete dissolved oxygen, causing other organisms\
    \ such as fish to die of hypoxia (Wetzel, \n2001). \nUnited States Environmental\
    \ Protection Agency recommended the following ways to \nmitigate the pollution\
    \ by excessive agricultural inputs: (1) applying nutrients in the right \namount,\
    \ at the right time of year, with the right method and with the right placement;\
    \ (2) \nEnsuring year-round ground cover to avoid soil erosion and nutrients loss\
    \ to the waterway; (3) \nPlanting field buffers. Planted buffers can help prevent\
    \ nutrient loss from fields by absorbing or \nfiltering out nutrients before they\
    \ reach a water body; (4) Installing fence along waterways to \nkeep animals off\
    \ the stream, river, etc. (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2019)\
    \ \n \nIn the context of this study, ICT sensor networks are deployed on farms\
    \ to collect \ninformation about the factors that would affect crop yield, such\
    \ as soil water content, fertilizer \nusage, and soil/atmospheric temperature\
    \ (Meeradevi & Mundada, 2015). Once information has \nbeen collected, it can be\
    \ processed in two different directions. The first is that information can \n\
    be sent directly to terminal clients and then converted into graphic deliverables\
    \ by visualization \nsoftware. With visualized content about the farm environment,\
    \ farm managers would know \nbetter about how the farm works, and what kind of\
    \ strategies they should take for better or more \n \n7 \nefficient crop production.\
    \ The second direction focuses on the idea of agricultural resource and \nwaste\
    \ control. The sensor network keeps contributing to making decision on the ground\
    \ \nregarding the proper amount of water, fertilizer and pesticide to be applied\
    \ on site. \n3.2 What is ICT sensor network? \nInformation and Communication Technology\
    \ is a varied cluster of digital tools and \nresources used to communicate, generate,\
    \ disseminate, store and perform information \nmanagement (Rahman et al., 2016).\
    \  \n3.2.1 Internet of Things \nIn this study, the main infrastructure used for\
    \ improving production is the sensor \nnetwork. The ICT sensor network is a subset\
    \ of the Internet of Things (IoT), referring to the \ninterconnection of smart\
    \ devices, ranging from appliances to tiny sensors (Stallings & Brown, \n2018).\
    \ An advantageous feature of the Internet of Things is that short-range mobile\
    \ transceivers \nare embedded in various gadgets and daily necessities, thereby\
    \ enabling new forms of \ncommunication between people and things, and between\
    \ things. The cloud systems today \nsupport the interconnection of billions of\
    \ industrial and personal objects. These objects can pass \ninformation collected\
    \ from distributed sensor nodes. Utilizing this low-latency information can \n\
    be used to effectively monitor the environment and make decisions for overall\
    \ management of \nlarge systems such as factories or cities. The farms involved\
    \ in this study are benefiting from \nthis technology. From the initial PC and\
    \ server to later professional operational technology and \npersonal electronic\
    \ communication equipment, sensor-based internet of things represents the \nlatest\
    \ products and trends of the Internet (Stallings & Brown, 2018). \nThe sensor\
    \ nodes are the most basic and underlying devices of an Internet of Things, \n\
    and at the same time they represent one of the core technologies of the wireless\
    \ sensor networks \nfor this study. A single sensor unit consists of five key\
    \ components, sensor, actuator, micro-\ncontroller, transceiver and radio-frequency\
    \ identification (Stallings & Brown, 2018), which will \nbe discussed in a following\
    \ subsection regarding sensor node structure. \nIn the context of a complete enterprise\
    \ network, an Internet of Things may have four \ndifferent layers. The bottom-up\
    \ order of these layers is the edge layer, the fog layer, the core \nlayer and\
    \ the cloud layer. The edge layer is mainly composed of sensors and switches,\
    \ which \n \n8 \ncan communicate information to each other when needed. At this\
    \ layer, there are a few \ngateways that connect sensors to communicate with higher-level\
    \ networks. After the data is \ncollected by the gateway, it is transmitted to\
    \ the fog layer. The amount of data this layer \nreceives from distributed sensor\
    \ networks on the ground is usually very large, so a significant \nfeature of\
    \ the fog layer is that it can be evaluated close to the edge layer. This can\
    \ effectively \nreduce the pressure on the entire network from transmitting a\
    \ large amount of data, whether it \nconsumes bandwidth or consumes other resources.\
    \ The main functions of the core layer above \nthe fog layer are to connect the\
    \ broadly distributed fog layer, and to open the interface to \nexternal servers.\
    \ The cloud layer on the top of the network, provides storage and processing \n\
    capabilities for large amounts of aggregated data sensor nodes from the edge (Stallings\
    \ & \nBrown, 2018). \n3.2.2 Network structure and architecture \nThe realm of\
    \ wireless networks can be divided into infrastructured and infrastructureless\
    \ \nnetworks. A typical infrastructured wireless network consists of a central\
    \ base station where all \nthe information transmitted from the ground is processed,\
    \ and nodes collect information at \nground level. A cellular wireless network\
    \ is the most common type of infrastructured network. \nDifferent from the infrastructured\
    \ network, an infrastructureless wireless network has \ndistributed, independent,\
    \ dynamic topology, low-power, task-oriented wireless nodes. With \nthese features,\
    \ a lot of decisions can be made at ground level, and as a result, some unnecessary\
    \ \ninformation for high-level decision-making will be removed from the information\
    \ package \nwhich will be sent to a central base station (Jangra, 2010). The wireless\
    \ sensor networks to be \ndiscussed in this study is a typical instance of an\
    \ infrastructureless network.  \n \nStallings and Brown (2018) summarized a sensor\
    \ network as a cluster of sensors \ntransmitting their data to one intermediate\
    \ entity that aggregates the data to be collected by a \nhigher-level entity.\
    \ There are five steps that a sensor network should take when a sensor node \n\
    has fetched data from an external environment: \n(1) Evaluation: evaluating data\
    \ for criteria as to whether it should be processed at a \nhigher level. \n(2)\
    \ Formatting: reformatting data for consistent higher-level processing. \n \n\
    9 \n(3) Expanding/decoding: handling cryptic data with additional context (such\
    \ as the \norigin). \n(4) Distillation/reduction: reducing and/or summarizing\
    \ data to minimize the impact \nof data and traffic on the network and higher-level\
    \ processing systems. \n(5) Assessment: determining whether data represent a threshold\
    \ or alert; this could \ninclude redirecting data to additional destinations.\
    \ \nAn advantage of the four-layered architecture of the Internet of Things networks,\
    \ is that \nthe size of data packets to be transmitted gradually shrinks as data\
    \ moves from ground level to \nthe higher levels (Stallings & Brown, 2018). \n\
    Another distinguishing characteristic of a sensor network is fog computing, which\
    \ is an \nopposite technical trend to cloud computing. Cloud computing refers\
    \ to the network that makes \nmassive and centralized storage, and processing\
    \ resources available to distributed users or \nclients. In fog computing, many\
    \ smart devices (e.g. sensors) are interconnected by fog network \nfacilities\
    \ that provide data processing function which is close to the sensors rather than\
    \ the \nhigher-level devices (Stallings et al., 2012). In terms of the efficiency,\
    \ the fog network between \nthe smart devices layer and the core network layer\
    \ enables lots of vital decisions to be made by \nthe smart devices on the edge.\
    \ That is to say, the time it takes for sensed data at ground/edge to \ntravel\
    \ to the higher-level cloud server can be saved by processing in the fog network.\
    \ The \narchitecture of the IoT equipped with a fog network relieves the burden\
    \ of computing in the \ncentral part of the IoT system, which in turn allows more\
    \ smart devices to be engaged in the \nnetwork. Owing to the rapid detection or\
    \ rapid measurements of sensors on edge, the risk of \ndisaster from a cascading\
    \ system failure would be decreased, and therefore the potential costs to \nmaintain\
    \ and repair the system would be saved (Cisco, 2015). Sliva’s research on WSNs\
    \ \nincludes a five-layered protocol, including a physical layer, a data link\
    \ layer, a network layer, a \ntransport layer and an application layer (Sliva,\
    \ 2008).Appendix Figure A1 is a common \narchitecture of ICT sensor network (Telecommunication\
    \ Standardization Sector of International \nTelecommunication Union, 2014). The\
    \ multi-layer feature of a sensor network is clearly \nillustrated in Appendix\
    \ Figure A1.  \n \n10 \n3.2.3 Sensor node structure \nNodes are a fundamental\
    \ part of a viable wireless sensor network. There are four major \ncomponents\
    \ in a node which are a power unit (e.g. battery sets), sensing unit, processing\
    \ and \nstorage unit and transceiver unit (for communication), with the major\
    \ structure of a node \ndepicted according to Sliva (2008)(Appendix Figure A2),\
    \ and a more detailed explanation (El-\nKader & El-Basion, 2013) (Appendix Figure\
    \ A3). In a fog network, these nodes have an \nadditional component, the microcontroller,\
    \ which is the intelligence for making basic decisions \nat ground level of a\
    \ whole network. \nTo ensure a sufficiently long network life, energy efficiency\
    \ in all parts of the network \nis critical. Therefore, data processing tasks\
    \ are often spread across the network: that is, nodes \nneed to cooperate to transmit\
    \ data to receivers (Galar & Kumar, 2017). \nIn real-world application of wireless\
    \ sensor networks in agriculture, one of the main \nconcerns and barriers is that\
    \ the farm owners or operators would worry about the costs of \nrunning the network\
    \ in fields, which includes the initial expense of setting up and configuring\
    \ \nhardware, the costs of maintenance and replacement, and of electricity for\
    \ devices in the long \nrun (Sliva, 2008; El-Kader & El-Basion, 2013). In order\
    \ to minimize the costs of nodes, more \ncircuits should be integrated into each\
    \ chip. Regarding the energy, less memory and less \npowerful processing units\
    \ in ground devices can be used to reduce cost (Sliva, 2008). This \nstrategy\
    \ makes sense, but at the same time it would increase the burden of computing\
    \ in a \ncentral base station, and in turn slow down the speed of processing data\
    \ and making decisions. \n3.2.4 Wireless standard used in ICT sensor networks\
    \ \nAt present, there are many standards and protocols for the wireless transmission\
    \ of \nsignals in wireless sensor networks. Among them, the following protocols\
    \ are the most \nfrequently used(Sohraby , Minoli, & Znati, 2007):  \n• IEEE 802.15.1\
    \ (also known as Bluetooth);  \nBluetooth is a standard for short range, low power,\
    \ and low-cost wireless \ncommunication that uses radio technology. Its short-range\
    \ wireless capability allows \nperipheral devices to communicate over a single\
    \ air-interface, replacing the cables that \n \n11 \nuse connectors with a multitude\
    \ of shapes, sizes and numbers of pins (McDermott-Wells, \n2004). \n• IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n\
    \ series of wireless LANs;  \nIEEE 802.11 and 802.11x refers to a family of specifications\
    \ developed by the IEEE for \nwireless local area network (WLAN) technology. 802.11\
    \ specifies an over-the-air \ninterface between a wireless client and a base station\
    \ or between two wireless clients \n(IEEE Standard Association, 2020). \n• IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4 (ZigBee);  \nZigBee is a specification for a suite of high-level communication\
    \ protocols using low-\npower digital radios based on IEEE 802.15.4. The technology\
    \ defined by the ZigBee \nspecification is intended to be simpler and less expensive\
    \ than the other consumer \nwireless personal area networks, such as Bluetooth.\
    \ A distinguishing feature of ZigBee \nis low cost, which allows this technology\
    \ to be widely used in the area of wireless \ncontrolling (Radmand, Talevski,\
    \ Petersen, & Carlsen, 2010). \n• MAN-scope IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX);  \nWiMAX standard\
    \ is a family of 802.16, that provides, multiple physical layer (PHY) \nand Media\
    \ Access Control (MAC) options (Nuaymi, 2007). \n• Radio-frequency identification\
    \ (RFID) tagging. \nThere are two general categories of RFID tagging, active and\
    \ passive, depending on \ntheir source of electrical power. Active RFID tags contain\
    \ their own power source, \nusually an on-board battery. Passive tags obtain power\
    \ from the signal of an external \nreader. This technique has been used widely\
    \ in the areas of supply chain management, \nsecurity, and movement tracking (Weinstein,\
    \ 2005). \nThese transmission protocols and their corresponding properties, including\
    \ transmission \nrange and speed, have been summarized in previous literature\
    \ (Sohraby et al., 2007; Ojha et al., \n \n12 \n2015). When configuring transmission\
    \ protocols for WSNs, the person who makes the decision \nshould select the appropriate\
    \ one based on energy availability, nodes characteristics, and \nperformance requirement\
    \ of this network. Appendix Figure A4 and Appendix Table A1 show \nthe differences\
    \ in data transmission rate, transmission range, and energy consumption of these\
    \ \navailable transmission protocols.  \nThe technologies described above enable\
    \ many sensors to be deployed in crop fields in \na non-destructive way, which\
    \ in turn helps increase the resolution when mapping soil, plant, \nand livestock\
    \ properties.  \n3.2.5 Energy efficiency matters \nThe energy consumed by an ICT\
    \ sensor network mainly has two aspects, the direct \ncurrent brought by the battery\
    \ used by the node, and the alternating current consumed by the \ndata center\
    \ or core layer of the network when processing data. A technology used to facilitate\
    \ \nsustainable development should be in line with its own idea of sustainable\
    \ development. \nTherefore, energy efficiency in ICT sensor networks should be\
    \ considered. Improving energy \nefficiency in the ICT solutions requires both\
    \ policy and technology guidelines (Cremer et al., \n2010). In terms of technologic\
    \ guidelines, these solutions start with where the ICT industry \nconsumes energy.\
    \ For example, server clusters, data centers, and base stations that are now \n\
    commonly used consume electric power for daily operations on the one hand, and\
    \ cooling \nhardware on the other(Fagas, Gammaitoni, Gallagher, & Paul, 2017).\
    \ For energy consumed to \nmaintain daily operations, the base station should\
    \ first ensure that there are no in-situ servers \nthat are powered on but not\
    \ working at all. The second step is to transform the traditional data \ncenters\
    \ into next generation hyperscale data centers. This upgraded data center has\
    \ 25% higher \nenergy efficiency than the traditional one. From 2016 to 2020,\
    \ a hyperscale data center is \npredicted to shrink the overall energy consumption\
    \ by 50%, with these small and less-efficient \ndata centers shut down (Jones,\
    \ 2018). \nTackling cooling down or maintaining system temperature is another\
    \ technical \nimprovement direction. Monitoring real-time operation conditions\
    \ including temperature and \nhumidity makes it possible to make dynamic actions\
    \ on the right timing to run a cooling system. \n \n13 \nThis practice can avoid\
    \ excessive cooling when the workload in the data center is not heavy \n(Shuja\
    \ et al., 2012). \nOptimizing computing procedure and network architecture is\
    \ another guideline for \nhigher efficiency. For example, streamlining the computing\
    \ process, scaling dynamic voltage \nand frequency for high-performance tasks,\
    \ and balancing the data pipeline are all feasible \noptions for architecture\
    \ (Fagas et al., 2017; Satran, 2018). However, implementing these \nmeasures to\
    \ improve the energy efficiency of ICT sensor networks will inevitably encounter\
    \ \nobstacles. As is mentioned above, guidelines for improving energy efficiency\
    \ in ICT industry \nimpact initially the businesses from an economic perspective,\
    \ and it will inevitably add \nfinancial burden to both business owners and their\
    \ clients/consumers. For instance, adding \ntaxes or extra fees to the price of\
    \ a product is never an easy task, because the stakeholders \nmight be reluctant\
    \ to accept this increase in cost. \nIn terms of deploying advanced cooling systems\
    \ for higher energy, this practice has two \nmajor obstacles for implementation.\
    \ The first one is the price that data centers have to pay for \nthis upgrade,\
    \ because cost-controlling is the very basis of running business in a robust manner.\
    \ \nAnother barrier is that some smart temperature controlling systems that are\
    \ integrated into data \ncenters involve deep customization for better compatibility.\
    \ Therefore, it will take time and \nefforts to set up such a system for a data\
    \ center. \nThe third guideline mentioned above may have technical difficulty\
    \ in implementing, \nthat is the transformation and upgrading of legacy architecture\
    \ and computing algorithms is a \nmentally work-intensive job, and it requires\
    \ massive assistance from external sources. If so, \nfurther collaboration between\
    \ internal and outsourced workers will cost time and effort for this \nintegration.\
    \ \n \n3.3 Applications of the Internet of Things \n \nInternet of Things has\
    \ been applied in various industries, including but not limited to \ngrid, transportation,\
    \ logistic and healthcare (Wu, 2010). This study mainly discusses the \napplication\
    \ of IoT in healthcare and finance. \n \n14 \n3.3.1 The Internet of Things in\
    \ Healthcare \nThe Internet of Things solutions for healthcare includes the following\
    \ aspects, \nequipment for patients, equipment designed for doctors' work, and\
    \ networks for hospital \nmanagement. \nInternet of Things for patients. IoT solutions\
    \ for monitoring the health or medical \nconditions of individuals are able to\
    \ collect parameters from patients, using the body-sensor \nnodes that are equipped\
    \ in wearable devices. These solutions play an important role in \nimproving the\
    \ quality of life and survival opportunities of critically ill patients and chronically\
    \ \nill patients. Fortino et al. (2014)designed a body sensor networks called\
    \ BodyCloud, which can \ngather real-time data regarding body temperature, blood\
    \ pressure, and electrocardiography, and \nconduct further processing on raw data,\
    \ data storage and analysis. Fanucci et al (2012)created a \nsystem to monitor\
    \ the vital signs of chronic heart failure patients. In this system, signs including\
    \ \nelectrocardiogram, SpO2, blood pressure, and weight are collected by non-invasive\
    \ sensor \nnodes. These data will be transmitted from sensor nodes to a home sensor\
    \ gateway for checking \nwhether the status of a patient who is prone to suffering\
    \ from heart failure is abnormal, \ncompared with the pre-set safety value range.\
    \ Once the detected values are beyond the \nthreshold, alerts will be sent from\
    \ home gateway and calls for instant supports, which allows \nearlier home interventions\
    \ thus reducing the number of hospitalizations. \nThe Internet of Things also\
    \ has significant impacts on the elderly who are living alone \nand their families\
    \ by continuously tracking their health. When someone's daily activities are \n\
    disturbed or changed, the alert mechanism will send signals to family members\
    \ and medical \npersonnel. For example, falls are a serious problem for the elderly,\
    \ so it is imperative to apply \nfalls detection in the daily life of the elderly.\
    \ There have been plenty of IoT-based fall detection \nand alerting solutions.\
    \ In Gutiérrez-Madroñal et al.’s (2019)solution of fall detection, once their\
    \ \nmotion sensors observe that the change in the acceleration of human motion\
    \ conforms to the \nfall pattern, these sensor nodes will determine a fall event,\
    \ and then an alert will be sent for help. \nThe combination of home monitoring\
    \ devices, such as wearables and fog computing, \ncan allow doctors to more effectively\
    \ track the patient's health. After the sensors installed on \nthe patient are\
    \ processed locally, the data necessary for the doctor's diagnosis will be uploaded\
    \ \nto the cloud. Doctors can track the patient's compliance with the treatment\
    \ plan or any need for \n \n15 \nimmediate medical attention. The Internet of\
    \ Things has made healthcare professionals more \nalert and able to proactively\
    \ contact patients. The data collected from IoT devices can help \ndoctors determine\
    \ the best treatment process for patients and achieve the expected results \n\
    (Alam et al., 2018). \nInternet of Things for hospitals. The National Health Service\
    \ in England declared the \npractices of using IoT in healthcare is effective\
    \ in tracking medical supplies and automating \nbasic data collection and patient\
    \ monitoring, so that the experienced healthcare workers can be \nset free from\
    \ repetitive tasks to focus on patients’ safety and services(Best, 2018). Hospitals\
    \ can \nuse IoT technology to track the use of medical equipment and consumables.\
    \ In most hospitals, \nequipment such as electrocardiographs and analgesic pumps\
    \ needs to be shared by patients. IoT \ncan not only provide insights for hospital\
    \ staff to plan resource allocation by sending the real-\ntime location of the\
    \ device, but also can be used to monitor the maintenance status of the device\
    \ \nand issue alerts when appropriate. For some medical consumables that are being\
    \ consumed at \nfast speed, low-cost RFID tags allow them to be marked, so it\
    \ is easy to count usage and then \ncharge the patient's account. At the same\
    \ time, tracking the usage of these medical consumables \ncan also help hospitals\
    \ manage inventory. For example, when the consumption of certain items \nis too\
    \ high or the rate of use is too fast, an alarm will be issued to remind the hospital\
    \ to \nreplenish inventory or reduce excessive consumption (Laplante & Laplante,\
    \ 2016). \nFor hospitals and some other healthcare providers, the significance\
    \ of using IoT is that \nafter collecting a massive amount of data from ground\
    \ devices, meaningful trends and \nconclusions can be drawn through centralized\
    \ sorting and analysis. These analytics deliverables \ncan be suggestions of medical\
    \ assistance or overall visualization of the condition of a patient \ngroup. Figure\
    \ 1is an illustration of the workflow of IoT solutions in healthcare (Mora et\
    \ al., \n2017; Mora, Gil, Terol, Azorín, & Szymanski, 2017) \n \n16 \n \nFigure\
    \ 1. Schema of IoT workflow (Mora et al., 2017) \n3.3.2 The Internet of Things\
    \ in Finance \n \nThe applications of IoT have transformed the way that the financial\
    \ sector works. \nKhanboubi et al. (2019)summarized the following trend in which\
    \ IoT solutions are changing \nfinancial services, mobile banking, crowd-based\
    \ financing, virtual money, high frequency \ntrading firms, cyber criminality,\
    \ big data and IT analytics. The applications of IoT in finance \ncan be classified\
    \ into two categories, one is financial services for individual users and corporate\
    \ \nusers, and the other is the measures used by banks and other financial institutions\
    \ to optimize \nand upgrade their own workflow. The most common of the first type\
    \ of application is the \nbanking service provided to users that can be accessed\
    \ at any time through a personal terminal. \nThese services include using the\
    \ user’s biological information to perform security \nauthentication of the banking\
    \ business or to replace the physical signature during the business \nprocess;\
    \ using the built-in near-field communication technologies (NFC) module of mobile\
    \ \nphone or wearable device to complete contactless payment; collecting funding\
    \ from a large \nnumber of individual to support a project financially via an\
    \ online platform (Khanboubi et al., \n2019). \nThere are some other IoT applications\
    \ in finance designed for business security and risk \nmanagement. For example,\
    \ Industrial and Commercial Bank of China is using IoT solutions for \nits financing\
    \ business risk management practices. RFID tags are deployed on collateral to\
    \ detect \nthe movement of objects. Any abnormal movement can trigger the alarm\
    \ system, a realization \n \n17 \nof the automatic collection of alarm information\
    \ and early warning of risk monitoring (InfoQ, \n2019). \n3.4 Concerns regarding\
    \ sensor nodes and the network \nAs discussed above, ICT sensor networks can indeed\
    \ play an effective role in detecting \nfarmland environment and controlling the\
    \ application of yield technology, but use of this \ntechnology in agriculture\
    \ is confronted with the limitations and challenges including, but not \nlimited\
    \ to, lifetime, energy and reliability. \n3.4.1 Energy consumption and Battery\
    \ life \nThe power unit is an essential part of an ICT sensor node (Sliva, 2008).\
    \ Rechargeable \nbatteries are usually used for power supply in a sensor node,\
    \ which have limited capacity and \npose a challenge to long-term deployment.\
    \ These batteries provide stable electricity to the other \nmodule in a sensor\
    \ node, so that each part of the node can work properly. To enhance energy \n\
    efficiency within a sensor node, the circuits and algorithm of the processing\
    \ and calculating \nmodule of a node have to be further optimized (Jawad, Nordin,\
    \ Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, \n2017). In wireless sensor networks, the lifetime\
    \ of a node is generally determined by its power \nunit, usually the life of batteries\
    \ used in the sensor nodes. To utilize the maximum of the battery \nlife, power\
    \ consumption of the nodes should be strictly controlled, which means that the\
    \ \nprogram and algorithms inside the nodes should be optimized and improved (Sliva,\
    \ 2008). The \ngood news is that the problem of limited node lifespan can be addressed,\
    \ with the use of \nenergy-harvesting techniques. Numerous techniques have been\
    \ developed to allow sensor nodes \nto harvest different types of energy, such\
    \ as solar, wireless power transfer, mechanical vibration, \nkinetic, and wind\
    \ energy, from different environments. Ambient energy can be converted into \n\
    electrical energy, and the electric energy can be used to charge the battery of\
    \ a sensor node, or \nit can be stored for later use. In agricultural applications,\
    \ energy harvesting can be used to \nextend the life of sensor nodes (Jawad, Nordin,\
    \ Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017). \n3.4.2 Equilibrium among energy consumption,\
    \ transmission range and node performance \nIn the realm of wireless communication\
    \ protocols, ZigBee consumes much less power \nthan these traditional transmission\
    \ methods, including Wi-Fi and GPRS, but the latter has a \nwider transmission\
    \ range. Similar trade-offs occur from time to time. Zigbee and low-energy \n\
    \ \n18 \nBluetooth are designed for battery-powered devices. Low-energy Bluetooth\
    \ is superior to \nZigBee in terms of power consumption, but due to its short\
    \ communication distance of 10 \nmeters, the protocol is limited in agricultural\
    \ applications. The Long-Range Radio (LoRa) \nProtocol covers large communication\
    \ areas with low power consumption. Therefore, it can be \nappropriately deployed\
    \ in a wide agricultural field. However, for this protocol, limited \ncommunication\
    \ time per hour for each device and message capacity for communication, and its\
    \ \ndependency on gateway make this protocol no longer the best option for configuring\
    \ \nagricultural ICT sensor networks (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail,\
    \ 2017). \n3.4.3 Transmission loss \nWhen deployed for agricultural purposes,\
    \ WSN faces a more difficult environment than \nother uses, such as outdoor, orchards,\
    \ farms and other complex terrain. Signal transmission will \nbe disturbed by\
    \ obstacles. In agricultural applications, signals transmitted from sensor nodes\
    \ \nneed to reach the receiving node through a thick canopy. If a sufficient gap\
    \ cannot be ensured, \nthe signal will be absorbed, reflected, attenuated and\
    \ scattered during the propagation process \n(Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad,\
    \ & Ismail, 2017). \n3.4.4 Immediate and reliable \nThe starting point for the\
    \ establishment of WSN determines that one of its first tasks is \nto provide\
    \ farmers with low-latency environmental information. Most crops are easily affected\
    \ \nby the weather. If WSN fails to detect environmental changes in a timely manner,\
    \ or detects \ninformation but does not transmit it to relevant clients in a timely\
    \ manner, it may lead to serious \nagricultural disasters, such as large-scale\
    \ diseases and insect pests, floods, fires, etc. Regarding \nsome existing ICT\
    \ sensor networks deployed in farms, the way they work is still to wait until\
    \ \nsymptoms appear so that the disease can be detected. Such systems do not qualify\
    \ as early \nwarning systems in detecting disease and pests (Datir & Wagh, 2014).\
    \ \n3.4.5 Fault tolerance \nIn ICT sensor networks, it is normal for one of the\
    \ hundreds of thousands of nodes to \nfail. Common causes include power exhaustion,\
    \ communication failure, and sensor module \nfailure. At this time, the most important\
    \ thing is to design a set of topological structures with \nstrong fault tolerance,\
    \ to prevent the entire network from collapsing due to a failed node(Jawad, \n\
    \ \n19 \nNordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017). Apart from solving this problem\
    \ from the \nperspective of network topology, some further improvement on the\
    \ combination of nodes \narchitecture and the network can be done as well. Geeta\
    \ et al.(2013) suggested a possible way \nof improvement. A single sensor node\
    \ should have the capability to send early alert to its \nneighbour node when\
    \ its battery is low or when it gets external interference, offering the \nnetwork\
    \ with enough time to adjust a transmission route to avoid network collapse. Hang\
    \ et \nal.(2015)designed a three-tiered unmanned aerial vehicle sensor network\
    \ for capturing \ninformation from farmland. This architecture realizes the extension\
    \ of the life of sensor nodes \nby reducing the transmission tasks of sensor nodes\
    \ in WSN. It enhances the data collection \nefficiency and life of the entire\
    \ system by enhancing the function of relay nodes and power \nsupply, reducing\
    \ resource consumption caused by transmission node failures, and improving \n\
    the network communication quality provided by mobile nodes. \n3.4.6 Data management\
    \ \nAgricultural monitoring practices generate large amounts of data because multiple\
    \ \nWSNs in agricultural applications include multiple crop sensor growth analysis\
    \ and harvest \nestimates. This situation requires the base station to monitor\
    \ and change farmland through \nanalysis mode. Therefore, base stations must support\
    \ high levels of storage capacity (Jawad et \nal., 2017). \n3.5 Review of ICT\
    \ sensor networks in agriculture \nDigital farming is the practice of modern technologies\
    \ such as sensors, robotics, and \ndata analysis for shifting from tedious operations\
    \ to continuously automated processes \n(Shamshiri et al., 2018). The terms digital\
    \ farming and precision agriculture are often used to \ndescribe the same concept\
    \ in many current contexts, but they are not the same thing. The \nconcept of\
    \ precision agriculture (PA) has been proposed for ages. At the very beginning,\
    \ PA \nwas mainly focused on the matching of environmental factors such as insitu\
    \ climate, soil \nproperty, and crop species (Krishna, 2016). \nInnovation in\
    \ digital farming occurs where the crops interact with their external \nenvironment,\
    \ for example, the physical, biological, and chemical components (Es van & \n\
    Woodard, 2017). Therefore, inspiration for innovations could be derived from the\
    \ factors that \naffect crop productivity. Lazarcik (1963) developed a term output-input\
    \ ratio for measuring \n \n20 \nproductivity. This ratio is about the relationship\
    \ of agricultural output to all production inputs \nused to produce that output.\
    \ It measures average aggregate productivity of all inputs together \n(operating\
    \ expenses, depreciation, interest on capital and cost of labor). It indicates\
    \ that in order \nto increase the productivity in agriculture, measures aiming\
    \ for both higher output and smaller \ninput should be taken. \nThere have been\
    \ many achievements in using wireless sensor networks in farms to \nmonitor the\
    \ environmental factors that affect crop yield, including but not limited to soil\
    \ \nmoisture, temperature, pH value, soil microbes load. Kalaivani et al. (2011)surveyed\
    \ ZigBee-\nbased wireless sensor networks in agriculture, which covers the features\
    \ and some drawbacks \nof the application of ZigBee in agribusiness. This transmission\
    \ protocol has good capability of \ntransmitting data with few losses within its\
    \ complimentary range, with low power consumption, \nprice and deployment difficulty.\
    \ However, the transmission quality can be significantly \nimpaired as the distance\
    \ changes and vegetable canopy keeps growing. The reason is that there \nis a\
    \ significant gray zone which is a range of distance between transmitter and receiver\
    \ where \nthe transmission doesn't work, and if the route between transmitter\
    \ and receiver is physically \nblocked by plant canopy, the connection would be\
    \ disturbed and closed (Kalaivani , Allirani, & \nPriya, 2011). \nYadav et al.\
    \ (2012)described a method to use wireless sensor networks to ensure that \neveryone\
    \ has enough food in some developing areas. In this study, wireless sensor networks\
    \ \nwere used to monitor the life cycle of food from producing stage to sales\
    \ stage. This monitoring \nprocess includes establishing a database by mapping\
    \ agricultural production and food shortages, \nconstructing efficient ways of\
    \ communication during emergency, monitoring real-time \nagricultural conditions\
    \ and sending an alert if an indicator meets its threshold. \nOjha et al.(2015)reviewed\
    \ various applications of WSNs in an agricultural context. \nThey divided wireless\
    \ sensor networks into two types according to different scenarios, which \nare\
    \ Terrestrial WSNs and Underground WSNs. They also listed some potential applications\
    \ \nsuch as automated irrigation scheduling for saving water, maintaining an optimized\
    \ \nenvironment for higher plant growth, monitoring cattle activities and ground\
    \ water quality to \nensure the cattle are staying in an appropriate environment\
    \ and location, simulating greenhouse \ngas distribution, and agricultural production\
    \ processing monitoring. These applications indicate \n \n21 \nthe feasibility\
    \ of utilizing ICT sensor network technologies in farms to improve production\
    \ by \ncreating optimal environment for crops. \nZhao et al. (2010) designed a\
    \ greenhouse environment monitoring system using IoT \ntechnology. This system\
    \ can control the on-site environment in real time according to the needs \nof\
    \ plants for temperature and humidity. Also, it’s able to collect a large amount\
    \ of \nenvironmental data and send it to research institutions for further processing\
    \ and analysis. \nDholu and Ghodinde (2018)created a similar IoT-based system\
    \ which can sense necessary \nparameters from the environment and make the necessary\
    \ decisions to control an actuator for \nirrigation. \nThe application of the\
    \ Internet of Things in agriculture is not limited to reading \nenvironmental\
    \ parameters and then taking corresponding irrigation or fertilization measures.\
    \ \nThe information collected by smart devices in the Internet of Things can be\
    \ accurately analyzed \nto improve agricultural productivity. Elijah et al.(2018)classified\
    \ the analysis into the following \ncategories. \nPrediction. The huge quantity\
    \ of environmental data such as moisture and temperature \ncollected by sensor\
    \ nodes and other smart devices in an IoT network can be used to develop \npredictive\
    \ algorithms to notify when diseases, drought, flood or fire is about to happen.\
    \ \nInventory management. In terms of storing agriproducts, external moisture\
    \ and \ntemperature can influence the quality of products significantly. In this\
    \ scenario, sensor nodes \nare deployed in inventory to collect this information.\
    \ After the data analysis has been sent to the \ncloud and analysis has been conducted,\
    \ automatic command will be sent for adjusting the \ncondition of inventory. This\
    \ practice can reduce the negative influence of spoilage and pests on \nfood quality.\
    \ \nDecision making. Big data obtained from sensors provides learning opportunities\
    \ to \nimprove decision-making for changing environmental conditions. An ideal\
    \ outcome of this \nanalysis is automatic decision-making by IoT systems involving\
    \ few human interventions, \nwhich could set the workers free from repetitive\
    \ work. \nInsurance. Agricultural activities are vulnerable to natural disasters.\
    \ IoT devices \ndeployed in remote areas can notify farmers or insurance companies\
    \ when a hazard or disaster \n \n22 \nis detected, reminding them to settle claims.\
    \ When extreme weather or another condition is \ndetected, access to information\
    \ by an insurance company can allow the company to make \nautomatic direct payment\
    \ to policyholders, initiated by the IoT system (Elijah, Rahman, \nOrikumhi, Leow,\
    \ & Hindia, 2018). \nUtilizing ICT sensor networks for collecting data from farmland\
    \ assists the farmers to \nmatch cropping practices to climatic trends, to use\
    \ inputs and resources more sustainably and \nreduce environmental impact, and\
    \ to cope with productivity threats. Moreover, it can enable \npublic officials\
    \ to integrate the data across the country and to adjust policies to reflect the\
    \ data \ncollected, to predict food supplies, and to target social programs or\
    \ promote yield technologies \n(World Bank, 2017). \n3.6 How do crops interact\
    \ with the external environment? \n3.6.1 Environmental factors \nWater and temperature\
    \ \nUnfavorable water and thermal conditions could sharply reduce crop yields.\
    \ For \nexample, excessively high temperature proved to have negative effect on\
    \ the yield of maize \n(Carter et al., 2016) and at the same time low-temperature\
    \ stress may damage photosynthesis \n(Oquist, 1983).Excessive high or low temperature\
    \ would impede the activity of enzymes, and \naffect the efficiency of metabolism\
    \ of plants.  \nAgriculture is one of the major consumer industries in the world\
    \ (Cazadilla et al., 2010). \nTwo aspects related to water consumption should\
    \ be considered, the direct effects of water \ncontent on crop growth, and the\
    \ economic cost of using water. In agribusiness, the term water \nproductivity\
    \ (WP), defined as the amount of yield produced per unit volume of water (\U0001D458\
    \U0001D454/\U0001D45A3), \nis often used to assess the efficiency of water usage\
    \ (Patil et al., 2015). Therefore, higher yield \nwith smaller water input can\
    \ be regarded as success in improving the productivity of crops. \nRespiration\
    \ by soil microorganisms can increase with increasing irrigation under water stress,\
    \ \nbut excessive irrigation can suppress soil respiration under the condition\
    \ of flooding (Wang, \nZhao, & Ouyang, 2010). For the crops, changes in atmospheric\
    \ moisture can alter the way their \nstomata work, and in turn the process of\
    \ plant transpiration, energy balance and tissue \ntemperatures (Grantz, 1990).\
    \ In some cases, the combination of high temperature and high \n \n23 \nvapor\
    \ pressure deficits could result in crops wilting when the water that crops take\
    \ up from soil \ncannot make up for the evaporation loss into the air (Carter,\
    \ Melkonian, Riha, & Shaw, 2016).  \nSoil nutrients \nSoil nutrients can be divided\
    \ into three types according to the amount that plants need \nduring for growth:\
    \ primary nutrients, secondary nutrients and micro-nutrients (Moore & \nBradley,\
    \ 2018). Fertilizer can be considered as a supplement to the original deficiencies\
    \ in the \nsoil, and the amount of fertilizers added to the soil should be precisely\
    \ calculated and controlled. \nN, P, and K are the most limiting factors in crop\
    \ production (primary nutrients) (Warpe & \nPippal, 2016).However, excessive application\
    \ of N-P-K fertilizers would lead to degradation of \nboth soil and water quality,\
    \ and production of crops. For example, nitrate leaching from the \nirrigated\
    \ farmland may move to lakes and groundwater, and then result in eutrophication\
    \ in \nlakes and nitrogen pollution in groundwater (Ju et al., 2007; Savci, 2012).\
    \ This practice in \ncontrolling the volume and usage of fertilizer is coined\
    \ as fertilizer management, which takes \nenvironmental, agronomic and economic\
    \ effects into consideration (Matson, Naylor, & Ortiz-\nMonasterio, 1998). \n\
    Soil pH \nA major issue regarding soil pH in agribusiness is soil acidity, resulting\
    \ from diverse \ncauses. For example, the parent rock material may enter soil\
    \ or groundwater due to weathering \n(Xu, 2015). Another cause of acidification\
    \ emerging in recent decades is the excessive use of \nchemical fertilizers. Common\
    \ chemicals found in artificial fertilizers, including ammonium \nsulfate, ammonium\
    \ phosphate, potassium nitrate, and ammonium nitrate have proven to be able \n\
    to lead to increase in H+ concentration in farmland soil (Pierre, 1928). A direct\
    \ effect of higher \nconcentration of H+ on soil is that activities and metabolism\
    \ of the microbes in soil could be \naffected. Altered soil pH may create conditions\
    \ that are less optimal for microbes or plants. \nExtreme pH could even inactivate\
    \ them. Some researchers have demonstrated the correlation \nbetween the soil\
    \ enzyme activity and crop yield (Tautges, Sullivan, Reardon, & Burke, 2016).\
    \ \nThere is another indirect effect that H+ could have on the soil. Higher concentration\
    \ of H+ \ncould change the form in which aluminum (and other metals) exist in\
    \ soil, and can increase the \n \n24 \nsolubility of Al+3in soil pore water (Gazey\
    \ & Azam, 2018). Excessive aluminum can lead to \nthe death of aquatic organisms,\
    \ the wilting of terrestrial plants, the reduction of crop yields, and \nthe decline\
    \ of forests (Weng, Huang, Liu, & Sato, 2000). Research conducted by Abruña-\n\
    Rodríguezet al. (1982) showed that higher concentrations of H+ and Al+3, decreased\
    \ the yield \nof crops like yam and cassava relative to their maximum yield. \
    \ \nSoil microbes \n \nSoil microbes consist of the fungi and bacteria in soil.\
    \ Soil microbes maintain or alter \nthe microscopic soil physical and chemical\
    \ properties by their metabolic activities, including \nthe soil properties in\
    \ the plant rhizosphere, influencing the efficiency with which plants are able\
    \ \nto utilize the soil nutrients (Sessitsch & Mitter, 2015). There is increasing\
    \ evidence that \nbiotechnology using microbes or their metabolites can enhance\
    \ nutrient uptake and yield of \ncrops, control pests and reduce plant stress\
    \ responses (Trivedi, Schenk, Wallenstein, & Singh, \n2017). At the same time,\
    \ research conducted by Gu et al. (2009)showed that a combination N-\nP-K fertilizer\
    \ could increase soil microbial biomass, diversify bacterial communities, and\
    \ \nmaintain crop production.  \nSoil depth \nResearch conducted by Khakural et\
    \ al.(1996)shows that the fertility of deeper soil can \ncontribute much to crop\
    \ yield than the fertility of topsoil. Williams et al. (1999) found that \nunder\
    \ sub-optimal living conditions, the properties of topsoil are definitely important\
    \ for \npredicting crop yield, while the properties of subsoil are relatively\
    \ more important in limiting \ncrop yields under normal conditions (Williams,\
    \ Ahuja, Naney, Ross, & Barnes, 1987). \nFarmland slope \n \nFarmland in sloping\
    \ area tends to have a thinner layer of soil (Atherton, Morgan, \nShearer, Stombaugh,\
    \ & Ward, 1999). Steep slopes are more vulnerable to soil erosion, therefore \n\
    soil layer on the slope is usually thinner, and the soil water content and soil\
    \ fertility are also \nrelatively poor (Mohammadi, Jalali, Kooch, & Said-Pullicino,\
    \ 2016), although Yang et \nal.(1998)found that the slope of farmland can have\
    \ a positively significant relationship with \nyield of wheat. \n \n25 \n3.7 Cultural\
    \ factors \n \nCommon cultural practices in agriculture include irrigation patterns,\
    \ fertilizer \napplication, planting spacing and density, intensity of various\
    \ routine agricultural practices, and \nharvesting time. The mechanism by which\
    \ some of these practices is able to influence crop \nyield is by modifying the\
    \ availability of sunlight (Atherton, Morgan, Shearer, Stombaugh, & \nWard, 1999).\
    \ Pathiratna et al.(2004)conducted several experiments to study the effects of\
    \ \nfertilizer, spacing and shade on the growth and yield of Aerva lanata. Results\
    \ from these \nexperiments showed that crops treated with organic and inorganic\
    \ fertilizers could produce \nhigher dry matter yields. Crops established with\
    \ a closer spacing have lower yield and growth \nthan those with wider planting\
    \ spacing, if yield per area is not considered. Ashraf and Saeed \n(2006) compared\
    \ two different irrigation methods in an area with saline groundwater. The \n\
    result shows that root zone of the crops which are treated with alternative, reduced-frequency\
    \ \nfurrow irrigation has smaller accumulation of salt than that with regular\
    \ furrow irrigation \n(Ashraf & Saeed, 2006). The planting date of a crop is fundamental\
    \ information for the \nmodeling of planting activities. It can be calculated\
    \ based on historical weather information \n(Dobor et al., 2016). Research conducted\
    \ by Kucharik (2008) in the United States shows that \nthe planting date, especially\
    \ the timing of planting the seeds has a significant impact on yield of \nmaize.\
    \ \nApart from the factors above, Krebs (1984)mentioned that there are some major\
    \ ways \nthat crops yield can be improved, including (1) improved quality of crop\
    \ varieties, (2) improved \nresistance to diseases, (3) improved resistance to\
    \ insects, and (4) adaptation to climatic \ncondition. \nThese known factors provide\
    \ direction for researchers and farm operators to improve \ncrops yield and labor\
    \ productivity. Among these factors, soil properties that can be measured by \n\
    sensors include soil moisture, concentration of specific ions required for plant\
    \ growth, and soil \nelectrical conductivity. Lab test and insitu measurements\
    \ on these soil properties of their \ncorresponding sensors are well matched.\
    \ However, for a lot of soil nutrients and soil organic \nmatter, there are not\
    \ reliable sensors for measurement.  \n \n26 \n3.8 Integration of sensor networks\
    \ with other ICT products for boosting production in \nagriculture \nAgriculture\
    \ is an important sector for the continuous growth of developing countries, \n\
    especially large agricultural countries. More than 80% of those who live in remote\
    \ areas are \nengaged in agriculture. The World Bank provided a guideline to guarantee\
    \ the security of \nreliable and stable access to nutritious, affordable food,\
    \ with access resilient to climate change. \nAs the World Bank pointed out in\
    \ a report, increasing the output of the agriculture, forestry, \nanimal husbandry\
    \ and fishery industries requires: 1) utilizing insitu technologies to characterize\
    \ \nfield conditions, in order to provide the optimal resources for plant growth.\
    \ These farming \npractices, after optimization, would result in more sustainable\
    \ and profitable farming; 2) \neliminating yield losses through early warning\
    \ systems. This revolves around identifying the \ninfection, disease, and upcoming\
    \ bad weather. \nMost farmers have access to the means of production and yield\
    \ enhancing technologies \nthat can help them increase their crop yields, such\
    \ as fertilizers and pesticides. Meanwhile, \nsometimes they do not know how to\
    \ use these products in a proper way. Although these \nproducts are usually equipped\
    \ with instructions, different application scenarios always have \ndifferent applicable\
    \ standards, with no universal standard practice. In this case, ICT technology\
    \ \ncan fill the gap of farmers' knowledge. With the help of ICT farmers can use\
    \ the optimal \nsolution for consuming resources in agriculture(World Bank, 2017).\
    \ \nIn agricultural production, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are often used\
    \ in \nconjunction with ICT sensor networks. UAV is very suitable for spraying\
    \ pesticides and \nfertilizers due to its high speed and spraying efficiency (Costa\
    \ et al., 2012). However, as is \nmentioned in Faiçal et al.’s work(2014), the\
    \ working route of a UAV spraying pesticides or \nfertilizer is prone to being\
    \ disturbed by wind.The architecture and workflow of Costa’s \nUAV+sensor networks\
    \ monitoring system was similar to that of Faiçal et al.The UAV has to \ncommunicate\
    \ with sensor nodes on the ground periodically to make sure that it’s in the proper\
    \ \nlocation (Costa et al., 2012). \nZhang et al. (2015) designed a three-tiered\
    \ UAV farmland sensor network (TUFSN) for \ncapturing information. Figure 2is\
    \ an illustration of their network architecture. The data \ncollection layer on\
    \ the ground is where the distributed sensor network can monitor the external\
    \ \n \n27 \nenvironment and grab information. In this layer, a large number of\
    \ sensor nodes are deployed to \nstrengthen the monitoring of a target data collecting\
    \ area. Another feature of this layer is self-\norganization. Layered protocols\
    \ and distributed algorithms allow wireless sensor nodes to \nautonomously schedule\
    \ their work processes. When deployed to a specific area and activated, \nthe\
    \ corresponding network can be organized automatically. The relay transmission\
    \ layer \nconsists of a network established between the relay node and the UAV\
    \ mobile node. This layer \nhas the following characteristics: 1) simple structure:\
    \ direct communication between UAV and \nthe data collection layer; 2) more energy\
    \ available: the data collection layer is generally \npowered by solar energy\
    \ so that UAV can be powered by rechargeable batteries; 3) stable and \nreliable:\
    \ UAV communicates with the ground data collection layer in the air. The possibility\
    \ of \nbeing blocked by plants or houses in the middle is low, and the packet\
    \ loss rate will be reduced; \n4) Long communication distance: the communication\
    \ quality is good, and it can provide larger \npower antenna coverage. The mobile\
    \ convergence layer consists of a single or multiple UAVs \nand a network established\
    \ between data centres. UAV and data centres are directly connected \nby a cellular\
    \ data network. The mobile convergence layer network has a very long \ncommunication\
    \ distance, has error detection and packet loss retransmission functions, and\
    \ \nsupports real-time or delayed data transmission. Compared with the traditional\
    \ static WSN, in \nterms of economic efficiency, this architecture is more suitable\
    \ for scattered land, hills and \nmountains, and the ground wireless sensor network\
    \ has difficulty or is unable to form a \ncomplete network due to natural environment\
    \ constraints. They are divided into multiple \nindependent networks. The limitation\
    \ of this system is that flight missions are performed only \nwhen data are needed,\
    \ so the frequency of UAV flights determines the frequency of data \nupdates (Zhang\
    \ et al., 2015). \n \n28 \n \nFigure 2. Three-tiered UAV farmland sensor network\
    \ by Zhang et al. (2015) \nApart from the sensor networks studied in this article,\
    \ image-based techniques are \nanother major part of the ICT solutions applied\
    \ in agriculture. Remote sensing is a hit. In \ngeneral, remote sensing technology\
    \ refers to acquiring image information about an object in a \nnon-invasive way,\
    \ without actually coming into contact with it, from a physically high altitude\
    \ \nand a macro perspective (Horning, 2008). \nWhen applied to agriculture, the\
    \ major role of remote sensing technology is to collect \nraw data from farmland.\
    \ The methods of obtaining data and the form of data from mobile \nphones include\
    \ aerial images taken by airplane, helicopter, radio-controlled aircraft, and\
    \ \nunmanned aerial vehicles; satellite images captured by satellites in orbit;\
    \ surface GPS receivers \nand satellite linkage to obtain positioning information;\
    \ laser scanning, using a set of laser beams \nto measure accurate elevation,\
    \ i.e. the distance from an aircraft to features on the ground, \npruning the\
    \ disturbance of trees and buildings on the ground. This means that when measuring\
    \ \nthe elevation of sensing aircraft, ground elevation under tree canopy can\
    \ be measured (World \nBank, 2017).After data are collected by remote sensing\
    \ technology, the following analytic tools \nare used to provide a deeper understanding\
    \ of the farmland system being studied. With spatial \nmodeling, existing data\
    \ can be used to simulate the real-world farmland. Using data mining \ntechniques,\
    \ patterns of crops, such as their growth rate characteristics can be extracted\
    \ from the \ndata set. \n \n29 \nThe workflow of collecting and analysing image-based\
    \ data has been widely used in \nagriculture. Reinecke and Prinsloo(2017)designed\
    \ a system, using drones to capture aerial \nphotos of plant leaf. These data\
    \ were used to determine whether the crops were healthy. \nHonkavaara et al.(2013)used\
    \ drones to take aerial images at pre-set time intervals at the \nbeginning of\
    \ the crop growing season, during the season, and before harvest to check the\
    \ \ngrowth of the entire field and highlight growth stagnation caused by insufficient\
    \ irrigation or \nlow initial nitrogen content. Biossard et al. (2008)provided\
    \ a technique based on automatic \ninterpretation applied to images of rose leaves\
    \ scanned in situ. They propose a cognitive vision \nsystem that combines image\
    \ processing, learning, and knowledge-based technologies. The \nsystem is able\
    \ to detect and count white flies (Trialeurode Vaporariorum Westwood) at \nmaturity.\
    \ This technology provides early warning for pest management so that measures\
    \ can be \ntaken to reduce losses before the pests become severe.  \nApplication\
    \ of remote sensing technology is not limited to identifying bad weather, \nplant\
    \ disease and pests. On a smaller scale, this technology is widely used on individual\
    \ crops, \nsuch as for classification of vegetables, fruits, and livestock. Traditionally,\
    \ the classification \nwork is often finished by the human workers who are well\
    \ trained and experienced. However, \nthere are some disadvantages to relying\
    \ on the human workforce for classification. For example, \nthe classifying worker\
    \ may feel tired or lose concentration and then lower the accuracy of \nclassification.\
    \ Ideally, there should be a standard diagram for the workers to refer to when\
    \ \nclassifying, which will increase difficulty of work. Also, raters are prone\
    \ to various illusions \n(Barbedo, 2013). Therefore, image processing techniques\
    \ are needed for these tasks to relieve \nworkload.  \nGastelum-Barrios et al.(2011)reviewed\
    \ newly emergent non-invasive image processing \nmethods in determining the quality\
    \ of fruits during and after the harvesting period, and \nconcluded that it is\
    \ a high-efficiency and harmless solution to grade the fruits. Singh et al. \n\
    (2011)customized an automated classifier of four different bamboo species based\
    \ on shape \nfeatures of bamboo Culm sheath, using the central moment classifier.\
    \ Their classifier for \nbamboo shows considerable recognition accuracy, which\
    \ has great potential on saving labour of \nmanually recognizing bamboo species.\
    \ This outcome proved the possibility of putting this \ntechnology into commercial\
    \ use. Latha et al.(2014) implemented an image processing function \n \n30 \n\
    to detect weed areas. Once the function was equipped onto pesticide sprayers,\
    \ the automatic \nsprayers can target these blocks covered by weed. This not only\
    \ saves pesticides, but also \navoids generating agricultural waste, and additional\
    \ effects on the environment and other plants \ncaused by excessive use. \nPatil\
    \ (2011) designed a measuring method for leaf area based on image processing \n\
    techniques. A traditional graphic measuring method was used to verify the accuracy\
    \ of \nmeasuring leaf area using image processing. The new method proved to have\
    \ high precision \nand accuracy and take less processing time. This result provided\
    \ a theoretical basis for the \ndevelopment of an imagery leaf area meter that\
    \ meets the requirements of precision farming. \nXu et al. (2011)developed an\
    \ algorithm that can tell whether the plants are suffering \nfrom nutrient deficiency,\
    \ by recognizing the color and texture of the leaf. The accuracy of this \ndiagnostic\
    \ algorithm was above 82.5% and it was able to diagnose disease 6–10 days before\
    \ \nexperts could determine it. Arakeri et al. (2015)implemented a system which\
    \ provided early \nwarning to detect diseases on tomatoes. Tomatoes are very prone\
    \ to a disease called late blight, \nwhich happens when leaves get infected with\
    \ Phytophthora infestans fungus. Typical \nsymptoms of fungus infection include\
    \ irregularly shaped leaves and water-soaked lesions. This \nalert system was\
    \ able to recognize whether a leaf was ill or healthy, and whether the leaf had\
    \ \ncontracted the Phytophthora infestans fungus. The accuracy of analyzing the\
    \ late blight disease \nwas 84%. Chen et al. (2014)proposed an effective method\
    \ for judging the nutrient content of \ncrops. They extracted characteristic parameters\
    \ from years of images of healthy leaves and \nnutritionally deficient leaves.\
    \ They were able to determine from an image of a rice leaf whether \nthe plant\
    \ was deficient in N, P, and K based on the attributes of leaf sheath length,\
    \ leaf area / \nleaf length, leaf tip, leaf lightness, etc. The average identification\
    \ accuracy of this method for \nassessing N/P/K deficiencies was around 88%.In\
    \ 2019, Chen et al. optimized the algorithm of \nthis detection method, and the\
    \ average accuracy of recognition increased to 93.4%. \nApplication of image-based\
    \ technologies is not limited to crop assessment; it is \napplicable in animal\
    \ husbandry as well. Image processing systems have been widely used in \nmonitoring\
    \ livestock for many applications, including identification, tracking, behavior\
    \ analysis, \noccupancy rates, and activity calculations. Kashiha et al. (2014)designed\
    \ an image processing \nsystem for checking whether hens were staying inside the\
    \ chambers. This system could save \n \n31 \nmuch time on manually analysing videos\
    \ for monitoring hen chambers. Pradana et al. \n(2016)designed a method to accurately\
    \ estimate the weight of cattle, by visually measuring the \nbody length, chest\
    \ circumstance, height and width. Wongsriworaphon et al. (2012)conducted \nsimilar\
    \ research, but their focus was to recognize individual pigs based on their size\
    \ and weight. \nAppendix Table A2 from Gong (2010) compares the differences of\
    \ the node sensors \nfrom the perspective of price, reliability, performance and\
    \ power consumption. This table also \nlists some environmental parameters that\
    \ can be measured by available sensors, such as \ntemperature, carbon dioxide\
    \ concentration, and relative humidity. \n3.9 A case study illustrating use of\
    \ UAV and ICT sensor networks in sustainable agriculture \nThe system Faiçal et\
    \ al. (2014)designed for the linkage of unmanned aerial vehicles \n(UAV) and ICT\
    \ sensor networks for spraying pesticides is a typical application in agriculture,\
    \ \nand is described in detail in subsections below to illustrate the use. \n\
    3.9.1 Research background \n \nSpraying pesticides and fertilizers in farmland\
    \ is vital for crop yields. Aircrafts are \nbecoming more common and popular for\
    \ this task, mainly because of the speed and efficiency \nof aircraft spray operations.\
    \ However, certain factors may reduce yield and even cause damage. \nFor example,\
    \ the spraying process might miss some crop areas, repeat spraying in the same\
    \ \ncrop area, and apply pesticides to the outer edges of the farmland. This study\
    \ proposed an \narchitecture based on unmanned aerial vehicles that could be employed\
    \ to implement a control \nloop for agricultural applications with UAVs responsible\
    \ for spraying chemicals on crops. An \nalgorithm to adjust the UAV’s motion routes\
    \ when confronted with constantly changing wind \nwas also assessed in this work.\
    \ \n3.9.2 Methods and procedure \n \nIn this solution, an unmanned aerial vehicle\
    \ and several sensor nodes are deployed in \nthe farmland. The function of the\
    \ sensor mainly includes obtaining the current concentration of \nthe pesticide\
    \ chemical from the soil. Sensor nodes also communicate with the drone in the\
    \ air at \nany time to help the UAV verify its real-time position to avoid crossing\
    \ a boundary and \nspraying where it should not, or spraying an area repeatedly,\
    \ resulting in excessively high \n \n32 \nconcentrations of pesticides in a small\
    \ area causing damage to the crop. If the sensor detects \nexcess chemicals, the\
    \ drone in the air will be directed away from this area of excessive \nconcentration.\
    \ The role of the drone is relatively simple, it receives the concentration \n\
    information on the ground and judges whether it is necessary to spray. \nThe researchers\
    \ used the following steps to ensure that UAV sprayed pesticides where \nappropriate.\
    \ (1) The algorithm sends a message periodically to query sensor nodes scattered\
    \ \nthroughout the farmland. A sensor node located at a previous location of the\
    \ drone responds to \nthis message with information about the amount of pesticide.\
    \ (2) With this information, the \ndrone can calculate the difference in pesticide\
    \ concentration between each sensor node. (3) If \nthe difference is larger than\
    \ the predetermined threshold, the algorithm will re-plan the route, \notherwise\
    \ it will continue to advance in the predefined path and wait for the next round\
    \ of query. \nRegarding the robustness of this proposed algorithm for spraying\
    \ pesticides, the following \naspects were assessed. \nCalibration of UAV routes.\
    \ An unmanned aerial vehicle is influenced by wind when it is \nworking. A dataset\
    \ containing information about wind direction and intensity was used to \nreproduce\
    \ the constantly changing weather conditions, and check if the UAV was able to\
    \ \nhandle the changes. Also, considering the nature of the linkage of ICT sensor\
    \ network and \nUAV in this project, whether the number of message exchanges between\
    \ the two terminals \nwould improve performance was evaluated. \nMapping the pesticide\
    \ concentration. ICT sensor networks provide location information \nand information\
    \ on chemical concentrations to the UAV. However, in practice, crops may not \n\
    get the appropriate amount of pesticide. Possible reasons are the UAV may be flying\
    \ too fast, or \nthe pesticide spraying process may be disturbed by wind. Therefore,\
    \ given the information \nabout nodes location and their corresponding chemical\
    \ concentration, a complete map of \npesticide concentration distribution can\
    \ be drawn. A heat map is an illustration of pesticide \ndistribution, where green\
    \ represents higher concentrations, and red low concentrations (Figure \n3). For\
    \ the spraying system in this study, an ideal outcome is that each node of it\
    \ has the same \nor similar color. \n \n33 \n \nFigure 3. Map after the application\
    \ of the interpolation technique (Faiçal et al., 2014) \nPotential correlation\
    \ between UAV height and spray coverage. Researchers speculate \nthat drones need\
    \ to fly to a certain altitude when spraying to get the best spray effect. There\
    \ \nmay be a relationship between the spray angle / coverage and the height of\
    \ the drone, meaning \nthat the higher the UAV’s altitude, the larger the area\
    \ covered by the spray may be. \n3.9.3 Case study results \n \nFigure 4is a map\
    \ of pesticide concentrations after actual testing. Higher uniform the \ncolors\
    \ of this map represents higher stability and robustness of the algorithm, and\
    \ this feature \nlets the vehicle to be more resistant to wind disturbance. Most\
    \ areas of the farmland were \nsprayed with similar concentrations of pesticides,\
    \ leaving only several small clusters with \ninsufficient pesticide concentrations.\
    \ Researchers assessed the relationship between time \nrequired for communicating\
    \ with sensor nodes on the ground and height of the UAV, and the \ncorrelation\
    \ turned out to be insignificant. \n \nFigure 4. Map after the application of\
    \ the threshold value (Faiçal et al., 2014) \n3.9.4 Case study summary \nThis\
    \ project provided a practical example of the combination of ICT sensor networks\
    \ \nand some other ICT solutions, aiming to make agricultural activities to be\
    \ more precise. \nAccording to the result of assessing with simulation tools,\
    \ the algorithm designed for the \ncollaboration between UAV and ICT sensor networks\
    \ proved to work well. After further insitu \ntesting procedures, it would be\
    \ possible to utilize the system to improve sustainability in crop \nproduction\
    \ (Faiçal et al., 2014). \n \n \n34 \n4. Methodology \nThis study consists of\
    \ two parts designed to answer the research questions. The first part \nis to\
    \ simulate the performance (which is indicated by annual yield in this study)\
    \ of a farm where \nICT sensor networks are deployed. The second part is to conduct\
    \ a meta-analysis on the \noutcomes of existing studies and publications. \n4.1\
    \ Data sources \nData and information for this study were collected by two major\
    \ means, (1) published \nacademic papers that discussed the change in crop yield\
    \ of specific ICT sensor networks-based \nfarms; and (2) contacting the companies\
    \ who provide ICT sensor networks solutions for details \nof how the solutions\
    \ they provide work and performance data of their service. \n4.1.1 Samples overview\
    \ \n \nThis study examines how the annual crop yield would change, when ICT sensor\
    \ \nnetworks are deployed to control usage of water, fertilizer, and pesticide.\
    \ Therefore, the sample \nfarms in this study all use ICT sensor networks to control\
    \ one or more of these agricultural \nresource usages. Figure shows the distribution\
    \ of where the selected farms are located. The \ninvolved crop types in this study\
    \ include maize, grape, rice. \n \nFigure 5. Geographical distribution of the\
    \ farms involved \n \nYara Water Solution is a part of a Farm Management System\
    \ offered by Yara Inc.in \nNorway, which can enable the farmers to save irrigation\
    \ water. This solution provides a \ncontinuous and non-destructive way of measuring\
    \ plant status. It uses sensors to measure the \nNorth America, 36%\nEurope, 36%\n\
    Asia, 8%\nAustralia, 16%\nSouth America, 4%\n \n35 \nturgor pressure of the plants’\
    \ leaves to determine if plants are deficient in water, and then \nmakes a decision\
    \ on whether to irrigate. The service provider of Yara Water Solution claims \n\
    that with this solution, the irrigation water consumption would drop by 20% while\
    \ yield \nincreases by 15%. Also, this solution will help save maintenance work\
    \ and corresponding \nenergy consumed (Yara, 2018). \nAtfarm (2018) monitors the\
    \ growth of fields with images taken remotely from satellite. \nIt makes it possible\
    \ for users to compare with images from previous years and to benchmark the \n\
    development of crops. Its performance of saving resources and boosting crop yield\
    \ is similar to \nYara (Atfarm, 2018). \nAccenture has been providing digital-based\
    \ farm services to farm owners for years. \nThese services are helping to improve\
    \ financial performance and to boost yield. Accenture \nDigital Agriculture Services\
    \ can help both large and small farms use digital technology to \nimprove processes,\
    \ increase yields and increase profitability to meet growing global food \ndemand\
    \ and to reduce the overall environmental impact of agriculture. Digital Agriculture\
    \ \nService can help increase overall profitability by $55 to $110 per acre (Accenture,\
    \ 2017). \nThe Field Manager created by Xarvio digital farming solutions supports\
    \ the users to \nknow better about the farmland they are working. The Manager\
    \ can provide real-time \ninformation of water and nutrition and can generate\
    \ a map for better visualization. Spray Timer \nis a product of the Field Manager\
    \ scheme. As is stated on the official website, Spray Timer can \nsave the amount\
    \ of pesticide application by up to 30% (Xarvio Digital FArming Solutions, \n\
    2020). \nDSS4Ag is an expert system for precision farming research. This system\
    \ uses advanced \nartificial intelligence and computer science technology to make\
    \ spatially variable fertilizer use \nand economically optimal decisions for specific\
    \ locations. Field testing was conducted in a \nwheat farmland, and the result\
    \ showed a 39.7% cost saving using the DSS4Ag as compared to \nthose blocks managed\
    \ by the farm’s traditional uniform applications practices, with only a 3.3% \n\
    decrease in yield (Hoskinson, Hess, & Fink, 1999). \nWhiteley implemented a precision\
    \ farming technology to monitor and control pesticide \napplication. The research\
    \ found that the estimated saving on pesticide can be as much as 80% \nof the\
    \ original application (Whiteley, 2002). \n \n36 \nA closed-loop, distributed\
    \ control and data acquisition system for site-specific irrigation \nmanagement\
    \ was introduced and developed by Wang & Li (2013). The system is formed by a\
    \ \ngroup of stationary field sensing nodes deployed in a field and a group of\
    \ nodes, called P2K \nnodes. These nodes collected the data from the field and\
    \ the central pivot system and \ntransmitted them to a master controller through\
    \ a power-line carrier communication. The \nsystem performance was compared with\
    \ a conventional uniform irrigation treatment in a potato \nfield. Results showed\
    \ that, with essentially equal water consumption, the tuber yield under site-\n\
    specific irrigation management was significantly greater, by about 4%, than the\
    \ yield from \nuniform irrigation (Wang & Li, 2013). \nBongiovanni and Lowenberg-DeBoer\
    \ (2004)summarized the research carried out by \nWeisz et al.(1996)regarding the\
    \ performance of ICT sensor networks in controlling the amount \nof pesticide\
    \ applied in a commercial potato farmland. With the site-specific pest management\
    \ \nprogram, the input amount of pesticide in this experimental area dropped by\
    \ up to 40%. \nBausch and Delgado (2003)built an application to figure out if\
    \ it is feasible to use \nground-based sensing and the N Reflectance Index to\
    \ improve in-season N management of corn \nin a commercial sprinkler-irrigated\
    \ field. The results indicated that the application could reduce \nthe consumption\
    \ of nitrogen fertilizer by 47%. \nIn much of the literature that discusses ICT\
    \ sensor networks in farms, the effects of \nusing this service have not been\
    \ clearly described. To describe the performance of this type of \nfarm and the\
    \ benefits of wireless sensor networks, two indicators should be provided - the\
    \ \npercentage of agricultural resources that can be saved (e.g. water, fertilizer,\
    \ or pesticide), and \nthe effect on crop yield. Some of the articles reviewed\
    \ reported both indicators, while some of \nthem only provided one or neither\
    \ of these indicators.  \n4.2 Simulation \n \nIn this study, one of the aims was\
    \ to investigate the possible response to the equipment \nof ICT sensor networks\
    \ in farms for controlling the consumption of means of production in \nagriculture.\
    \ Before this predictive what-if analysis begins, the raw data collected from\
    \ \npublications and service providers have to be cleaned and formatted well according\
    \ to the \nmethodologies in the following paragraph.  \n \n37 \nThe collected\
    \ data are about the amount and percentage that usage of agricultural \nresources\
    \ including irrigation water, fertilizer and pesticide can be saved and reduced\
    \ by the \nwireless sensor networks solution in farm, and the amount and percentage\
    \ that crop yield can be \nimproved with the solutions. Apart from the numeric\
    \ data, location and crop type are recorded \nas well. These two attributes are\
    \ regarded as independent factors on sensor network \nperformance. \nThe first\
    \ step of data cleaning is to normalize all the raw data into the same value range,\
    \ \nand at the same time keeping the original relative deviation. In this case,\
    \ all the extents of \nchange in crop yield and resource usage are converted to\
    \ a value of percentage, which is the \n“final state” after ICT sensor networks\
    \ interfering with the crop production activities. These \nnormalized variables\
    \ include incremental changes in crop yield with ICT sensor networks, \npercentage\
    \ of saved resources, location, crop type, and information source. Table 1 is\
    \ an \nillustration of the details that will be analysed. \nTable 1. Illustration\

    \ Table 2, for some samples, one or more columns are missing. For this \nissue,\
    \ a R package called missForest is used for filling the missing values. This package\
    \ can \nhandle multivariate data consisting of continuous and categorical variables\
    \ simultaneously. This \nfeature matches the variable type of the dataset in this\
    \ study. Also, when applying this \nalgorithm, there is no need in setting tuning\
    \ parameters or making assumptions in data \ndistribution. The full potential\
    \ of missForest is deployed when the data include complex \ninteractions or non-linear\
    \ relations between variables of unequal scales and different types \n(Stekhoven\
    \ & Bühlmann, 2012).In other words, in contrast to the traditional way of using\
    \ \naverage or median values of missing data missForest uses a predictive algorithm\
    \ based on a \nrandom forest trained on the observed values to predict the missing\
    \ values. This will increase \nthe accuracy of estimated missing values. So far,\
    \ all the data used from here has been filled \n \n39 \nwith missing values with\
    \ missForest, and all variables have been normalized to the same value \nrange.\
    \ \nFor the modeling process, as is proposed in the methodology chapter, the first\
    \ step of \nmodeling was to preclude the statistical influence of locations on\
    \ the performance of ICT \nsensor networks. For this analysis, the General Linear\
    \ Model (GLM) Univariate procedure, \nwhich is based on the General Linear Model\
    \ procedure, was used for testing the significance of \nthe correlation of crop\
    \ production increasing and where the farms equipped with ICT sensor \nnetworks\
    \ are located. To assess the impact of location, general linear regression was\
    \ run with \nthe fixed factors being set as location. If the test statistic is\
    \ outside of the confidence intervals, \nthen the factor has a significant effect\
    \ on the response variable. In this study, the statistical \nsignificance of the\
    \ correlation between location and ICT sensor networks performance can be \nassessed\
    \ by this test. The statistical software used for this step was SPSS. In the GLM\
    \ \nregression setting in SPSS, the increased percentage of yield was set as the\
    \ dependent variable, \nand the percentage of water/fertilizer/pesticide saved\
    \ by ICT sensor network-based farms were \nset as covariates. This means that\
    \ the change in crop yield is the result of combined changes in \nusage of agricultural\
    \ input, controlled by ICT sensor networks.  \n \nThe following central issue\
    \ is to fit a function based on collected data. In this step, \nrandom forest\
    \ was used as the basis model for simulating how the farmland would respond with\
    \ \nICT sensor networks equipped on site. Random forest is a classifier consisting\
    \ of a collection of \ntree-structured classifiers {ℎ(\U0001D465, Θ\U0001D458\
    ),\U0001D458 = 1,… } where the {Θ\U0001D458} are independent identically \ndistributed\
    \ random vectors and each tree casts a unit vote for the most popular class at\
    \ input \U0001D465. \nWhen it comes to continuous numeric values instead of classification\
    \ questions, the random \nforest model works as well. Random forests for regression\
    \ are formed by growing trees \ndepending on a random vector Θ such that the tree\
    \ predictor ℎ(\U0001D465, Θ) takes on numerical values \nas opposed to class labels\
    \ (Breiman, 2001). This regressor fits classifying decision trees on \nvarious\
    \ sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy\
    \ and \ncontrol over-fitting (Pedregosa et al., 2011).  \nIn terms of implementation\
    \ of this simulation, a Python package called Scikit-learn was \nused. Scikit-learn\
    \ provides a functional implementation of the random forest regressor model, \n\
    RandomForestRegressor, which is written in Python. To optimize the accuracy of\
    \ modeling, \n \n40 \nparameters including, but not limited to, the number of\
    \ decision trees, maximum depth, \nminimum number of samples required to be at\
    \ a leaf node can be set to the model instance \n(scikit-learn, 2019). This implementation\
    \ has a class method score, which calculates the \ncoefficient of value (1 −\n\
    \U0001D462\n\U0001D463), where \U0001D462 is the residual sum of squares of the\
    \ difference between \nreal value and predicted value, and \U0001D463 is the total\
    \ sum of squares of the difference (Pedregosa et \nal., 2011). \nThis model can\
    \ be simplified to the form of \U0001D466 = \U0001D453(\U0001D4651,\U0001D465\
    2,\U0001D4653), where \U0001D466 stands for the \nincreased percentage of crop\
    \ yield, compared with the years during which ICT sensor networks \nare not used;\
    \ and \U0001D4651,\U0001D4652,\U0001D4653 represent the percentage of saving on\
    \ water, fertilizer and pesticide \nrespectively. The selected random forest Python\
    \ package provides several optional parameters, \nsuch as the number of trees\
    \ in the forest, criteria to measure the quality of splitting a tree, and \nminimum\
    \ number of samples required to be at a leaf node. I selected several parameters\
    \ that \nhave a significant impact on the random forest to fit the equation mentioned\
    \ above, and then \nfind a group of parameters that scored the highest among all\
    \ the parameter sets in an iterative \nway. After 500 experiments, it was found\
    \ that for the dataset in this study, the following \nparameter combinations had\
    \ the highest scores, with a score of 0.9946 (out of 1). This score \nindicates\
    \ that the current model fits the nature and distribution feature of dataset well.\
    \ \n{'bootstrap': True, 'criterion': 'mse', 'max_depth': None, 'max_features':\
    \ 'auto', \n'max_leaf_nodes': None, 'min_impurity_decrease': 0.0, 'min_impurity_split':\
    \ \nNone, 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'min_samples_split': 2, \n'min_weight_fraction_leaf':\
    \ 0.0, 'n_estimators': 1, 'n_jobs': 1, 'oob_score': \nFalse, 'random_state': 50,'verbose':\
    \ 0, 'warm_start': False} \n \nGiven a model that has been fitted, predictive\
    \ analysis on the potential increase in crop \nyield with ICT sensor network deployed\
    \ for controlling external environment can be conducted. \nWith this predictive\
    \ model, as long as the percentages of the three resources saved are input, we\
    \ \ncan get a percentage of how the crop output will change in a farm using ICT\
    \ sensor networks. \n4.3 Meta-analysis \n \nMeta-analysis is a research method\
    \ that summarizes, integrates, and interprets selected \nsets of scholarly works\
    \ in the various disciplines (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001).Glass (1976)defined \n \n\
    41 \nthis research method as statistical analysis on a collection of research\
    \ results from individual \nstudies. It is the application of specific design\
    \ and statistical methods to the overall and \nsystematic qualitative and quantitative\
    \ analysis of previous research results. It is retrospective \nand observational,\
    \ it is improvement on the traditional review (Xia, 2005). \n \nResearch findings\
    \ which are applicable for this method must meet the following criteria: \n(1)\
    \ they must deal with the same constructs and relationships, (2) they must be\
    \ configured in \nsimilar statistical forms. To be specific, the involved studies\
    \ must focus on the same correlation \nor causality relationship in the research\
    \ scope. In meta-analysis, effect sizes are used to \nrepresent the outcome of\
    \ each study. The effect size indicates the critical quantitative \ninformation\
    \ from each study. It should represent either the direction or the magnitude of\
    \ \nquantitative research findings, or both(Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). \n4.3.1 Analysis\
    \ steps \n \nThe statistic tool used for the meta-analysis is an R package called\
    \ metafor. The \nfunction rma() in this package allows for fitting fixed- and\
    \ random/mixed-effects models with \nor without moderators via the usual mechanics\
    \ of the general linear (mixed-effects) model \n(Viechtbauer, 2010). \nThere are\
    \ two major models to use for meta-analysis, the fixed-effects model and the \n\
    random-effects model. The difference between these two models is that a random-effects\
    \ model \nallows the true effect to vary among studies. For further scalability\
    \ (Brockwell & Gordon, \n2001), the random-effects model is chosen for this study.Then,\
    \ the individual effect size \nforeach sample (i.e. finding) is calculated, using\
    \ the calculating tools provided by \nWilson(2001).The most common format of calculating\
    \ effect size is \U0001D451 = (\U0001D44B\U0001D452 − \U0001D44B\U0001D450)/\U0001D446\
    , where \n\U0001D44B\U0001D452 is the average value of an experimental group,\
    \ \U0001D44B\U0001D450 is average value of the control or reference \ngroup, and\
    \ \U0001D446 is the common standard deviation of both groups(Peng & Zheng, 1999).The\
    \ value \nof the overall effect size is positively related to the influence, which\
    \ means that higher effect \nsize indicates greater influences (Yuan, Sun, You,\
    \ Liu, & Li, 2018). \nIn this study, standard deviation from the involved studies\
    \ is collected for further \nanalysis. For these publications that did not provide\
    \ the statistical information, emails for \nenquiry were sent to the authors.\
    \  \n \n \n42 \n5. Results and Discussion \n5.1 Research question evaluation \n\
    Research question 1: To what degree can ICT sensor networks boost crop yield by\
    \ monitoring \nand controlling the usage of water, fertilizer, and pesticide?\
    \ \nAccording to the result for the test of between-subjects effects proposed\
    \ in Section 3.2, \nthe significance value for location (continent) term is 0.181\
    \ (p = 0.181), which is higher than \n0.05. Table 3 is the result of statistical\
    \ analysis from SPSS. Therefore, the correlation between \nincreased crop yield\
    \ and continent was not statistically significant. From a statistical point of\
    \ \nview, the influence of area on performance can be temporarily excluded in\
    \ this study. \nTable 3. Result of Test of between-subjects effects from SPSS\

    \ of irrigation water, fertilizer and pesticide are 80%, 86%, \nand 75% respectively,\
    \ compared with the conditions that these ICT solutions were not utilized \non\
    \ site. \nGiven the random forest model built above, a percentage to which the\
    \ ICT sensor \nnetworks can assist farms increase yield can be estimated. In this\
    \ case, with the \U0001D45D\U0001D45F\U0001D452\U0001D451\U0001D456\U0001D450\U0001D461\
    () \nfunction provided by RandomForestRegressor class in Scikit-learn, prediction\
    \ based on the \nmodel that was fitted, with parameters as the above three percentage\
    \ value set (80, 86, 75) can \nbe conducted. Output value of this prediction turned\
    \ out to be 116.26746667. This result \n \n43 \nindicates that, if the ICT sensor\
    \ network can be deployed and used in a crop farmland, with an \naverage percentage\
    \ of saving water, fertilizer and pesticide resources, the corresponding \nestimated\
    \ increase in crop yield is approximately 16%. \nAccording to the results of simulation,\
    \ the deployment of such ICT sensor networks on \nfarms can indeed reduce the\
    \ amount of agricultural resources (such as water and fertilizers) \nwhile increasing\
    \ crop yields. Such a decrease in input and an increase or change in output just\
    \ \nimprove the productivity of the farm, which is in line with the idea of sustainable\
    \ development \nin agriculture. In addition to increasing production, the more\
    \ important significance of this \napplication is to reduce the impact of human\
    \ agricultural production on the natural environment \nby controlling the amount\
    \ of chemical substances used. This protects animals and plants from \ntoxic chemicals\
    \ on the one hand, and protects human safety on the other. \nResearch question\
    \ 2: If ICT sensor networks could be deployed throughout a selected \ncountry/area,\
    \ how could the annual yield of crops change? \n \nFor this research question,\
    \ Canada is taken as an example for estimating the potential in \nincreasing crop\
    \ yield with ICT sensor networks. Except for 2015, in the past five years, \n\
    Canada's annual principal crop yield has remained at around 88.6 million metric\
    \ tonnes \n(Statistics Canada, 2020).At the same time, according to previous research\
    \ results, the \nconsumption of irrigation, fertilization and spraying of pesticides\
    \ on those farms using ICT can \nbe reduced to 80%, 86% and 75% respectively,\
    \ with boost of annual crop yield by 16%.  \nIf the result of this estimation\
    \ is extended to the entire scope of Canada, taking into \naccount the average\
    \ crop yield of Canada over the past five years, it can be concluded that if \n\
    this ICT sensor network that detects and controls water, fertilizer, and pesticides\
    \ can spread \nacross the farms in Canada, the annual crop yield in Canada (shown\
    \ in Figure 6)(Statistics \nCanada, 2019)may rise from 88 million tonnes to 98\
    \ million tonnes. Considering that Canada \nhas been exporting more than half\
    \ of the crops to the overseas demand side (Agriculture and \nAgri-Food Canada,\
    \ 2019), this potential growth in crop production will help alleviate the \ndemand\
    \ around the world. \n \n44 \n \nFigure 6. Estimated production of principal field\
    \ crops of Canada (Statistics Canada, 2019) \nAccordingly, with ICT sensor network,\
    \ the amount of resources saved for agricultural \nproduction cannot be overlooked.\
    \ In Canada, the annual total irrigation volume for crops was \n2.05 million cubic\
    \ metres in 2016, rising to 2.95 million cubic metres in 2018, a 43% increase\
    \ \n(Statistics Canada, 2019).Fertilizer consumption per hectare of arable land\
    \ in Canada was \nreported at 87.63 kg in 2016. With 41,224,000 hectares of arable\
    \ land in Canada, the annual \nfertilizer consumption is estimated as 36 million\
    \ tonnes in 2016, which has increased from 29 \nmillion tonnes in 2010, a 25%\
    \ increase (Index Mundi, 2020; World Bank, 2020). Only \nconsidering irrigation\
    \ and fertilizer use, ICT sensor networks are expected to help Canada save \n\
    irrigation water by 0.59 million tonnes, and fertilizer by 5.76 million tonnes,\
    \ with increases in \ncrop yield of 14 million tonnes. \nAs can be seen from the\
    \ results above, since the consumption of water, fertilizer and \npesticide can\
    \ be controlled by ICT sensor networks, deploying this solution across the country\
    \ \nin Canada is likely to have a huge positive influence on the crop yield and\
    \ the environment. \n5.2 Conclusion and Limitation \nAccording to Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization of the United Nations, the growth in \nyield of rice in developing\
    \ countries has been declining or stagnating for years since 2009. In \n0\n10,000,000\n\
    20,000,000\n30,000,000\n40,000,000\n50,000,000\n60,000,000\n70,000,000\n80,000,000\n\
    90,000,000\n100,000,000\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\nEstimated production of\
    \ principal field crops of Canada \n(metric tonnes)\nBarley\nCanary seed\nCanola\n\
    Chick peas\nCorn for grain\nFlaxseed\nLentils\nMustard seed\nOats\nSoybeans\n\
    Sunflower seeds\nWheat\n \n45 \nsouth Asia, the annual yield of rice has dropped\
    \ by 10% due to the primary and secondary \ndamage to farmland due to effects\
    \ of climate change. There are many reasons for the low yield, \nsuch as diseases\
    \ and insect pests, soil erosion, and improper farming. In addition, limited \n\
    research investment and transfer of scientific and technological practices have\
    \ also put \nunderdeveloped regions into inefficient agricultural production,\
    \ and the lack of technology \nleaves their agricultural industry vulnerable (World\
    \ Bank, 2017). \nThis study aimed to address the gap in knowledge from the few\
    \ quantitative analyses of \nthe performance of ICT sensor networks that reported\
    \ simultaneous monitoring of water, \nfertilizer and pesticide (or some subset\
    \ of these). In this study, the necessity and feasibility of \nutilizing ICT sensor\
    \ networks in agriculture have been clarified. \nThe analysis shows that as a\
    \ whole, ICT sensor networks can indeed effectively \nimprove the use of agricultural\
    \ resources, such as water, fertilizers and pesticides, and can also \nincrease\
    \ crop output by 16%. If this technology can be widely used in developing countries\
    \ or \nregions that rely heavily on agriculture as a source of income and livelihood,\
    \ then farmers and \nthe agricultural sector there can satisfy more of them with\
    \ limited resources in a sustainable \nway.  \nMeanwhile, the cost of deploying,\
    \ setting up and maintaining a network is often a \nstumbling block to prevent\
    \ farmers from adopting ICT sensor networks. In fact, there are \nalready some\
    \ low-cost solutions, such as a basic version of the network designed by Polo\
    \ et al. \n(2015).  The total cost can be controlled within $1,000, operating\
    \ in a farm of around 100 ha. \nRegarding the limitation of this study, the first\
    \ is that the small amount of data has \nlimited the development of this study.\
    \ Although the research on the combination of ICT and \nagriculture is not a new\
    \ topic, most of the literature that can be found now does not include \nquantitative\
    \ statements regarding the performance of their equipment. Therefore, it is not\
    \ easy \nto find a lot of information about the performance of ICT sensor networks\
    \ in agriculture. \nAttempts have been made to reach out to the authors and researchers\
    \ for more detailed \ninformation regarding the research questions, but very few\
    \ replies were received. \nAnother limitation of this study is that the original\
    \ meta-analysis was not completed. \nJudging from the publications I've been exposed\
    \ to regarding the application of the ICT sensor \nnetwork in agriculture, no\
    \ researcher provided information about the experimental group and \n \n46 \n\
    the control group in their articles, and the standard deviation used to calculate\
    \ meta-analysis is \neven more rare. Similarly, I wrote some emails to these researchers,\
    \ but unfortunately there are \nfew responders and insufficient data to support\
    \ this analysis. In the end, the focus of this \nresearch was on the simulation\
    \ of farmland equipped with ICT sensor network equipment. \n \n47 \n5.3 Future\
    \ recommendations \nThis study can be a very small part of future studies looking\
    \ to provide optimal \nallocation of agricultural resources in crop production.\
    \ The perspective of this research is \nrelatively macro. It is based on the existing\
    \ research conclusions of previous people. In the \nfuture, more micro experiments\
    \ can be conducted. For example, ICT sensor networks can be set \nup in situ to\
    \ control irrigation and fertilizer application on farmland, and eventually figure\
    \ out \nthe best external conditions for planting. To be specific, a piece of\
    \ farmland can be divided into \na grid, and ICT sensor networks will be deployed\
    \ for monitoring and controlling the amount of \nagricultural input. By comparing\
    \ crop yields under different conditions, find out the most \nsuitable external\
    \ environmental parameters for certain farmland and crops. \nIn the long run,\
    \ after collecting and analyzing many years of data, ICT can be used to \nmatch\
    \ the right environment with cultivars, to increase understanding of the interactions\
    \ \nbetween genotypes and the environment, and to adapt planting strategies to\
    \ constantly changing \nclimate. \n \n \n48 \nAppendices \nAppendix A: Tables\

    \ 51 \n \n 1 \n1. Introduction \nAs is advocated by the United Nations, efficiency\
    \ of the life cycle of production process \nis an important consideration for\
    \ sustainable development. This study aims to quantitatively \nassess the degree\
    \ to which Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sensor \nnetworks\
    \ can help increase crop yield in farmland and cut down on the consumption of\
    \ \nresources. Additionally, in agriculture, excessive application of nutrients\
    \ can be regarded as \npollution. Therefore, pollution prevention is an additional\
    \ consideration in sustainable \nagricultural development. An ICT sensor network\
    \ is an effective tool to monitor external \nconditions and collect data for making\
    \ decision for agricultural inputs allocation (i.e., watering, \nfertilizer application,\
    \ and pesticide application) for optimal outcome (i.e., crop yield).  \nIn this\
    \ study, a model to simulate the performance of farms that are equipped with ICT\
    \ \nsensor networks for controlling usage of agricultural inputs, with the data\
    \ collected from \npublications and from the service providers that focus on utilizing\
    \ ICT sensor networks in \nagriculture. With the model, an estimated value of\
    \ possible outcomes (crop yield, resource \ninputs) was calculated. \nThis study\
    \ answered a question that how to use existing technologies to increase crop \n\
    yields, while reducing agricultural inputs and the associated negative ecological\
    \ impacts. The \nresults of this study have important implications for improving\
    \ the yield and productivity of \nfarming, and for the sustainable development\
    \ of agriculture. The effects of the climatic zones in \nwhich the farms are located\
    \ on performance of ICT sensor networks are also analyzed, and the \ninfluence\
    \ of location variation proved to be insignificant.  \n \n \n \n2 \n2. Background\
    \ \n2.1 Problem statement \nA growing population and the corresponding needs for\
    \ food throughout the world have \nprompted farm owners to expand the scale of\
    \ planting. As farm size expands, it is no longer \nfeasible to rely on collecting\
    \ data manually for making decisions on agricultural activities \n(Brase, 2006).\
    \ Breakthroughs in areas of information technology, lower manufacturing and \n\
    usage cost, smaller size, and longer life span have made sensors ubiquitous items\
    \ for the public \n(Nack, 2019), and there has been a trend that ICT sensors technologies\
    \ are being widely applied \nin agriculture, controlling the usage of water, fertilizer,\
    \ and pesticide. Meanwhile, in many \nstudies that discussed wireless sensor networks\
    \ in farms, the effects of using this service were \nnot clearly mentioned. To\
    \ describe the performance of ICT usage on farms, two types of \ninformation (indicators)\
    \ should be provided: the percentage of agricultural resources that can be \n\
    saved, and the increase in crop yield that are realized by using wireless sensor\
    \ networks. Some \nof the articles listed both indicators, while some of them\
    \ only provided one or neither of these \nindicators. \nMany previous studies\
    \ on sensor networks in agriculture have focused mainly on the \ndeployment and\
    \ configuration of wireless sensor networks, and the collection of environmental\
    \ \ndata. Work by Sakthipriya(2014) is a typical example. In the study by Sakthipriya(2014),a\
    \ crop \nmanagement system has two types of functions, sensing and decision making.\
    \ The sensor \nnetwork can collect environmental parameters including temperature,\
    \ soil moisture and soil pH \nvalue. Based on these environmental parameters sent\
    \ to the backbone, decisions on whether the \nwater sprinkler should be turned\
    \ on to provide sufficient water to the field can be made. \nHowever, there has\
    \ been little quantitative analysis on the potential of wireless sensor \nnetworks\
    \ to enhance crop yield or improve efficiency of resource use. Most of the studies\
    \ claim \nthat the wireless sensor networks solution they discussed will improve\
    \ or boost the crop \nproduction. iFarm designed by Jiber et al. (2011) is a typical\
    \ example. This system provided \nirrigation management (monitoring and controlling\
    \ water usage), pest and disease detection, \ncrop yield prediction, and resource\
    \ optimization. Few studies provided the percentage or \nincremental gain in crop\
    \ production and saving on agricultural inputs. For example, Xiong et \nal.(2008)collected\
    \ a variety of environmental and animal-related data (e.g. breed, days in milk,\
    \ \n \n3 \nmilk time, milk quality, reproduction status, location), but further\
    \ utilization of the data in \npredicting animal activities or future production\
    \ was not carried out. \n2.2 Research objectives \nThe overall purpose of my study\
    \ is to evaluate how the farmland and crop would \nrespond, when wireless sensor\
    \ networks are deployed to monitor and control how much water, \nfertilizer, and\
    \ pesticide are used. I decided to carry out research based on the performance\
    \ data \ncollected from existing farms using this type of service. The goal of\
    \ my research is to determine \nthe quantitative relationships between use of\
    \ wireless sensor networks and performance \nindicators (change in crop yield\
    \ and agricultural resource usage on farms). The analysis is based \non existing\
    \ farms that have already been equipped with wireless sensor networks and that\
    \ have \ncollected performance indicator data.  \nTherefore, my major research\
    \ questions are: \n(1) To what degree can ICT sensor networks boost crop yield\
    \ by monitoring and \ncontrolling the usage of water, fertilizer, and pesticide?\
    \ \n(2) If ICT sensor networks could be deployed throughout a selected country\
    \ or area, \nhow could the annual yield of crops change?  \n \n \n \n4 \n3. Literature\
    \ review \nIn this literature review, concepts of sustainable development, an\
    \ introduction to ICT \nsensor network, and applications of ICT sensor networks\
    \ are discussed.  \n3.1 Sustainable Development and ICT sensor networks \n3.1.1\
    \ Overview of sustainable development \nThe United Nations in 1987 articulated\
    \ a need “to make development sustainable to \nensure that it meets the needs\
    \ of the present without compromising the ability of future \ngenerations to meet\
    \ their own needs” (World Commission on Environment and Development, \n1987).\
    \ This concept drew the attention of the public toward finding ways to avoid sacrificing\
    \ \nthe natural environment for economic growth. Over time, given the changing\
    \ needs of people \nwith respect to the environment, society and economy, the\
    \ practices and definition of \nsustainable development need to be up-to-date.\
    \  \nThe US Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency\
    \ defined \nsustainable agricultural development as “Agricultural sustainable\
    \ development refers to the \napplication of local intrinsic technology to achieve\
    \ the following objectives for a long time and \nstrive to form a comprehensive\
    \ production system for plant and livestock production.” (Hebei \nAcademy of Social\
    \ Sciences, 2017). These objectives include (1) to meet the needs of people's\
    \ \nfood and clothing; (2) to improve the quality of the environment and natural\
    \ resources on which \nagricultural production depends; and (3) to make the most\
    \ efficient use of non-renewable \nresources and materials available on farms,\
    \ and at the same time, comprehensive regulation of \nnatural resources management\
    \ methods is carried out if necessary; (4) maintaining the \neconomic vitality\
    \ of agricultural production entities; and (5) improving the overall quality of\
    \ \nlife of farmers and the whole society (Hebei Academy of Social Sciences, 2017).\
    \ \nA report from the United Nations claims that if the global population increases\
    \ to 9.6 \nbillion in the next 30 years, the equivalent of three planets would\
    \ be required to meet the \ndemands of humans given current lifestyles (United\
    \ Nations, 2016). Facing the challenge of \nfulfilling growing demands with limited\
    \ resource, it is essential to increase the efficiency of \nusing resources, so\
    \ the United Nations proposed a concept of Sustainable Consumption and \nProduction.\
    \ Based on the principle of higher efficiency with smaller input and more output,\
    \ this \n \n5 \nconcept improves the quality of life while reducing resource consumption\
    \ and environmental \ndegradation and pollution levels throughout the consumption\
    \ and production cycle, thereby \nenhancing the welfare benefits of economic activities\
    \ (United Nations Environment Programme, \n2010).  \nIn 2015, the General Assembly\
    \ adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals for the \nfollowing 15-year lifespan,\
    \ aiming to achieve sustainable development inclusively for everyone. \nAmong\
    \ the 17 goals, Sustainable Development Goal 12 (also known as SDG 12) is most\
    \ related \nto this study. SDG 12 was to build a more sustainable and production-efficient\
    \ world. Its major \ntargets include (1) promoting resource and energy efficiency,\
    \ and (2) promoting sustainable \ninfrastructures (United Nations, 2015). The\
    \ SDGs were intended to promote a new worldview \nand provide the beginnings of\
    \ a plan to end poverty without imposing significant costs on \nEarth’s life-support\
    \ systems. The goals may help create a fresh global narrative around a \ncommon\
    \ future to mobilise collective action and help develop a shared understanding\
    \ of \ninterconnected risks and solutions(Gaffney, 2014).  \n3.1.2 Agricultural\
    \ waste issues \nHigher production and smaller input are required for sustainable\
    \ development. To meet \nthe demand for food by a growing global population, an\
    \ expansion in agricultural production is \nneeded. As farm sizes expand, it is\
    \ no longer viable to rely on collecting data manually for \nmaking decisions\
    \ on agricultural activities (Brase, 2006). At the same time, various sensors\
    \ \nwhich have lower manufacturing and utilization costs, smaller size, and longer\
    \ life spans, have \nbecome ubiquitous items for the public (Nack, 2019).  \n\
    Another aspect of accomplishing United Nation’s SDG 12 is to reduce the solid\
    \ waste \nthat is generated from production processes, which could cut down on\
    \ the amount of raw \nmaterials that manufacturers have to obtain from nature\
    \ or artificially create (Bishop, \n2004).Relevant to this research is agriculture\
    \ waste, produced by agricultural activities. \nAgricultural waste is comprised\
    \ of animal waste (manure, animal carcasses), food processing \nwaste (only 20%\
    \ of maize is canned and 80% is waste), crop waste (corn stalks, sugarcane \n\
    bagasse, drops and culls from fruits and vegetables, pruning) and hazardous and\
    \ toxic \nagricultural waste (pesticides, insecticides and herbicides, etc.) (Ramírez-García\
    \ et al., 2019; \nObi et al., 2016). \n \n6 \nMost chemicals of agricultural waste\
    \ are water-soluble and can leach and enter water \nbodies and food, leading to\
    \ severe ecologic and human health impacts.  This can cause serious \nhealth disorders\
    \ in humans, including cancer, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, birth\
    \ \ndefects, and reproductive disorders. Pesticides can also kill non-target plants,\
    \ birds, and other \nwildlife, and have a significant negative impact on soil\
    \ quality and fertility (Ramírez-García, \nGohil, & Singh, 2019). \nFertilizer\
    \ contains massive amount of nutritive minerals including nitrogen, phosphorus,\
    \ \nand potassium which provides support for plants to grow faster and increase\
    \ yields. However, if \nthe application of fertilizer surpasses the crop/soil\
    \ system’s capacity to absorb the nutrients, the \nexcessive minerals will leak\
    \ into surface runoff, and eventually enter waterbodies such as lakes, \nrivers,\
    \ creeks, etc. (Karunanithi et al., 2016). When the excessive NPK minerals enter\
    \ the \nwaterbody, eutrophication occurs, with mass production of photosynthetic\
    \ microorganisms. \nWhen these photosynthetic microorganisms die, bacteria activity\
    \ decomposing this biomass can \ndeplete dissolved oxygen, causing other organisms\
    \ such as fish to die of hypoxia (Wetzel, \n2001). \nUnited States Environmental\
    \ Protection Agency recommended the following ways to \nmitigate the pollution\
    \ by excessive agricultural inputs: (1) applying nutrients in the right \namount,\
    \ at the right time of year, with the right method and with the right placement;\
    \ (2) \nEnsuring year-round ground cover to avoid soil erosion and nutrients loss\
    \ to the waterway; (3) \nPlanting field buffers. Planted buffers can help prevent\
    \ nutrient loss from fields by absorbing or \nfiltering out nutrients before they\
    \ reach a water body; (4) Installing fence along waterways to \nkeep animals off\
    \ the stream, river, etc. (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2019)\
    \ \n \nIn the context of this study, ICT sensor networks are deployed on farms\
    \ to collect \ninformation about the factors that would affect crop yield, such\
    \ as soil water content, fertilizer \nusage, and soil/atmospheric temperature\
    \ (Meeradevi & Mundada, 2015). Once information has \nbeen collected, it can be\
    \ processed in two different directions. The first is that information can \n\
    be sent directly to terminal clients and then converted into graphic deliverables\
    \ by visualization \nsoftware. With visualized content about the farm environment,\
    \ farm managers would know \nbetter about how the farm works, and what kind of\
    \ strategies they should take for better or more \n \n7 \nefficient crop production.\
    \ The second direction focuses on the idea of agricultural resource and \nwaste\
    \ control. The sensor network keeps contributing to making decision on the ground\
    \ \nregarding the proper amount of water, fertilizer and pesticide to be applied\
    \ on site. \n3.2 What is ICT sensor network? \nInformation and Communication Technology\
    \ is a varied cluster of digital tools and \nresources used to communicate, generate,\
    \ disseminate, store and perform information \nmanagement (Rahman et al., 2016).\
    \  \n3.2.1 Internet of Things \nIn this study, the main infrastructure used for\
    \ improving production is the sensor \nnetwork. The ICT sensor network is a subset\
    \ of the Internet of Things (IoT), referring to the \ninterconnection of smart\
    \ devices, ranging from appliances to tiny sensors (Stallings & Brown, \n2018).\
    \ An advantageous feature of the Internet of Things is that short-range mobile\
    \ transceivers \nare embedded in various gadgets and daily necessities, thereby\
    \ enabling new forms of \ncommunication between people and things, and between\
    \ things. The cloud systems today \nsupport the interconnection of billions of\
    \ industrial and personal objects. These objects can pass \ninformation collected\
    \ from distributed sensor nodes. Utilizing this low-latency information can \n\
    be used to effectively monitor the environment and make decisions for overall\
    \ management of \nlarge systems such as factories or cities. The farms involved\
    \ in this study are benefiting from \nthis technology. From the initial PC and\
    \ server to later professional operational technology and \npersonal electronic\
    \ communication equipment, sensor-based internet of things represents the \nlatest\
    \ products and trends of the Internet (Stallings & Brown, 2018). \nThe sensor\
    \ nodes are the most basic and underlying devices of an Internet of Things, \n\
    and at the same time they represent one of the core technologies of the wireless\
    \ sensor networks \nfor this study. A single sensor unit consists of five key\
    \ components, sensor, actuator, micro-\ncontroller, transceiver and radio-frequency\
    \ identification (Stallings & Brown, 2018), which will \nbe discussed in a following\
    \ subsection regarding sensor node structure. \nIn the context of a complete enterprise\
    \ network, an Internet of Things may have four \ndifferent layers. The bottom-up\
    \ order of these layers is the edge layer, the fog layer, the core \nlayer and\
    \ the cloud layer. The edge layer is mainly composed of sensors and switches,\
    \ which \n \n8 \ncan communicate information to each other when needed. At this\
    \ layer, there are a few \ngateways that connect sensors to communicate with higher-level\
    \ networks. After the data is \ncollected by the gateway, it is transmitted to\
    \ the fog layer. The amount of data this layer \nreceives from distributed sensor\
    \ networks on the ground is usually very large, so a significant \nfeature of\
    \ the fog layer is that it can be evaluated close to the edge layer. This can\
    \ effectively \nreduce the pressure on the entire network from transmitting a\
    \ large amount of data, whether it \nconsumes bandwidth or consumes other resources.\
    \ The main functions of the core layer above \nthe fog layer are to connect the\
    \ broadly distributed fog layer, and to open the interface to \nexternal servers.\
    \ The cloud layer on the top of the network, provides storage and processing \n\
    capabilities for large amounts of aggregated data sensor nodes from the edge (Stallings\
    \ & \nBrown, 2018). \n3.2.2 Network structure and architecture \nThe realm of\
    \ wireless networks can be divided into infrastructured and infrastructureless\
    \ \nnetworks. A typical infrastructured wireless network consists of a central\
    \ base station where all \nthe information transmitted from the ground is processed,\
    \ and nodes collect information at \nground level. A cellular wireless network\
    \ is the most common type of infrastructured network. \nDifferent from the infrastructured\
    \ network, an infrastructureless wireless network has \ndistributed, independent,\
    \ dynamic topology, low-power, task-oriented wireless nodes. With \nthese features,\
    \ a lot of decisions can be made at ground level, and as a result, some unnecessary\
    \ \ninformation for high-level decision-making will be removed from the information\
    \ package \nwhich will be sent to a central base station (Jangra, 2010). The wireless\
    \ sensor networks to be \ndiscussed in this study is a typical instance of an\
    \ infrastructureless network.  \n \nStallings and Brown (2018) summarized a sensor\
    \ network as a cluster of sensors \ntransmitting their data to one intermediate\
    \ entity that aggregates the data to be collected by a \nhigher-level entity.\
    \ There are five steps that a sensor network should take when a sensor node \n\
    has fetched data from an external environment: \n(1) Evaluation: evaluating data\
    \ for criteria as to whether it should be processed at a \nhigher level. \n(2)\
    \ Formatting: reformatting data for consistent higher-level processing. \n \n\
    9 \n(3) Expanding/decoding: handling cryptic data with additional context (such\
    \ as the \norigin). \n(4) Distillation/reduction: reducing and/or summarizing\
    \ data to minimize the impact \nof data and traffic on the network and higher-level\
    \ processing systems. \n(5) Assessment: determining whether data represent a threshold\
    \ or alert; this could \ninclude redirecting data to additional destinations.\
    \ \nAn advantage of the four-layered architecture of the Internet of Things networks,\
    \ is that \nthe size of data packets to be transmitted gradually shrinks as data\
    \ moves from ground level to \nthe higher levels (Stallings & Brown, 2018). \n\
    Another distinguishing characteristic of a sensor network is fog computing, which\
    \ is an \nopposite technical trend to cloud computing. Cloud computing refers\
    \ to the network that makes \nmassive and centralized storage, and processing\
    \ resources available to distributed users or \nclients. In fog computing, many\
    \ smart devices (e.g. sensors) are interconnected by fog network \nfacilities\
    \ that provide data processing function which is close to the sensors rather than\
    \ the \nhigher-level devices (Stallings et al., 2012). In terms of the efficiency,\
    \ the fog network between \nthe smart devices layer and the core network layer\
    \ enables lots of vital decisions to be made by \nthe smart devices on the edge.\
    \ That is to say, the time it takes for sensed data at ground/edge to \ntravel\
    \ to the higher-level cloud server can be saved by processing in the fog network.\
    \ The \narchitecture of the IoT equipped with a fog network relieves the burden\
    \ of computing in the \ncentral part of the IoT system, which in turn allows more\
    \ smart devices to be engaged in the \nnetwork. Owing to the rapid detection or\
    \ rapid measurements of sensors on edge, the risk of \ndisaster from a cascading\
    \ system failure would be decreased, and therefore the potential costs to \nmaintain\
    \ and repair the system would be saved (Cisco, 2015). Sliva’s research on WSNs\
    \ \nincludes a five-layered protocol, including a physical layer, a data link\
    \ layer, a network layer, a \ntransport layer and an application layer (Sliva,\
    \ 2008).Appendix Figure A1 is a common \narchitecture of ICT sensor network (Telecommunication\
    \ Standardization Sector of International \nTelecommunication Union, 2014). The\
    \ multi-layer feature of a sensor network is clearly \nillustrated in Appendix\
    \ Figure A1.  \n \n10 \n3.2.3 Sensor node structure \nNodes are a fundamental\
    \ part of a viable wireless sensor network. There are four major \ncomponents\
    \ in a node which are a power unit (e.g. battery sets), sensing unit, processing\
    \ and \nstorage unit and transceiver unit (for communication), with the major\
    \ structure of a node \ndepicted according to Sliva (2008)(Appendix Figure A2),\
    \ and a more detailed explanation (El-\nKader & El-Basion, 2013) (Appendix Figure\
    \ A3). In a fog network, these nodes have an \nadditional component, the microcontroller,\
    \ which is the intelligence for making basic decisions \nat ground level of a\
    \ whole network. \nTo ensure a sufficiently long network life, energy efficiency\
    \ in all parts of the network \nis critical. Therefore, data processing tasks\
    \ are often spread across the network: that is, nodes \nneed to cooperate to transmit\
    \ data to receivers (Galar & Kumar, 2017). \nIn real-world application of wireless\
    \ sensor networks in agriculture, one of the main \nconcerns and barriers is that\
    \ the farm owners or operators would worry about the costs of \nrunning the network\
    \ in fields, which includes the initial expense of setting up and configuring\
    \ \nhardware, the costs of maintenance and replacement, and of electricity for\
    \ devices in the long \nrun (Sliva, 2008; El-Kader & El-Basion, 2013). In order\
    \ to minimize the costs of nodes, more \ncircuits should be integrated into each\
    \ chip. Regarding the energy, less memory and less \npowerful processing units\
    \ in ground devices can be used to reduce cost (Sliva, 2008). This \nstrategy\
    \ makes sense, but at the same time it would increase the burden of computing\
    \ in a \ncentral base station, and in turn slow down the speed of processing data\
    \ and making decisions. \n3.2.4 Wireless standard used in ICT sensor networks\
    \ \nAt present, there are many standards and protocols for the wireless transmission\
    \ of \nsignals in wireless sensor networks. Among them, the following protocols\
    \ are the most \nfrequently used(Sohraby , Minoli, & Znati, 2007):  \n• IEEE 802.15.1\
    \ (also known as Bluetooth);  \nBluetooth is a standard for short range, low power,\
    \ and low-cost wireless \ncommunication that uses radio technology. Its short-range\
    \ wireless capability allows \nperipheral devices to communicate over a single\
    \ air-interface, replacing the cables that \n \n11 \nuse connectors with a multitude\
    \ of shapes, sizes and numbers of pins (McDermott-Wells, \n2004). \n• IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n\
    \ series of wireless LANs;  \nIEEE 802.11 and 802.11x refers to a family of specifications\
    \ developed by the IEEE for \nwireless local area network (WLAN) technology. 802.11\
    \ specifies an over-the-air \ninterface between a wireless client and a base station\
    \ or between two wireless clients \n(IEEE Standard Association, 2020). \n• IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4 (ZigBee);  \nZigBee is a specification for a suite of high-level communication\
    \ protocols using low-\npower digital radios based on IEEE 802.15.4. The technology\
    \ defined by the ZigBee \nspecification is intended to be simpler and less expensive\
    \ than the other consumer \nwireless personal area networks, such as Bluetooth.\
    \ A distinguishing feature of ZigBee \nis low cost, which allows this technology\
    \ to be widely used in the area of wireless \ncontrolling (Radmand, Talevski,\
    \ Petersen, & Carlsen, 2010). \n• MAN-scope IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX);  \nWiMAX standard\
    \ is a family of 802.16, that provides, multiple physical layer (PHY) \nand Media\
    \ Access Control (MAC) options (Nuaymi, 2007). \n• Radio-frequency identification\
    \ (RFID) tagging. \nThere are two general categories of RFID tagging, active and\
    \ passive, depending on \ntheir source of electrical power. Active RFID tags contain\
    \ their own power source, \nusually an on-board battery. Passive tags obtain power\
    \ from the signal of an external \nreader. This technique has been used widely\
    \ in the areas of supply chain management, \nsecurity, and movement tracking (Weinstein,\
    \ 2005). \nThese transmission protocols and their corresponding properties, including\
    \ transmission \nrange and speed, have been summarized in previous literature\
    \ (Sohraby et al., 2007; Ojha et al., \n \n12 \n2015). When configuring transmission\
    \ protocols for WSNs, the person who makes the decision \nshould select the appropriate\
    \ one based on energy availability, nodes characteristics, and \nperformance requirement\
    \ of this network. Appendix Figure A4 and Appendix Table A1 show \nthe differences\
    \ in data transmission rate, transmission range, and energy consumption of these\
    \ \navailable transmission protocols.  \nThe technologies described above enable\
    \ many sensors to be deployed in crop fields in \na non-destructive way, which\
    \ in turn helps increase the resolution when mapping soil, plant, \nand livestock\
    \ properties.  \n3.2.5 Energy efficiency matters \nThe energy consumed by an ICT\
    \ sensor network mainly has two aspects, the direct \ncurrent brought by the battery\
    \ used by the node, and the alternating current consumed by the \ndata center\
    \ or core layer of the network when processing data. A technology used to facilitate\
    \ \nsustainable development should be in line with its own idea of sustainable\
    \ development. \nTherefore, energy efficiency in ICT sensor networks should be\
    \ considered. Improving energy \nefficiency in the ICT solutions requires both\
    \ policy and technology guidelines (Cremer et al., \n2010). In terms of technologic\
    \ guidelines, these solutions start with where the ICT industry \nconsumes energy.\
    \ For example, server clusters, data centers, and base stations that are now \n\
    commonly used consume electric power for daily operations on the one hand, and\
    \ cooling \nhardware on the other(Fagas, Gammaitoni, Gallagher, & Paul, 2017).\
    \ For energy consumed to \nmaintain daily operations, the base station should\
    \ first ensure that there are no in-situ servers \nthat are powered on but not\
    \ working at all. The second step is to transform the traditional data \ncenters\
    \ into next generation hyperscale data centers. This upgraded data center has\
    \ 25% higher \nenergy efficiency than the traditional one. From 2016 to 2020,\
    \ a hyperscale data center is \npredicted to shrink the overall energy consumption\
    \ by 50%, with these small and less-efficient \ndata centers shut down (Jones,\
    \ 2018). \nTackling cooling down or maintaining system temperature is another\
    \ technical \nimprovement direction. Monitoring real-time operation conditions\
    \ including temperature and \nhumidity makes it possible to make dynamic actions\
    \ on the right timing to run a cooling system. \n \n13 \nThis practice can avoid\
    \ excessive cooling when the workload in the data center is not heavy \n(Shuja\
    \ et al., 2012). \nOptimizing computing procedure and network architecture is\
    \ another guideline for \nhigher efficiency. For example, streamlining the computing\
    \ process, scaling dynamic voltage \nand frequency for high-performance tasks,\
    \ and balancing the data pipeline are all feasible \noptions for architecture\
    \ (Fagas et al., 2017; Satran, 2018). However, implementing these \nmeasures to\
    \ improve the energy efficiency of ICT sensor networks will inevitably encounter\
    \ \nobstacles. As is mentioned above, guidelines for improving energy efficiency\
    \ in ICT industry \nimpact initially the businesses from an economic perspective,\
    \ and it will inevitably add \nfinancial burden to both business owners and their\
    \ clients/consumers. For instance, adding \ntaxes or extra fees to the price of\
    \ a product is never an easy task, because the stakeholders \nmight be reluctant\
    \ to accept this increase in cost. \nIn terms of deploying advanced cooling systems\
    \ for higher energy, this practice has two \nmajor obstacles for implementation.\
    \ The first one is the price that data centers have to pay for \nthis upgrade,\
    \ because cost-controlling is the very basis of running business in a robust manner.\
    \ \nAnother barrier is that some smart temperature controlling systems that are\
    \ integrated into data \ncenters involve deep customization for better compatibility.\
    \ Therefore, it will take time and \nefforts to set up such a system for a data\
    \ center. \nThe third guideline mentioned above may have technical difficulty\
    \ in implementing, \nthat is the transformation and upgrading of legacy architecture\
    \ and computing algorithms is a \nmentally work-intensive job, and it requires\
    \ massive assistance from external sources. If so, \nfurther collaboration between\
    \ internal and outsourced workers will cost time and effort for this \nintegration.\
    \ \n \n3.3 Applications of the Internet of Things \n \nInternet of Things has\
    \ been applied in various industries, including but not limited to \ngrid, transportation,\
    \ logistic and healthcare (Wu, 2010). This study mainly discusses the \napplication\
    \ of IoT in healthcare and finance. \n \n14 \n3.3.1 The Internet of Things in\
    \ Healthcare \nThe Internet of Things solutions for healthcare includes the following\
    \ aspects, \nequipment for patients, equipment designed for doctors' work, and\
    \ networks for hospital \nmanagement. \nInternet of Things for patients. IoT solutions\
    \ for monitoring the health or medical \nconditions of individuals are able to\
    \ collect parameters from patients, using the body-sensor \nnodes that are equipped\
    \ in wearable devices. These solutions play an important role in \nimproving the\
    \ quality of life and survival opportunities of critically ill patients and chronically\
    \ \nill patients. Fortino et al. (2014)designed a body sensor networks called\
    \ BodyCloud, which can \ngather real-time data regarding body temperature, blood\
    \ pressure, and electrocardiography, and \nconduct further processing on raw data,\
    \ data storage and analysis. Fanucci et al (2012)created a \nsystem to monitor\
    \ the vital signs of chronic heart failure patients. In this system, signs including\
    \ \nelectrocardiogram, SpO2, blood pressure, and weight are collected by non-invasive\
    \ sensor \nnodes. These data will be transmitted from sensor nodes to a home sensor\
    \ gateway for checking \nwhether the status of a patient who is prone to suffering\
    \ from heart failure is abnormal, \ncompared with the pre-set safety value range.\
    \ Once the detected values are beyond the \nthreshold, alerts will be sent from\
    \ home gateway and calls for instant supports, which allows \nearlier home interventions\
    \ thus reducing the number of hospitalizations. \nThe Internet of Things also\
    \ has significant impacts on the elderly who are living alone \nand their families\
    \ by continuously tracking their health. When someone's daily activities are \n\
    disturbed or changed, the alert mechanism will send signals to family members\
    \ and medical \npersonnel. For example, falls are a serious problem for the elderly,\
    \ so it is imperative to apply \nfalls detection in the daily life of the elderly.\
    \ There have been plenty of IoT-based fall detection \nand alerting solutions.\
    \ In Gutiérrez-Madroñal et al.’s (2019)solution of fall detection, once their\
    \ \nmotion sensors observe that the change in the acceleration of human motion\
    \ conforms to the \nfall pattern, these sensor nodes will determine a fall event,\
    \ and then an alert will be sent for help. \nThe combination of home monitoring\
    \ devices, such as wearables and fog computing, \ncan allow doctors to more effectively\
    \ track the patient's health. After the sensors installed on \nthe patient are\
    \ processed locally, the data necessary for the doctor's diagnosis will be uploaded\
    \ \nto the cloud. Doctors can track the patient's compliance with the treatment\
    \ plan or any need for \n \n15 \nimmediate medical attention. The Internet of\
    \ Things has made healthcare professionals more \nalert and able to proactively\
    \ contact patients. The data collected from IoT devices can help \ndoctors determine\
    \ the best treatment process for patients and achieve the expected results \n\
    (Alam et al., 2018). \nInternet of Things for hospitals. The National Health Service\
    \ in England declared the \npractices of using IoT in healthcare is effective\
    \ in tracking medical supplies and automating \nbasic data collection and patient\
    \ monitoring, so that the experienced healthcare workers can be \nset free from\
    \ repetitive tasks to focus on patients’ safety and services(Best, 2018). Hospitals\
    \ can \nuse IoT technology to track the use of medical equipment and consumables.\
    \ In most hospitals, \nequipment such as electrocardiographs and analgesic pumps\
    \ needs to be shared by patients. IoT \ncan not only provide insights for hospital\
    \ staff to plan resource allocation by sending the real-\ntime location of the\
    \ device, but also can be used to monitor the maintenance status of the device\
    \ \nand issue alerts when appropriate. For some medical consumables that are being\
    \ consumed at \nfast speed, low-cost RFID tags allow them to be marked, so it\
    \ is easy to count usage and then \ncharge the patient's account. At the same\
    \ time, tracking the usage of these medical consumables \ncan also help hospitals\
    \ manage inventory. For example, when the consumption of certain items \nis too\
    \ high or the rate of use is too fast, an alarm will be issued to remind the hospital\
    \ to \nreplenish inventory or reduce excessive consumption (Laplante & Laplante,\
    \ 2016). \nFor hospitals and some other healthcare providers, the significance\
    \ of using IoT is that \nafter collecting a massive amount of data from ground\
    \ devices, meaningful trends and \nconclusions can be drawn through centralized\
    \ sorting and analysis. These analytics deliverables \ncan be suggestions of medical\
    \ assistance or overall visualization of the condition of a patient \ngroup. Figure\
    \ 1is an illustration of the workflow of IoT solutions in healthcare (Mora et\
    \ al., \n2017; Mora, Gil, Terol, Azorín, & Szymanski, 2017) \n \n16 \n \nFigure\
    \ 1. Schema of IoT workflow (Mora et al., 2017) \n3.3.2 The Internet of Things\
    \ in Finance \n \nThe applications of IoT have transformed the way that the financial\
    \ sector works. \nKhanboubi et al. (2019)summarized the following trend in which\
    \ IoT solutions are changing \nfinancial services, mobile banking, crowd-based\
    \ financing, virtual money, high frequency \ntrading firms, cyber criminality,\
    \ big data and IT analytics. The applications of IoT in finance \ncan be classified\
    \ into two categories, one is financial services for individual users and corporate\
    \ \nusers, and the other is the measures used by banks and other financial institutions\
    \ to optimize \nand upgrade their own workflow. The most common of the first type\
    \ of application is the \nbanking service provided to users that can be accessed\
    \ at any time through a personal terminal. \nThese services include using the\
    \ user’s biological information to perform security \nauthentication of the banking\
    \ business or to replace the physical signature during the business \nprocess;\
    \ using the built-in near-field communication technologies (NFC) module of mobile\
    \ \nphone or wearable device to complete contactless payment; collecting funding\
    \ from a large \nnumber of individual to support a project financially via an\
    \ online platform (Khanboubi et al., \n2019). \nThere are some other IoT applications\
    \ in finance designed for business security and risk \nmanagement. For example,\
    \ Industrial and Commercial Bank of China is using IoT solutions for \nits financing\
    \ business risk management practices. RFID tags are deployed on collateral to\
    \ detect \nthe movement of objects. Any abnormal movement can trigger the alarm\
    \ system, a realization \n \n17 \nof the automatic collection of alarm information\
    \ and early warning of risk monitoring (InfoQ, \n2019). \n3.4 Concerns regarding\
    \ sensor nodes and the network \nAs discussed above, ICT sensor networks can indeed\
    \ play an effective role in detecting \nfarmland environment and controlling the\
    \ application of yield technology, but use of this \ntechnology in agriculture\
    \ is confronted with the limitations and challenges including, but not \nlimited\
    \ to, lifetime, energy and reliability. \n3.4.1 Energy consumption and Battery\
    \ life \nThe power unit is an essential part of an ICT sensor node (Sliva, 2008).\
    \ Rechargeable \nbatteries are usually used for power supply in a sensor node,\
    \ which have limited capacity and \npose a challenge to long-term deployment.\
    \ These batteries provide stable electricity to the other \nmodule in a sensor\
    \ node, so that each part of the node can work properly. To enhance energy \n\
    efficiency within a sensor node, the circuits and algorithm of the processing\
    \ and calculating \nmodule of a node have to be further optimized (Jawad, Nordin,\
    \ Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, \n2017). In wireless sensor networks, the lifetime\
    \ of a node is generally determined by its power \nunit, usually the life of batteries\
    \ used in the sensor nodes. To utilize the maximum of the battery \nlife, power\
    \ consumption of the nodes should be strictly controlled, which means that the\
    \ \nprogram and algorithms inside the nodes should be optimized and improved (Sliva,\
    \ 2008). The \ngood news is that the problem of limited node lifespan can be addressed,\
    \ with the use of \nenergy-harvesting techniques. Numerous techniques have been\
    \ developed to allow sensor nodes \nto harvest different types of energy, such\
    \ as solar, wireless power transfer, mechanical vibration, \nkinetic, and wind\
    \ energy, from different environments. Ambient energy can be converted into \n\
    electrical energy, and the electric energy can be used to charge the battery of\
    \ a sensor node, or \nit can be stored for later use. In agricultural applications,\
    \ energy harvesting can be used to \nextend the life of sensor nodes (Jawad, Nordin,\
    \ Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017). \n3.4.2 Equilibrium among energy consumption,\
    \ transmission range and node performance \nIn the realm of wireless communication\
    \ protocols, ZigBee consumes much less power \nthan these traditional transmission\
    \ methods, including Wi-Fi and GPRS, but the latter has a \nwider transmission\
    \ range. Similar trade-offs occur from time to time. Zigbee and low-energy \n\
    \ \n18 \nBluetooth are designed for battery-powered devices. Low-energy Bluetooth\
    \ is superior to \nZigBee in terms of power consumption, but due to its short\
    \ communication distance of 10 \nmeters, the protocol is limited in agricultural\
    \ applications. The Long-Range Radio (LoRa) \nProtocol covers large communication\
    \ areas with low power consumption. Therefore, it can be \nappropriately deployed\
    \ in a wide agricultural field. However, for this protocol, limited \ncommunication\
    \ time per hour for each device and message capacity for communication, and its\
    \ \ndependency on gateway make this protocol no longer the best option for configuring\
    \ \nagricultural ICT sensor networks (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail,\
    \ 2017). \n3.4.3 Transmission loss \nWhen deployed for agricultural purposes,\
    \ WSN faces a more difficult environment than \nother uses, such as outdoor, orchards,\
    \ farms and other complex terrain. Signal transmission will \nbe disturbed by\
    \ obstacles. In agricultural applications, signals transmitted from sensor nodes\
    \ \nneed to reach the receiving node through a thick canopy. If a sufficient gap\
    \ cannot be ensured, \nthe signal will be absorbed, reflected, attenuated and\
    \ scattered during the propagation process \n(Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad,\
    \ & Ismail, 2017). \n3.4.4 Immediate and reliable \nThe starting point for the\
    \ establishment of WSN determines that one of its first tasks is \nto provide\
    \ farmers with low-latency environmental information. Most crops are easily affected\
    \ \nby the weather. If WSN fails to detect environmental changes in a timely manner,\
    \ or detects \ninformation but does not transmit it to relevant clients in a timely\
    \ manner, it may lead to serious \nagricultural disasters, such as large-scale\
    \ diseases and insect pests, floods, fires, etc. Regarding \nsome existing ICT\
    \ sensor networks deployed in farms, the way they work is still to wait until\
    \ \nsymptoms appear so that the disease can be detected. Such systems do not qualify\
    \ as early \nwarning systems in detecting disease and pests (Datir & Wagh, 2014).\
    \ \n3.4.5 Fault tolerance \nIn ICT sensor networks, it is normal for one of the\
    \ hundreds of thousands of nodes to \nfail. Common causes include power exhaustion,\
    \ communication failure, and sensor module \nfailure. At this time, the most important\
    \ thing is to design a set of topological structures with \nstrong fault tolerance,\
    \ to prevent the entire network from collapsing due to a failed node(Jawad, \n\
    \ \n19 \nNordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017). Apart from solving this problem\
    \ from the \nperspective of network topology, some further improvement on the\
    \ combination of nodes \narchitecture and the network can be done as well. Geeta\
    \ et al.(2013) suggested a possible way \nof improvement. A single sensor node\
    \ should have the capability to send early alert to its \nneighbour node when\
    \ its battery is low or when it gets external interference, offering the \nnetwork\
    \ with enough time to adjust a transmission route to avoid network collapse. Hang\
    \ et \nal.(2015)designed a three-tiered unmanned aerial vehicle sensor network\
    \ for capturing \ninformation from farmland. This architecture realizes the extension\
    \ of the life of sensor nodes \nby reducing the transmission tasks of sensor nodes\
    \ in WSN. It enhances the data collection \nefficiency and life of the entire\
    \ system by enhancing the function of relay nodes and power \nsupply, reducing\
    \ resource consumption caused by transmission node failures, and improving \n\
    the network communication quality provided by mobile nodes. \n3.4.6 Data management\
    \ \nAgricultural monitoring practices generate large amounts of data because multiple\
    \ \nWSNs in agricultural applications include multiple crop sensor growth analysis\
    \ and harvest \nestimates. This situation requires the base station to monitor\
    \ and change farmland through \nanalysis mode. Therefore, base stations must support\
    \ high levels of storage capacity (Jawad et \nal., 2017). \n3.5 Review of ICT\
    \ sensor networks in agriculture \nDigital farming is the practice of modern technologies\
    \ such as sensors, robotics, and \ndata analysis for shifting from tedious operations\
    \ to continuously automated processes \n(Shamshiri et al., 2018). The terms digital\
    \ farming and precision agriculture are often used to \ndescribe the same concept\
    \ in many current contexts, but they are not the same thing. The \nconcept of\
    \ precision agriculture (PA) has been proposed for ages. At the very beginning,\
    \ PA \nwas mainly focused on the matching of environmental factors such as insitu\
    \ climate, soil \nproperty, and crop species (Krishna, 2016). \nInnovation in\
    \ digital farming occurs where the crops interact with their external \nenvironment,\
    \ for example, the physical, biological, and chemical components (Es van & \n\
    Woodard, 2017). Therefore, inspiration for innovations could be derived from the\
    \ factors that \naffect crop productivity. Lazarcik (1963) developed a term output-input\
    \ ratio for measuring \n \n20 \nproductivity. This ratio is about the relationship\
    \ of agricultural output to all production inputs \nused to produce that output.\
    \ It measures average aggregate productivity of all inputs together \n(operating\
    \ expenses, depreciation, interest on capital and cost of labor). It indicates\
    \ that in order \nto increase the productivity in agriculture, measures aiming\
    \ for both higher output and smaller \ninput should be taken. \nThere have been\
    \ many achievements in using wireless sensor networks in farms to \nmonitor the\
    \ environmental factors that affect crop yield, including but not limited to soil\
    \ \nmoisture, temperature, pH value, soil microbes load. Kalaivani et al. (2011)surveyed\
    \ ZigBee-\nbased wireless sensor networks in agriculture, which covers the features\
    \ and some drawbacks \nof the application of ZigBee in agribusiness. This transmission\
    \ protocol has good capability of \ntransmitting data with few losses within its\
    \ complimentary range, with low power consumption, \nprice and deployment difficulty.\
    \ However, the transmission quality can be significantly \nimpaired as the distance\
    \ changes and vegetable canopy keeps growing. The reason is that there \nis a\
    \ significant gray zone which is a range of distance between transmitter and receiver\
    \ where \nthe transmission doesn't work, and if the route between transmitter\
    \ and receiver is physically \nblocked by plant canopy, the connection would be\
    \ disturbed and closed (Kalaivani , Allirani, & \nPriya, 2011). \nYadav et al.\
    \ (2012)described a method to use wireless sensor networks to ensure that \neveryone\
    \ has enough food in some developing areas. In this study, wireless sensor networks\
    \ \nwere used to monitor the life cycle of food from producing stage to sales\
    \ stage. This monitoring \nprocess includes establishing a database by mapping\
    \ agricultural production and food shortages, \nconstructing efficient ways of\
    \ communication during emergency, monitoring real-time \nagricultural conditions\
    \ and sending an alert if an indicator meets its threshold. \nOjha et al.(2015)reviewed\
    \ various applications of WSNs in an agricultural context. \nThey divided wireless\
    \ sensor networks into two types according to different scenarios, which \nare\
    \ Terrestrial WSNs and Underground WSNs. They also listed some potential applications\
    \ \nsuch as automated irrigation scheduling for saving water, maintaining an optimized\
    \ \nenvironment for higher plant growth, monitoring cattle activities and ground\
    \ water quality to \nensure the cattle are staying in an appropriate environment\
    \ and location, simulating greenhouse \ngas distribution, and agricultural production\
    \ processing monitoring. These applications indicate \n \n21 \nthe feasibility\
    \ of utilizing ICT sensor network technologies in farms to improve production\
    \ by \ncreating optimal environment for crops. \nZhao et al. (2010) designed a\
    \ greenhouse environment monitoring system using IoT \ntechnology. This system\
    \ can control the on-site environment in real time according to the needs \nof\
    \ plants for temperature and humidity. Also, it’s able to collect a large amount\
    \ of \nenvironmental data and send it to research institutions for further processing\
    \ and analysis. \nDholu and Ghodinde (2018)created a similar IoT-based system\
    \ which can sense necessary \nparameters from the environment and make the necessary\
    \ decisions to control an actuator for \nirrigation. \nThe application of the\
    \ Internet of Things in agriculture is not limited to reading \nenvironmental\
    \ parameters and then taking corresponding irrigation or fertilization measures.\
    \ \nThe information collected by smart devices in the Internet of Things can be\
    \ accurately analyzed \nto improve agricultural productivity. Elijah et al.(2018)classified\
    \ the analysis into the following \ncategories. \nPrediction. The huge quantity\
    \ of environmental data such as moisture and temperature \ncollected by sensor\
    \ nodes and other smart devices in an IoT network can be used to develop \npredictive\
    \ algorithms to notify when diseases, drought, flood or fire is about to happen.\
    \ \nInventory management. In terms of storing agriproducts, external moisture\
    \ and \ntemperature can influence the quality of products significantly. In this\
    \ scenario, sensor nodes \nare deployed in inventory to collect this information.\
    \ After the data analysis has been sent to the \ncloud and analysis has been conducted,\
    \ automatic command will be sent for adjusting the \ncondition of inventory. This\
    \ practice can reduce the negative influence of spoilage and pests on \nfood quality.\
    \ \nDecision making. Big data obtained from sensors provides learning opportunities\
    \ to \nimprove decision-making for changing environmental conditions. An ideal\
    \ outcome of this \nanalysis is automatic decision-making by IoT systems involving\
    \ few human interventions, \nwhich could set the workers free from repetitive\
    \ work. \nInsurance. Agricultural activities are vulnerable to natural disasters.\
    \ IoT devices \ndeployed in remote areas can notify farmers or insurance companies\
    \ when a hazard or disaster \n \n22 \nis detected, reminding them to settle claims.\
    \ When extreme weather or another condition is \ndetected, access to information\
    \ by an insurance company can allow the company to make \nautomatic direct payment\
    \ to policyholders, initiated by the IoT system (Elijah, Rahman, \nOrikumhi, Leow,\
    \ & Hindia, 2018). \nUtilizing ICT sensor networks for collecting data from farmland\
    \ assists the farmers to \nmatch cropping practices to climatic trends, to use\
    \ inputs and resources more sustainably and \nreduce environmental impact, and\
    \ to cope with productivity threats. Moreover, it can enable \npublic officials\
    \ to integrate the data across the country and to adjust policies to reflect the\
    \ data \ncollected, to predict food supplies, and to target social programs or\
    \ promote yield technologies \n(World Bank, 2017). \n3.6 How do crops interact\
    \ with the external environment? \n3.6.1 Environmental factors \nWater and temperature\
    \ \nUnfavorable water and thermal conditions could sharply reduce crop yields.\
    \ For \nexample, excessively high temperature proved to have negative effect on\
    \ the yield of maize \n(Carter et al., 2016) and at the same time low-temperature\
    \ stress may damage photosynthesis \n(Oquist, 1983).Excessive high or low temperature\
    \ would impede the activity of enzymes, and \naffect the efficiency of metabolism\
    \ of plants.  \nAgriculture is one of the major consumer industries in the world\
    \ (Cazadilla et al., 2010). \nTwo aspects related to water consumption should\
    \ be considered, the direct effects of water \ncontent on crop growth, and the\
    \ economic cost of using water. In agribusiness, the term water \nproductivity\
    \ (WP), defined as the amount of yield produced per unit volume of water (\U0001D458\
    \U0001D454/\U0001D45A3), \nis often used to assess the efficiency of water usage\
    \ (Patil et al., 2015). Therefore, higher yield \nwith smaller water input can\
    \ be regarded as success in improving the productivity of crops. \nRespiration\
    \ by soil microorganisms can increase with increasing irrigation under water stress,\
    \ \nbut excessive irrigation can suppress soil respiration under the condition\
    \ of flooding (Wang, \nZhao, & Ouyang, 2010). For the crops, changes in atmospheric\
    \ moisture can alter the way their \nstomata work, and in turn the process of\
    \ plant transpiration, energy balance and tissue \ntemperatures (Grantz, 1990).\
    \ In some cases, the combination of high temperature and high \n \n23 \nvapor\
    \ pressure deficits could result in crops wilting when the water that crops take\
    \ up from soil \ncannot make up for the evaporation loss into the air (Carter,\
    \ Melkonian, Riha, & Shaw, 2016).  \nSoil nutrients \nSoil nutrients can be divided\
    \ into three types according to the amount that plants need \nduring for growth:\
    \ primary nutrients, secondary nutrients and micro-nutrients (Moore & \nBradley,\
    \ 2018). Fertilizer can be considered as a supplement to the original deficiencies\
    \ in the \nsoil, and the amount of fertilizers added to the soil should be precisely\
    \ calculated and controlled. \nN, P, and K are the most limiting factors in crop\
    \ production (primary nutrients) (Warpe & \nPippal, 2016).However, excessive application\
    \ of N-P-K fertilizers would lead to degradation of \nboth soil and water quality,\
    \ and production of crops. For example, nitrate leaching from the \nirrigated\
    \ farmland may move to lakes and groundwater, and then result in eutrophication\
    \ in \nlakes and nitrogen pollution in groundwater (Ju et al., 2007; Savci, 2012).\
    \ This practice in \ncontrolling the volume and usage of fertilizer is coined\
    \ as fertilizer management, which takes \nenvironmental, agronomic and economic\
    \ effects into consideration (Matson, Naylor, & Ortiz-\nMonasterio, 1998). \n\
    Soil pH \nA major issue regarding soil pH in agribusiness is soil acidity, resulting\
    \ from diverse \ncauses. For example, the parent rock material may enter soil\
    \ or groundwater due to weathering \n(Xu, 2015). Another cause of acidification\
    \ emerging in recent decades is the excessive use of \nchemical fertilizers. Common\
    \ chemicals found in artificial fertilizers, including ammonium \nsulfate, ammonium\
    \ phosphate, potassium nitrate, and ammonium nitrate have proven to be able \n\
    to lead to increase in H+ concentration in farmland soil (Pierre, 1928). A direct\
    \ effect of higher \nconcentration of H+ on soil is that activities and metabolism\
    \ of the microbes in soil could be \naffected. Altered soil pH may create conditions\
    \ that are less optimal for microbes or plants. \nExtreme pH could even inactivate\
    \ them. Some researchers have demonstrated the correlation \nbetween the soil\
    \ enzyme activity and crop yield (Tautges, Sullivan, Reardon, & Burke, 2016).\
    \ \nThere is another indirect effect that H+ could have on the soil. Higher concentration\
    \ of H+ \ncould change the form in which aluminum (and other metals) exist in\
    \ soil, and can increase the \n \n24 \nsolubility of Al+3in soil pore water (Gazey\
    \ & Azam, 2018). Excessive aluminum can lead to \nthe death of aquatic organisms,\
    \ the wilting of terrestrial plants, the reduction of crop yields, and \nthe decline\
    \ of forests (Weng, Huang, Liu, & Sato, 2000). Research conducted by Abruña-\n\
    Rodríguezet al. (1982) showed that higher concentrations of H+ and Al+3, decreased\
    \ the yield \nof crops like yam and cassava relative to their maximum yield. \
    \ \nSoil microbes \n \nSoil microbes consist of the fungi and bacteria in soil.\
    \ Soil microbes maintain or alter \nthe microscopic soil physical and chemical\
    \ properties by their metabolic activities, including \nthe soil properties in\
    \ the plant rhizosphere, influencing the efficiency with which plants are able\
    \ \nto utilize the soil nutrients (Sessitsch & Mitter, 2015). There is increasing\
    \ evidence that \nbiotechnology using microbes or their metabolites can enhance\
    \ nutrient uptake and yield of \ncrops, control pests and reduce plant stress\
    \ responses (Trivedi, Schenk, Wallenstein, & Singh, \n2017). At the same time,\
    \ research conducted by Gu et al. (2009)showed that a combination N-\nP-K fertilizer\
    \ could increase soil microbial biomass, diversify bacterial communities, and\
    \ \nmaintain crop production.  \nSoil depth \nResearch conducted by Khakural et\
    \ al.(1996)shows that the fertility of deeper soil can \ncontribute much to crop\
    \ yield than the fertility of topsoil. Williams et al. (1999) found that \nunder\
    \ sub-optimal living conditions, the properties of topsoil are definitely important\
    \ for \npredicting crop yield, while the properties of subsoil are relatively\
    \ more important in limiting \ncrop yields under normal conditions (Williams,\
    \ Ahuja, Naney, Ross, & Barnes, 1987). \nFarmland slope \n \nFarmland in sloping\
    \ area tends to have a thinner layer of soil (Atherton, Morgan, \nShearer, Stombaugh,\
    \ & Ward, 1999). Steep slopes are more vulnerable to soil erosion, therefore \n\
    soil layer on the slope is usually thinner, and the soil water content and soil\
    \ fertility are also \nrelatively poor (Mohammadi, Jalali, Kooch, & Said-Pullicino,\
    \ 2016), although Yang et \nal.(1998)found that the slope of farmland can have\
    \ a positively significant relationship with \nyield of wheat. \n \n25 \n3.7 Cultural\
    \ factors \n \nCommon cultural practices in agriculture include irrigation patterns,\
    \ fertilizer \napplication, planting spacing and density, intensity of various\
    \ routine agricultural practices, and \nharvesting time. The mechanism by which\
    \ some of these practices is able to influence crop \nyield is by modifying the\
    \ availability of sunlight (Atherton, Morgan, Shearer, Stombaugh, & \nWard, 1999).\
    \ Pathiratna et al.(2004)conducted several experiments to study the effects of\
    \ \nfertilizer, spacing and shade on the growth and yield of Aerva lanata. Results\
    \ from these \nexperiments showed that crops treated with organic and inorganic\
    \ fertilizers could produce \nhigher dry matter yields. Crops established with\
    \ a closer spacing have lower yield and growth \nthan those with wider planting\
    \ spacing, if yield per area is not considered. Ashraf and Saeed \n(2006) compared\
    \ two different irrigation methods in an area with saline groundwater. The \n\
    result shows that root zone of the crops which are treated with alternative, reduced-frequency\
    \ \nfurrow irrigation has smaller accumulation of salt than that with regular\
    \ furrow irrigation \n(Ashraf & Saeed, 2006). The planting date of a crop is fundamental\
    \ information for the \nmodeling of planting activities. It can be calculated\
    \ based on historical weather information \n(Dobor et al., 2016). Research conducted\
    \ by Kucharik (2008) in the United States shows that \nthe planting date, especially\
    \ the timing of planting the seeds has a significant impact on yield of \nmaize.\
    \ \nApart from the factors above, Krebs (1984)mentioned that there are some major\
    \ ways \nthat crops yield can be improved, including (1) improved quality of crop\
    \ varieties, (2) improved \nresistance to diseases, (3) improved resistance to\
    \ insects, and (4) adaptation to climatic \ncondition. \nThese known factors provide\
    \ direction for researchers and farm operators to improve \ncrops yield and labor\
    \ productivity. Among these factors, soil properties that can be measured by \n\
    sensors include soil moisture, concentration of specific ions required for plant\
    \ growth, and soil \nelectrical conductivity. Lab test and insitu measurements\
    \ on these soil properties of their \ncorresponding sensors are well matched.\
    \ However, for a lot of soil nutrients and soil organic \nmatter, there are not\
    \ reliable sensors for measurement.  \n \n26 \n3.8 Integration of sensor networks\
    \ with other ICT products for boosting production in \nagriculture \nAgriculture\
    \ is an important sector for the continuous growth of developing countries, \n\
    especially large agricultural countries. More than 80% of those who live in remote\
    \ areas are \nengaged in agriculture. The World Bank provided a guideline to guarantee\
    \ the security of \nreliable and stable access to nutritious, affordable food,\
    \ with access resilient to climate change. \nAs the World Bank pointed out in\
    \ a report, increasing the output of the agriculture, forestry, \nanimal husbandry\
    \ and fishery industries requires: 1) utilizing insitu technologies to characterize\
    \ \nfield conditions, in order to provide the optimal resources for plant growth.\
    \ These farming \npractices, after optimization, would result in more sustainable\
    \ and profitable farming; 2) \neliminating yield losses through early warning\
    \ systems. This revolves around identifying the \ninfection, disease, and upcoming\
    \ bad weather. \nMost farmers have access to the means of production and yield\
    \ enhancing technologies \nthat can help them increase their crop yields, such\
    \ as fertilizers and pesticides. Meanwhile, \nsometimes they do not know how to\
    \ use these products in a proper way. Although these \nproducts are usually equipped\
    \ with instructions, different application scenarios always have \ndifferent applicable\
    \ standards, with no universal standard practice. In this case, ICT technology\
    \ \ncan fill the gap of farmers' knowledge. With the help of ICT farmers can use\
    \ the optimal \nsolution for consuming resources in agriculture(World Bank, 2017).\
    \ \nIn agricultural production, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are often used\
    \ in \nconjunction with ICT sensor networks. UAV is very suitable for spraying\
    \ pesticides and \nfertilizers due to its high speed and spraying efficiency (Costa\
    \ et al., 2012). However, as is \nmentioned in Faiçal et al.’s work(2014), the\
    \ working route of a UAV spraying pesticides or \nfertilizer is prone to being\
    \ disturbed by wind.The architecture and workflow of Costa’s \nUAV+sensor networks\
    \ monitoring system was similar to that of Faiçal et al.The UAV has to \ncommunicate\
    \ with sensor nodes on the ground periodically to make sure that it’s in the proper\
    \ \nlocation (Costa et al., 2012). \nZhang et al. (2015) designed a three-tiered\
    \ UAV farmland sensor network (TUFSN) for \ncapturing information. Figure 2is\
    \ an illustration of their network architecture. The data \ncollection layer on\
    \ the ground is where the distributed sensor network can monitor the external\
    \ \n \n27 \nenvironment and grab information. In this layer, a large number of\
    \ sensor nodes are deployed to \nstrengthen the monitoring of a target data collecting\
    \ area. Another feature of this layer is self-\norganization. Layered protocols\
    \ and distributed algorithms allow wireless sensor nodes to \nautonomously schedule\
    \ their work processes. When deployed to a specific area and activated, \nthe\
    \ corresponding network can be organized automatically. The relay transmission\
    \ layer \nconsists of a network established between the relay node and the UAV\
    \ mobile node. This layer \nhas the following characteristics: 1) simple structure:\
    \ direct communication between UAV and \nthe data collection layer; 2) more energy\
    \ available: the data collection layer is generally \npowered by solar energy\
    \ so that UAV can be powered by rechargeable batteries; 3) stable and \nreliable:\
    \ UAV communicates with the ground data collection layer in the air. The possibility\
    \ of \nbeing blocked by plants or houses in the middle is low, and the packet\
    \ loss rate will be reduced; \n4) Long communication distance: the communication\
    \ quality is good, and it can provide larger \npower antenna coverage. The mobile\
    \ convergence layer consists of a single or multiple UAVs \nand a network established\
    \ between data centres. UAV and data centres are directly connected \nby a cellular\
    \ data network. The mobile convergence layer network has a very long \ncommunication\
    \ distance, has error detection and packet loss retransmission functions, and\
    \ \nsupports real-time or delayed data transmission. Compared with the traditional\
    \ static WSN, in \nterms of economic efficiency, this architecture is more suitable\
    \ for scattered land, hills and \nmountains, and the ground wireless sensor network\
    \ has difficulty or is unable to form a \ncomplete network due to natural environment\
    \ constraints. They are divided into multiple \nindependent networks. The limitation\
    \ of this system is that flight missions are performed only \nwhen data are needed,\
    \ so the frequency of UAV flights determines the frequency of data \nupdates (Zhang\
    \ et al., 2015). \n \n28 \n \nFigure 2. Three-tiered UAV farmland sensor network\
    \ by Zhang et al. (2015) \nApart from the sensor networks studied in this article,\
    \ image-based techniques are \nanother major part of the ICT solutions applied\
    \ in agriculture. Remote sensing is a hit. In \ngeneral, remote sensing technology\
    \ refers to acquiring image information about an object in a \nnon-invasive way,\
    \ without actually coming into contact with it, from a physically high altitude\
    \ \nand a macro perspective (Horning, 2008). \nWhen applied to agriculture, the\
    \ major role of remote sensing technology is to collect \nraw data from farmland.\
    \ The methods of obtaining data and the form of data from mobile \nphones include\
    \ aerial images taken by airplane, helicopter, radio-controlled aircraft, and\
    \ \nunmanned aerial vehicles; satellite images captured by satellites in orbit;\
    \ surface GPS receivers \nand satellite linkage to obtain positioning information;\
    \ laser scanning, using a set of laser beams \nto measure accurate elevation,\
    \ i.e. the distance from an aircraft to features on the ground, \npruning the\
    \ disturbance of trees and buildings on the ground. This means that when measuring\
    \ \nthe elevation of sensing aircraft, ground elevation under tree canopy can\
    \ be measured (World \nBank, 2017).After data are collected by remote sensing\
    \ technology, the following analytic tools \nare used to provide a deeper understanding\
    \ of the farmland system being studied. With spatial \nmodeling, existing data\
    \ can be used to simulate the real-world farmland. Using data mining \ntechniques,\
    \ patterns of crops, such as their growth rate characteristics can be extracted\
    \ from the \ndata set. \n \n29 \nThe workflow of collecting and analysing image-based\
    \ data has been widely used in \nagriculture. Reinecke and Prinsloo(2017)designed\
    \ a system, using drones to capture aerial \nphotos of plant leaf. These data\
    \ were used to determine whether the crops were healthy. \nHonkavaara et al.(2013)used\
    \ drones to take aerial images at pre-set time intervals at the \nbeginning of\
    \ the crop growing season, during the season, and before harvest to check the\
    \ \ngrowth of the entire field and highlight growth stagnation caused by insufficient\
    \ irrigation or \nlow initial nitrogen content. Biossard et al. (2008)provided\
    \ a technique based on automatic \ninterpretation applied to images of rose leaves\
    \ scanned in situ. They propose a cognitive vision \nsystem that combines image\
    \ processing, learning, and knowledge-based technologies. The \nsystem is able\
    \ to detect and count white flies (Trialeurode Vaporariorum Westwood) at \nmaturity.\
    \ This technology provides early warning for pest management so that measures\
    \ can be \ntaken to reduce losses before the pests become severe.  \nApplication\
    \ of remote sensing technology is not limited to identifying bad weather, \nplant\
    \ disease and pests. On a smaller scale, this technology is widely used on individual\
    \ crops, \nsuch as for classification of vegetables, fruits, and livestock. Traditionally,\
    \ the classification \nwork is often finished by the human workers who are well\
    \ trained and experienced. However, \nthere are some disadvantages to relying\
    \ on the human workforce for classification. For example, \nthe classifying worker\
    \ may feel tired or lose concentration and then lower the accuracy of \nclassification.\
    \ Ideally, there should be a standard diagram for the workers to refer to when\
    \ \nclassifying, which will increase difficulty of work. Also, raters are prone\
    \ to various illusions \n(Barbedo, 2013). Therefore, image processing techniques\
    \ are needed for these tasks to relieve \nworkload.  \nGastelum-Barrios et al.(2011)reviewed\
    \ newly emergent non-invasive image processing \nmethods in determining the quality\
    \ of fruits during and after the harvesting period, and \nconcluded that it is\
    \ a high-efficiency and harmless solution to grade the fruits. Singh et al. \n\
    (2011)customized an automated classifier of four different bamboo species based\
    \ on shape \nfeatures of bamboo Culm sheath, using the central moment classifier.\
    \ Their classifier for \nbamboo shows considerable recognition accuracy, which\
    \ has great potential on saving labour of \nmanually recognizing bamboo species.\
    \ This outcome proved the possibility of putting this \ntechnology into commercial\
    \ use. Latha et al.(2014) implemented an image processing function \n \n30 \n\
    to detect weed areas. Once the function was equipped onto pesticide sprayers,\
    \ the automatic \nsprayers can target these blocks covered by weed. This not only\
    \ saves pesticides, but also \navoids generating agricultural waste, and additional\
    \ effects on the environment and other plants \ncaused by excessive use. \nPatil\
    \ (2011) designed a measuring method for leaf area based on image processing \n\
    techniques. A traditional graphic measuring method was used to verify the accuracy\
    \ of \nmeasuring leaf area using image processing. The new method proved to have\
    \ high precision \nand accuracy and take less processing time. This result provided\
    \ a theoretical basis for the \ndevelopment of an imagery leaf area meter that\
    \ meets the requirements of precision farming. \nXu et al. (2011)developed an\
    \ algorithm that can tell whether the plants are suffering \nfrom nutrient deficiency,\
    \ by recognizing the color and texture of the leaf. The accuracy of this \ndiagnostic\
    \ algorithm was above 82.5% and it was able to diagnose disease 6–10 days before\
    \ \nexperts could determine it. Arakeri et al. (2015)implemented a system which\
    \ provided early \nwarning to detect diseases on tomatoes. Tomatoes are very prone\
    \ to a disease called late blight, \nwhich happens when leaves get infected with\
    \ Phytophthora infestans fungus. Typical \nsymptoms of fungus infection include\
    \ irregularly shaped leaves and water-soaked lesions. This \nalert system was\
    \ able to recognize whether a leaf was ill or healthy, and whether the leaf had\
    \ \ncontracted the Phytophthora infestans fungus. The accuracy of analyzing the\
    \ late blight disease \nwas 84%. Chen et al. (2014)proposed an effective method\
    \ for judging the nutrient content of \ncrops. They extracted characteristic parameters\
    \ from years of images of healthy leaves and \nnutritionally deficient leaves.\
    \ They were able to determine from an image of a rice leaf whether \nthe plant\
    \ was deficient in N, P, and K based on the attributes of leaf sheath length,\
    \ leaf area / \nleaf length, leaf tip, leaf lightness, etc. The average identification\
    \ accuracy of this method for \nassessing N/P/K deficiencies was around 88%.In\
    \ 2019, Chen et al. optimized the algorithm of \nthis detection method, and the\
    \ average accuracy of recognition increased to 93.4%. \nApplication of image-based\
    \ technologies is not limited to crop assessment; it is \napplicable in animal\
    \ husbandry as well. Image processing systems have been widely used in \nmonitoring\
    \ livestock for many applications, including identification, tracking, behavior\
    \ analysis, \noccupancy rates, and activity calculations. Kashiha et al. (2014)designed\
    \ an image processing \nsystem for checking whether hens were staying inside the\
    \ chambers. This system could save \n \n31 \nmuch time on manually analysing videos\
    \ for monitoring hen chambers. Pradana et al. \n(2016)designed a method to accurately\
    \ estimate the weight of cattle, by visually measuring the \nbody length, chest\
    \ circumstance, height and width. Wongsriworaphon et al. (2012)conducted \nsimilar\
    \ research, but their focus was to recognize individual pigs based on their size\
    \ and weight. \nAppendix Table A2 from Gong (2010) compares the differences of\
    \ the node sensors \nfrom the perspective of price, reliability, performance and\
    \ power consumption. This table also \nlists some environmental parameters that\
    \ can be measured by available sensors, such as \ntemperature, carbon dioxide\
    \ concentration, and relative humidity. \n3.9 A case study illustrating use of\
    \ UAV and ICT sensor networks in sustainable agriculture \nThe system Faiçal et\
    \ al. (2014)designed for the linkage of unmanned aerial vehicles \n(UAV) and ICT\
    \ sensor networks for spraying pesticides is a typical application in agriculture,\
    \ \nand is described in detail in subsections below to illustrate the use. \n\
    3.9.1 Research background \n \nSpraying pesticides and fertilizers in farmland\
    \ is vital for crop yields. Aircrafts are \nbecoming more common and popular for\
    \ this task, mainly because of the speed and efficiency \nof aircraft spray operations.\
    \ However, certain factors may reduce yield and even cause damage. \nFor example,\
    \ the spraying process might miss some crop areas, repeat spraying in the same\
    \ \ncrop area, and apply pesticides to the outer edges of the farmland. This study\
    \ proposed an \narchitecture based on unmanned aerial vehicles that could be employed\
    \ to implement a control \nloop for agricultural applications with UAVs responsible\
    \ for spraying chemicals on crops. An \nalgorithm to adjust the UAV’s motion routes\
    \ when confronted with constantly changing wind \nwas also assessed in this work.\
    \ \n3.9.2 Methods and procedure \n \nIn this solution, an unmanned aerial vehicle\
    \ and several sensor nodes are deployed in \nthe farmland. The function of the\
    \ sensor mainly includes obtaining the current concentration of \nthe pesticide\
    \ chemical from the soil. Sensor nodes also communicate with the drone in the\
    \ air at \nany time to help the UAV verify its real-time position to avoid crossing\
    \ a boundary and \nspraying where it should not, or spraying an area repeatedly,\
    \ resulting in excessively high \n \n32 \nconcentrations of pesticides in a small\
    \ area causing damage to the crop. If the sensor detects \nexcess chemicals, the\
    \ drone in the air will be directed away from this area of excessive \nconcentration.\
    \ The role of the drone is relatively simple, it receives the concentration \n\
    information on the ground and judges whether it is necessary to spray. \nThe researchers\
    \ used the following steps to ensure that UAV sprayed pesticides where \nappropriate.\
    \ (1) The algorithm sends a message periodically to query sensor nodes scattered\
    \ \nthroughout the farmland. A sensor node located at a previous location of the\
    \ drone responds to \nthis message with information about the amount of pesticide.\
    \ (2) With this information, the \ndrone can calculate the difference in pesticide\
    \ concentration between each sensor node. (3) If \nthe difference is larger than\
    \ the predetermined threshold, the algorithm will re-plan the route, \notherwise\
    \ it will continue to advance in the predefined path and wait for the next round\
    \ of query. \nRegarding the robustness of this proposed algorithm for spraying\
    \ pesticides, the following \naspects were assessed. \nCalibration of UAV routes.\
    \ An unmanned aerial vehicle is influenced by wind when it is \nworking. A dataset\
    \ containing information about wind direction and intensity was used to \nreproduce\
    \ the constantly changing weather conditions, and check if the UAV was able to\
    \ \nhandle the changes. Also, considering the nature of the linkage of ICT sensor\
    \ network and \nUAV in this project, whether the number of message exchanges between\
    \ the two terminals \nwould improve performance was evaluated. \nMapping the pesticide\
    \ concentration. ICT sensor networks provide location information \nand information\
    \ on chemical concentrations to the UAV. However, in practice, crops may not \n\
    get the appropriate amount of pesticide. Possible reasons are the UAV may be flying\
    \ too fast, or \nthe pesticide spraying process may be disturbed by wind. Therefore,\
    \ given the information \nabout nodes location and their corresponding chemical\
    \ concentration, a complete map of \npesticide concentration distribution can\
    \ be drawn. A heat map is an illustration of pesticide \ndistribution, where green\
    \ represents higher concentrations, and red low concentrations (Figure \n3). For\
    \ the spraying system in this study, an ideal outcome is that each node of it\
    \ has the same \nor similar color. \n \n33 \n \nFigure 3. Map after the application\
    \ of the interpolation technique (Faiçal et al., 2014) \nPotential correlation\
    \ between UAV height and spray coverage. Researchers speculate \nthat drones need\
    \ to fly to a certain altitude when spraying to get the best spray effect. There\
    \ \nmay be a relationship between the spray angle / coverage and the height of\
    \ the drone, meaning \nthat the higher the UAV’s altitude, the larger the area\
    \ covered by the spray may be. \n3.9.3 Case study results \n \nFigure 4is a map\
    \ of pesticide concentrations after actual testing. Higher uniform the \ncolors\
    \ of this map represents higher stability and robustness of the algorithm, and\
    \ this feature \nlets the vehicle to be more resistant to wind disturbance. Most\
    \ areas of the farmland were \nsprayed with similar concentrations of pesticides,\
    \ leaving only several small clusters with \ninsufficient pesticide concentrations.\
    \ Researchers assessed the relationship between time \nrequired for communicating\
    \ with sensor nodes on the ground and height of the UAV, and the \ncorrelation\
    \ turned out to be insignificant. \n \nFigure 4. Map after the application of\
    \ the threshold value (Faiçal et al., 2014) \n3.9.4 Case study summary \nThis\
    \ project provided a practical example of the combination of ICT sensor networks\
    \ \nand some other ICT solutions, aiming to make agricultural activities to be\
    \ more precise. \nAccording to the result of assessing with simulation tools,\
    \ the algorithm designed for the \ncollaboration between UAV and ICT sensor networks\
    \ proved to work well. After further insitu \ntesting procedures, it would be\
    \ possible to utilize the system to improve sustainability in crop \nproduction\
    \ (Faiçal et al., 2014). \n \n \n34 \n4. Methodology \nThis study consists of\
    \ two parts designed to answer the research questions. The first part \nis to\
    \ simulate the performance (which is indicated by annual yield in this study)\
    \ of a farm where \nICT sensor networks are deployed. The second part is to conduct\
    \ a meta-analysis on the \noutcomes of existing studies and publications. \n4.1\
    \ Data sources \nData and information for this study were collected by two major\
    \ means, (1) published \nacademic papers that discussed the change in crop yield\
    \ of specific ICT sensor networks-based \nfarms; and (2) contacting the companies\
    \ who provide ICT sensor networks solutions for details \nof how the solutions\
    \ they provide work and performance data of their service. \n4.1.1 Samples overview\
    \ \n \nThis study examines how the annual crop yield would change, when ICT sensor\
    \ \nnetworks are deployed to control usage of water, fertilizer, and pesticide.\
    \ Therefore, the sample \nfarms in this study all use ICT sensor networks to control\
    \ one or more of these agricultural \nresource usages. Figure shows the distribution\
    \ of where the selected farms are located. The \ninvolved crop types in this study\
    \ include maize, grape, rice. \n \nFigure 5. Geographical distribution of the\
    \ farms involved \n \nYara Water Solution is a part of a Farm Management System\
    \ offered by Yara Inc.in \nNorway, which can enable the farmers to save irrigation\
    \ water. This solution provides a \ncontinuous and non-destructive way of measuring\
    \ plant status. It uses sensors to measure the \nNorth America, 36%\nEurope, 36%\n\
    Asia, 8%\nAustralia, 16%\nSouth America, 4%\n \n35 \nturgor pressure of the plants’\
    \ leaves to determine if plants are deficient in water, and then \nmakes a decision\
    \ on whether to irrigate. The service provider of Yara Water Solution claims \n\
    that with this solution, the irrigation water consumption would drop by 20% while\
    \ yield \nincreases by 15%. Also, this solution will help save maintenance work\
    \ and corresponding \nenergy consumed (Yara, 2018). \nAtfarm (2018) monitors the\
    \ growth of fields with images taken remotely from satellite. \nIt makes it possible\
    \ for users to compare with images from previous years and to benchmark the \n\
    development of crops. Its performance of saving resources and boosting crop yield\
    \ is similar to \nYara (Atfarm, 2018). \nAccenture has been providing digital-based\
    \ farm services to farm owners for years. \nThese services are helping to improve\
    \ financial performance and to boost yield. Accenture \nDigital Agriculture Services\
    \ can help both large and small farms use digital technology to \nimprove processes,\
    \ increase yields and increase profitability to meet growing global food \ndemand\
    \ and to reduce the overall environmental impact of agriculture. Digital Agriculture\
    \ \nService can help increase overall profitability by $55 to $110 per acre (Accenture,\
    \ 2017). \nThe Field Manager created by Xarvio digital farming solutions supports\
    \ the users to \nknow better about the farmland they are working. The Manager\
    \ can provide real-time \ninformation of water and nutrition and can generate\
    \ a map for better visualization. Spray Timer \nis a product of the Field Manager\
    \ scheme. As is stated on the official website, Spray Timer can \nsave the amount\
    \ of pesticide application by up to 30% (Xarvio Digital FArming Solutions, \n\
    2020). \nDSS4Ag is an expert system for precision farming research. This system\
    \ uses advanced \nartificial intelligence and computer science technology to make\
    \ spatially variable fertilizer use \nand economically optimal decisions for specific\
    \ locations. Field testing was conducted in a \nwheat farmland, and the result\
    \ showed a 39.7% cost saving using the DSS4Ag as compared to \nthose blocks managed\
    \ by the farm’s traditional uniform applications practices, with only a 3.3% \n\
    decrease in yield (Hoskinson, Hess, & Fink, 1999). \nWhiteley implemented a precision\
    \ farming technology to monitor and control pesticide \napplication. The research\
    \ found that the estimated saving on pesticide can be as much as 80% \nof the\
    \ original application (Whiteley, 2002). \n \n36 \nA closed-loop, distributed\
    \ control and data acquisition system for site-specific irrigation \nmanagement\
    \ was introduced and developed by Wang & Li (2013). The system is formed by a\
    \ \ngroup of stationary field sensing nodes deployed in a field and a group of\
    \ nodes, called P2K \nnodes. These nodes collected the data from the field and\
    \ the central pivot system and \ntransmitted them to a master controller through\
    \ a power-line carrier communication. The \nsystem performance was compared with\
    \ a conventional uniform irrigation treatment in a potato \nfield. Results showed\
    \ that, with essentially equal water consumption, the tuber yield under site-\n\
    specific irrigation management was significantly greater, by about 4%, than the\
    \ yield from \nuniform irrigation (Wang & Li, 2013). \nBongiovanni and Lowenberg-DeBoer\
    \ (2004)summarized the research carried out by \nWeisz et al.(1996)regarding the\
    \ performance of ICT sensor networks in controlling the amount \nof pesticide\
    \ applied in a commercial potato farmland. With the site-specific pest management\
    \ \nprogram, the input amount of pesticide in this experimental area dropped by\
    \ up to 40%. \nBausch and Delgado (2003)built an application to figure out if\
    \ it is feasible to use \nground-based sensing and the N Reflectance Index to\
    \ improve in-season N management of corn \nin a commercial sprinkler-irrigated\
    \ field. The results indicated that the application could reduce \nthe consumption\
    \ of nitrogen fertilizer by 47%. \nIn much of the literature that discusses ICT\
    \ sensor networks in farms, the effects of \nusing this service have not been\
    \ clearly described. To describe the performance of this type of \nfarm and the\
    \ benefits of wireless sensor networks, two indicators should be provided - the\
    \ \npercentage of agricultural resources that can be saved (e.g. water, fertilizer,\
    \ or pesticide), and \nthe effect on crop yield. Some of the articles reviewed\
    \ reported both indicators, while some of \nthem only provided one or neither\
    \ of these indicators.  \n4.2 Simulation \n \nIn this study, one of the aims was\
    \ to investigate the possible response to the equipment \nof ICT sensor networks\
    \ in farms for controlling the consumption of means of production in \nagriculture.\
    \ Before this predictive what-if analysis begins, the raw data collected from\
    \ \npublications and service providers have to be cleaned and formatted well according\
    \ to the \nmethodologies in the following paragraph.  \n \n37 \nThe collected\
    \ data are about the amount and percentage that usage of agricultural \nresources\
    \ including irrigation water, fertilizer and pesticide can be saved and reduced\
    \ by the \nwireless sensor networks solution in farm, and the amount and percentage\
    \ that crop yield can be \nimproved with the solutions. Apart from the numeric\
    \ data, location and crop type are recorded \nas well. These two attributes are\
    \ regarded as independent factors on sensor network \nperformance. \nThe first\
    \ step of data cleaning is to normalize all the raw data into the same value range,\
    \ \nand at the same time keeping the original relative deviation. In this case,\
    \ all the extents of \nchange in crop yield and resource usage are converted to\
    \ a value of percentage, which is the \n“final state” after ICT sensor networks\
    \ interfering with the crop production activities. These \nnormalized variables\
    \ include incremental changes in crop yield with ICT sensor networks, \npercentage\
    \ of saved resources, location, crop type, and information source. Table 1 is\
    \ an \nillustration of the details that will be analysed. \nTable 1. Illustration\

    \ Table 2, for some samples, one or more columns are missing. For this \nissue,\
    \ a R package called missForest is used for filling the missing values. This package\
    \ can \nhandle multivariate data consisting of continuous and categorical variables\
    \ simultaneously. This \nfeature matches the variable type of the dataset in this\
    \ study. Also, when applying this \nalgorithm, there is no need in setting tuning\
    \ parameters or making assumptions in data \ndistribution. The full potential\
    \ of missForest is deployed when the data include complex \ninteractions or non-linear\
    \ relations between variables of unequal scales and different types \n(Stekhoven\
    \ & Bühlmann, 2012).In other words, in contrast to the traditional way of using\
    \ \naverage or median values of missing data missForest uses a predictive algorithm\
    \ based on a \nrandom forest trained on the observed values to predict the missing\
    \ values. This will increase \nthe accuracy of estimated missing values. So far,\
    \ all the data used from here has been filled \n \n39 \nwith missing values with\
    \ missForest, and all variables have been normalized to the same value \nrange.\
    \ \nFor the modeling process, as is proposed in the methodology chapter, the first\
    \ step of \nmodeling was to preclude the statistical influence of locations on\
    \ the performance of ICT \nsensor networks. For this analysis, the General Linear\
    \ Model (GLM) Univariate procedure, \nwhich is based on the General Linear Model\
    \ procedure, was used for testing the significance of \nthe correlation of crop\
    \ production increasing and where the farms equipped with ICT sensor \nnetworks\
    \ are located. To assess the impact of location, general linear regression was\
    \ run with \nthe fixed factors being set as location. If the test statistic is\
    \ outside of the confidence intervals, \nthen the factor has a significant effect\
    \ on the response variable. In this study, the statistical \nsignificance of the\
    \ correlation between location and ICT sensor networks performance can be \nassessed\
    \ by this test. The statistical software used for this step was SPSS. In the GLM\
    \ \nregression setting in SPSS, the increased percentage of yield was set as the\
    \ dependent variable, \nand the percentage of water/fertilizer/pesticide saved\
    \ by ICT sensor network-based farms were \nset as covariates. This means that\
    \ the change in crop yield is the result of combined changes in \nusage of agricultural\
    \ input, controlled by ICT sensor networks.  \n \nThe following central issue\
    \ is to fit a function based on collected data. In this step, \nrandom forest\
    \ was used as the basis model for simulating how the farmland would respond with\
    \ \nICT sensor networks equipped on site. Random forest is a classifier consisting\
    \ of a collection of \ntree-structured classifiers {ℎ(\U0001D465, Θ\U0001D458\
    ),\U0001D458 = 1,… } where the {Θ\U0001D458} are independent identically \ndistributed\
    \ random vectors and each tree casts a unit vote for the most popular class at\
    \ input \U0001D465. \nWhen it comes to continuous numeric values instead of classification\
    \ questions, the random \nforest model works as well. Random forests for regression\
    \ are formed by growing trees \ndepending on a random vector Θ such that the tree\
    \ predictor ℎ(\U0001D465, Θ) takes on numerical values \nas opposed to class labels\
    \ (Breiman, 2001). This regressor fits classifying decision trees on \nvarious\
    \ sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy\
    \ and \ncontrol over-fitting (Pedregosa et al., 2011).  \nIn terms of implementation\
    \ of this simulation, a Python package called Scikit-learn was \nused. Scikit-learn\
    \ provides a functional implementation of the random forest regressor model, \n\
    RandomForestRegressor, which is written in Python. To optimize the accuracy of\
    \ modeling, \n \n40 \nparameters including, but not limited to, the number of\
    \ decision trees, maximum depth, \nminimum number of samples required to be at\
    \ a leaf node can be set to the model instance \n(scikit-learn, 2019). This implementation\
    \ has a class method score, which calculates the \ncoefficient of value (1 −\n\
    \U0001D462\n\U0001D463), where \U0001D462 is the residual sum of squares of the\
    \ difference between \nreal value and predicted value, and \U0001D463 is the total\
    \ sum of squares of the difference (Pedregosa et \nal., 2011). \nThis model can\
    \ be simplified to the form of \U0001D466 = \U0001D453(\U0001D4651,\U0001D465\
    2,\U0001D4653), where \U0001D466 stands for the \nincreased percentage of crop\
    \ yield, compared with the years during which ICT sensor networks \nare not used;\
    \ and \U0001D4651,\U0001D4652,\U0001D4653 represent the percentage of saving on\
    \ water, fertilizer and pesticide \nrespectively. The selected random forest Python\
    \ package provides several optional parameters, \nsuch as the number of trees\
    \ in the forest, criteria to measure the quality of splitting a tree, and \nminimum\
    \ number of samples required to be at a leaf node. I selected several parameters\
    \ that \nhave a significant impact on the random forest to fit the equation mentioned\
    \ above, and then \nfind a group of parameters that scored the highest among all\
    \ the parameter sets in an iterative \nway. After 500 experiments, it was found\
    \ that for the dataset in this study, the following \nparameter combinations had\
    \ the highest scores, with a score of 0.9946 (out of 1). This score \nindicates\
    \ that the current model fits the nature and distribution feature of dataset well.\
    \ \n{'bootstrap': True, 'criterion': 'mse', 'max_depth': None, 'max_features':\
    \ 'auto', \n'max_leaf_nodes': None, 'min_impurity_decrease': 0.0, 'min_impurity_split':\
    \ \nNone, 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'min_samples_split': 2, \n'min_weight_fraction_leaf':\
    \ 0.0, 'n_estimators': 1, 'n_jobs': 1, 'oob_score': \nFalse, 'random_state': 50,'verbose':\
    \ 0, 'warm_start': False} \n \nGiven a model that has been fitted, predictive\
    \ analysis on the potential increase in crop \nyield with ICT sensor network deployed\
    \ for controlling external environment can be conducted. \nWith this predictive\
    \ model, as long as the percentages of the three resources saved are input, we\
    \ \ncan get a percentage of how the crop output will change in a farm using ICT\
    \ sensor networks. \n4.3 Meta-analysis \n \nMeta-analysis is a research method\
    \ that summarizes, integrates, and interprets selected \nsets of scholarly works\
    \ in the various disciplines (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001).Glass (1976)defined \n \n\
    41 \nthis research method as statistical analysis on a collection of research\
    \ results from individual \nstudies. It is the application of specific design\
    \ and statistical methods to the overall and \nsystematic qualitative and quantitative\
    \ analysis of previous research results. It is retrospective \nand observational,\
    \ it is improvement on the traditional review (Xia, 2005). \n \nResearch findings\
    \ which are applicable for this method must meet the following criteria: \n(1)\
    \ they must deal with the same constructs and relationships, (2) they must be\
    \ configured in \nsimilar statistical forms. To be specific, the involved studies\
    \ must focus on the same correlation \nor causality relationship in the research\
    \ scope. In meta-analysis, effect sizes are used to \nrepresent the outcome of\
    \ each study. The effect size indicates the critical quantitative \ninformation\
    \ from each study. It should represent either the direction or the magnitude of\
    \ \nquantitative research findings, or both(Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). \n4.3.1 Analysis\
    \ steps \n \nThe statistic tool used for the meta-analysis is an R package called\
    \ metafor. The \nfunction rma() in this package allows for fitting fixed- and\
    \ random/mixed-effects models with \nor without moderators via the usual mechanics\
    \ of the general linear (mixed-effects) model \n(Viechtbauer, 2010). \nThere are\
    \ two major models to use for meta-analysis, the fixed-effects model and the \n\
    random-effects model. The difference between these two models is that a random-effects\
    \ model \nallows the true effect to vary among studies. For further scalability\
    \ (Brockwell & Gordon, \n2001), the random-effects model is chosen for this study.Then,\
    \ the individual effect size \nforeach sample (i.e. finding) is calculated, using\
    \ the calculating tools provided by \nWilson(2001).The most common format of calculating\
    \ effect size is \U0001D451 = (\U0001D44B\U0001D452 − \U0001D44B\U0001D450)/\U0001D446\
    , where \n\U0001D44B\U0001D452 is the average value of an experimental group,\
    \ \U0001D44B\U0001D450 is average value of the control or reference \ngroup, and\
    \ \U0001D446 is the common standard deviation of both groups(Peng & Zheng, 1999).The\
    \ value \nof the overall effect size is positively related to the influence, which\
    \ means that higher effect \nsize indicates greater influences (Yuan, Sun, You,\
    \ Liu, & Li, 2018). \nIn this study, standard deviation from the involved studies\
    \ is collected for further \nanalysis. For these publications that did not provide\
    \ the statistical information, emails for \nenquiry were sent to the authors.\
    \  \n \n \n42 \n5. Results and Discussion \n5.1 Research question evaluation \n\
    Research question 1: To what degree can ICT sensor networks boost crop yield by\
    \ monitoring \nand controlling the usage of water, fertilizer, and pesticide?\
    \ \nAccording to the result for the test of between-subjects effects proposed\
    \ in Section 3.2, \nthe significance value for location (continent) term is 0.181\
    \ (p = 0.181), which is higher than \n0.05. Table 3 is the result of statistical\
    \ analysis from SPSS. Therefore, the correlation between \nincreased crop yield\
    \ and continent was not statistically significant. From a statistical point of\
    \ \nview, the influence of area on performance can be temporarily excluded in\
    \ this study. \nTable 3. Result of Test of between-subjects effects from SPSS\

    \ with ICT sensor networks, their normalized \nchanges in percentage of consumption\
    \ of irrigation water, fertilizer and pesticide are 80%, 86%, \nand 75% respectively,\
    \ compared with the conditions that these ICT solutions were not utilized \non\
    \ site. \nGiven the random forest model built above, a percentage to which the\
    \ ICT sensor \nnetworks can assist farms increase yield can be estimated. In this\
    \ case, with the \U0001D45D\U0001D45F\U0001D452\U0001D451\U0001D456\U0001D450\U0001D461\
    () \nfunction provided by RandomForestRegressor class in Scikit-learn, prediction\
    \ based on the \nmodel that was fitted, with parameters as the above three percentage\
    \ value set (80, 86, 75) can \nbe conducted. Output value of this prediction turned\
    \ out to be 116.26746667. This result \n \n43 \nindicates that, if the ICT sensor\
    \ network can be deployed and used in a crop farmland, with an \naverage percentage\
    \ of saving water, fertilizer and pesticide resources, the corresponding \nestimated\
    \ increase in crop yield is approximately 16%. \nAccording to the results of simulation,\
    \ the deployment of such ICT sensor networks on \nfarms can indeed reduce the\
    \ amount of agricultural resources (such as water and fertilizers) \nwhile increasing\
    \ crop yields. Such a decrease in input and an increase or change in output just\
    \ \nimprove the productivity of the farm, which is in line with the idea of sustainable\
    \ development \nin agriculture. In addition to increasing production, the more\
    \ important significance of this \napplication is to reduce the impact of human\
    \ agricultural production on the natural environment \nby controlling the amount\
    \ of chemical substances used. This protects animals and plants from \ntoxic chemicals\
    \ on the one hand, and protects human safety on the other. \nResearch question\
    \ 2: If ICT sensor networks could be deployed throughout a selected \ncountry/area,\
    \ how could the annual yield of crops change? \n \nFor this research question,\
    \ Canada is taken as an example for estimating the potential in \nincreasing crop\
    \ yield with ICT sensor networks. Except for 2015, in the past five years, \n\
    Canada's annual principal crop yield has remained at around 88.6 million metric\
    \ tonnes \n(Statistics Canada, 2020).At the same time, according to previous research\
    \ results, the \nconsumption of irrigation, fertilization and spraying of pesticides\
    \ on those farms using ICT can \nbe reduced to 80%, 86% and 75% respectively,\
    \ with boost of annual crop yield by 16%.  \nIf the result of this estimation\
    \ is extended to the entire scope of Canada, taking into \naccount the average\
    \ crop yield of Canada over the past five years, it can be concluded that if \n\
    this ICT sensor network that detects and controls water, fertilizer, and pesticides\
    \ can spread \nacross the farms in Canada, the annual crop yield in Canada (shown\
    \ in Figure 6)(Statistics \nCanada, 2019)may rise from 88 million tonnes to 98\
    \ million tonnes. Considering that Canada \nhas been exporting more than half\
    \ of the crops to the overseas demand side (Agriculture and \nAgri-Food Canada,\
    \ 2019), this potential growth in crop production will help alleviate the \ndemand\
    \ around the world. \n \n44 \n \nFigure 6. Estimated production of principal field\
    \ crops of Canada (Statistics Canada, 2019) \nAccordingly, with ICT sensor network,\
    \ the amount of resources saved for agricultural \nproduction cannot be overlooked.\
    \ In Canada, the annual total irrigation volume for crops was \n2.05 million cubic\
    \ metres in 2016, rising to 2.95 million cubic metres in 2018, a 43% increase\
    \ \n(Statistics Canada, 2019).Fertilizer consumption per hectare of arable land\
    \ in Canada was \nreported at 87.63 kg in 2016. With 41,224,000 hectares of arable\
    \ land in Canada, the annual \nfertilizer consumption is estimated as 36 million\
    \ tonnes in 2016, which has increased from 29 \nmillion tonnes in 2010, a 25%\
    \ increase (Index Mundi, 2020; World Bank, 2020). Only \nconsidering irrigation\
    \ and fertilizer use, ICT sensor networks are expected to help Canada save \n\
    irrigation water by 0.59 million tonnes, and fertilizer by 5.76 million tonnes,\
    \ with increases in \ncrop yield of 14 million tonnes. \nAs can be seen from the\
    \ results above, since the consumption of water, fertilizer and \npesticide can\
    \ be controlled by ICT sensor networks, deploying this solution across the country\
    \ \nin Canada is likely to have a huge positive influence on the crop yield and\
    \ the environment. \n5.2 Conclusion and Limitation \nAccording to Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization of the United Nations, the growth in \nyield of rice in developing\
    \ countries has been declining or stagnating for years since 2009. In \n0\n10,000,000\n\
    20,000,000\n30,000,000\n40,000,000\n50,000,000\n60,000,000\n70,000,000\n80,000,000\n\
    90,000,000\n100,000,000\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\nEstimated production of\
    \ principal field crops of Canada \n(metric tonnes)\nBarley\nCanary seed\nCanola\n\
    Chick peas\nCorn for grain\nFlaxseed\nLentils\nMustard seed\nOats\nSoybeans\n\
    Sunflower seeds\nWheat\n \n45 \nsouth Asia, the annual yield of rice has dropped\
    \ by 10% due to the primary and secondary \ndamage to farmland due to effects\
    \ of climate change. There are many reasons for the low yield, \nsuch as diseases\
    \ and insect pests, soil erosion, and improper farming. In addition, limited \n\
    research investment and transfer of scientific and technological practices have\
    \ also put \nunderdeveloped regions into inefficient agricultural production,\
    \ and the lack of technology \nleaves their agricultural industry vulnerable (World\
    \ Bank, 2017). \nThis study aimed to address the gap in knowledge from the few\
    \ quantitative analyses of \nthe performance of ICT sensor networks that reported\
    \ simultaneous monitoring of water, \nfertilizer and pesticide (or some subset\
    \ of these). In this study, the necessity and feasibility of \nutilizing ICT sensor\
    \ networks in agriculture have been clarified. \nThe analysis shows that as a\
    \ whole, ICT sensor networks can indeed effectively \nimprove the use of agricultural\
    \ resources, such as water, fertilizers and pesticides, and can also \nincrease\
    \ crop output by 16%. If this technology can be widely used in developing countries\
    \ or \nregions that rely heavily on agriculture as a source of income and livelihood,\
    \ then farmers and \nthe agricultural sector there can satisfy more of them with\
    \ limited resources in a sustainable \nway.  \nMeanwhile, the cost of deploying,\
    \ setting up and maintaining a network is often a \nstumbling block to prevent\
    \ farmers from adopting ICT sensor networks. In fact, there are \nalready some\
    \ low-cost solutions, such as a basic version of the network designed by Polo\
    \ et al. \n(2015).  The total cost can be controlled within $1,000, operating\
    \ in a farm of around 100 ha. \nRegarding the limitation of this study, the first\
    \ is that the small amount of data has \nlimited the development of this study.\
    \ Although the research on the combination of ICT and \nagriculture is not a new\
    \ topic, most of the literature that can be found now does not include \nquantitative\
    \ statements regarding the performance of their equipment. Therefore, it is not\
    \ easy \nto find a lot of information about the performance of ICT sensor networks\
    \ in agriculture. \nAttempts have been made to reach out to the authors and researchers\
    \ for more detailed \ninformation regarding the research questions, but very few\
    \ replies were received. \nAnother limitation of this study is that the original\
    \ meta-analysis was not completed. \nJudging from the publications I've been exposed\
    \ to regarding the application of the ICT sensor \nnetwork in agriculture, no\
    \ researcher provided information about the experimental group and \n \n46 \n\
    the control group in their articles, and the standard deviation used to calculate\
    \ meta-analysis is \neven more rare. Similarly, I wrote some emails to these researchers,\
    \ but unfortunately there are \nfew responders and insufficient data to support\
    \ this analysis. In the end, the focus of this \nresearch was on the simulation\
    \ of farmland equipped with ICT sensor network equipment. \n \n47 \n5.3 Future\
    \ recommendations \nThis study can be a very small part of future studies looking\
    \ to provide optimal \nallocation of agricultural resources in crop production.\
    \ The perspective of this research is \nrelatively macro. It is based on the existing\
    \ research conclusions of previous people. In the \nfuture, more micro experiments\
    \ can be conducted. For example, ICT sensor networks can be set \nup in situ to\
    \ control irrigation and fertilizer application on farmland, and eventually figure\
    \ out \nthe best external conditions for planting. To be specific, a piece of\
    \ farmland can be divided into \na grid, and ICT sensor networks will be deployed\
    \ for monitoring and controlling the amount of \nagricultural input. By comparing\
    \ crop yields under different conditions, find out the most \nsuitable external\
    \ environmental parameters for certain farmland and crops. \nIn the long run,\
    \ after collecting and analyzing many years of data, ICT can be used to \nmatch\
    \ the right environment with cultivars, to increase understanding of the interactions\
    \ \nbetween genotypes and the environment, and to adapt planting strategies to\
    \ constantly changing \nclimate. \n \n \n48 \nAppendices \nAppendix A: Tables\

    \ AND APPLICATIONS\nMuhammad Zaigham Abbas Shah, Syed\nNovember 8, 2022\nInternet\
    \ of Things is a system that integrates different devices and technologies,\n\
    removing the necessity of human intervention. This enables the capacity of having\n\
    smart (or smarter) cities around the world. By hosting different technologies\
    \ and al-\nlowing interactions between them, the internet of things has spearheaded\
    \ the develop-\nment of smart city systems for sustainable living, increased comfort\
    \ and productivity\nfor citizens. The Internet of Things (IoT) for Smart Cities\
    \ has many different domains\nand draws upon various underlying systems for its\
    \ operation, in this work, we provide\na holistic coverage of the Internet of\
    \ Things in Smart Cities by discussing the fun-\ndamental components that make\
    \ up the IoT Smart City landscape, the technologies\nthat enable these domains\
    \ to exist, the most prevalent practices and techniques which\nare used in these\
    \ domains as well as the challenges that deployment of IoT systems for\nsmart\
    \ cities encounter and which need to be addressed for ubiquitous use of smart\
    \ city\napplications. It also presents a coverage of optimization methods and\
    \ applications\nfrom a smart city perspective enabled by the Internet of Things.\
    \ Towards this end,\na mapping is provided for the most encountered applications\
    \ of computational opti-\nmization within IoT smart cities for five popular optimization\
    \ methods, ant colony\noptimization, genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization,\
    \ artificial bee colony op-\ntimization and differential evolution. For each application\
    \ identified, the algorithms\nused, objectives considered, the nature of the formulation\
    \ and constraints taken in\nv\nto account have been specified and discussed. Lastly,\
    \ the data setup used by each\ncovered work is also mentioned and directions for\
    \ future work have been identified.\nWithin the smart health domain of IoT smart\
    \ cities, human activity recognition\nhas been a key study topic in the development\
    \ of cyber physical systems and as-\nsisted living applications. In particular,\
    \ inertial sensor based systems have become\nincreasingly popular because they\
    \ do not restrict users’ movement and are also rel-\natively simple to implement\
    \ compared to other approaches. Fall detection is one of\nthe most important tasks\
    \ in human activity recognition. With an increasingly aging\nworld population\
    \ and an inclination by the elderly to live alone, the need to incor-\nporate\
    \ dependable fall detection schemes in smart devices such as phones, watches\n\
    has gained momentum. Therefore, differentiating between falls and activities of\
    \ daily\nliving (ADLs) has been the focus of researchers in recent years with\
    \ very good results.\nHowever, one aspect within fall detection that has not been\
    \ investigated much is di-\nrection and severity aware fall detection. Since a\
    \ fall detection system aims to detect\nfalls in people and notify medical personnel,\
    \ it could be of added value to health pro-\nfessionals tending to a patient suffering\
    \ from a fall to know the nature of the accident.\nIn this regard, as a case study\
    \ for smart health, four different experiments have been\nconducted for the task\
    \ of fall detection with direction and severity consideration on\ntwo publicly\
    \ available datasets. These four experiments not only tackle the problem\non an\
    \ increasingly complicated level (the first one considers a fall only scenario\
    \ and\nthe other two a combined activity of daily living and fall scenario) but\
    \ also present\nmethodologies which outperform the state of the art techniques\
    \ as discussed. Lastly,\nfuture recommendation have also been provided for researchers.\n\

    Motivation\nThe world is experiencing a bulging world population and increasing\
    \ urbanization\nwhich is set to grow by more than 10% in the next 30 years [1]\
    \ resulting in a total\nof 70% living in cities by 2050. Countries around the\
    \ world are looking at equipping\ntheir cities to deal with the influx of people\
    \ and the stress it will bring to current\ncity systems [2]. This is to be performed\
    \ keeping in view the UN Sustainable De-\nvelopment Goals 2030 [3]. In this regard,\
    \ Smart Cities have come out as a major\ninitiative by various governments in\
    \ making cities more navigable and welcoming to\nthe expected population increase\
    \ and providing city dwellers a better living experi-\nence, as is evidenced by\
    \ the multiple projects ongoing on both the public and private\nlevel [4, 5, 6,\
    \ 7]. The Internet of Things (IoT) has been the prime enabler of smart\ncities\
    \ as it has provided the means in terms of sensors, architectures, storage and\n\
    other technologies to instrument cities. It allows stakeholders to gather data,\
    \ pro-\ncess it and then make decisions based on the analyses performed. There\
    \ are various\ndomains within smart cities, these include Smart Agriculture, Smart\
    \ City Services,\nSmart Grid, Smart Health, Smart Homes, Smart Industry, Smart\
    \ Infrastructure and\nSmart Transportation.With improvement of Artificial intelligence\
    \ (AI) capabilities\nin the last decade, there have been different applications\
    \ of machine learning (ML)\nand deep learning (DL) algorithms within each of these\
    \ domains providing for better\ndecision making and improvement of services. Apart\
    \ from various supervised and un-\nsupervised learning applications, several tasks\
    \ within different components of smart\ncities can be formulated into optimization\
    \ problems and/or require heuristics to be\nincorporated in some form. However,\
    \ in both such tasks, there is a dearth of an\noverall coverage of Smart City\
    \ IoT based ML/DL and combinatorial optimization\nproblems. Such a coverage would\
    \ be very beneficial to researchers starting in the\nfield and has been presented\
    \ herein.\nOne of the major applications of the IoT Smart Cities is for health\
    \ purposes.\nMany countries around the world, especially in the developed world\
    \ are facing an\naging population. With the retirement of the ’baby boomer’ generation,\
    \ countries\naround the world are facing a big question over caring for their\
    \ elderly population.\nOne of the major issues that elderly people face today\
    \ are falls [8]. In the US, falls\naccount for a majority of the deaths caused\
    \ by injury in population aged 65 and\nabove [9] and a fall related injury occurs\
    \ every 19 minutes [10]. As indicated in [11],\nfalls have been associated with\
    \ estimated medical costs ranging from $31.5 billion for\n2013 to $49.5 billion\
    \ for 2017. Moreover, Floerence et al. [12] notes that in 2018,\nfalls contributed\
    \ to 8% of Medicaid expenses in the US for older adults, consequently\n1\nfalls\
    \ have huge health as well as financial ramifications for people and governments.\n\
    Determining when a person has experienced a fall is therefore an important task\
    \ in\nthe healthcare of people, more so in the old age population who tend to\
    \ increasingly\nlive alone and are at increased risk of suffering from falls.\
    \ Apart from just detecting\nif a fall has occurred or not, the direction of a\
    \ fall is an important consideration\nas well. Bourke et al. [13] notes that even\
    \ though 60% of falls occurring in older\nadults are forward falls, falls occurring\
    \ sideways may result in fracture and thus\nare important to determine. Quick\
    \ dispatch of healthcare providers can result in\ntimely treatment of fall related\
    \ injuries, thereby reducing the overall impact to life\nand wealth. Additional\
    \ information about the fall could benefit the medical dispatch\nteam to help\
    \ decide emergency procedures which could be matched up with patient\nhistory\
    \ of potentially being injury prone in a certain part of the body. In light of\
    \ this\nall, the development of fall detection systems has been of keen interest\
    \ to researchers\nin the domain of human activity recognition, tele-medicine and\
    \ smart health.\n2\nAims\nCiting the importance of IoT usage in communities, the\
    \ aims of this dissertation are\nas follows:\n1. To provide a wholistic coverage\
    \ of IoT based Smart City system design consid-\nering important aspects such\
    \ as sensors, technologies used, IoT architectures,\nthe use of machine/deep learning\
    \ methods and optimization schemes as well as\nthe challenges.\n2. Considering\
    \ the case study of smart health and specifically fall detection, de-\nvelop methodologies\
    \ for detection of falls considering fall direction and severity.\n3\nOrganization\n\
    This dissertation is organized in to six chapters.\nChapter II presents a coverage\n\
    of the IoT for Smart Cities in terms of the technologies used, its architectures\
    \ and\nalso the challenges towards IoT usage in Smart Cities. Chapter III discusses\
    \ the the\napplications of machine and deep learning algorithms. This chapter\
    \ provides a com-\nprehensive discussion on IoT usage in Smart Cities by considering\
    \ the different types\nof systems devised for each application as well. Chapter\
    \ IV discusses the applications\nof optimization algorithms in IoT based smart\
    \ cities for five popular algorithms. It\nthus provides a coverage of optimization\
    \ applications under the IoT smart city um-\nbrella. Chapter V presents work on\
    \ a chosen case study of smart health based on\nIoT. The considered task is fall\
    \ detection with direction and severity consideration.\nFour experiments have\
    \ been performed in this regard considering three scenarios, one\nconsidering\
    \ falls only with direction and severity and two others considering falls and\n\
    activity of daily living (ADL) as a combined problem. The designed methodologies\n\
    have shown to outperform the state of the art as has been discussed in the chapter.\n\
    The conclusion and future work opportunities are discussed in chapter VI.\n2\n\
    CHAPTER II\nIOT SMART CITIES\n1\nIntroduction\nThis chapter provides an overeview\
    \ of the use of IoT in Smart Cities and discuss\nhow it facilitates such initiatives.\
    \ It starts by laying out the structure of Internet\nof Things in a Smart City\
    \ context, discussing its various applications, components\nand architectures\
    \ while also discussing the technologies used at the different levels of\nthe\
    \ IoT architecture. Lastly, a discussion of the technical challenges that exist\
    \ in the\ndeployment of IoT in the Smart City domain is provided along with identification\
    \ of\npotential solutions to those challenges followed by future directions.\n\
    It is hard to define a Smart City, in fact, cities claim to be ‘smart’ based on\
    \ a\nvariety of criteria, for e.g. implementing novel e-governance schemes, creating\
    \ so-\ncial learning ventures and community engagement programs, focusing on sustainable\n\
    living as well as the more typical application of Information and Communication\n\
    Technologies for innovation [14]. In this work, Smart Cities are defined to be\
    \ the ap-\nplication of various information and communication technologies (ICT)\
    \ with the aim\nof creating a better living experience for a city’s population.\
    \ This encompasses use\nof these technologies in all the domains discussed previously,\
    \ including governance,\ntransport, housing, business, sustainable living, social\
    \ learning, community engage-\nment, providing opportunities and more. In an ideal\
    \ sense, the idea of a smart city\ntranscends the typically set boundaries of\
    \ a traditional city’s administrative and so-\ncial structure by allowing interaction\
    \ between the two, thereby enabling it to operate\nin a more cohesive and engaged\
    \ manner. Smart cities offer several advantages (in\nterms of value) compared\
    \ to a traditional city ecosystem:\n1. Climate goal achievement: Smart cities\
    \ are at the forefront of pioneering tech-\nnologies to help enable countries\
    \ meet climate goals. Smart city focuses on\nsmart energy management, smart transportation\
    \ systems and city administra-\ntion which aim to reduce the carbon footprint\
    \ of cities and enable development\nand use of new technologies for cleaner living.\n\
    2. Money value: Smart City ventures will be a market of USD 1 Trillion by 2025\n\
    [15], this provides a huge monetary incentive for not only governments but\nprivate\
    \ companies to actively contribute to the development of technologies\nsupporting\
    \ smart city development.\n3. Societal impact: The centerpiece of the smart city\
    \ project is to improve the qual-\nity of life of a city’s inhabitants and help\
    \ develop an inclusive society wherein\nevery opinion is catered for and equal\
    \ opportunity is provided. Information and\n3\nCommunication Technologies in the\
    \ smart city context are a fundamental com-\nponent to the provision of public\
    \ services by facilitating interactions of citizens\nwith the city environment\
    \ and making life easier.\n2\nSmart City Components\nA smart city is made up of\
    \ several components which are illustrated in Figure 1.\nSmart city applications\
    \ typically have four aspects associated with them, the first is\nthe collection\
    \ of data, the next is its transmission/reception, third is the storage and\n\
    fourth is analysis. The collection of data is application dependent and has been\
    \ a real\ndriver for sensor development in the various domains. The second part\
    \ is the exchange\nof data, this involves data transmission from the data collection\
    \ units towards the\ncloud for storage and analysis.\nThis task has been achieved\
    \ in several manners,\nmany smart city ventures have city-wide Wi-Fi networks,\
    \ 4G and 5G technologies are\nbeing used, as well as various types of local networks\
    \ which can convey data either\non a local level or a global level. The third\
    \ stage is storage in the cloud, different\nstorage schemes are used to arrange\
    \ and organize data so as to make it usable for\nthe fourth stage which is data\
    \ analysis. Data Analysis refers to the extraction of\npatterns and inferences\
    \ from the gathered data to guide decision making. In some\nsituations, simple\
    \ analysis such as basic decision making and aggregating would work\ntoo. For\
    \ more complex decision making, the availability of the cloud allows not only\n\
    for heterogeneous data gathering/storage and processing but also analysis through\n\
    the use of statistical methods as well as machine and deep Learning algorithms\
    \ in\nreal-time [16].\n2.1\nSmart Agriculture\nFood security is one of the most\
    \ important parts of the United Nations Sustainable\nDevelopment goals for 2030.\
    \ With an increasing world population, worsening climate\nchange causing erratic\
    \ weather in food centers of the world, the race to ensure that\nfood production\
    \ is made sustainable and that dwindling resources such as water are\nutilized\
    \ efficiently has been a high priority for countries around the world. Smart\n\
    agriculture is the use of sensors embedded into plants and fields to measure various\n\
    parameters to help in decision making and prevent/diseases, pests etc [17]. A\
    \ part\nof the smart agriculture paradigm is precision agriculture, which involves\
    \ sensors\nbeing placed in plants to provide targeted measurements and therefore\
    \ allow for\ntargeted care mechanisms to be deployed. Precision agriculture will\
    \ be necessary\nfor food security in the future [18] and therefore is an essential\
    \ part of the fight for\nsustainable food production. The major applications of\
    \ AI in IoT for agriculture are\ncrop monitoring/disease detection and data driven\
    \ crop care and decision making.\n2.2\nSmart City Services\nSmart city services\
    \ encompass the activities that sustain a city’s population, these\ninvolve municipal\
    \ tasks such as supply of water, waste management, environmental\n4\nSmart \n\

    \ Smart City Components\ncontrol and monitoring etc. Sensors for water quality\
    \ can be deployed to continually\nprovide an update about the quality of water\
    \ being used in the city and detect leaks\n[19]. One popular component of smart\
    \ city initiatives is the management of waste,\nand it has been the part of many\
    \ of the smart city initiatives mentioned earlier, from\nchutes in Barcelona to\
    \ having bins equipped with sensors and connected to the cloud\nso as to not only\
    \ inform the relevant authorities of the need to empty them but also\nusing AI\
    \ to determine the best route to reduce cost [20]. Sensors can also be used to\n\
    monitor the environmental conditions in a city to determine pollution levels [21]\
    \ and\nguiding citizens to the next free parking space to save fuel costs [22].\n\
    2.3\nSmart Energy\nTypical electrical systems have one-way energy flow from a\
    \ main generator source,\nusually a hydroelectric or fossil fuel based power plant.\
    \ Power generation is controlled\nvia feedback from the substations, however,\
    \ since there is no information feedback\nfrom the consumer end, the power generation\
    \ scheme used with these systems requires\nthat the power being produced by these\
    \ sources outstrips the demand by a large\namount to ensure continuous supply\
    \ of power. The process of detecting faults and\nperforming corrective actions\
    \ in such systems is also a time taking process. Moreover,\nwith renewable energy\
    \ technologies becoming cheaper, the consumer of today not\nonly has a supply\
    \ from the main utility but also performs their own generation.\nSmart Grids is\
    \ the use of ICT to make the current and newly installed grids more\nobservable,\
    \ allow for distributed energy generation, both at the consumer end as well\n\
    as the utility end and introduce self-healing capabilities in to the grid. One\
    \ aspect\n5\nof smart grids is that real time power data is transmitted to utilities\
    \ at different\npoints on the grid throughout the supply lines till the customer.\
    \ Since smart grids\nprovide real-time data about consumer usage, it allows for\
    \ better management of\npower generation using prediction models developed through\
    \ acquired consumption\ndata, integrating different energy sources as well as\
    \ self-healing [23] of the network\nto ensure an uninterrupted supply.\n2.4\n\
    Smart Health\nSmart Health refers to the use of ICT to improve health care availability\
    \ and quality.\nWith an increasing population and rising costs of healthcare,\
    \ this area has been of\nintense focus of researchers as well as healthcare providers.\
    \ Current health systems\nare over burdened and therefore cannot cater to the\
    \ increasing demand from the pop-\nulace. In this regard, smart health aims to\
    \ ensure that healthcare be available to as\nmany people as possible through telemedicine\
    \ services [24] and improved diagnosis\nassistance to doctors utilizing AI [25].\
    \ With the ubiquitousness of mobile phones\nand health trackers [26] that can\
    \ capture real-time data about peoples health (ECGs,\ntemperature, body oxygen\
    \ saturation and other biosensors) while also recording daily\nactivity and detecting\
    \ abnormal movements using inertial sensors, it has become pos-\nsible to leverage\
    \ cloud capabilities for processing this data to make better healthcare\ndecisions.\
    \ Thus reducing the overall costs as well as burden on healthcare facilities.\n\
    2.5\nSmart Home\nOne major component of Smart Cities is the Smart Home since it\
    \ is central to the\nlife of the city’s inhabitants. Smart Homes involve the use\
    \ of sensing units installed\nthroughout a person’s home that provide information\
    \ about the home as well as\nits occupants. These sensors might include user activity\
    \ monitors such as ambient\nsensors, motion trackers and power/energy consumption.\n\
    2.6\nSmart Industry\nIndustries around the world are busy in a continuous pursuance\
    \ of being more ef-\nficient and increasing productivity while reducing cost.\
    \ The industry 4.0 paradigm\nentails the vision of a connected factory where all\
    \ its intermediary functionaries are\nseamlessly integrated, working in tandem\
    \ with each other. This is made possible be-\ncause of the internet of things\
    \ [27]. The use of IoT in manufacturing and production\nprocesses, cyber physical\
    \ systems integrating workers and machines has led to several\nbenefits to the\
    \ industry such as faster and better innovation, optimization of manu-\nfacturing\
    \ schemes (resources and processes), better quality of products and enhanced\n\
    safety for factory workers. However, smart industries come with several challenges\n\
    for IoT usage, working with a set of heterogeneous devices and machines has its\
    \ own\nchallenges and requires cyber physical systems to have flexibility in configuration,\
    \ con-\nnectivity and quick implementation for use in IoT applications for Smart\
    \ Industry\n[28]. Artificial Intelligence has gone hand in hand with IoT to spur\
    \ the development\nand deployment of industry 4.0 services. With sensors being\
    \ embedded in machines\n6\nand other processes in the factory, data from these\
    \ sources provide an opportunity for\nusing AI techniques to increase automation,\
    \ perform business intelligence operations\nand more. In fact, researchers have\
    \ suggested frameworks for integrating AI within\nIoT for Smart Industry [28,\
    \ 29, 30]. The major applications of AI in the industry are\npredictive maintenance,\
    \ monitoring/fault detection (machine health) and production\nmanagement.\n2.7\n\
    Smart Infrastructure\nThe infrastructure of a city is paramount to its living\
    \ quality, city governments need\nto construct new bridges, roads and buildings\
    \ for the use of its inhabitants and also\nperform maintenance for uninterrupted\
    \ usage. Smart infrastructure helps cities in\nensuring their infrastructure is\
    \ in shape and usable by utilizing sensors for measuring\nbuilding/bridge structural\
    \ state for structural health monitoring using accelerome-\nters [31] and smart\
    \ materials [32]. Data collected through these sensors allows for\npredictive\
    \ maintenance of these essential units to maintain normal operation of the\ncity.\n\
    2.8\nSmart Transport\nMany urban centers suffer from traffic problems, this includes\
    \ congestion, pollution,\nscheduling and cost reduction issues for public transport.\
    \ The rapid development\nand implementation of new Information and Communication\
    \ Technologies, Vehicle-\nInfrastructure-Pedestrian communication has become commonplace.\
    \ Whether it be\nVehicle to Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I), Vehicle\
    \ to Pedestrian (V2P)\nor Pedestrian to Infrastructure (P2I), such technologies\
    \ have made the design of smart\ntransportation systems possible. With cars having\
    \ a GPS device and the common-\nality of cellphones with every driver, many approaches\
    \ use GPS data to track driver\nbehavior and traffic patterns [33]. This real-time\
    \ data is already used for route map-\nping in applications such as Waze and Google\
    \ Maps and used for trip scheduling in\npublic transport. Parking systems equipped\
    \ with sensors can also guide drivers to\nthe nearest free parking spot.\n3\n\
    Internet of Things for Smart Cities\nAt the heart of the smart city initiatives\
    \ is the internet of things, it is the enabling\ntechnology that has allowed for\
    \ the pervasive digitization that gives rise to the con-\ncept of smart cities.\
    \ The internet of things refers to the ubiquitous connection of\ndevices to the\
    \ internet, allowing them to send information to the cloud and poten-\ntially\
    \ get directions for performing actions. IoT involves the collection of data and\n\
    performing data analytics operations to extract information in order to support\
    \ de-\ncision and policy making. It is estimated that by 2025 more than 75 billion\
    \ devices\nwill be connected to the internet [34], spearheading even more application\
    \ develop-\nment. Within the smart city context, IoT allows for sensors to collect\
    \ and send data\n7\nabout the city’s state to a central cloud, which is then mined\
    \ or processed for pattern\nextraction and decision-making purposes.\n3.1\nIoT\
    \ Architectures for Smart cities\nThe Internet of Things unifies the operations\
    \ of data sensing, transmission/recep-\ntion, processing and storage through the\
    \ use cloud services. Based on technology, a\ngeneric IoT architecture consists\
    \ of five layers where successive layers operate on the\ninformation from the\
    \ previous layer as shown in Figure 2. It also shows the three\ndifferent architectures\
    \ that exist for IoT systems.\nCloud Computing\nEdge computing\nFog Computing\n\
    Business layer\nActuators\nMobile Elements\nSensors\nNetwork Technologies\nNetwork\

    Layer\nNetwork Layer\nSensing Layer\nFigure 2. IoT Architecture\nThe Sensing layer,\
    \ also called the Perception layer consists of sensors that can\nget information\
    \ about physical quantities of interest in any application as well as\nactuators\
    \ which can act upon physical objects, such as Radio Frequency IDentification\n\
    (RFID) readers for reading RFID tags and other such devices. The data read by\
    \ the\nsensing layer is passed onward to the Middleware layer using the networking\
    \ layer\nthrough wireless network technologies such as Wi-Fi, cellular internet,\
    \ Zigbee and\nBluetooth etc.\nThe Middleware layer provides a generic interface\
    \ for the sensing\nlayer hardware and the Application layer which uses the data\
    \ through various API’s\nand database management services to provide users with\
    \ services. The Business layer\nis attached to the application layer and is used\
    \ to develop strategies and formulate\npolicies that help manage the complete\
    \ system.\nIn terms of architectures, typically, IoT architectures are categorized\
    \ based on\nthe type of operation responsibilities allocated to parts of the IoT\
    \ system, this cat-\negorization is based mainly on processing of data responsibilities.\
    \ There are three\narchitectures of IoT systems with respect to the stage of the\
    \ IoT framework where\nprocessing of data can be carried out and these are Cloud,\
    \ Fog and Edge Models.\nTable 1 lists the traits of each of three layers of the\
    \ IoT system. It is important to\n8\nmention that the three IoT architectures\
    \ discussed here are not mutually exclusive,\ninstead the aim of this hierarchy\
    \ is to complement the higher layer by providing it only\nuseful information which\
    \ makes the system more productive and dependable. For any\nIoT system designer,\
    \ the aim is to establish a balance between the capabilities of the\nthree layers\
    \ keeping in view system costs and requirements.\n3.1.1\nCloud Computing Model\n\
    This was the first proposed architecture for IoT systems and is based on the premise\n\
    that processing of data from the various components in the IoT system should take\n\
    place in the cloud. Cloud computing allows for the remote accessing of uninterrupted\n\
    shared resources (computing, storage and services) over the network. It should\
    \ be\nable to dynamically allocate these resources without human intervention,\
    \ schedule\nor pool as necessary and be able to be accessed from a variety of\
    \ different platforms\n[35]. The cloud can provide both hardware as well as software\
    \ services for smart city\napplications. It has the advantage that it provides\
    \ a central management platform\nfrom which to observe, control the IoT system\
    \ as well as to disseminate command\nactions based on the received data. Moreover,\
    \ this centralization also allows for cloud\nsystems to have sufficiently large\
    \ computing and storage capacities thereby allowing\nthem to perform complex tasks\
    \ of data mining, pattern extraction and making infer-\nences from sensor data\
    \ in smart cities to make use of it in the best manner possible.\nHowever, there\
    \ are a few disadvantages with using the cloud computing model for\nthe IoT. First,\
    \ transmitting all gathered data to the cloud increases network traffic,\neven\
    \ though this may not be true for applications in which measurements are not\n\
    very frequent, but in other cases, this could increase network costs. Moreover,\
    \ data\ntransmission overheads may increase due to the large amount of data that\
    \ needs to\nbe transmitted by the many sensors existing in the smart city scenario.\
    \ Another\ndisadvantage that the cloud computing model suffers from is data latency,\
    \ since the\nsensing units exist at the sensing layer and the decision making/data\
    \ processing takes\nplace in the cloud, this gives rise to data latency in the\
    \ transmission of sensing infor-\nmation, especially when many devices start sending\
    \ data at the same time. Network\nreliability can be an issue when using this\
    \ model, with the large volume of data traffic\non the network, it might not be\
    \ possible to enforce robust data transmission schemes\nas IoT systems get bigger.\n\
    3.1.2\nFog Computing Model\nSince most of the information produced with in IoT\
    \ takes place towards the sensing\nend of the IoT system, also called the edge,\
    \ Fog Computing was proposed in [36]\nto overcome some of the problems of the\
    \ cloud computing model for the IoT. Fog\ncomputing provides a more diverse distribution\
    \ of responsibilities than are dictated\nby the cloud computing architecture by\
    \ moving some of the processing to devices\non the local network.\nTypically,\
    \ Fog computing refers to data processing that is\ncarried out by routers and\
    \ other network devices within in the Network layer in the\nIoT. Since network\
    \ devices nowadays increasingly offer better computational capabil-\n9\nities,\
    \ one can leverage them to perform rudimentary operations on data. Operations\n\
    such as aggregation and collection of sensor data, simple processing operations\
    \ and\ndecision-making can be performed to reduce the amount of information flow\
    \ towards\nthe higher cloud layer. Questions that need to be answered for the\
    \ decision-making\nprocess include but are not limited to for e.g., does the decision\
    \ require the use of\naveraging for one quantity and instantaneous values of the\
    \ other? Is it possible to\nextrapolate data received for one quantity and use\
    \ the currently measured value for\nanother one? Based on the previous data for\
    \ a given period, can one provide higher\nlayers with decision options rather\
    \ than just data, thereby providing better quality\ninformation to the cloud layer\
    \ thus resulting in better utilization of cloud resources.\nFog layers can localize\
    \ decision making since they have access to the local state of a\ngiven region\
    \ [37]. This would be helpful in implementing distributed decision mak-\ning mechanisms\
    \ which might be necessary in some applications. Moreover, they also\nallow for\
    \ local networks to be established using non-internet technologies such as Zig-\n\
    bee, Bluetooth, RFID etc where sensors and other end devices transmit data to\
    \ the\nFog node (also referred to as access points in such systems) which is connected\
    \ to the\ncloud.\nFog computing results in reduced costs for deployment of IoT\
    \ systems, increases ro-\nbustness as latency, data overhead and errors in transmission\
    \ are reduced. This also\nimproves the efficiency of the applications as quicker\
    \ decisions can be made on the\nreceived data, which is important in critical\
    \ decision-making situations. Moreover,\nFog devices have the capability to not\
    \ only receive data from similar devices at the\nedge but also collect it from\
    \ many different types of devices. This capability to mea-\nsure different parameters\
    \ in the edge environment enable for an application neutral\nIoT system architecture\
    \ to be developed.\nData sent upward by the Fog layer in the IoT hierarchy would\
    \ be used to gain insights\nin to system behavior and to guide new rules of system\
    \ operation, this will typically\nbe carried out in the cloud. Devices in the\
    \ Fog layer may be provided decision making\nguidance from the higher cloud layer\
    \ to ensure smooth system operation. However,\na balance needs to be struck as\
    \ to the division of responsibilities between the cloud\nand the fog layer keeping\
    \ in view the costs involved.\n3.1.3\nEdge Computing Model\nThe purpose of Fog\
    \ Computing was to push some of the decision making towards\nthe edge of the network.\
    \ In recent years, with increasingly capable devices being\ndeveloped that are\
    \ attached to ‘edge’ nodes, simple decision making, and processing\nof data has\
    \ been increasingly moved on to these devices so as to reduce network\nand device\
    \ costs even further at the fog level and make for even deeper distributed\ndecision-making\
    \ schemes. Edge computing refers to data processing that is done at\nthe ”thing”\
    \ level, i.e. by sensors and other devices in the IoT system [38]. Another\nconcept\
    \ about Edge computing as discussed in [39] defines the Edge computing layer\n\
    as an intermediary layer between the Fog and the ‘things’ (sensors) rather than\
    \ edge\nnodes. The difference between them in this case is the Edge computing\
    \ nodes act\nas aggregation and decision-making units on a smaller scale compared\
    \ to fog devices\n10\nwhich act to provide seamless connectivity and data integrity\
    \ throughout the IoT\nnetwork. The aim of the Fog and the Edge computing paradigms\
    \ is to decentralize\nthe IoT system for purposes of reducing cost, increasing\
    \ scalability and increasing\nrobustness.\nTable 1. Comparison of Cloud, Fog and\

    \ Internet of Things promises the digitization of all aspects of our lives. For\
    \ smart\ncities, this digitization process entails the proliferation of sensing\
    \ nodes in every\ndomain of a city’s operation mechanism. With an application\
    \ scope this broad, the\ncreation and subsequent deployment of IoT systems in\
    \ smart cities carry enormous\nchallenges that need to be considered. In this\
    \ section, a discussion is provided of\nthe challenges that IoT system designers\
    \ face when making deployments in smart\ncity applications.\nThe focus in this\
    \ work is on the technological challenges that\npertain to IoT use in smart cities\
    \ and has also been the focus of researchers. Figure 3\nshows the different challenges\
    \ which Smart City IoT system deployment encounters,\nnamely Security and Privacy,\
    \ Smart Sensors, Networking and Big Data Analytics. A\nsummary of the discussion\
    \ in this section is presented in Table 2.\n11\nSmart City\nChallenges\nSmart\

    3.2.1\nSecurity and Privacy\nSecurity, along with Privacy is the primary concern\
    \ in smart cities.\nSmart cities\ninvolve having essential city infrastructures\
    \ online, any aberration in the operation\nof the city’s services will bring inconvenience\
    \ to its citizens and put human lives and\nproperty at risk. Therefore, security\
    \ is a big concern in smart cities. In today’s age\nwhere cybercrime and warfare\
    \ have become a tactic in world politics, smart cities\nare at an ever-greater\
    \ risk of being the target of such malicious attacks. Encryption\nof data transmitted\
    \ over the network is necessary in this scenario. For smart city\nprojects to\
    \ be successful, they require the trust and participation of citizens. The\nproliferation\
    \ of sensors in smart cities, which continuously collect data about the\nactivity\
    \ of people may expose the daily activities of citizens to unwanted parties.\n\
    Moreover, companies and corporations on the IoT network may use citizen data\n\
    without their approval for things like targeted advertising and may perform acts\
    \ such\nas eavesdropping etc. Solutions to this will require processes that anonymize\
    \ data\ncollection while retaining the integrity of the context of the measured\
    \ task so that\napt decision making is possible. Security and Privacy has been\
    \ covered in detail in a\nlater section.\n12\n3.2.2\nSmart Sensors\nSmart sensors\
    \ are the hardware components that gather data in smart cities. These\ndevices\
    \ are manufactured by a host of different vendors that adhere to different sens-\n\
    ing mechanisms, standards of measurement, data formats and connectivity proto-\n\
    cols. Smart city deployment will require all these devices to exchange data, perform\n\
    scheduling of tasks between them and be able to aggregate data together for mak-\n\
    ing inferences. A solution to this issue is to develop and use open protocols\
    \ and\ndata formats that will enable manufacturers to create equipment that can\
    \ communi-\ncate between each other, further spurring IoT system deployment. Another\
    \ solution\ncould be the development of ‘standard’ access point nodes for IoT\
    \ systems that can\ncommunicate to devices using several different communication\
    \ protocols and are able\nto decode the information received. Some manufacturers\
    \ have, in fact, made their\nproducts compatible with other protocols as mentioned\
    \ in [40].\nAnother challenge for smart sensors is reliability and robustness.\
    \ Reliability and\nrobustness refer to the dependability and correctness of the\
    \ IoT system. IoT is the\nbackbone of future smart cities and being imperative\
    \ to their operation, the IoT\nsystem needs to provide a smooth experience to\
    \ its users. This requires that service\nrequests from users of the application\
    \ receive an accurate and timely response. The\nquality of service needs to be\
    \ ensured for every citizen in the smart city. Systems\nthat deliver critical\
    \ utilities such as transport, electricity etc. should be decentralized.\nThe\
    \ distributed connection points will allow for robustness and increase reliability.\n\
    One such example is self-healing in Smart Grids [23].\nMany current networking\
    \ protocols are developed for infrastructure networked\ndevices which have access\
    \ to continuous power, however, sensors in smart cities will\nbe mobile in many\
    \ scenarios and thus be battery powered. Moreover, they will need\nto measure,\
    \ transfer and in some cases save data they have collected. This requires\nthe\
    \ development of not only low power, low overhead data transmission schemes\n\
    but also development of new memory and storage technologies as well as low power\n\
    devices that extend battery life as much as possible. Storing this large amount\
    \ of\ndata would require development of compression algorithms which will be employed\n\
    and database schemes that will need to be developed in the future as smart cities\n\
    and IoT are scaled up. Solutions for power issues necessitate the development\
    \ of new\nbattery technologies and perhaps the incorporation of energy harvesting\
    \ mechanisms\nin such devices to make long lasting service provision possible.\n\
    3.2.3\nNetworking\nThe IoT depends on the capability of sensing and other devices\
    \ to be able to send\nand receive information to each other and the Cloud. With\
    \ new smart city appli-\ncations coming up, providing networking to these devices\
    \ to remain connected is a\nbig challenge. Current networking methods are not\
    \ optimized to providing network-\ning services for smart city components. Many\
    \ devices in smart cities have mobility\nand data throughput requirements which\
    \ need to be met to provide an acceptable\nquality of service. Different approaches\
    \ have been suggested in terms of defining ac-\n13\ncess points, local networks\
    \ etc. to solve this problem. Another aspect of networking\nwould be working on\
    \ efficient and dynamic routing protocols that can serve IoT re-\nquirements capable\
    \ of working with stationary as well as devices in motion, which\nmany current\
    \ protocols do not offer sufficiently [41].\n3.2.4\nBig Data Analytics\nIoT connected\
    \ devices generated 13.6 Zetta Bytes of data in 2018 and this is expected\nto\
    \ grow to 79.4 Zetta Bytes till 2025 [34]. To make use of this data and continuously\n\
    improve the services that are delivered in smart cities, new data analytics algorithms\n\
    need to be developed. With the myriad of the different parameters that are measured\n\
    in smart cities, these algorithms need to be applicable to data of varying nature\
    \ (both\nstructured and unstructured), better data fusion techniques need to be\
    \ developed as\nwell so as to combine them in meaningful ways and be able to extract\
    \ inferences and\nrecognize patterns. Deep learning has been of interest in this\
    \ area as it can lever-\nage on this large amount of data to provide better results\
    \ for different applications.\nAnother important consideration would be to ensure\
    \ that the developed algorithms\nare scalable in that they have enough generality\
    \ and can be used through out the\nintended application. For, e.g., for the purposes\
    \ of activity recognition, the authors\nin [42] found that a CNN trained for activity\
    \ recognition on one dataset failed to\nperform well on others or in [43] where\
    \ the deep learning network performs poorly\nwhen the color of tomatoes is different\
    \ from what it was trained on. Concept drift is\nanother issue of concern as with\
    \ the continuous acquisition of data, the properties of\ndata may change over\
    \ time. Techniques such as incremental learning may be useful\nin this respect.\
    \ Explainability is another important factor for Smart City analytics\nto be widely\
    \ acceptable, specially in the area of smart health. There have been some\napproaches\
    \ suggested towards this end, in [44] a hybrid deep learning classifier and\n\
    semantic web technologies based solution is demonstrated for the application of\
    \ flood\nmonitoring. In [45], the authors present an explainable deep learning\
    \ based health-\ncare system at the Edge for COVID-19 care based on a distributed\
    \ learning paradigm\nwith promising results. However, more work needs to be performed\
    \ to incorporate\nexplainability techniques such as distillation, visualization,\
    \ and intrinsic methods into\nMachine and Deep Learning based smart city applications\
    \ in order to increase smart\ncity application proliferation.\n3.3\nSensing Technologies\n\
    Sensing is at the heart of smart city technologies. Sensors provide the knowledge\
    \ and\ndata from which smart city innovations are created. With the vastly different\
    \ nature\nof Smart City projects and its various components, there are numerous\
    \ sensors which\nare used as part of these initiatives. The authors in [58] have\
    \ provided a framework\nfor the comparison of IoT sensors and have listed sensors\
    \ they found in use for the\nInternet of Things. We use their work to direct our\
    \ survey of the sensing technologies\nused in smart cities. Sensors within IoT\
    \ can be divided in to several groups, these are\nambient, motion, electric, biosensors,\
    \ identification, presence, hydraulic and chemical\n14\nTable 2. Smart City IoT\

    \ are the key component in smart city IoT\nsystems which provide the interaction\
    \ between the smart city system and the city’s\ninhabitants and allow for new\
    \ services to be developed. One thing to note is that\nmany of the sensors find\
    \ applications in multiple areas as discussed. Furthermore,\nany given application\
    \ will require measuring different physical quantities and will\nrequire the use\
    \ of many different types of sensors. For, e.g., ambient, motion, electric,\n\
    identification, position, chemical and hydraulic sensors have been found to be\
    \ used in\nsmart homes. As noted in the challenges, working with different sensors\
    \ which might\nhave different output data types is a task that needs to be dealt\
    \ with when working\nwith multiple types of sensors. Table 3 presents a summary\
    \ of the sensors used in\neach smart city component.\n3.3.1\nAmbient Sensors\n\
    Ambient sensors include sensors used to measure physical quantities indicating\
    \ to\nenvironmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, light intensity\
    \ and pressure.\nAmbient sensors are used in a variety of smart city applications\
    \ including smart homes\nwhere they are used to regulate the comfort level, they\
    \ are also used for smart city\nservices.\n3.3.2\nBio-Sensors\nBio-sensors are\
    \ used for measuring health parameters of living things. Bio-sensors in\nsmart\
    \ cities are used for monitoring patients for healthcare purposes. Such sensors\

    and more.\n3.3.3\nChemical\nChemical sensors are used to measure chemical properties\
    \ of materials, this includes\ngas sensors which can measure/detect carbon monoxide\
    \ (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2)\nand other gases for air quality monitoring, sensors\
    \ for detecting smoke, pH and other\nsensors for water quality monitoring etc.\n\
    3.3.4\nElectric Sensors\nElectric sensors allow for the measurement of electrical\
    \ power and are widely used in\nsmart grids and smart homes to monitor the power\
    \ consumption of consumers/ap-\npliances. Types include current transformers and\
    \ voltage sensors to measure current\nand voltage, respectively.\n3.3.5\nHydraulic\n\
    Hydraulic sensors refer to sensors used for liquid measurements such as level,\
    \ flow,\nleak detection. These are used for measurement of liquid levels in tanks\
    \ [59].\n16\n3.3.6\nIdentification\nIdentification sensors refer to RFID tags\
    \ and Near Field Communication (NFC) de-\nvices. These sensors are used in applications\
    \ involving payments, data exchange in\nthe domain of smart transportation and\
    \ smart city services.\n3.3.7\nMotion Sensors\nMotion sensors refer to sensors\
    \ that can be used for the detection of motion. Sensors\nfor motion sensing involve\
    \ inertial sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes.\nThese sensors are used\
    \ in smart health applications such as activity tracking as well\nas applications\
    \ like vibration sensing in smart homes and industry.\n3.3.8\nPresence\nPresence\
    \ sensors indicate to the presence of a humans or objects. Passive InfraRed\n\
    (PIR) sensors are very popular and are used to detect human motion, reed switches\n\
    can be used on windows and doors for security purposes, inductive loop sensors\
    \ which\nuse electromagnetic induction can be used to detect presence in transport\
    \ systems.\nUltrasonic sensors are also used to determine the distance of objects.\n\
    Capacitive\nsensors are also included in this type, these may be used to determine\
    \ position.\n3.3.9\nOther Sensors\nVarious smart city applications make use of\
    \ different sensing modalities such as audio\nor visual information or other signal\
    \ measurement devices, for, e.g., bluetooth and\nWi-Fi signal strength. Since\
    \ the sensors for these modalities capture raw information\nabout signals (visual,\
    \ sound or signal strength etc.), the gathered data is typically\nprocessed further\
    \ before it indicates to the target variable being measured.\n3.4\nNetworking\
    \ Technologies\nThe internet of things in smart cities depends on the aggregation\
    \ of data measured by\nindividual sensing units placed throughout the smart city\
    \ environment. Systems that\ncan use these measurements individually have long\
    \ existed and provided automation\nfor small projects. However, the ‘smart’ in\
    \ smart city comes from the collective usage\nof the data from these individual\
    \ sensing units to perform complex decisions while\ndelivering services to citizens.\
    \ The collective use of this data enables its analysis over\na wider scope compared\
    \ to individual levels so as to determine long term patterns\nand provide meaningful\
    \ insights to support services. The number of such IoT devices\ncurrently present\
    \ in the world [34] are multiple times that of the world population.\nTo enable\
    \ these devices to exchange data, wireless technologies need to be used as\nphysical\
    \ connections would, for one, be too costly (where ever they can be used),\nsecond,\
    \ would not satisfy the mobility requirements that are typical of many smart\n\
    city applications. The internet has provided connectivity to computers, smartphones\n\
    and other electronic devices around the world with each other, allowing for instant\n\

    transfer of information between them. However, for IoT the internet may not neces-\n\
    sarily be the only communication method [72] as many applications do not possess\n\
    edge devices that can connect to the internet. An application may consist of a\
    \ local\nnetwork of sensing units which can exchange data between them and rely\
    \ on a multi-\nhop communication protocol to send data to a central node, hub\
    \ or gateway. The\ngateway might be fixed and would be connected to the internet,\
    \ thereby relaying any\nmonitored data to the cloud for further processing or\
    \ use. It might also be possible\nthat devices within an application may use many\
    \ different protocols with the central\nnode having the capability to communicate\
    \ with all of them, a common case for such\narchitectures is the smart home where\
    \ manufacturers produce devices using propriety\nor incompatible protocols for\
    \ which a hub may be used, an example of such a system\nwas provided in [73] and\
    \ several hubs are commercially available. In this section, we\ndiscuss the network\
    \ types, topologies and protocols used in the Internet of Things for\nSmart City\
    \ applications as illustrated in Figure 5. We later provide a comparison of\n\
    these protocols in Table 4.\n3.4.1\nNetwork Topologies\nThere are three IoT network\
    \ topologies, point to point, star and mesh [74]. The first\ntype of topology\
    \ is the point to point topology where devices are connected to each\nother sequentially\
    \ in a point to point manner. Point to point networks introduce\ndata hops for\
    \ packets that need to be sent to other nodes as data needs to go through\neach\
    \ node in the path of the two nodes wanting to exchange data. Point to point\n\
    networks are not very popular in IoT systems as it ranks low on fault resiliency\
    \ and\nwill breakdown if there is a fault in any of the intermediate nodes. In\
    \ Star topology,\n18\nall units in a network are connected to a central node or\
    \ gateway and cannot send data\nto each other directly. In order to perform an\
    \ exchange of data among themselves, the\ndevices need to send it through the\
    \ central node. Star topology networks, with their\ncentral node structure provide\
    \ a natural aggregation scheme for data collection within\nthe internet of things,\
    \ however, large networks consisting of many devices, which can\nbe the case in\
    \ most smart city applications, may result in high latency and possible\nbottlenecks\
    \ in high information throughput scenarios. Star topology has been used in\nvarious\
    \ applications including disaster management [75] and environmental sensing\n\
    [76]. The last type of network topology that is used in IoT is the Mesh network\n\
    topology, mesh networks allow all individual devices to communicate between them.\n\
    By enabling communication between the nodes in a network, mesh topology offers\n\
    a larger range as data transmitted towards a certain node can make multiple hops\n\
    through the network, this also increases the networks resilience as alternate\
    \ paths\ncould be used if packet delivery fails due to any node becoming faulty.\
    \ In fact, such\ntopologies have been used in smart homes [77] as well as in smart\
    \ grids [78]. There are\nother topologies which have not been mentioned, for,\
    \ e.g., tree (which has multiple\nstar networks connected in a point by point\
    \ fashion).\n3.4.2\nNetwork Architectures\nNetwork Architecture refers to the\
    \ structure of the network used for a given appli-\ncation. As discussed earlier,\
    \ the ‘things’ in IoT may not necessarily be connected\nthrough the internet,\
    \ in fact a distributed connectivity structure may be imple-\nmented with only\
    \ one unit in the network being capable of sending data to the\ncloud depending\
    \ on the requirement. Work in [72] mentions three types of network\narchitectures\
    \ that are used for smart cities based on IoT. These are Home Area\nNetworks (HANs),\
    \ Wide Area Networks (WANs) and Field/Neighborhood Area Net-\nworks (FANs/NANs).\
    \ Home Area Networks are short range networks and are usually\nused to transmit\
    \ information to a central node which is responsible for data collection\nbefore\
    \ it is sent to the cloud. Communication within the network is performed using\n\
    some low power communication protocol such as Zigbee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi etc. HANs\n\
    are very popular in smart homes where they are used to gather power consumption\n\
    and times of operation data from a multitude of appliances which are then sent\
    \ to\na smart meter as part of a smart grid [79]. The second type of network architecture\n\
    is Field Area Networks (FANs), sometimes also called Neighborhood Area Networks\n\
    (NANs). Field Area Networks have a larger communication range than HANs and\n\
    are used to provide connection between a customer (for, e.g., in a smart grid)\
    \ to the\nutility company. Wide Area Networks are used for network structures\
    \ that require\ncommunication over large distances. These networks are not as\
    \ dense as HANs or\nFANs and utilize technologies such as cellular services, wired\
    \ connections such as fiber\noptics as well as a class of low power protocols\
    \ designed for WANs themselves [80].\nWANs are used in a variety of smart city\
    \ applications including Smart Grids where\nthey are used to connect multiple\
    \ substations together or exchanging data between\nthe customer and the substation\
    \ [81].\n19\n3.4.3\nNetwork Protocols\nThe type of network to use depends on the\
    \ requirements of the application. It is\nimperative that the communication protocol\
    \ used in a smart city application meet\nthe desirable quality of service (QoS).\
    \ Several protocols have been used in the internet\nof things for smart cities\
    \ [48, 82, 83, 84], herein, we discuss the traits of the most\npopular wireless\
    \ networking protocols used in smart cities.\n3.4.3.1\nRFID\nRadio Frequency Identification\
    \ (RFID) utilizes radio frequencies\nto transmit and receive data. RFID communication\
    \ consists of two types of devices,\none device is the Reader and the other is\
    \ called the Tag. The Reader is usually\npowered and once a tag comes in the vicinity\
    \ of the reader, an exchange of information\ntakes place after authorization as\
    \ the tag harvests the energy from the reader. Such\ntags are called passive tags,\
    \ there are also active tags which are do not depend on the\nreader for their\
    \ power. Depending on the standard, RFID can operate on different\nfrequencies\
    \ in the radio frequency spectrum between 125 KHz to 928 MHz and can\nbe used\
    \ over short ranges. They are used in applications such as smart transport\n(toll\
    \ tax collection, parking), smart health and more.\n3.4.3.2\nNear Field Communication\n\
    Near Field Communication (NFC) is very\nsimilar to RFID, however, the structure\
    \ of NFC communication doesn’t consist of\ntags and readers. Unlike RFID, both\
    \ devices which want to communicate using NFC\nneed to be powered and data tranmission/reception\
    \ can take place in both directions\nunlike RFIDs. This enables the use of NFC\
    \ to control and configure devices unlike the\nRFID which cannot be used for measurement\
    \ or control tasks. NFC utilizes similar\nfrequencies to RFID but is used for\
    \ very short distances. NFC devices are popular\nfor applications involving payment\
    \ using smart phones and are also used in smart\nhomes.\n3.4.3.3\nBluetooth\n\
    Bluetooth is a low energy protocol popular in IoT applica-\ntions as it can support\
    \ an unlimited number of nodes [82]. The protocol is designed\nfor short range,\
    \ low bandwidth communication in an arrangement where devices can\neasily exit\
    \ or enter the network. Bluetooth natively supports the star topology as it\n\
    has a master device at the center of the communication mechanism. It operates\
    \ in\nthe 2.4 GHz ISM band and can have maximum data rates of 2 Mbps. Bluetooth\
    \ has\nbeen widely used in smart home due to it providing a direct connection\
    \ interface to\nsmart phones without the need for any intermediary hub device.\n\
    3.4.3.4\nZ-Wave\nZ-Wave or Zensys wave is a low power protocol developed to\n\
    be used in home automation applications. It is a low speed protocol with a short\n\
    range, operating in the frequencies of 868 MHz and 900 MHz. It operates in a master\n\
    slave fashion where a master can have multiple slave devices which can respond\
    \ to\ncommands from the master node. Therefore this is well suited for applications\
    \ where\na central control element is present and needs to gather data from multiple\
    \ sensing\nunits such as smart homes and smart healthcare systems.\n20\n3.4.3.5\n\
    Li-Fi\nLi-Fi (Light Fidelity) uses visible light instead of radio frequency\n\
    (RF) to exchange data. The advantage with using Li-Fi over RF communication is\n\
    that it can utilize already present lighting systems which also results in conservation\n\
    of power [85]. It offers very high speeds of data transfer for short distances\
    \ and has\nbeen used in parking systems.\n3.4.3.6\nWi-Fi\nWi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity)\
    \ operates using wireless frequencies in the\n2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands to provide\
    \ high speed internet connectivity in a limited\ndistance. Wi-Fi is popular in\
    \ many smart city applications as it provides ready to\nuse interface to smart\
    \ phones, computers and other wearable gadgets.\n3.4.3.7\nZigbee\nThe ZigBee protocol\
    \ was developed as a low power low cost pro-\ntocol for wireless sensor networks\
    \ (WSNs) and has evolved to be used in the Internet\nof Things. The ZigBee protocol\
    \ operates in the 868 MHz/915 MHz/2.4 GHz band\nand offers moderate data transfer\
    \ speeds with distances similar to Wi-Fi in a multi-\nhop data transfer scheme.\
    \ Zigbee radios are low cost devices and therefore it is a\npopular protocol used\
    \ by many manufacturers of smart home, smart healthcare de-\nvices. A ZigBee network\
    \ will have three devices, one called the coordinator which\nis the controller\
    \ of the network, the router which is responsible for moving data to\nother devices\
    \ and the ZigBee end device (sensors and actuators).\n3.4.3.8\nWi-SUN\nThe Wireless\
    \ Smart Utility Network (Wi-SUN) is a network\napproved by Institute of Electrical\
    \ and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) and is used in\nfield area networks for utility\
    \ metering, automation of distribution for utilities such\nas electricity, gas\
    \ etc. and also for demand response systems for utility-based appli-\ncations.\
    \ It supports IPv6 addressing and can be used in star or mesh configuration\n\
    where it also allows for multi-hop communication [86].\n3.4.3.9\nCellular\nCellular\
    \ technologies refers to 3G, 4G and 5G communications.\nAlong with Bluetooth and\
    \ Zigbee, they are the most popular IoT enabling technolo-\ngies. Cellular communication\
    \ provides high data rate and supports more content rich\napplications compared\
    \ to the other protocols. With the long range they provide, they\nare preferred\
    \ for a variety of applications where power is not an issue. Depending on\nthe\
    \ technology, cellular bands range from 600 MHz to 80 GHz with very high data\n\
    rates.\n3.4.3.10\nLoRaWAN\nLoRaWAN stands for Long Range Wide Area Network (Lo-\n\
    RaWAN) and it is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) that consists of several\n\
    gateways and multiple end devices with the gateways connected to a back-end net-\n\
    work server. The back-end server provides connection to the cloud. End devices\
    \ do\nnot have a fixed association with a specific gateway and may send data to\
    \ multiple\ngateways when it needs to transfer data to the cloud.\n21\n3.4.3.11\n\
    6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN which is short for IPv6 over Low Power Net-\nworks was created\
    \ by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) specifically for\ninternet of\
    \ things applications with the aim of making it possible for providing in-\nternet\
    \ connectivity to small devices. It is an IP based network and leverages IPv6\n\
    communication. This is a short-range network operating in Industrial, Scientific\
    \ and\nMedical (ISM) bands.\n3.4.3.12\nSigFox\nSigFox is a proprietary standard\
    \ developed by SigFox Inc., France.\nIt uses unlicensed bands to perform ultra-narrowband\
    \ bidirectional communication\nwith low speeds [87]. SigFox has a similar architecture\
    \ to LoRaWAN and like Lo-\nRaWAN and 6LoWPAN, SigFox is a popular LPWAN in the\
    \ IoT domain offering\nsufficiently large distances of communication of up to\
    \ 50 km. SigFox finds applica-\ntions in security in buildings, smart lighting\
    \ and environmental monitoring.\n3.4.3.13\nNB-IoT\nNB-IoT (Narrow Band IoT) is\
    \ a type of LPWAN which oper-\nates on Global System for Mobile Communications\
    \ (GSM) and Long-Term Evolution\n(LTE) bands. In fact, it can operate using the\
    \ same hardware with a software up-\ngrade as it is considered a bare bones version\
    \ of LTE. It allows for connecting up to\n100,000 devices per cell.\nTable 4.\

    \ Smart Cities.\n3.5\nSecurity and Privacy in Smart City IoT\nSmart Cities involve\
    \ the transmission of sensing data, control information through\nthe internet\
    \ as well as local networks. Moreover, several components in smart cities\ntend\
    \ to critical aspects of a citys operation and are highly intertwined with the\
    \ social\nand private life of its citizens. Consequently, security and privacy\
    \ in Smart Cities\nis of great importance and has been of high interest to researchers\
    \ [51, 88, 89, 90,\n91, 92]. The topic of Security of IoT has been covered in\
    \ [93] who deliberate upon\nthe challenges faced in the different architectures\
    \ of the IoT and present issues and\nsolutions. We cover security for IoT in smart\
    \ cities so as to highlight issues that are\npertinent to in the Smart City context\
    \ and to complete our discussion on this topic.\nSmart Cities are enabled by collecting\
    \ data through sensors within a city as well\nas its populace, process it and\
    \ then mine it to provide a better quality of life to the\npeople living. These\
    \ sensors can provide an estimate about the internal state of a\ncity’s components\
    \ such as transportation, power system, building condition/state,\nhuman mobility\
    \ and more. All of this data is sent to the cloud where it is processed\nand mined.\
    \ However, there are several issues that pertain to how these data are\nsent and\

    \ for Smart Cities.\nof this process. In fact, this concern is not unwarranted\
    \ for, in 2015 an attack on\nthe Ukranian power grid which left 225,000 people\
    \ without power [94] opened the\nworlds eyes to the very real threat posed by\
    \ cyber attackers. Data gathered in Smart\nCity applications can be used to perform\
    \ many undesired acts, GPS devices that are\npresent in every phone and most vehicles\
    \ are susceptible to providing information\nabout a persons location, habits as\
    \ well as lead to privacy issues as discussed in [91],\npower consumption and\
    \ ambient sensor data from a building may indicate to occu-\npancy [95] and even\
    \ indicate to the individual identities [96]. This information may\nbe used by\
    \ bad actors to carry out unlawful acts causing risk to life and property.\nTo\
    \ secure the Internet of Things for Smart Cities, typical security schemes might\
    \ not\nbe as effective in many cases and new methods will need to be developed\
    \ to cope\nwith the security and privacy issues in IoT for Smart Cities. In order\
    \ to provide a\nstandardized framework and terminology for discussing security\
    \ attacks, we adapt the\nstandard attack incident taxonomy [97] suggested by the\
    \ Computer Emergency Re-\nsponse Team (CERT) which was established by Defense\
    \ Advanced Research Projects\nAgency (DARPA) for use towards IoT for Smart Cities.\
    \ This is shown in Figure 6.\nThere are different types of security and privacy\
    \ issues in IoT in Smart Cities,\nthey exist on each of the three levels of the\
    \ IoT architecture, application software\nlayers, network layer and the perception\
    \ layer along with some system wide issues, a\ndiscussion is provided for each\
    \ of them. Furthermore, Table 5 provides a summary\nof the security and privacy\
    \ issues in IoT for Smart Cities and the counter measures\nthat one can take to\
    \ mitigate them.\n3.5.1\nApplication Software Layers\nApplication software layers\
    \ are comprised of the Middleware, Application and Busi-\nness Layers. Security\
    \ and privacy in the application software layers tend to issues\nrelating to storage\
    \ of data and its usage. These are data visibility, access and injec-\ntion.\n\
    24\n3.5.1.1\nData Visibility/Identification\nOnce data is gathered, it is sent\
    \ to the\ncloud where it is stored and mined to make inferences. Since the cloud\
    \ would be used\nby multiple entities with different standards of security protocols\
    \ and practices, it is\nextremely important that data stored in the cloud is encrypted\
    \ so as not to allow its\nexposure to unwanted entities. Any data stored in plain\
    \ form would be a risk to not\nonly user privacy but also company rapport.\n3.5.1.2\n\
    Data access/Secondary Use\nAccess control is also a major issue in\nsmart city\
    \ data. Most Smart City applications rely on the usage of data from different\n\
    applications to provide smart services, thus resulting in the gathered data to\
    \ be used\nby many different enterprises. To allow this to take place smoothly\
    \ while preserving\nprivacy, suitable access control schemes will need to be devised\
    \ to allow for responsible\naccess to users of this data. A well-defined hierarchy\
    \ of data users will need to be\ndeveloped and implemented to limit access only\
    \ to intended authorized personnel.\nInformation flow control should also be employed\
    \ that can track data flow as access\nto it is made and to detect any violation\
    \ of access or usage rules. Moreover, data\nmashups that will occur in the cloud\
    \ where multiple entities merge their data to\nwork on some common goal, should\
    \ be carried out with proper oversight.\nData\nanonymization may also be required\
    \ in such a scenario where specific values may be\nconverted in to a range perhaps\
    \ ( e.g., using k-anonymity [90]) and unwanted data be\ndeleted as necessary.\
    \ Blockchain has been suggested to be used for access control as\nwell as access\
    \ tracking of users in IoT applications where each user access to a service\n\
    or an application ends up as a transaction to form the applications IoT trail\
    \ [98].\n3.5.1.3\nData Injection/Data Integrity\nData injection refers to the\
    \ injection\nof false information or modification information about a user in\
    \ the system after\ngaining access. Since data is typically stored in databases,\
    \ SQL injection involves\nan attacker inserting queries to modify data or make\
    \ false data insertions into the\ndatabase. This can have far reaching consequences\
    \ for smart city applications such\nas patient record manipulation as well as\
    \ manipulation or deletion of government\nrecords. SQL injection prevention schemes\
    \ involve the validation of data before using\nit [99] such as positive pattern\
    \ matching. It also involves limiting database access\nbased on the user requirements\
    \ and performing penetration testing.\n3.5.2\nNetwork Layer\nLike other networks,\
    \ the IoT in Smart Cities are also susceptible to network attacks\nsuch as Denial\
    \ of service, Eavesdropping, Man in the middle attack, Side Channel\nand spoofing\
    \ attacks [100]. We discuss these attacks and discuss remedial actions\nthat should\
    \ be taken to prevent them.\n3.5.2.1\nMan in the Middle Attack\nMan in the middle\
    \ (MITM) attack refers\nto the interception of data on the network by faking the\
    \ identity of a network node\nor device. This is carried out by appearing as the\
    \ intended recipient to the sender\n25\nand the original sender to the recipient\
    \ by unauthorized actors. To prevent this,\nthe exchange of data between two entities\
    \ should employ cryptographic protocols\nwhich can ensure secure communication.\
    \ Many public networks do not make use of\nencryption when exchanging data, this\
    \ endangers user data and can give access to\nunwanted persons to user information\
    \ [90]. Policies need to be devised to allow for\nsuitable data communication\
    \ standards for such networks while keeping the user as\nwell as commercial interests\
    \ in mind.\n3.5.2.2\nEavesdropping/Sniffing Attack\nEavesdropping refers to the\
    \ listening\nof data on the network. In eavesdropping an unauthorized entity joins\
    \ the network\nand can listen to the data that is being exchanged between the\
    \ devices on the network.\nTo avoid this, strategies include the use of authenticate\
    \ always protocols which initiate\nauthentication steps whenever devices need\
    \ to communicate with each other. This will\nensure that no unwanted users are\
    \ allowed access to network traffic to prevent such\nattacks. Moreover, industry\
    \ standard security protocols such as the Transport Layer\nSecurity (TLS), Wi-Fi\
    \ Protected Access 2 (WPA2) should be used for authenticating\nremote access.\
    \ Furthermore, remote sessions should have time-outs implemented to\nensure that\
    \ mistakes are not made by forgetful employees.\n3.5.2.3\nSide Channel Attack\n\
    Side Channel Attacks refer to the extraction\nof information by observing operation\
    \ characteristics of the implemented computer\nalgorithms or systems such as power\
    \ consumed, time taken, traffic analysis, fault\nanalysis, acoustic analysis [101].\
    \ Side Channel attacks don’t give nonpermitted parties\naccess to the data within\
    \ the network but may allow them to determine important\ninformation about the\
    \ system, such as the protocol used, or allow them to drop\npackets so as to degrade\
    \ performance of the network. One solution to counter network\ntraffic side channels\
    \ attacks is to saturate network bandwidth to prevent patterns\nfrom being observed.\
    \ Another popular method of preventing side channel attacks is\nto make use of\
    \ masking [102].\n3.5.2.4\nDenial of Service Attack\nDenial of Service (DOS) or\
    \ Distributed DOS\n(DDOS) attacks involve an entity getting access to the network\
    \ and using legitimate\nnodes within it to flood the target with unnecessary requests\
    \ to consume network\nbandwidth and degrade quality of service. With a smart city\
    \ depending on sensors\nto provide it with a ‘view’ of the city, DOS attacks can\
    \ make the smart city system\nblind which can lead to loss of property and life.\
    \ Countermeasures for DOS attacks\ninvolve anomaly detection by monitoring of\
    \ network data to check for any irregular\nbehavior. Artificial Intelligence has\
    \ found applications in this area as noted by [103],\nfor, e.g., it has been used\
    \ to identify abnormal data in smart grids [104] as well as\ndetecting attacks\
    \ [105, 106].\n3.5.2.5\nSpoofing Attack\nIn a spoofing attack, an attacker adds\
    \ itself to the\nnetwork by appearing to be a legitimate device on the network,\
    \ thereby allowing\nthem to send irregular or abnormal data to upset normal operation\
    \ of a smart city\n26\nsystem. Due to the varying nature and types of IoT devices\
    \ having different levels of\nbuilt-in security, spoofing is a particularly dangerous\
    \ attack for IoT systems. Methods\nto prevent spoofing are the use of cryptography,\
    \ hybrid encryption [107] as well as the\nuse of blockchain [108] to validate\
    \ data exchange and as well as authenticate devices.\n3.5.3\nPerception Layer\n\
    Perception layers attacks refer to physical attacks on an IoT based smart city\
    \ system.\nThis requires the physical presence of an attacker near the sensing\
    \ elements in an IoT\nsystem. We cover these attacks to provide a holistic assessment\
    \ of the security and\nprivacy issues in IoT Smart Cities. Tempering and Radio\
    \ Interference (jamming)\nare attacks which can affect the performance of smart\
    \ city systems. Tempering may\noccur during the development or the manufacturing\
    \ process while jamming can take\nplace due to a generation of radio frequencies\
    \ which interfere with the frequencies\nused by devices on the network to exchange\
    \ data. To circumvent this, policies may\nbe incorporated into software which\
    \ alert businesses and other Smart City partners\nto missing or abnormal data\
    \ from sensing devices.\n3.5.4\nSystem Wide Issues\n3.5.4.1\nData Leakage\nData\
    \ leakage refers to the unintentional conveyance of\ninformation about subjects\
    \ in smart cities. The many data sources in smart cities\nmay contain information\
    \ related to a user’s identity, health, quality of life etc. Smart\nCity application\
    \ managers use this data to improve their services and provide a bet-\nter user\
    \ experience, however, it is possible that this data might be shared with third\n\
    party entities. It is therefore necessary to anonymize data before such assignments\n\
    are taken. Data leakage can also take place when devices within a network perform\n\
    discovery tasks and may provide personal information to rogue nodes in the network.\n\
    In Smart Grids, power consumption data should be anonymized by considering the\n\
    data on a neighborhood level rather than on the individual level, moreover, systems\n\
    could be installed in homes using batteries to modify the demand response signal.\n\
    Data aggregation is an important tool in preserving individual privacy and preventing\n\
    data leakage. Moreover, data should be encrypted when sending it over the network\n\
    so that any unauthorized access is avoided. Another strategy would be to use data\n\
    minimization. Typically, sensors used in smart cities will gather data of less\
    \ ‘interest’\nin addition to data of interest. For, e.g., navigation systems many\
    \ times record loca-\ntion information even when not in use or video applications\
    \ such as facial recognition\nsystems typically record other activities apart\
    \ from being activated whenever a face is\nobserved in the video. This extra information\
    \ increases the risk of data leakage. Data\nminimization can be employed in such\
    \ cases to limit the data that is being gathered\non the user.\n3.5.4.2\nTrustworthiness\n\
    Apart from the technical steps that need to be taken\nto provide a secure usage\
    \ experience of smart city applications and to encourage its\nuse, it is important\
    \ that smart city users be provided clear policy guidelines to how\n27\nTable\

    \ of scalable, explainable AI\nTable 6.\n4.1\nStrengths\nIoT smart city strengths\
    \ are the fact that they provide an improved quality of life for\na city’s population\
    \ along with reduction of costs in terms of operation and also enable\ncities\
    \ to be sustainable. IoT enables sensors and devices to be deployed throughout\
    \ a\ncity to give an overview of the state of the city’s main functions such as\
    \ transportation\nsystems, electric, water and gas distribution as well as crime\
    \ monitoring to name\na few. This real time information helps city administration,\
    \ businesses and other\nstakeholders to provide better services to people, increase\
    \ the effectiveness of those\nservices and reduce the cost through efficient operation.\n\
    On the technical side, IoT data has made possible to use data analytics to gauge\n\
    various aspects of the multitude of services which are being provided in the city\
    \ as\nwell as to determine interactions between them and utilize that information\
    \ for better\ndecision making to make life easier for citizens. Furthermore, the\
    \ distributed nature\nof IoT systems and the flexible architectures which enable\
    \ fluidity through movement\nof sensing units is easily scalable thereby requiring\
    \ little additional cost to upgrade\nand expand currently deployed systems. Moreover,\
    \ this distributed architecture also\nmakes such systems very robust to faults\
    \ thereby increasing reliability of deployments\nand offering self-healing in\
    \ applications such as electricity systems.\n29\n4.2\nWeaknesses\nIoT in Smart\
    \ cities do suffer from some weaknesses in terms of technology, for, e.g.,\nthe\
    \ current deployment scenario has a myriad of different technologies relating\
    \ to\nnetworks, hardware platforms and software frameworks which do not often\
    \ work to-\ngether very well as discussed. Different standards’ bodies such as\
    \ the IETF, European\nTelecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), IEEE and\
    \ other organizations have\nbeen contributing with standards for communication,\
    \ network discovery, identifica-\ntion, management of devices etc. However, the\
    \ sheer number of ‘standards’ with\nmany of them not being compatible with each\
    \ other has not fully solved the inter-\noperability problem and this can cause\
    \ hurdles for expansion of IoT systems without\na significant overhaul of system\
    \ components. Another problem currently facing IoT\nsystems is the lack of data\
    \ policies and legislation. The concern here is that data\npolicies are not mature\
    \ enough to regulate how data is handled in IoT systems, as\nhas been discussed\
    \ previously. This is a major problem given the growing issue with\nuser data\
    \ privacy in a connected world.\n4.3\nOpportunities\nIoT in Smart cities presents\
    \ many opportunities to researchers and businesses alike\nin lieu of mitigating\
    \ the weaknesses and also in the provision of new city services.\nThe data gathered\
    \ by the sensors in IoT systems has the potential to provide a\nholistic overview\
    \ of the city’s state allowing for the use of big data algorithms to\ndevelop\
    \ new applications and services. For researchers in the data analytics domain,\n\
    this heterogenous data provides a wonderful opportunity for the development of\
    \ new\ndata science algorithms for service delivery. There is a large monetary\
    \ value towards\nthe development and usage of computationally cheap encryption\
    \ techniques, efficient\ndata storage methods and networking technologies to make\
    \ IoT deployment easier\nand cheaper.\nDevelopment of new sensor technologies\
    \ is another opportunity for\nresearchers in IoT for smart cities.\nThe development\
    \ of newer, efficient, low-cost\nsensors would aid to the creation of IoT services\
    \ and enable even wider usage.\n4.4\nThreats\nWith a connected system, there are\
    \ several threats that come with IoTs for Smart\nCities involving trust issues\
    \ among users, privacy concerns due to network attacks,\npotential data theft\
    \ etc. Privacy and security are the most important concerns of\nIoT applications,\
    \ with such a personalized interaction mechanism between people\nand devices as\
    \ is the case of smart cities, the risks for privacy breaches, data theft\nand\
    \ leakages are high and this is a constant concern for service users as well as\n\
    providers. Numerous attacks on Smart City systems have exposed the vulnerability\n\
    of this technology to cyber attacks and also demonstrated the consequences that\
    \ it\nhas on the population. Traditional security procedures and methods such\
    \ as access\nauthentication, routing and networking might not be enough or possible\
    \ in many IoT\ndeployments due to IoT devices typically not having sufficient\
    \ computing capabilities,\n30\nthis has exacerbated the privacy and security concerns\
    \ for IoT stakeholders. This can\nalso feed to a lack of trust by customers to\
    \ participate in smart city applications.\n5\nConclusions\nThis chapter presented\
    \ a broad coverage of the Internet of Things in Smart Cities.\nProviding a detailed\
    \ discussion of Smart Cities and its different domains, IoT was\npresented as\
    \ a vital enabler of smart city services and the various smart city architec-\n\
    tures and the challenges that are faced in the deployment of smart city applications\n\
    were deliberated upon. This was followed by a review of the sensing and networking\n\
    technologies used for such applications Finally, the security and privacy issues\
    \ faced\nby IoT based Smart Cities were discussed and a SWOT analysis is provided.\n\
    31\nCHAPTER III\nAI IN IOT SMART CITIES\n1\nIntroduction\nThis chapter provides\
    \ insight into different ways in which AI has been applied in\nthe IoT for Smart\
    \ Cities using the application of clustering, regression, classification\netc.\
    \ In addition, various applications, solutions and data used for implementing\
    \ the\noverall framework of Smart Cities are discussed in detail. along with the\
    \ types of\ndeployment used by these proposed approaches.\n2\nBig Data Algorithms/Artificial\
    \ Intelligence\nThe various sensors that make up the internet of things in a smart\
    \ city relay in-\nformation about the city’s state to the cloud. However, measuring\
    \ raw data is not\nenough, to utilize this data and to make the city ‘smart’,\
    \ data analysis is key. Data\nanalysis in smart cities has four layers, the first\
    \ is Data Acquisition, which deals with\nthe collection and storage of data, this\
    \ is followed by the Preprocessing layer which\nperforms operations (such as imputing\
    \ missing values, scaling, removing erroneous\ndata points etc.) on the data to\
    \ ensure that data is of suitable quality to be used for\nthe data analytics stage.\
    \ The data analytics stage involves the application of data\nscience techniques\
    \ on the data to extract patterns and insights which would be used\nfor policy\
    \ making, planning and other actions in the Service layer. In this section, we\n\
    focus our attention on the third stage of the data analysis process, i.e., data\
    \ analytics.\nData analytics in the Smart City based on the IoT involves the use\
    \ of Deep Learning\nand Machine Learning on the gathered data. The discussion\
    \ in this chapter considers\nthe following aspects of the use of AI (ML/DL) in\
    \ the IoT for smart cities:\n1. The type of application: This refers to the aim\
    \ of the application.\n2. Algorithm/Network: This refers to the algorithm being\
    \ used to perform the\ntask and can be any of the ML/DL algorithms covered.\n\
    3. System Architecture: System architecture refers to the IoT architecture pro-\n\
    posed for the covered work. This can be Cloud, Fog or Edge.\n4. Task: This refers\
    \ to the type of machine learning task being performed. This can\nbe classification,\
    \ clustering or regression. In this category, a brief description is\nalso presented\
    \ about what quantities/outcomes are being worked with.\n32\n5. Data Type: This\
    \ refers to the type of data being used. Data can be of two\ntypes, heterogeneous\
    \ or homogeneous. Heterogeneous refers to the use of data\nof different modalities\
    \ whereas homogenous refers to a single modality being\nused. The aim of providing\
    \ this information is to capture the complexity of the\ndata involved in an application.\n\
    2.1\nMachine Learning\nMachine learning (ML) has been a crucial element of smart\
    \ city application develop-\nment [109], helping in prediction (classification),\
    \ estimation (regression) and cluster-\ning tasks. Machine learning refers to\
    \ the set of approaches through which computers\ncan be used to learn from empirical\
    \ data [110] and has been used in smart cities\nin various applications. Since\
    \ there has been a lot of work in this area using ML\nalgorithms, we focus on\
    \ work in the last few years. It was found that most commonly\nused ML algorithms\
    \ have been the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forests\n(RF), Decision Tree\
    \ (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), K-Means, K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN)\nand Logistic Regression\
    \ (LR).\n2.2\nDeep Learning\nDeep learning is the use of successive layers of\
    \ Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to\nlearn patterns. The idea is that successive\
    \ non-linear layers of interconnected artificial\nneurons can be used to learn\
    \ patterns in data that simple machine learning algorithms\nmight not be able\
    \ to do. Deep learning architectures can process noisy data to provide\noutput\
    \ for classification and prediction tasks. This makes them very useful in the\n\
    Smart City environment where the IoT enables the collection of heterogeneous sensor\n\
    data which can be of varying nature. Data derived from sensors can be processed\
    \ to\nextract features or can be fed directly to deep learning algorithms which\
    \ can perform\nboth feature extraction as well as classification/prediction. Deep\
    \ Learning methods\nsuch as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)(Long Short-Term Machines\
    \ (LSTM) and\nGated Recurrent Units (GRU)), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),\
    \ Deep Neural\nNetworks (DNN) and Stacked Autoencoder Networks (SAE) were the\
    \ preferred deep\nlearning methodologies used for smart city applications and\
    \ our discussion revolves\naround the utilization of these methods.\n3\nAI Applications\
    \ for Smart Cities\nIn this section, the applications for of AI in smart cities\
    \ have been discussed, we also\nmention the kind of deployment as well as the\
    \ nature of data utilized to achieve their\ntask.\n3.1\nSmart Agriculture\nThe\
    \ major applications of AI in IoT for agriculture are crop monitoring/disease\
    \ de-\ntection and data driven crop care and decision making. Considering the\
    \ scarcity of\n33\nwater, the authors in [111, 112, 113] develop irrigation systems\
    \ which monitor and\ncontrol the amount of water being used for crops, all structured\
    \ around a cloud com-\nputing system. This problem has been devised both as a\
    \ classification as well as a\nregression problem as in [114], who develop a closed\
    \ loop water irrigation system using\nsupport vector regression and K-Means clustering.\
    \ The authors in [115, 116] propose\ncloud based greenhouse monitoring systems\
    \ using images and a host of physical pa-\nrameters from plants such as temperature,\
    \ humidity and light using several machine\nand deep learning methods. Plant disease\
    \ detection is also an important task within\nsmart agriculture and has been worked\
    \ on by the authors in [117, 118, 119, 120] who\npresent schemes for disease detection\
    \ for various crops including tomatoes and pota-\ntoes. The proliferation of sensing\
    \ systems in agricultural fields has also provided an\navenue for data driven\
    \ decision making and planning for farmers. This involves pre-\ndicting various\
    \ physical parameters which can affect crop growth like solar radiance\n[121]\
    \ and temperature, humidity, windspeed [122, 123, 124, 125, 126] to help in deci-\n\
    sion making in terms of plant care but also classification systems for recommending\n\
    crops to be sown [127, 128]. It is important to note that all of these implementations\n\
    are cloud based.\nThere have been some suggested methodologies for bringing fog\
    \ processing for AI\nin smart agriculture, for, e.g., in [129] a deep learning\
    \ entrusted to fog nodes (DLEFN)\nalgorithm is described to support efficient\
    \ use of resources and reduce cloud resource\nusage. However, as noted in [130],\
    \ who use an edge system for temperature prediction\nusing an LSTM, edge device\
    \ performance still lacks that of similar cloud systems but\nthe inclusion of\
    \ DL capable hardware does provide opportunities for further innova-\ntions. Previous\
    \ work by the same author [131], where they aimed to monitor crops\nfor frost\
    \ signs and trigger anti-frost measures, compared edge and cloud computing\nsystems\
    \ for outlier detection and determined that cloud implementations to provide\n\
    much better performance. However, they do note the potential for edge systems\
    \ to\nprovide highly responsive data analytics in smart agriculture. More applications\
    \ can\nbe envisaged for AI deployment in smart agriculture, for, e.g., monitoring\
    \ of crop\ngrowth, selection of the fertilizer and the timeline for it to be used\
    \ as well as targeted\napplication, pest detection and intelligent pesticide spraying\
    \ so as to reduce harm to\nthe environment, environmental monitoring to track\
    \ the effects of climate change and\nmore. Some of these applications have potential\
    \ to be deployed as edge computing\nsystems. A summary of the use of IoT based\
    \ AI in Smart Agriculture is presented in\nTable 7.\n3.2\nSmart City Services\n\
    A popular component of smart city initiatives is the management of waste and involves\n\
    having bins equipped with sensors and connected to the cloud to not only inform\
    \ the\nrelevant authorities of the need to empty them but also using AI to determine\
    \ the\nbest route to reduce fuel consumption. The use of IoT systems for waste\
    \ management\nhas been observed in the works of [133] who utilize IoT systems\
    \ to help reduce energy\nwastage in waste collection by municipalities. Hussain\
    \ et al. [134] develop a waste\nmanagement system that not only determines if\
    \ bins are full and need collecting\n34\nTable 7. AI use for Smart Agriculture\n\

    \ air quality\naround it using RNNs. The sensing modalities in each of these applications\
    \ is pretty\nsimilar in that they indicate to whether a waste bin is full or not\
    \ which is then\nused for route planning. Considering the requirements of such\
    \ a system, in terms\nof implementation, all of these systems are cloud based.\
    \ Sewer monitoring has been\nperformed in [135] in a cloud based system, they\
    \ use sewer water level and rain gauge\ndata along with a RNN to perform sewer\
    \ overflow monitoring. The RNN is used to\npredict sewer overflow ahead in time.\
    \ Water quality has monitoring has been the focus\nof [136, 137, 138] where the\
    \ authors use multiple sensors measuring pH value, chloride,\nnitrate content\
    \ and hardness of water to determine whether it is fit for drinking or\nnot. In\
    \ [139], Liu et al. use data from water monitoring stations along the Yangtze\n\
    river to predict water quality. Like the classification-based systems, they use\
    \ multiple\nchemical measurements from the water such as oxygen, pH, turbidity\
    \ etc. Apart from\nair quality, smart city monitoring systems are an important\
    \ application within the\nsmart city services domain. This includes urban noise,\
    \ which has been the focus of\nresearchers in [140, 141] as well as other more\
    \ comprehensive monitoring systems as\nproposed in [142, 143]. All these systems\
    \ are cloud based and use a combination\nof sensors for sound and/or image data\
    \ for performing noise monitoring/detection\nand various smart city dashboard\
    \ applications. In Table 8, we summarize the type\nof deployments, applications\
    \ task and data for smart city services applications. It\nis noted that most of\
    \ the applications relating to city services such as air quality\nmonitoring and\
    \ prediction, sewer monitoring, waste collection have been proposed as\ncloud\
    \ systems as data needs to be collected from nodes at various points in a city.\n\
    It is envisaged that due to the nature of the applications, many smart city services\n\
    would still rely on cloud or fog architectures as the decision-making taking place\
    \ in\nsuch situations isn’t possible on only a local level. It is also observed\
    \ that most of the\napplications required data from multiple sensors and therefore\
    \ utilized heterogeneous\ndata to carry out the task at hand.\n3.3\nSmart Energy\n\
    Load/energy consumption forecasting is an essential task for monitoring and control\n\
    of electrical power supply in the electricity grid and ensure appropriate demand\
    \ side\nmanagement. It has been performed by the authors of [148] who use data\
    \ collected\nfrom consumers in a smart grid to determine load for up to 24 h in\
    \ advance. They treat\nthis as primarily a clustering problem where they form\
    \ clusters of similar load profiles\nand then use distance functions to determine\
    \ energy consumption for the future. The\nauthors in [149] also use a cloud based\
    \ clustering approach, using historical power\ndata, they use K-Means clustering\
    \ to determine the closest historical records and then\ncombine them to predict\
    \ energy consumption 24 h in advance. The load forecasting\nproblem has been dealt\
    \ as a regression by [150] using a SVM and by [151] through an\nRNN using electricity\
    \ power data. A regression approach is also followed by [152, 153]\nwho use electricity\
    \ consumption in addition to environmental data for load forecasting\nusing deep\
    \ learning methods (DNN and a combination of Autoencoders and RNNs\n(GRU)). Edge\
    \ based systems have been suggested by the authors of [154, 155, 156]\n36\nTable\

    \ The authors in [157] use decision trees in a cloud\nbased system to classify\
    \ between different faults in a smart grid. In [158], the authors\nuse power consumption\
    \ data from consumers in China to determine electricity theft\nin a cloud based\

    \ two major applications of IoT with AI in health, these are activity recog-\n\
    nition/fall detection and disease diagnosis/health monitoring, a summary of the\
    \ IoT\nbased AI systems used in Smart Health is presented in Table 10. Activity\
    \ recog-\nnition involves the use of movement sensors such as accelerometers,\
    \ gyroscopes and\nmagnetometers with the aim to help provide the user with feedback\
    \ on their health.\nThis can be in terms of them having enough physical exercise\
    \ or not, used for sports\ntherapy, fall detection and for monitoring of different\
    \ diseases such as Parkinson’s or\nother motor degenerative ailments. The most\
    \ popular sensor for activity recognition\nare inertial sensors which have been\
    \ used by [160, 161] in a cloud based setting using\nvarious deep and machine\
    \ learning algorithms. In [162], Castro et al. include vital\nsign data in addition\
    \ to movement information for human activity recognition in a\ncloud environment,\
    \ they utilize the DT as their classifier. In [163],, the authors pro-\npose an\
    \ edge-based system to perform activity recognition for people by recording\n\
    their movements using the accelerometer and gyroscope present on the phone. They\n\
    use a SVM as their classifier and differentiate between six different activities\
    \ of daily\nliving. Fall detection has been performed by [164, 165] in a fog and\
    \ edge environment,\nrespectively, using an accelerometer, Santos et al. [164]\
    \ use a CNN while Yacchirema\net al. [165] useRFCwith both approaches showing\
    \ promising results.\nEquipped with the power of AI in IoT, Smart Health systems\
    \ facilitate the provi-\nsion of telehealth services as well as real time monitoring\
    \ of patients, giving doctors\nand patients feedback on their health.\nHealth\
    \ monitoring systems and real time\ndisease diagnosis have been one of the most\
    \ important applications of IoT technol-\nogy. The authors in [166, 167, 168,\
    \ 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176] develop\ncloud based health monitoring\
    \ systems for detecting various types of diseases, such\n38\nas heart (stroke\
    \ [167], irregular sound [169], irregular rhythm [171, 173]), epilep-\ntic seizures\
    \ [172], Parkinson seizure [176] and multiple disease diagnosis systems\n[174,\
    \ 175]. In [174, 175], the authors formulate the problem of disease diagnosis\
    \ as\na classification problem and utilize medical data such as ECGs, EEG, heart\
    \ rate,\nblood pressure, blood sugar, heart sound, blood glucose, liver health\
    \ along with var-\nious machine and deep learning methods to achieve this task.\
    \ Fog and edge based\nhealth monitoring/disease diagnosis systems have also been\
    \ suggested by a number\nof researchers. The authors in [177] present a fog based\
    \ system using a deep neural\nnetwork to detect heart disease from a patients\
    \ vital signs (blood oxygen, heart rate,\nrespiration rate, EEG, ECG, EMG, blood\
    \ pressure, glucose) and activity data. In\n[178], Devarajan & Ravi work on a\
    \ fog computing based Parkinson detection system\nusing a persons speech. Moreover,\
    \ an edge computing system is presented in [179]\nwhich utilizes EEG signals to\
    \ determine seizures in patients.\nTable 10. AI use for Smart Health\nApplication\n\

    \ (EEG)\n39\n3.5\nSmart Homes\nAmbient assisted living is a huge component of\
    \ Smart Homes.\nThis is especially\nneeded for the elderly and is typically achieved\
    \ by the use of ambient sensors, Wi-Fi\nand radio frequency systems in smart homes.\
    \ In this work, we include all monitoring\nmethods that depend on sensors placed\
    \ in the home/within the smart home domain.\nIn [182], Pirzada et al. use a network\
    \ of reed switches connected to the cloud to\nmonitor the activities of elderly\
    \ people as a clustering problem. They use the K-\nNN algorithm to determine anomalies\
    \ in the daily activities which can then be used\nto send medical or other help\
    \ requests to assist people. A similar setup for activity\nrecognition for ambient\
    \ assisted living has been presented in [183, 184, 185] where they\nuse data from\
    \ a number of different sensors including motion, presence, water float,\ntemperature\
    \ etc to determine various activities being performed in a home. In [186],\na\
    \ cloud based assisted living system for the deaf has been developed that performs\n\
    haptic conversions for sounds detected in a home. An array of sensors are used\
    \ to\nmonitor environmental sound and the authors use RNNs for detecting the sound\n\
    event before its passed on to the haptic vibration producer. Another task within\n\
    in monitoring is localization of people, this part of smart homes is also applicable\n\
    to smart infrastructure in that such systems are used in smart buildings as well.\n\
    Applications of localization include security, i.e., detecting unauthorized presence\n\
    and people monitoring in general (for, e.g., locating elderly people in homes)\
    \ etc.\nThe authors in [187] perform localization using a grid of Wi-Fi units\
    \ that measure\nsignal strength to determine peoples locations indoors for buildings.\
    \ They formulate\nthis both as a classification problem as well as a regression\
    \ problem. The classification\nproblem being formulated as coded locations (for,\
    \ e.g., a given room no) while the\nregression case estimating the location of\
    \ the user in a coordinate grid. Their system is\ncloud based and they use a deep\
    \ neural network to perform this task and have found\nsuitably good results. Occupancy\
    \ detection has been performed by the authors of\n[188] making use of various\
    \ ambient measurements (temperature, humidity, pressure\netc.) and passing them\
    \ to a cloud before using a deep neural network to classify\nbetween the various\
    \ number of people present in an indoor environment. In [189],\nZimmermann et\
    \ al. also make use of ambient sensors for the occupancy problem and\nuse a na¨ıve\
    \ bayes learner to determine both the presence of occupants as well as their\n\
    number.\nHome automation is another application that the IoT finds application\n\
    within the Smart Home domain. The integration of AI has helped develop smart\n\
    home automation systems that aim to reduce energy consumption in homes as well\n\
    as maintain user privacy, security. Chowdhry et al. [190] use a combination of\
    \ visual\ndata and motion sensing to perform home automation for security using\
    \ a SVM.\nAn interesting use of AI in home automation is presented in [191] who\
    \ develop a\ncloud based home automation system, they take measurements from various\
    \ ambient\nsensors and control appliances and use a Na¨ıve Bayes classifier to\
    \ determine which\ntechnician to call whenever sensor measurements appear aberrated.\
    \ The problem of\nintelligent consumption of energy has been considered by [192]\
    \ who develop an energy\ndisaggregation system on the appliance level in smart\
    \ homes using stacked denoising\nautoencoders. They achieve this using power data\
    \ for individual appliances as well\n40\nas the total power consumed in the home\
    \ and send it to a local cloud. Data is then\ndisaggregated for various appliances\
    \ to provide feedback to the user.\nMore work\nproviding energy intelligence to\
    \ consumers has been performed by [193, 194, 195].\nKonstantakopoulos et al. [195]\
    \ pose this as a regression problem, they propose a\ncloud-based system utilizing\
    \ both ambient sensor data (lighting, temperature etc)\nand appliance power data\
    \ to forecast resource usage for consumers using a RNN.\nThey show a reduction\
    \ in energy consumption for their users using this information.\nEventhough applications\
    \ covered in smart homes have been cloud based systems,\nthere have been recent\
    \ proposals for frameworks that combine edge and cloud pro-\ncessing as in [196]\
    \ who discuss a hierarchical control system for smart homes through\na edge microgrid\
    \ and a cloud power grid. Due to the nature of smart homes in that\nthe sensing\
    \ scheme is present within a finite space (within the home), edge and fog\ncomputing\
    \ based systems are expected to be increasingly incorporated smart home\napplications.\
    \ A summary of the use of IoT based AI in Smart Homes is presented in\nTable 11.\n\
    3.6\nSmart Industry\nOne of the major applications of AI in the IoT powered smart\
    \ industry is towards\nfault detection in products and anomaly detection in industrial\
    \ processes. This has\nseen the use of both Machine Learning (SVM [197, 198],RFC[199,\
    \ 200]) as well as\nDeep Learning (DNN [201, 202, 203], CNN [204]) methods using\
    \ a cloud computing\nstructure to perform anomaly detection/product inspection\
    \ and monitoring using a\nvariety of heterogeneous and homogenous data sources\
    \ such as inertial sensors for ma-\nchines, images for products and processes\
    \ and other process specific variables. Other\napproaches suggested in [205, 206]\
    \ propose a fog computing method along with edge\ncomputing systems suggested\
    \ in [207, 208]. An edge computing system for anomaly\ndetection is presented\
    \ in [209] where edge devices collaboratively train a deep anomaly\ndetection\
    \ model. Production management is another application that has found usage\nof\
    \ AI in IoT based smart Industry. For, e.g., the authors in [210, 211, 212, 213,\
    \ 214]\nuse cloud based data driven systems along with machine and deep learning\
    \ algorithms\nto help with task dispatching, performance analysis as well as worker\
    \ activity recog-\nnition utilizing a variety of sensing modalities. The work\
    \ of [213, 214] are especially\ninteresting as they aim is to not only perform\
    \ production management but also pro-\npose data for various health related analysis\
    \ to create a safer working environment\non the factory floor. A fog system for\
    \ production management has been presented in\n[215] who use activity data to\
    \ determine resource allocation locations to contribute\nto management of a production\
    \ operation. Furthermore, product inspection, which\nis a common application of\
    \ instrumentation systems in a factory, has been performed\nby [216, 217] who\
    \ utilize images and sensor data in a cloud based system to monitor\nproduct quality.\n\
    A factory has a multitude of machines and equipment working round the clock\n\
    manufacturing goods. Maintenance is an important aspect of this operation where\n\
    regular checks are performed on the equipment to ensure that no breakdown occurs\n\
    during the production process, which might result in monetary loss or loss of\
    \ life.\n41\nTable 11. AI use for Smart Homes\nApplication\nNetwork\nSystem\n\

    \ with the data gathered by various sensors on these machines, it is often\nmore\
    \ beneficial to take an active approach rather than a passive one by using this\n\
    data for predictive maintenance purposes. Predictive maintenance utilizes data\
    \ from\nthe daily operation of machines in an industry to optimize the manufacturing\
    \ op-\neration [218] and is one of the main uses for AI in the industry. In [219,\
    \ 220], the\nauthors suggest a predictive maintenance scheme using SVMs utilizing\
    \ data from ac-\ncelerometers measuring vibration in a crane motor and data from\
    \ various sources in\na semiconductor manufacturing process, respectively, both\
    \ work in a cloud environ-\nment as evidenced from the architecture. Prediction\
    \ of failure can also be a regression\noperation, as was demonstrated by [221]\
    \ who use RNNs to predict future values of\na physical parameters of a pump using\
    \ a number of heterogeneous sensors used to\nmonitor it. As with the other two\
    \ systems, this system also had a cloud architecture.\nThe authors in [170] also\
    \ present a regression based health prognosis system for the\nindustry using a\
    \ CNN on machine data (Images, stress, temperature, vibration, po-\n42\nsition\
    \ and electromagnetic signal measurements). The use of IoT based AI in Smart\n\
    Industry has been presented in Table 12.\n3.7\nSmart Infrastructure\nAn application\
    \ within smart infrastructures also involves monitoring of civil structures\n\
    for structural health. The authors in [222] take a clustering approach to perform\n\
    health monitoring of a bridge using vibration data in a cloud setting.\nThey use\n\
    clustering to determine clusters of abnormal behavior in accelerometer measurements\n\
    from a bridge. In [223, 224, 225], accelerometer signals have been used where\
    \ as [226]\nhave used piezo electric transducers for performing structural health\
    \ monitoring of\nbridges formulated as a classification problem between different\
    \ damaged states of\na bridge. The prime sensing modality for monitoring has been\
    \ measuring vibration\nusing accelerometers, however, other sensors such as fiber\
    \ optic gratings can also be\nused to measure stress.\nThe second avenue for AI\
    \ applications in IoT for smart infrastructure is the use\nof IoT devices for\
    \ building environment control and energy management as well com-\nfort aware\
    \ control. This involves the prediction of building energy usage based on\nenvironmental\
    \ data (such as temperature, humidity) and electrical power data. The\nauthors\
    \ in [227] and [228] use electric power data and heat flow information in a\n\
    building to predict the energy requirements in the future so as to better manage\
    \ en-\nergy consumption. Ambience control of a museum has been performed in [229]\
    \ where\nthe authors use deep learning algorithms to predict the CO2 and humidity\
    \ levels\nfor the care of exhibits. Comfort aware energy management has been performed\
    \ in\n[230] where the authors use a CNN to regulate thermal comfort in a building\
    \ using\nvarious physical quantities. It can be noted that all of these mentioned\
    \ systems have\nbeen deployed in the cloud, this is due to the nature of the application.\
    \ However,\nthere have been efforts for developing fog/edge systems for smart\
    \ infrastructure. The\nauthors in [231] describe a framework for deploying edge\
    \ and fog computing services\nin smart buildings and demonstrate their systems\
    \ effectiveness for the case of energy\nmanagement. Table 13 summarizes the use\
    \ of IoT based AI in Smart Infrastructure.\n3.8\nSmart Transport\nMajor smart\
    \ transportation applications involve smart parking and transportation\nmanagement.\
    \ Smart parking aims to solve the problem of helping users finding park-\ning\
    \ spots in order to save time as well as reduce gas emissions and is therefore\
    \ a much-\nresearched topic for AI deployment towards smart transportation. Solutions\
    \ to this\nproblem have been formulated both as a regression problem as well as\
    \ a classification\none, both utilizing imaging and/or other occupancy sensing\
    \ modalities. Regression\nsolutions [232, 233, 234] are typically used to predict\
    \ a parking lots occupancy levels\nin the future whereas classification systems\
    \ [235, 236, 237] involve guiding drivers ac-\ncording to the shortest distance\
    \ as well as used for user localization purposes within\nsuch lots. In addition\
    \ to cloud based approaches, edge computing systems for smart\nparking have also\
    \ been devised as suggested in [238, 239] who deploy CNNs on edge\n43\nTable 12.\

    Regression - Comfort level\ndevices for occupancy detection and user localization,\
    \ respectively. Another applica-\ntion of AI IoT for smart transportation involves\
    \ determining traffic flow as well as\nprediction of traffic flow for traffic\
    \ light control and other management tasks such as\naccident detection. In this\
    \ regard, video cameras are popular for detection of vehicle\ndensity on roads\
    \ for traffic congestion determination. However, with most cars having\na GPS\
    \ device and the commonality of cellphones with every driver, many approaches\n\
    use the data from the GPS along with weather and generic traffic flow information\n\
    to determine traffic prediction. The nature of traffic flow prediction using sensing\n\
    modalities such as GPS require systems to be operated as cloud-based systems as\n\
    is the case in [240, 241, 242, 243]. Of these, Wangyang et al. [242] and Xiao\
    \ et al.\n[243] use deep learning based sequential modeling approaches to predict\
    \ traffic flow\nahead of time where as Aung & Naing [240] and Yunxiang Liu & Wu\
    \ [241] solve this\nthrough a classification formulation. A traffic management\
    \ system for public buses\nhas been proposed in [33, 244] where GPS data is used\
    \ to predict bus arrival times\nfor public transportation systems. Accident detection\
    \ has been performed using car\nposition and velocity information in a Vehicular\
    \ Adhoc NETworks (VANET) envi-\nronment by the authors of [245]. They do this\
    \ through a cloud based system that\ncan use this information to predict whether\
    \ an accident has occurred or not. Apart\nfrom typical sensing modalities, with\
    \ smart phones and user participation in social\nmedia, smart transportation systems\
    \ are expected to increasingly include more sens-\ning modalities [246] fused\
    \ together for use in decision making for traffic management\npurposes. Mukherji\
    \ et al. [247] use Wi-Fi signals to determine commuter traffic a\nsubway station.\
    \ They do this by using the measured signal strength of the Wi-Fi\nsignals along\
    \ with a Random Forest classifier in a cloud-based setting. Their system\nis able\
    \ to determine if a person is on the train or on the platform which can be used\n\
    to help with planning train times and routes. A summary of IoT based AI for Smart\n\

    This chapter presents a coverage of combinatorial optimization in IoT based smart\n\
    cities by deliberating on the most popular applications of optimization algorithms\n\
    and providing an insight to how those problems are formulated and worked upon.\
    \ It\nprovides a mapped overview of the optimization landscape in the smart city\
    \ domain\nwhile considering the IoT. Through this mapping, the common optimization\
    \ problems\nacross the various components of the IoT enabled smart city have been\
    \ identified. For\neach problem discussed, the objective function used, the nature\
    \ of the objective as\nwell as the constraints considered have also been elaborated\
    \ on.\n2\nOptimization and Heuristics in IoT Smart Cities\nAs has been observed\
    \ by [249], combinatorial optimization problems in the real-world\nare known to\
    \ be difficult to formulate and generally are hard to solve. Moreover,\nchoosing\
    \ the right algorithm is also a tedious task as each comes with a different\n\
    set of characterizations. This is very applicable to the IoT bases smart city\
    \ where\napplications in each component caters to a different environment and\
    \ aspect of the\ncity’s operation and therefore requires intricate design of the\
    \ problem. This chapter\ntakes guidance from the work of [249]. They note that\
    \ the most popular algorithms for\nuse in combinatorial optimization problems\
    \ are the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO),\nGenetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm\
    \ Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution\n(DE) and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC).\
    \ Moreover, following from their discussion, six\nfactors are considered for each\
    \ application identified. These are:\n1. The type of application: This refers\
    \ to the problem being optimized within the\nsmart city domain.\n2. Data Setup:\
    \ For each application, we mention the data setup used. While doing\nso, we aim\
    \ to capture the various ways in which researchers have sourced data\nfor their\
    \ proposed method.\n3. Single-Parallel problems: Another thing to note in smart\
    \ city optimization\nproblems is whether a problem has been considered as a single\
    \ problem or\nmultiple sub-problems/parallel.\n4. Objective direction, function\
    \ and number of objectives: Maximization or mini-\nmization, lowest fitness function\
    \ value desirable or higher fitness function value\n49\nis desirable.\nSince we\
    \ list the objectives, we also covere the number of ob-\njectives inherently.\
    \ Single objective, where a single fitness is optimized for its\nbest value or\
    \ multi-objective where multiple objective functions need to be con-\nsidered\
    \ at the same time. The latter is a complex process as some objectives\nmay have\
    \ conflicts and thus requires the need to perform trade-offs with what’s\nacceptable.\n\
    5. Constraints: Constraints are a set of restrictions or prerequisites that may\n\
    sometimes be necessary to determine if a solution is considered valid or not.\n\
    Soft constraints are desirable but not necessary whereas hard constraints are\n\
    mandatory to be met. Constraints are put on the fitness function according to\n\
    application being considered. Covering this aspect is particularly important as\n\
    constraints are determined by the application being worked on.\n3\nMeheuristic\
    \ Algorithms\nMetaheuristic algorithms are widely used to solve combinatorial\
    \ optimziation prob-\nlems in the real-world [249]. The aim of these algorithms\
    \ is to determine the minima\nor maxima of an objective function which translates\
    \ an optimization objective in to\none or more mathematical equations. Five algorithms\
    \ have been considered in this\nchapter, these are the Ant Colony Algorithm, Genetic\
    \ Algorithm, Particle Swarm Op-\ntimization Algorithm, Differential Evolution\
    \ and Artificial Bee Colony. As mentioned\nearlier, these have been chosen as\
    \ these were the most commonly used optimzation\nalgorithms identified by [249].\
    \ In this section, we provide a brief intuitive description\nfor each of them.\n\
    3.1\nAnt Colony Optimization\nAnt colony optimization is derived from the behavior\
    \ of ants searching for food\n[250]. It was observed that during this process,\
    \ each ant deposits a chemical called\npheromone on the path which it takes towards\
    \ the food. The more the ants take a\ngiven path, the more the pheromone is deposited\
    \ on it. Subsequent ants that want\nto go towards the food use the amount of pheromone\
    \ on a given path or sub-path\nto decide which path to take so as to determine\
    \ the optimal route to the food. In\nthe artificial ant colony optimization algorithm,\
    \ the points on the path that form the\nsub-paths are encoded on a graph where\
    \ each ant can only visit a given vertex (travel\non the same sub-path) once.\
    \ Each iteration starts with a number of artificial ants,\nan ant would choose\
    \ the next vertex to visit based on the level of pheromone on the\npossible sub-paths\
    \ available to it as well as whether that path has been used before.\nAt the end\
    \ of each iteration, the pheromone levels are updated so as to prioritize the\n\
    use of the most used path for ants in the next iteration.\n3.2\nGenetic Algorithm\n\
    A genetic algorithm [251] is based on evolutionary science. The idea behind the\
    \ ge-\nnetic algorithm is that starting from a given population set of organisms,\
    \ subsequent\n50\nreproduction will result in fitter organisms being produced\
    \ given that the organisms\nchosen for reproduction have some level of fitness.\
    \ To solve an optimization prob-\nlem, a genetic algorithm begins with a given\
    \ population size of strings also called\na chromosome. Each ‘chromosome’ consists\
    \ of a ‘gene’ which may represent points\nin the population. The sequence in which\
    \ the genes are present would represent a\nsolution to the problem. For e.g. for\
    \ a route scheduling problem, this may be the\ncoordinates of the stops. The ‘goodness’\
    \ of a chromosome is determined by a fitness\nfunction that quantifies how appropriate\
    \ a given chromosome is as a solution for the\nproblem. Choosing the right fitness\
    \ function is an important consideration in genetic\nalgorithms as it needs to\
    \ gauge the kind of optimization that is to be performed.\nThe optimization process\
    \ starts with an initial population of a given size. Once a fit-\nness function\
    \ has been defined, in each iteration, two or more chromosomes (parents)\nare\
    \ taken at random from the population and one or more offsprings are generated.\n\
    The random selection takes the selected parents fitness function value in to account,\n\
    however, its necessary that not all parents chosen are the fittest of the population\
    \ as\notherwise, diversity will be compromised, and the algorithm may get stuck\
    \ in a local\nminimum. The method by which these offspring are generated is called\
    \ the Crossover\nfunction and the number of parents mated to form offsprings from\
    \ them depends\non the crossover rate. The Crossover function defines the way\
    \ the genes within the\nchromosomes are exchanged. Usually, the crossover rate\
    \ has a high value. Moreover,\ndepending on some mutation rate, a given fraction\
    \ of all offsprings are mutated. Mu-\ntation depends on the mutation function\
    \ used and involves members of the offspring\nbeing swapped in some manner. When\
    \ one iteration of the offspring creation from\nthe parents in the entire population\
    \ is completed, the offsprings replace members of\nthe original population (typically\
    \ the weakest) and one generation of the GA is said\nto be completed. In order\
    \ to converge to a sufficiently good result, GA’s need to run\nfor many generations.\n\
    3.3\nParticle Swarm Optimization\nParticle Swarm Optimization is modeled on the\
    \ social behavior of animals rather than\nthe evolutionary biological behavior\
    \ on which Genetic Algorithms are based. PSO\n[252] is particularly based on the\
    \ behavior of a flock of birds searching for food. Each\nbird in the flock searches\
    \ for food and can communicate with other birds in the flock\nas soon as it finds\
    \ food or a good direction for it. Therefore, each bird has two food\n‘directions’\
    \ that it needs to consider, first is on an individual level which is called\n\
    the personal best and the second is on the flock level which is the global best.\
    \ Using\nthese two values the bird will proceed towards that path and will inform\
    \ other birds\nin the flock too. The idea here is that after enough time and with\
    \ all the individuals\nworking together, the swarm will find the place with the\
    \ highest concentration of\nfood. In terms of using PSO for optimization tasks,\
    \ individual birds are equivalent\nto a solution as in a GA and each is considered\
    \ as a point or a particle, collectively\nthey make up the swarm. This swarm population\
    \ may be initialized randomly or\nbased on some domain knowledge about the problem.\
    \ The highest concentration of\nfood represents the optimal solution for the whole\
    \ swarm where as a good direction\n51\nrepresents the local optimal solution for\
    \ each case. The aim here, like birds in a flock\nis to determine the global optimal\
    \ solution using information from each individual\nparticle. Each particle has\
    \ three aspects to it, its position, its velocity and a value of\nits current\
    \ position’s ’goodness’. This ’goodness’ as in the GA is defined by a fitness\n\
    function. Like birds, each particle has a personal best fitness value and is also\
    \ aware\nof the global best fitness value. For any particle, the new direction\
    \ of movement is\ndecided by a combination of the personal best and the global\
    \ best as well as the\nparticle’s intention to maintain its current movement.\
    \ Furthermore, several different\ntopologies can be utilized, and a neighborhood\
    \ can also be set for each particle to\nconvey positions when limiting the global\
    \ best parameter to the local best scheme\nrather than the whole swarm. The algorithm\
    \ may be stopped till the best solution is\nreached or no more improvement is\
    \ observed.\n3.4\nDifferential Evolution\nDifferential evolution [253] is a stochastic\
    \ evolutionary algorithm which is used for\noptimization problems for continuous\
    \ functions. The DE algorithm does not expect\ngradient information and thus it\
    \ doesn’t need to be differentiable. Like other evolu-\ntionary algorithms, a\
    \ solution is searched for in the design space by maintaining a\nset of individual\
    \ candidate solutions. In each iteration, the solutions with the best\nfitness\
    \ are combined together and retained for the next iteration. The aim is to im-\n\
    prove upon the fitness value and this process is repeated until a pre-decided\
    \ condition\nfor termination of this process is satisfied. Differential Evolution\
    \ is very similar to\nGenetic Algorithms in that both are evolutionary in nature,\
    \ however, the difference\nis that the DE uses real numbers in the chromosome\
    \ and also that the mutation oper-\nation consists of the difference between two\
    \ or more chromosomes of the population\nwith the possible addition of some type\
    \ of noise to create a new individual. Like\nGA, DE also suffer from getting stuck\
    \ in local minima. The DE algorithm also has\nthree control parameters, the population\
    \ size, the mutation factor and the crossover\nprobability.\n3.5\nArtificial Bee\
    \ Colony\nArticle Bee Colony [254] is a swarm intelligence algorithm based on\
    \ the behavior of\nbees. Within bees, there are different social classes who work\
    \ together to complete\ntasks such as harvesting pollen and nesting through the\
    \ use of smell, ’swing dance’\nand other methods. Bee colonies consist of three\
    \ types of bees, queen, male and\nthe worker bees which work on activities such\
    \ as searching for food, gathering and\nstorage of honey.\nAfter gathering honey,\
    \ the worker bee comes to the nest and\ninforms other bees about the location\
    \ of the honey source site through a dance. The\nABC algorithm simulates the behavior\
    \ of bees by considering three elements, the\nfood source, employed bees and unemployed\
    \ bees. The food source is represented as\nrevenue considering its distance and\
    \ quality, the higher the revenue, the better is the\nvalue. In computational\
    \ optimization terms, the food source is a potential solution\nto the objective\
    \ formulation of the considered problem and the quality or value of\n52\nthe food\
    \ source represents the fitness value of that particular solution. At the start,\n\
    all bees are used as scouts, searching for food sources. When a food source is\
    \ found,\nfor a high value food source, bees who find those food sources become\
    \ hire bees and\ncollect the food source. If the food source is of intermediate\
    \ value, the bees become\nfollow bees and if the food source value becomes low,\
    \ the bees become scout bees to\nlook for better food sources. Hire bees, the\
    \ bees with a food source location having\na high value, lead the follow bees\
    \ to develop solutions in their neighborhood in order\nto come up with more solutions.\
    \ A subset of the highest-ranking solutions are then\nconsidered before this process\
    \ is repeated again until the end conditions are met.\n4\nOptimization Applications\
    \ in Smart Cities\nSeveral tasks in smart city operations require the use of metheuristics\
    \ to be solved,\nthe aim being to optimize the resources present in the city.\
    \ This section presents\nthe different uses of optimization techniques for IoT\
    \ enabled Smart Cities.\nThis\ntask is performed for all eight components, Smart\
    \ Agriculture, Smart City Services,\nSmart Grid, Smart Health, Smart Homes, Smart\
    \ Homes, Smart Industry, Smart\nInfrastructure and Smart Transportation.\n4.1\n\
    Smart Agriculture\nSmart Agriculture involves the use of digital technologies\
    \ such as sensors and in-\ntelligent systems to improve agricultural productivity.\
    \ The sustenance of agriculture\ndepends on water, and it is central to the agricultural\
    \ production of food items around\nthe world. However, water is becoming an ever-scarce\
    \ resource due to the increasing\ndemand caused by human population growth, increased\
    \ economic activity by indus-\ntries and also due to climate change. It therefore\
    \ is necessary to utilize this precious\nresource wisely so as make use of it\
    \ in the best manner possible.\nOne approach\ntowards ensuring that water and\
    \ land is used appropriately is by introducing irriga-\ntion management schemes\
    \ such as irrigation scheduling and water allocation in the\nfarming process.\
    \ A summary of the optimization problems, objectives, constraints in\nsmart agriculture\
    \ and the use of IoT is illustrated in Figure 8.\nMeasurements in water irrigation\
    \ systems are typically performed by sensors\nplaced at different points in the\
    \ canals and rivers to determine water flow, volume and\nspeed. This information\
    \ regarding water movement can be combined with economic\ninformation such as\
    \ yeild, crop profit to optimize water distribution. Irrigation man-\nagement\
    \ through scheduling has been performed by the authors of [255, 256, 257, 258]\n\
    to maximize net return on crop profits, water use efficiency and to minimize leakage\n\
    losses. In [259] Fuqiang et al. aim to optimize water delivery through canals\
    \ while\nalso performing scheduling. They do this using a genetic algorithm and\
    \ work with\ntwo objectives, minimizing the difference between the time of water\
    \ delivery and wa-\nter demand and the fluctuation in water discharge of the main\
    \ canal. Their model\nwas applied to a district in China.\nThe authors in [260,\
    \ 261] work on optimal allocation of water. Of these, Ikudayisi\net al. [260]\
    \ use the differential evolution algorithm to minimize the water allocated to\n\

    \ terms of job creation, ensuring\nfood security and the yield of crops.\nWu et\
    \ al.\n[261] approach this as problem\nof reducing deviation between different\
    \ channels and minimizing water seepage to\nensure a more consistent supply to\
    \ all water channels. An approach presented by\nOcampo et al. [262] tackles this\
    \ problem not as a task of allocation directly but\nconsiders the scenario of\
    \ providing sufficient water to a smart farm while controlling\ntwo water pumps.\
    \ The objective function is formulated to minimize the energy cost\nof the water\
    \ pumps while maintaining sufficient supply of water to the plants on the\nfarms.\
    \ Constraints considered for such applications include the limited quantities\
    \ of\nwater being worked with, the time for which the water was available and\
    \ the area\nof land which was to be considered. Another allocation based scheme\
    \ is presented\nby Zhuo et al. [263] who use a genetic algorithm for an irrigation\
    \ system based on\na reservoir and two pumping stations. Their aim is to ensure\
    \ that there is no water\n54\nshortage. The objective function used by them is\
    \ the minimization of the annual sum\nof squared water shortage. Other work in\
    \ [264] also minimizes use of groundwater\nand increase benefit to the regional\
    \ water supply through reduction of water deficits\nin the Dujiangyan region of\
    \ China.\nA precision agriculture scheme is presented by Roy et al.\n[265] who\
    \ combine\nan IoT system consisting of sensors on plants using a GA based rainfall\
    \ predictor.\nCombining predicted rainfall information along with the sensed moisture\
    \ level in\nthe crops, they control plant watering. Lin et al. [266] propose a\
    \ framework for the\nmanagement of fertigation and irrigation in precision agriculture.\
    \ They perform short\nterm management and long-term management. Soil and crop\
    \ growth data is gathered\nfrom IoT based sensor systems. Long term planning refers\
    \ to the allocation of water\nand fertilizer resources to crops in terms of quantity\
    \ so as to meet demands whereas\nshort term refers to when and how to use them.\
    \ They use a genetic algorithm for long\nterm planning considering the allocation\
    \ of water and fertilizer for crops to maintain\npH value and electrical conductivity.\
    \ This information has been presented in Table\n16 while a summary of the identified\
    \ data sources used by each considered work has\nbeen provided in Table 17.\n\
    4.2\nSmart City Services\nAccording to the world bank, the amount of annual solid\
    \ waste generated is set to be\n3.40 billion tons [268] in 2050. Managing this\
    \ waste and its collection in an efficient\nmanner is imperative for health and\
    \ climate reaons. The most common application\ntowards smart city services optimization\
    \ is waste management as illustrated in Figure\n9 which summarizes the objectives,\
    \ constraints and the use of IoT.\nSmart waste collection systems include sensors\
    \ attached to trash cans which can\ninform the municipal authority about the status\
    \ of the garbage amount present in\nthem.\nOnce the trash cans are close to being\
    \ full, it is the responsibility of the\nmunicipal corporation to perform garbage\
    \ collection in an efficient manner. In this\nrespect, data provided by the sensors\
    \ on garbage cans can be used to determine\nan optimized route for garbage collection\
    \ to construct the Vehicle Routing Problem\n(VRP) in the Smart City Services domain.\
    \ As such, this problem has been performed\nkeeping in view various goals. The\
    \ minimization of the route distance taken by a\ngarbage tuck has been performed\
    \ by the authors in [269, 270, 271, 272, 273]. The\naim in this case is to determine\
    \ a route for garbage collection vehicles that minimizes\nthe total distance traveled\
    \ by the them. Zhang et al. [273] consider multi-vehicle\nallocation while considering\
    \ the single objective of minimizing route distance. Wei\net al. [274] use the\
    \ Artificial Bee Colony algorithm to determine garbage collection\nroutes resulting\
    \ in the minimum emission of CO2. Another optimization objective\nin route optimization\
    \ for waste management has been the minimization of the total\ntravel time, such\
    \ a target is described by the authors of [275, 276, 277, 278] who aim\nto reduce\
    \ travel time while considering emptying of waste bins. Another optimization\n\
    consideration in route optimization for waste management is to reduce cost. This\
    \ has\nbeen carried out by Tirkolaee et al. [279] who formulate a multi-objective\
    \ function of\ntravel cost and total useage cost of vehicles and determine the\
    \ route with the minimum\n55\nTable 16. Optimization in Smart Agriculture\nApplication\n\

    the applications, objectives, constraints and IoT usage for optimization algorithms\
    \ in\nSmart Grids has been illustrated in Figure 10.\nAn increasing population\
    \ has led to an increasing demand for electricity around\nthe world. This burdening\
    \ of the electricity grid has led to measures for increasing\nthe performance\
    \ of the electricity distribution system by reducing loss, prevent over-\nload\
    \ and reduce cost. The authors in [282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288] work on\n\
    the improvement of grid performance by minimizing cost and reducing power losses.\n\
    Power loss minimization is specifically targeted by [282, 286, 284]. Of these,\
    \ Ettappan\net al. [282] aim for the reduction of power losses, voltage deviation\
    \ and increasing\nvoltage stability. Atteya et al. [286] also address this problem\
    \ by considering net-\nwork redistribution to minimize losses in the grid whereas\
    \ Sakr et al. [284] focuses\non minimizing transfer losses in the smart grid to\
    \ accomplish this task. Nguyen and\nMohammadi [285] attempt the reduction of power\
    \ losses and line congestion by deter-\nmining the location of thyristor controlled\
    \ series compensator devices. The problem\nis formulated as a multi-objective\
    \ problem aiming to minimize loadability of the lines,\nactive power loss and\
    \ the reactance of the transmission line. A cost reduction-based\napproach to\
    \ improve grid performance is followed by Das et al. [283] who aim to\nreduce\
    \ cost of maintaining electrical stability and also the cost of management of\
    \ the\ndistribution network. They do this by considering changing the location\
    \ of energy\nstorage systems within the grid. Kanwar et al. [287] take maximizing\

    Distributed energy resource (DER) management is another area where optimiza-\n\
    tion algorithms are used in Smart Grids. The management of distributed energy\n\
    sources within smart grids is dependent on the interconnectivity provided by IoT\n\
    in the smart grid system.\nSmart meters within the smart grid provide real-time\n\
    information relating to power consumption which can be used for controlling DER\n\
    electricity. Moreover, IoT devices allow for switching loads and generation sources\
    \ as\nrequired. This assists in creating a virtual power plant to aggregate all\
    \ energy sources\nin a DER scenario. With global warming and a changing climate,\
    \ utilities around\nthe world are increasingly incorporating various renewable\
    \ energy sources within their\ngrid which often times are an economically convenient\
    \ option as well. However, many\n59\nof these sources such as wind and solar (photo\
    \ voltaic [PV]) do not offer a consistent\nsupply of power throughout the day.\
    \ In this regard, systems such as batteries as\nwell as conventional generation\
    \ plants need to be used together along with renewable\nenergy sources. For utility\
    \ companies, it is necessary to optimize power production\nso that the maximum\

    \ [289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302] provide\n\
    a management scheme for DERs to minimize cost. In this regard, the authors in\n\
    [292, 293, 294, 297, 289, 290, 300, 301, 302] all formulate the problem of distributed\n\
    energy resource management as a single objective problem where the cost incurred\
    \ is\nminimized. On the other hand, the authors in [298, 295, 291] and [299] formulate\
    \ this\nas a multi-objective problem. Azaza and Wallin [299] not only target reduction\
    \ of\nelectricity production cost but also maximize reliability of the system\
    \ while reducing\nthe environmental impact of the distribution system. It is interesting\
    \ to note that the\nimprovement of system reliability is formulated as a minimization\
    \ problem as well.\nSimilarly, Das et, al. [291] consider the reduction of both\
    \ the total cost as well as\nthe environmental cost of the system. Their considered\
    \ scenario also consists of a\nPV, Wind Turbine and battery. The constraints considered\
    \ were constraints regard-\ning power flow, limitations on power and voltage values,\
    \ power balance constraint\nand power generation constraints on the renewable\
    \ energy sources. In [289, 302], a\nDER management system is developed for a microgrid\
    \ which consists of a controllable\ncollection of energy storage and generation\
    \ sources powered by IoT devices.\nPlanning in distribution networks has been\
    \ considered by the work of [303] and\n[304]. Mahdavi et al. [303] work on expanding\
    \ transmission lines utilizing the artificial\nbee colony algorithm to minimize\
    \ cost of network expansion, power losses in load\nand generation. On the other\
    \ hand, Maji and Acharjee [304] aim to determine the\nminimum number of Phase\
    \ Measurement Units (PMUs) to make the distribution\nnetwork observable. The constraints\
    \ used were power flow and balance of power as\nwell as limits on the number of\
    \ transmission lines available. The internet of things also\nfinds usefulness\
    \ in terms of the use of Phase Measurement Units that provide voltage\nand current\
    \ measurement capabilities within smart grids to perform maintenance and\nmonitoring\

    ambulance dispatch increases mortality [307], moreover, economically speaking,\
    \ a\none-minute delay in response time for cardiac patients found that the mortality\
    \ in-\ncreases by 1% and adds annual costs of USD 7 billion in healthcare expenditure\n\
    [308]. Keeping this in mind ambulance deployment and location determination have\n\
    been of considerable interest in the area of optimization for smart health. These\n\
    two problems are specific cases of the Vehicle Routing Problem [309] and Maximum\n\
    coverage problem [310] sometimes called the Ambulance Routing Problem [311] and\n\
    Ambulance Location Problem [312]. The authors in [313] work on the optimal allo-\n\
    62\ncation determination based on fixed sites and a finite number of ambulances\
    \ while\nminimizing lateness of ambulance arrival using the Ant Colony Optimization.\
    \ Later\non, in their work in [314], they do a comparison with using GAs and find\
    \ that GAs\nprovide better performance. Kochetov and Shamray [315] attempt localization\
    \ of\nambulance fleet at base stations with the aim to minimize the average waiting\
    \ time\nfor arrival of ambulances. An interesting approach to this problem is\
    \ presented in\nYan et al. [316] who work on this problem from a scheduling perspective\
    \ where they\ncontrol scheduling of emergency vehicles to reduce the total cost\
    \ in terms of money\nand time using a Genetic Algorithm. Another approach for\
    \ sequencing vehicles to\nensure emergency vehicles reach their destination in\
    \ time is presented by Lu et al.\n[317] who aim to prioritize emergency vehicle\
    \ thoroughfare on traffic intersections.\nThey do this by minimizing the entrance\
    \ time of the vehicle by manipulating vehicle\norder. Constraints used for these\
    \ problems include constraints on the speed of the\nambulances, the flow of vehicles\
    \ on the road, specific road connections present as well\nas time constraints.\
    \ The internet of things serves a pivotal role in enabling the allo-\ncation and\
    \ routing of emergency vehicles. The connectivity provided by IoT through\nvehicle-to-vehicle\
    \ communication as well as vehicle to infrastructure communication\nfacilitates\
    \ providing a real-time indication of the vehicle’s location as well as the con-\n\
    dition of traffic in a given area. This information can then be used to determine\
    \ an\noptimal route for emergency vehicles as well as for their optimal deployment\
    \ to serve\npeople in need. Information about optimization methods for smart health\

    \ energy management has been the prime application of optimization in smart\n\
    homes, a summary of the objectives, constraints and the use of IoT has been shown\n\
    in Figure 12.\nSmart Homes \nHome Energy Management \nAppliance\nScheduling \n\
    Objectives: Minimize\ncost, time, peak to\naverage power ratio,\ndiscomfort \n\
    Constraints: Capacity\nlimits, flow, one level\nper location\nIoT usage: Sensors\
    \ for providing power consumption data and other environmental\nreadings such\
    \ as temperature etc for comfort determination in homes, smart meters\nprovide\
    \ interconnectivity betwen homes\nFigure 12. Optimization applications in Smart\
    \ Homes.\n64\nHome energy management refers to the development of demand side\
    \ manage-\nment schemes that aim to reduce the electricity cost billed to a customer\
    \ or maintain\ncomfort for the user. One way this is performed is by appropriate\
    \ appliance schedul-\ning. The idea here is to schedule the usage of appliances\
    \ in such a way that the\nmost power-hungry devices are turned on during off peak\
    \ hours when electricity costs\nmight be lower. The combination of the Smart Grid\
    \ and Smart Homes facilitates the\ndevelopment of optimization schemes that not\
    \ only benefit the customer (in terms\nof reduced electricity costs and maintaining\
    \ comfort) but also be useful for the util-\nities in ensuring that load profiles\
    \ (though minimizing the peak to average ratio)\nare more consistent thereby allowing\
    \ better planning of the power generation mix\nused by them. The authors of [319]\
    \ perform appliance scheduling for the purpose of\nminimizing electricity cost\
    \ and the waiting time for appliance usage. Interestingly,\nthey incorporate comfort\
    \ maintenance by adding it as a constraint. A similar ap-\nproach has been followed\
    \ by Bui et al [320] and Makhadmeh et al. [321] who aim to\nminimize the cost\
    \ of electricity usage with a constraint for maintenance of comfort.\nMakhadmeh\
    \ et al. [321] also include the reduction of waiting time rate for appliances\n\
    by the user and the reduction of the peak to average ratio of the power consumed\
    \ as\nconstraints. The authors in [322, 323, 324, 325] perform appliance scheduling\
    \ while\nconsidering electricity cost and peak to average ratio which need to\
    \ be minimized.\nAll of the authors present a multi-objective function for this\
    \ purpose combining the\nobjectives of minimizing the cost and the peak to average\
    \ power ratio. Azimi et al.\n[326] combine the problem of reducing cost and power\
    \ together as a single objective\nby considering the minimization of the ratio\
    \ of operating cost and load factor in a\nbattery supported system. The works\
    \ of [327, 328, 329, 330, 331] also consider user\ncomfort as part of the objective.\
    \ In [327], Essiet and Wang form a multi-objective\nminimization problem of electricity\
    \ cost, peak to average ratio for power and discom-\nfort of users in a smart\
    \ home supported by a renewable energy system consisting of a\nbattery and PV\
    \ system. In Chanra et al. [332], the authors aim to reduce electricity\ncost\
    \ by appliance scheduling in such a manner so as to make as much use of onsite\n\
    energy units as possible so as to reduce usage of utility provided electricity.\
    \ The\nenergy units they consider are a diesel generator, renewables and battery.\
    \ Another\napproach that aims to reduce cost of consumed electricity is presented\
    \ by Faia et\nal. [333] who formulate it as a problem of minimizing the energy\
    \ bill and the cost\nassociated with curtailment of power in a system with a battery\
    \ and a photovoltaic\nsystem. Work in [334, 330, 335, 336] also perform appliance\
    \ scheduling to reduce\ncost of electricity. Appliance scheduling for smart homes\
    \ has also been performed by\nFatima et al. [323] and Abid et al. [322] considering\
    \ a microgrid for homes where\ninstead of optimizing data from single homes, the\
    \ authors used data from connected\nsmart meters to determine an optimized control\
    \ scheme for appliances across the grid.\nThe constraints used for optimization\
    \ in smart homes are on the comfort needing to\nbe maintained, constraints on\
    \ the powerflow, time of operation, the maximum power\nthat is present or used\
    \ and which appliances are switchable appliances. Appliance\nscheduling is based\
    \ on smart meters as well as individual control and monitoring of\nappliances\
    \ using IoT systems. IoT devices enable the microgrid which is used to\ngather\
    \ data as well as control the switching on and off of sources from the houses\n\
    65\nelectricty supply. The information gathered from these IoT units can be processed\n\
    to optimize energy consumption patterns to reduce cost to the customer as well\
    \ as\nincrease comfort. The use of the considered optimization schemes for smart\
    \ homes\nhas been presented in Table 24 with the data setups presented in Table\
    \ 25.\n4.6\nSmart Industry\nOne of the biggest enablers of the Industry 4.0 concept\
    \ has been the use of AI tech-\nniques to improve the efficiency of the manufacturing\
    \ and production process. This\nhas led to the development of cyber physical systems\
    \ aiming to assist in activity recog-\nnition [339], machine health prediction\
    \ [340] and production management in terms of\nbottleneck prediction [341]. Apart\
    \ from conventional AI applications of anomaly de-\ntection, classification and\
    \ regression, computational optimization also finds numerous\napplications as\
    \ it fits well with the objective of efficient and streamlined manufac-\nturing.\
    \ The major applications for the use of computational optimization have been\n\
    in the area of routing and location for logistics and are variations of the vehicle\n\
    routing problem and are typically represented as Multidepot Vehicle Routing Prob-\n\
    lem (MVRP), Vehicle Routing Problem Pick-up and Delivery with Time Windows\n(VRPPDTW)\
    \ or Large-scale Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (LSDVRP). Figure\n13 summarizes\
    \ the objectives utilized, constraints and the role of IoT in optimization\nfor\
    \ Smart Industry.\nThe authors in [342] and [343] use the ABC and the GA respectively\
    \ to determine\nthe best location of service sites for logistic operations. Both\
    \ these approaches use\nmulti-objective formulations aiming to reduce cost of\
    \ operations, transportation as\nwell as the establishment of the centers. The\
    \ authors in Su et al. [344] use ACO,\nAlinaghia et al. [345] PSO and Utama et\
    \ al. [346] use ABC to address the problem\nof determining the best route for\
    \ logistics operations.\nThe routing and coverage\nproblem for logistics involves\
    \ determining the best route for either a single or multiple\nvehicles at a depot\
    \ which have to visit every customer. The works of [344, 345, 346]\nfocus on reducing\
    \ the cost incurred in the routing for vehicles in logistics as a single\nobjective\
    \ formulation. On the other hand, the authors of [347, 348] and [349] all\nwork\
    \ on the minimization of distance as their objective in determining the optimal\n\
    route for delivery vehicles trying to serve multiple locations.\nMounia and Bachir\n\
    [348] address routing in logistics as a multi-objective problem where they not\
    \ only\naim to minimize the distance traveled by the vehicles but also aim to\
    \ reduce CO2\nemissions and the number of vehicles used. A time based optimization\
    \ approach is\npresented by the authors of [350] and [351] with [350] also factoring\
    \ in reduction of fuel\nconsumption in their objective function formulation. Constraints\
    \ used for the routing\nand location determination problem are related to time,\
    \ capacity constraints for the\nvehicles, each customer being served only once,\
    \ constraints related to the route. The\ndetermination of the location and the\
    \ route for vehicles is dependent on real time\ninformation concerning the traffic\
    \ in the area as well as the loads to be collected from\neach site in addition\
    \ to other information which can be provided by IoT units. The\nusage of optimization\
    \ algorithms for smart industry has been presented in Table 26\nwith data setups\

    Smart Infrastructure\nWithin the infrastructure domain, the most common optimization\
    \ problem is the\narea of health monitoring of structures. Structural Health Monitoring\
    \ (SHM) is a\nnecessary application within the smart infrastructure domain as\
    \ it makes for safe\nusage of different structures of public use.\nThese structures\
    \ can be buildings as\nwell as transport structures such as bridges, tunnels.\
    \ Structural health monitoring\ntypically involves the use of sensors attached\
    \ to a structure at several points that can\ngauge some type of physical variable\
    \ (vibration, strain, acceleration, temperature,\ntilt etc) from the structure.\n\
    Data gathered from these connected sensors is then\nused to determine if any structural\
    \ damage has taken place or not.\nWithin the\ndomain of SHM, optimization algorithms\
    \ find application towards the Optimal Sensor\n69\nTable 27. Data setup for Smart\

    For the optimal sensor placement problem, the aim is to determine the best num-\n\
    ber and placement of sensors over a structure so as to reduce the number of sensors\n\
    used as well as improve the measurement process, both these aims result in increased\n\
    reliability of the SHM system as well as potentially lower the cost of the system\n\
    too. The authors in [353, 354, 355, 356, 357] work on the placement of sensors\
    \ for\nstructural health monitoring focusing on improving the effectiveness of\
    \ the deployed\nsystem. In this regard, [353] and [356] use the genetic algorithm\
    \ to solve a multi-\nobjective problem aiming to minimize the measurement error\
    \ and cost. Yang et al.\nin [355] formulate OSP as single objective minimization\
    \ where they aim to reduce\nthe ratio of sensor placement performance to the redundancy\
    \ of information resulting\nfrom each tested placement. Another approach that\
    \ works on the error is presented\nby [354] who use the Particle Swarm Optimization\

    places where sensors can be placed. This information has been provided in Table\

    \ of the most popular optimization applications within smart cities are within\
    \ the\nsmart transport domain. These include parking system routing, traffic signal\
    \ control\nand scheduling. A summary of the applications, their objectives, constraints\
    \ and the\nrole of IoT is illustrated in Figure 15.\n71\nSmart TransportaƟon \n\

    Smart transport systems consist of sensors along roads and traffic intersections\n\
    to measure relevant parameters while also providing communication services between\n\
    vehicles and infrastructure. This allows for measurement of the current state\
    \ of roads\nin terms of traffic congestion and usage thereby allowing for the\
    \ use of optimization\ntechniques to improve trip experiences for users and make\
    \ the transportation system\nmore efficient. The authors in [361, 362, 363, 364,\
    \ 365] work on the minimization\nof time (wait and travel) in traffic signal control.\
    \ The aim of such systems is to\nreduce traffic build up on signal intersections.\
    \ Of these, the work in [361, 362] and\n[363] use the artificial bee colony and\
    \ the genetic algorithm respectively for a single\nobjective function of minimizing\
    \ delay time. An interesting approach for this problem\nis presented by Li et\
    \ al. [365] who use a multi objective formulation targeting the\nminimization\
    \ of the average travel time both overall and individually for all vehiclesl.\n\
    Another multi-objective approach in traffic signal control is presented by Chen\
    \ and\nYuan [366] who form a mixed problem of minimizing vehicle emissions and\
    \ travel\ntime together. Korkmaz [367] work on the estimation of delays in traffic\
    \ signals using\na genetic algorithm, they use it to minimize the difference between\
    \ the estimated\n72\nand simulated values.\nTang et al.\n[364] carry out distributed\
    \ optimization in a\nfog and cloud hierarchy.\nFirst, fog nodes optimize phase\
    \ timings within a single\ncycle and if the number of vehicles exceeds a threshold,\
    \ the results are sent to the\ncentral controller to further optimize over different\
    \ cycles so that a traffic jam is\navoided or alleviated. Zhang et al. [368] attempt\
    \ traffic signal optimization using\nmulti objective optimization functions of\
    \ reducing time delay and increasing traffic\ncapacity.\nConstraints used for\
    \ traffic signal control are timing constraints on the\nphase durations, flow\
    \ rate of vehicles and on the travel time.\nTraffic routing is also another important\
    \ aspect in smart transportation. This\ntypically involves the determination of\
    \ the best route to the destination keeping in\nview various criteria such as\
    \ reduction of distance, time, cost etc.\nThe problem\nof traffic routing is addressed\
    \ by the works of [369, 370, 371, 372, 373, 374, 375,\n376, 377, 378, 379]. The\
    \ authors in [369] and [370] use the ant colony optimization\nand genetic algorithm\
    \ to minimize the travel distance in parking system routing.\nThey aim to minimize\
    \ distance traveled by a driver looking to find a free parking\nspot, using the\
    \ algorithm, an optimized route is determined for the parking spot.\nIn, [371,\
    \ 373] and [372] the ant colony optimization algorithm is used to determine\n\
    the best route in a generic traffic scenario where cars can communicate with road\n\
    side units in a VANET architecture. Routing for public transport is performed\
    \ by\n[380] and [375] in a connected vehicle scenario aiming to minimize travel\
    \ time. An\neconomic objective approach to traffic routing is taken by the authors\
    \ of [376, 378]\nand [379] who minimize the total cost of the trip.\nMao [379]\
    \ also include traffic\ncongestion and travel time as well in their computation.\
    \ Hassoune et al. [381] work\non a parking guidance using the ant colony optimization\
    \ algorithm to reduce traffic\ncongestion and minimize distance. Constraints for\
    \ traffic routing are related to the\nroad network allowing travel in specific\
    \ directions, signaling and travel time. Within\nsmart transportation, IoT nodes\
    \ are used to determine occupied parking spaces and\nthis data is used for routing\
    \ applications in parking. Traffic routing is based on vehicle\nto vehicle and\
    \ vehicle to infrastructure communication provided by VANETs within\nthe IoT framework.\
    \ These systems enable cars to exchange data with each other and\nalso with fixed\
    \ infrastructure on the roads. This discussion is also presented in Table\n30\
    \ and the data setups for the covered work are presented in Table 31.\n5\nConclusion\n\

    \ algo-\nrithms in the IoT enabled Smart City. It provides a mapping of the various\

    As discussed earlier, IoT finds usage in many different Smart City domains, both\
    \ for\nuse in classification/regression tasks as well as for optimization applications.\
    \ One\nof the most important applications of IoT within Smart Cities is within\
    \ the Smart\nHealth domain wherein IoT devices enable the monitoring of patients\
    \ for different\ndiseases such as heart disease etc. While there are a multitude\
    \ of IoT within Smart\nHealth, in order to develop algorithms on IoT sensor data,\
    \ the case of ambient assisted\nliving was chosen, in particular, this work considers\
    \ the case of fall detection.\n2\nIoT for Fall Detection\nThe United Nations estimates\
    \ that the number of old people (aged 60 and above) will\nbe 2.1 billion by 2050\
    \ and 3.1 billion by 2100 [382] leading to an increased old age\npopulation. With\
    \ people above 65 years suffering the greatest number of fatal falls\namong adults\
    \ aged 60 and over [383] healthcare costs related to fall related injuries\nrun\
    \ in to billions of dollars. These falls can result in injuries of moderate to\
    \ severe\nnature in the people experiencing the falls and may lead to decreased\
    \ mobility [384],\nespecially for the elderly [385]. Furthermore, following the\
    \ initial fall, the likelihood\nof experiencing additional falls increases [386]\
    \ and can lead to mental stress in the\nform of post-fall syndrome [387].\nThe\
    \ Internet of Things has spearheaded the development of cyber-physical systems\n\
    that facilitate the recognition of activities/events being performed by people\
    \ in their\ndaily life. One aspect of this application scenario is fall detection.\
    \ Falls can occur\ndue to a variety of reasons [388] and Fall Detection Systems\
    \ (FDS) are used for\npeople with different of health related ailments such as\
    \ in Parkinsons disease [389],\nepilepsy [390], arthritis, people suffering from\
    \ cardiovascular diseases and various\nneuro-degenerative diseases [391]. In any\
    \ scenario, it is pertinent that when a person\nundergoes a fall, they be provided\
    \ care as quickly as possible. Providing timely care\nafter a fall may improve\
    \ post-fall life quality of a patient. Fall detection Systems can\nplay a vital\
    \ role in contributing to the provision of timely care [389, 392] by alerting\n\
    healthcare professionals. As noted by [393] fall detection systems are necessary\
    \ for\nold people with cognitive impairments who may not be able to get up after\
    \ a fall for\nlong durations of time which may result in pressure sores and other\
    \ complications\nand due to vulnerability to injuries when experiencing a fall,\
    \ it may sometimes result\nin death [394].\n76\nA fall is an unintended and sudden\
    \ change of posture resulting in one resting on\nthe ground or some other lower\
    \ level elevation. The aim of a FDS is to monitor the\nmovement of a person and\
    \ determine when a fall has taken place with the aim to\nalert healthcare personnel\
    \ or other caregivers. Over the years different methodologies\nhave been suggested\
    \ to address this problem, however, before discussing the different\nmethods utilize\
    \ for fall detection purposes, it is important to mention what researchers\nenumerate\
    \ to be the traits of a ’good’ FDS [395].\n2.1\nChallenges/Requirements of a FDS\n\
    The following are the typical typical traits/requirements of a good fall detection\n\
    system.\n2.1.1\nNon-intrusiveness\nAn important requirement in fall detection\
    \ systems is to be non-intrusive. Any FDS\nshould not be an impediment in the\
    \ execution of daily activities of a person as it may\nrestrict movement or inconvenience\
    \ their lifestyle.\n2.1.2\nLow Latency\nAn FDS needs to be able to detect a fall\
    \ with low latency. Latency refers to the time\nduration between the occurring\
    \ of a fall and its detection. FDS need to detect falls\nas quickly as possible\
    \ to ensure that caregivers can be notified right away so that apt\ncare is provided\
    \ to the person. Low latency depends on not only the algorithm being\nused to\
    \ detect falls but also parameters like network speed and reliability. Sensor\
    \ data\ntransmission to the main system might also be included in this calculation\
    \ depending\non the FDS proposed.\n2.1.3\nLow power consumption\nPower consumption\
    \ is an important issue in FDS, especially for ones which are battery\npowered.\
    \ Many FDS are expected to be used by elderly people who might not be\nas regular\
    \ in charging the FDS, therefore FDS should consume as little power as\npossible.\n\
    2.1.4\nAllow mobility\nA FDS should not hamper mobility as it might be preventive\
    \ in adoption of a FDS\ntoo. FDS which require people to remain infront of a camera\
    \ at a certain viewpoint\netc can be difficult to deploy and use.\n2.1.5\nDifferentiate\
    \ between Falls and Activities\nA FDS should have low false positives and false\
    \ negatives. In other words it should\nbe able to confidently detect falls and\
    \ be able to differentiate them from activities of\n77\ndaily living such as walking,\
    \ sitting, jumping, running etc. Any false alarms will result\nin wastage of valuable\
    \ healthcare resources, on the contrary, any false negatives might\ncause the\
    \ patient/person having undergone the fall to not get appropriate medical\ncare\
    \ in time and lead to potential death or trauma.\n2.1.6\nNotify caregivers\nA\
    \ complete fall detection solution should have some mechanism of informing care-\n\
    givers whenever a fall is detected. Typically this is carried out in terms of\
    \ email,\nnotifications via some system or messages. Moreover, this process should\
    \ be quick so\nas to ensure the dispatch of any needed help as quickly as possible.\n\
    2.1.7\nTrack history\nA complete fall detection solution should be able to provide\
    \ the history about a\npatient in terms of falls that a person may have suffered\
    \ from as this will help monitor\nthe patients health and determine likelihood\
    \ to suffer from falls in the future. FDS\nmay sometimes also look at other biological\
    \ parameters during falls so as to help\ninvestigate the causes of falls using\
    \ the conditions prevalent at that time. Biological\nparameters that could be\
    \ measured include heart rate, perhaps an ECG or others as\ndeemed necessary based\
    \ on a patients history.\n2.2\nTypes of Fall Detection Systems\nFall detection\
    \ systems can be categorized in to three types based on the sensing\nmechanisms\
    \ used and their placement. These are Ambient Sensor based systems,\nVisual based\
    \ systems and Wearable Sensor based systems.\n2.2.1\nAmbient Sensor based systems\n\
    Ambient sensor based systems are also sometimes referred to as environmental sensor\n\
    based systems since these types of FDS rely on the use of a number of wirelessly\n\
    connected ambient sensors placed in a given area for the detection of falls. These\n\
    FDS make use of various sensors including Passive InfraRed (PIR) Sensors [396],\n\
    Acoustic sensors such as microphones, thermal sensors as well as sensors measuring\n\
    Wi-Fi signal strength etc. For e.g., the authors in [397] develop a fall detection\
    \ system\nbased on two PIR sensors and a vibration sensor to detect vibrations\
    \ on the floor\nwhen a person falls down. Using the PIR sensor to detect a persons\
    \ motion. feature\nextraction is performed on vibration measurements and an SVM\
    \ classifier is used to\ndetermine whether a fall has taken place or not. Another\
    \ approach presented in [398]\nutilize sounds in a home to determine falls in\
    \ the elderly. They do this by extracting\nfeatures in sound signals and like\
    \ [397] use a Support Vector Machine classifier to\ndetermine falls. The authors\
    \ in [399] make use of Wi-Fi channel state information\nfor fall detection. They\
    \ achieve this by feature extraction in the frequency domain\nfollowed by an SVM\
    \ classifier.\n78\nAmbient fall detection systems offer the advantage of not requiring\
    \ people to wear\nanything on their bodies and are thus nonrestrictive in that\
    \ sense. However, such\nsystems are prone to suffer high false positives due to\
    \ the large number of external\nfactors such as other heat emitting devices, multiple\
    \ people moving around at the\nsame time etc. Another issue that comes with ambient\
    \ fall detection systems is that\ndeployment could be cumbersome to cover a large\
    \ space, therefore they are typically\ndeployable in small places such as a home\
    \ or a small building but are very difficult\nto use outdoors due to the nature\
    \ of the setting as well as the possible sources of\nexternal interference.\n\
    2.2.2\nVision based systems\nVision based systems rely on the processing of video\
    \ frames or other visual infor-\nmation such as depth and thermal images or their\
    \ combination [400] to detect falls.\nTypically, the recorded data is sent to\
    \ a server or central computer which provides\nprocessing capabilities. Moreover,\
    \ recently, with the use of deep learning algorithms,\nsuch systems have found\
    \ to provide improved performance. For e.g. [401] use Convo-\nlution Neural Networks\
    \ on velocity information in video frames. Another approach\nthat uses CNNs is\
    \ given in [402] who model human motion from video frames using\nCNNs and then\
    \ use a logistic regression classifier to determine falls. Other approaches\n\
    with CNNs include the works in [403] and [404], both of which achieve very high\
    \ de-\ntection accuracy. Another DL network which has been useful in fall detection\
    \ systems\nbased on cameras is Long Short Term Machine, a recent example of that\
    \ is the use of\na CNN + LSTM combination on 360 degree video recordings of an\
    \ indoor facility to\ndetermine falls. The LSTM allows for capturing the changing\
    \ characteristics between\nvideo frames to provide fall recognition.\nEventhough\
    \ vision based FDS have been able to provide improved fall detection\nperformance\
    \ recently, like ambient sensor based systems, these systems suffer from\nsome\
    \ drawbacks. They are affected negatively in terms of performance and deploya-\n\
    bility from external factors such as occlusion, restricted mobility of the people\
    \ being\nmonitored, typically usable in environments over a small area, have high\
    \ computa-\ntional costs and are expensive. One other issue with vision based\
    \ systems is privacy,\nvision systems which use normal cameras pose risk of violation\
    \ to the privacy of peo-\nple being captured on video. The question of privacy\
    \ can be circumvented by the\nuse of depth cameras for e.g. a kinect [405, 406]\
    \ or using heatmaps using infrared\ncameras/sensors [407].\n2.2.3\nWearable Sensor\
    \ based systems\nWearable fall detection systems involve the use of a device attached\
    \ to the subject.\nThe wearable device monitors user activity by means of sensors\
    \ and can determine\nwhen a fall has occurred. Information about the fall is then\
    \ conveyed to a doctor or\nother medical professionals. Various types of sensors\
    \ can be used in these systems\nincluding inertial measurement sensors such as\
    \ accelerometers, gyroscopes, magne-\ntometers [408] or health sensors such as\
    \ ECGs, oxygen level and pulse rate sensors\n79\nas well. The devices that contain\
    \ these sensors can be worn on the hand, wrist, arm,\nchest, waist, legs, thigh\
    \ or even put inside shoes and are usually battery powered.\nWearable fall detection\
    \ systems have the advantage that they do not restrict move-\nment of the person\
    \ using them and consume less power than the other two approaches,\nhowever, a\
    \ disadvantage to this is the need to ’carry’ the device all the time. Another\n\
    disadvantage is the need to charge the device regularly which might be difficult\
    \ to do\nfor older people, a way this has been addressed in some approaches is\
    \ to make use of\nenergy harvesting [409].\n2.3\nTypes of Wearable FDS\nThere\
    \ are two types of wearable systems in use for fall detection purposes.\n2.3.1\n\
    Threshold based systems\nThe first of type of wearable FDS are threshold-based\
    \ fall detection systems where\nauthors have used various thresholding techniques\
    \ on sensor values measuring motion,\nparticularly the accelerometer. The major\
    \ advantage of threshold based fall detection\nsystems is their relative low computational\
    \ cost and use of sensor fusion techniques\nto improve fall detection accuracy\
    \ , however, the big disadvantage of such systems is\nthat threshold based systems\
    \ do not generalize well across subjects since people may\nhave different gaits,\
    \ this is especially true for people of different ages. As a result,\nthreshold\
    \ based FDS may suffer from having many false positives as well as false\nnegatives\
    \ since the FDS needs to differentiate between activities of daily living and\n\
    falls, which many times may appear to be fairly similar to each other in terms\
    \ of\nsensor readings.\n2.3.2\nMachine/Deep Learning based systems\nSince threshold-based\
    \ systems are rigid in terms of their usage, ML/DL methods\nprovide a flexible\
    \ method for fall detection. ML/DL algorithms can learn complex\npatterns from\
    \ sensor data which indicate to a fall while monitoring a persons activities\n\
    and therefore are useful in fall detection systems. As opposed to threshold based\n\
    systems, their generalizing capability allows them to be used across subjects.\n\
    A\ntypical ML framework for fall detection will involve data acquisition, prepossessing,\n\
    feature extraction and then usage of a suitable ML algorithm to make the inference\n\
    for a fall or no fall. A deep learning framework based FDS might have a similar\n\
    methodology, but depending on the DL algorithm used, feature extraction might\
    \ be\nomitted.\n2.4\nSensors used in Wearable FDS\nAs mentioned before, the sensors\
    \ used in wearable FDS are accelerometers, gyroscope,\nmagnetometer, ECG, Pulse\
    \ Rate and oxygen saturation levels. In this section, we will\ndiscuss briefly\
    \ the role of these sensors in wearable FDS and parameters of interest\nwhen using\
    \ them in FDS.\n80\n2.4.1\nAccelerometers\nAccelerometers, together with gyroscopes\
    \ are the most widely used sensors in wear-\nable FDS. One reason for this is\
    \ that both these sensors are typically present in\nsmartphones, which have been\
    \ used to either collect data for and/or deploy fall de-\ntection systems. An\
    \ accelerometer provides a measure of absolute acceleration and\nare used to detect\
    \ vibrations, force in a variety of applications involving monitoring\nof machines,\
    \ planes, civil architectures and more. In an FDS, an accelerometer is\nable to\
    \ capture the movement patterns of individuals which can be used to determine\n\
    falls.\n2.4.2\nGryroscope\nGyroscopes are used to measure tilt/orientation.\n\
    Gyroscopes find applications in\nvarious areas where orientation measurement is\
    \ required, for e.g. in airplanes and\nsubmarines where they are used in stabilization\
    \ systems, smartphones and game re-\nmotes for interactive gameplay, among other\
    \ things. Since orientation is an important\ncharacteristic of a fall, gyroscopes\
    \ are one of the most widely used sensors in FDS\nalong with acceleratorometers.\n\
    2.4.3\nMagnetometer\nA magnetometer is a device that measures the direction and\
    \ strength of magnetism\nrelative to the earths magnetic north. In addition to\
    \ other applications, magnetome-\nters are used in aircrafts for direction referencing.\
    \ These sensors are not very popular\nin FDS but have been proposed in some approaches\
    \ [410, 411] to be used for fall\ndetection in addition to accelerometers and/or\
    \ gyroscopes.\n2.4.4\nVarious Medical Sensors\nWearable fall detection systems\
    \ may also incorporate different types of medical sen-\nsors such as ElectroCardioGraphs,\
    \ ElectroMyoGraphs, Pulse Rate or Oxygen Level\nmeasurement in the FDS solution.\
    \ Even though there have been some approaches\nwhich have used medical sensors\
    \ exclusively for fall detection (such as EMG[412]),\nhowever, like magnetometers,\
    \ these sensors are usually used along with accelerome-\nters and/or gyroscopes.\
    \ Adding these sensors to fall detection systems has the added\nadvantage of assessing\
    \ falls from a health standpoint too as this information can be\nused to determine\
    \ risk of falls [413].\n2.5\nDesign considerations for Wearable FDS\nWearable\
    \ fall detection systems utilize sensor measurements to ascertain the occur-\n\
    rence of a fall. Since wearable FDS units are always attached to a persons body,\
    \ they\ncontinuously provide measurements of a persons movements and activities.\
    \ In order\nto use these measurements in a FDS, there are some design considerations\
    \ involved.\nWe discuss them in this section.\n81\n2.5.1\nSampling frequency\n\
    The sampling frequency dictates the number of sensor measurements recorded per\n\
    second. The sampling frequency used in an FDS should be high enough to capture\n\
    fall motion but not too high so as to increase data processing, storage requirements\n\
    as well as allow for energy efficient operation. In fact, depending on the position\n\
    of the sensors, significant reductions can be made in the sampling frequency used\n\
    for sensors with little or no change in performance as demonstrated by [414].\
    \ Such\nreductions could result in low power consumption by the wearable module\
    \ thereby\nenabling longevity of operation.\n2.5.2\nWindowing\nSince wearable\
    \ fall detection systems provide a continuous stream of sensor data, the\ndata\
    \ needs to be windowed for fall detection to be performed. Windowing refers to\
    \ the\nextraction of a subset of the sensor data stream in a sliding manner or\
    \ otherwise and\nis typically specified in terms of time duration for its size.\
    \ It is typical for wearable\nFDS designers to test different window sizes for\
    \ their fall detection algorithms. The\nsize of the window used would dictate\
    \ memory and computational requirements of\nthe unit used for deploying the FDS\
    \ system. Another important factor in windowing\nsensor signals is whether overlapping\
    \ is used during the windowing process or not.\nThis might be important to allow\
    \ for smooth transitions between different windows.\n2.5.3\nFeature Extraction\n\
    Feature extraction is the process of determining quantities from data which charac-\n\
    terizes it for a desired task appropriately. Feature extraction not only aims\
    \ to capture\nimportant aspects of the data being worked on but also to present\
    \ its content in a\nreduced size, thereby, making use of the data easier. Feature\
    \ extraction is a typ-\nical step of the a signal processing and machine learning\
    \ workflow and follows the\nwindowing step. There are different types of features\
    \ which have been computed\nfor fall detection applications, common feature computations\
    \ include the determina-\ntion of time domain features, frequency domain features,\
    \ statistical features etc. or\nsome combination from sensor data in FDS. Feature\
    \ extraction is followed by either a\nthresholding algorithm to sensor values\
    \ or a machine/deep learning model. For deep\nlearning, there have been some end\
    \ to end deep learning approaches which skip the\nstep of manual feature extraction.\
    \ In such approaches, deep learning networks such\nas CNN may be used to extract\
    \ features followed by other networks such as LSTM\nto determine falls, an example\
    \ is proposed in [415].\n2.6\nLiterature Review\nAs discussed previously, wearable\
    \ fall detection systems present several advantages\nwhen used for fall detection\
    \ purposes such as non-intrusiveness, ease of mobility, small\nsize of deployment,\
    \ low cost and that many implementations are typically standalone\nsystems. This\
    \ added with the fact that sensors and other components which are used\n82\nin\
    \ such systems have been becoming cheaper and cheaper to produce has resulted\
    \ in\na lot of interest in the development of wearable FDS by researchers and\
    \ technologists\nalike. Therefore, wearable FDS methodologies have gained considerable\
    \ interest in\nfall detection research. We discuss some of the popular methodologies\
    \ proposed in\nthis regard.\nThe authors in Mrozek et al. [416] present a complete\
    \ design of a wearable fall\ndetection system for an Internet of Things scenario.\
    \ They conduct two experiments\nwith their system, in one experiment, data is\
    \ collected from a gyroscope and an\naccelerometer and sent to the cloud for fall\
    \ detection (as a web service) while in\nthe second experiment, fall detection\
    \ is performed on the edge node (smart phone).\nThrough their experiments they\
    \ conclude that performing fall detection on the edge\nnode results in less network\
    \ traffic and storage requirements for the cloud. Algo-\nrithmically speaking,\
    \ they extract 3 second overlapping windows from measurements\nof both sensors,\
    \ perform feature extraction and pass it on to a boosted decision tree\nclassifier\
    \ for determining whether a fall has taken place or not. Moreover, the boosted\n\
    decision tree classifier was trained using the SisFall [417] dataset. Another\
    \ IoT based\nsystem is proposed by Marquez et al. [418] who develop a fall detection\
    \ system for\nIoT on the edge. They first gather data from an accelerometer and\
    \ a gyroscope placed\non the waist of multiple subjects and train a support vector\
    \ machine classifier on a\ncombination of raw sensor values and its standard deviation.\
    \ They are able to deploy\ntheir system successfully and achieve satisfactory\
    \ results. Moreover, feature selection\nis also performed before the classification\
    \ stage. A fog based fall detection model has\nbeen proposed by Sarabia-J’acome\
    \ et al. [419] who utilize a Long Short Term Memory\nRecurrent Neural Network\
    \ in their method. Edge nodes collect Inertial Measurement\nUnit (IMU) measurements\
    \ and relay them to a fog node which processes the data to\ndetermine if a fall\
    \ has taken place or not. One motivation for them to develop RNN\nmodels over\
    \ a Convolutional Neural Network one is the requirement of less param-\neters\
    \ and thus less computational requirements. Their final model consists of a 1D\n\
    CNN layer followed by two LSTM layers and a fully connected layer for classification\n\
    and is trained using raw data (window of 15s) from the SisFall dataset.\nZurbuchen\
    \ et al. in [420] provide a comparison of various machine learning al-\ngorithms\
    \ for fall detection while using data from the SisFall dataset. They perform\n\
    experiments using Decision Trees, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting\
    \ tree,\nK-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machines. Segments of 10 seconds\
    \ are ex-\ntracted from the trials in the SisFall dataset and various time and\
    \ frequency domain\nfeatures are computed for those segments. These are then passed\
    \ on to the classifiers.\nThrough their experiments, they find that Random Forest\
    \ and Gradient Boosting\ntrees perform the best among the considered methods.\
    \ Another comparison of var-\nious ML algorithms is provided by Chelli and P¨atzold\
    \ in [421] who compare the\nperformance of a number of machine learning algorithms\
    \ on two datasets, the Cogent\nLabs dataset [422] and the one provided in [423].\
    \ The algorithms they consider are\nan artificial neural network, K-NN, an ensemble\
    \ bagged tree (EBT) and Quadratic\nSupport Vector Machine (QSVM). They compute\
    \ several time and frequency domain\nfeatures from accelerometer and gyroscope\
    \ signals and pass them on to the classi-\nfiers. Their best performing classifiers\
    \ were QSVM and EBT. Kerdjidj et al. in [424]\n83\nuse compressive sensing to\
    \ explore the use of different modalities for fall detection\npurposes. The performance\
    \ of accelerometer only and an accelerometer - gyroscope\nsensor combination in\
    \ a fall detection scenario is compared. A Shimmer device [425]\nis used to capture\
    \ data from 17 volunteers asked to perform activities of daily living\nas well\
    \ as fall like movements. They first extract segments of length 2.56 seconds\n\
    from their recordings before performing feature extraction and passing it on to\
    \ four\ndifferent machine learning classifiers, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector\
    \ Machines,\nDecision Trees and an Ensemble Classifier (EC). They conduct two\
    \ such experiments,\none with compressive sensing and the other without. Their\
    \ results indicate that the\nEC classifier and SVM perform the best with the help\
    \ of compressive sensing included\nin the pipeline. A ’transfer learning’ approach\
    \ towards fall detection is provided by\nFanez et al. in [426] and they test it\
    \ on the UMAFall [427] dataset and the FallOVI\ndataset (created by them). Using\
    \ a finite state machine which captures windows\nof accelerometer measurements\
    \ based on peak values, the authors convert the win-\ndowed segments into string\
    \ representations using symbolic aggregate approximation\n(SAX) [428]. During\
    \ training each user performs normal ADLs and falls for a short\nperiod of time.\
    \ Peak values are determined from sensor measurements and used to\ncreate bag\
    \ of words using SAX. After this, normal operation of the system starts\nand information\
    \ retrieval (term frequency - inverse term frequency) values are used\nto determine\
    \ what label to give to new SAX words derived from sensor values. If a\ndetermined\
    \ word is not similar (using Manhattan distance) to any word in the bag of\nwords\
    \ (K-NN clustering is used to group similar words), a fall event is suggested\
    \ to\nhave occurred. ’Transfer learning’ involves the use of clusters formed by\
    \ other users\n(performing activities only) as the starting point of the training.\
    \ Their experiment\ncompared an SVM classifier with their information retrieval\
    \ based scheme. They are\nable to detect falls all the time with the UMAfall dataset\
    \ but have a high number\nof false positives for the FallOVI dataset. An noticeable\
    \ aspect of this approach is\nthe use of clustering and ’feature extraction’ as\
    \ strings. In Giuffrida et al. [429]\nthe authors use data from the SisFall dataset\
    \ and an SVM classifier to differentiate\nbetween falls and no-fall samples. They\
    \ extract slices (of 1 second) from the SisFall\ntrials and label each slice as\
    \ containing a fall or not. A number of features were then\ncomputed for each\
    \ slice before feature selection was performed and an SVM classifier\nwas trained\
    \ to determine the output class.\nDeep Learning methods have also been widely\
    \ used for fall detection purposes.\nCasilari et al. in [430] explore the contribution\
    \ of the gyroscope sensor for use in\ncombined accelerometer-gyroscope based fall\
    \ detection systems.\nTo do this, they\nmake use of measurements from the SisFall\
    \ dataset, extract observation windows of\n5 seconds around peaks of accelerometer\
    \ sensor signal values over a trace and pass\nthem on to a Convolutional Neural\
    \ Network with four convolutional layers, three\nmax pooling layers followed by\
    \ one fully connected layer for classification. Training is\nperformed in two\
    \ different sets of experiments, one including gyroscope data and the\nother without\
    \ it. They note that the results they get while using only accelerometer\nsignal\
    \ measurements are better than that when using data from both sensors. A\nCNN\
    \ is used for fall detection purposes by Santos et al. in [431] from accelerometer\n\
    measurements. Their network consists of six convolutional layers, two max pooling\n\
    84\nlayers in between followed by a fully connected layer for classification.\n\
    They use\ndata from the URFD dataset [432] and the Smart Watch and Notch datset\
    \ [433] in\ntheir experiments. They note that their model performs best when they\
    \ use data\naugmentation for both the datasets. However, this was achieved by\
    \ two different\nvariants of the same model. This highlights the point of a single\
    \ model not necessarily\nperforming well on all datasets. Another interesting\
    \ aspect of their work is the use of\nthe Mathews Correlation Coefficient to evaluate\
    \ performance of their algorithms. A\nmodified AlexNet [434] has been used in\
    \ [435] by Alarifi et. al. They collect tri-axial\ndata from inertial measurement\
    \ sensors consisting of accelerometer, gyroscope and\nmagnetometer at six different\
    \ positions on a subjects body. A total of 16 activities of\ndaily living and\
    \ 20 falls were recorded by them. Feature extraction is then performed\nin terms\
    \ of various statistical measurements as well as frequency analysis. This is\n\
    followed by principal component analysis and then passed on to the classification\n\
    stage consisting of an optimized AlexNet ConvNet. Waheed et. al. in [436] develop\n\
    a FDS using a Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network. They\n\
    consider the binary case of fall and no fall and perform experiments using the\
    \ SisFall\ndataset as well as the UP-Fall dataset [437]. Their network consists\
    \ of eight layers\nin total. Two Bi-LSTM layers and two fully connected layers\
    \ with dropouts being\nused for regularization. Training is performed with creating\
    \ missing values in the\ndata to introduce noise tolerancy.\nCasiliri et al.\n\
    in [438] provide a performance\ncomparison for a CNN network on multiple public\
    \ fall detection datasets. The aim\nof their work is to test the cross-application\
    \ of a similar CNN network trained on\ndifferent datasets. They set their experiments\
    \ up by training a four layer CNN on\neach dataset separately for fall detection\
    \ on 14 datasets (using similar positions of\nsensor placement) on windows of\
    \ 5 seconds for accelerometer signals. Their results\nindicate a very good performance\
    \ of the network for the SisFall dataset, however, it\ndoesn’t perform very well\
    \ for most of the other datasets, in some cases, performing\nless than random\
    \ chance, which is quite surprising. Their experiments do however,\nhighlight\
    \ an issue with the well accepted notion that an algorithm developed on some\n\
    benchmark dataset will necessarily work similarly well with other datasets.\n\
    The\nauthors suggest that the erratic performance of their method could be due\
    \ to the\ndifference in the nature of the data in terms of sampling frequency\
    \ used, range of\nthe sensor and the varying type of movements. Another cross-dataset\
    \ approach for\nfall detection has been proposed in [439] where the authors use\
    \ a combination of a\nCNN and Long Short Term Memory network to extract features\
    \ followed by a K-\nNearest Neighbor classifer to detect falls as well as identify\
    \ the subjects within four\nfall datasets, DFNAPAS [440], SisFall, UniMiB-SHAR\
    \ [441] and ASLH [442]. The\nnetwork is trained using the DFNAPAS dataset, before\
    \ training the network however,\ndata augmentation is carried out for the fall\
    \ class. Their best results are achieved\nfor a value of K = 3 and they achieve\
    \ good results for all experiments. They observe\nthat using a deep learning architecture\
    \ for feature extraction purposes along with a\nmachine learning classifier performs\
    \ better than a using a fully connected layer at the\nclassification stage.\n\
    Post fall intelligence is an important research area in the field of fall detection\n\
    as it can be useful in determining various post fall injuries [443] and serve\
    \ as an\n85\nintelligence parameter [444] for doctors. Jung et al. in [445] also\
    \ target detection\nof pre-impact falls for wearable airbag deployment. Their\
    \ method involves the ap-\nplication of a threshold on determined features from\
    \ accelerometer and gyroscope\nmeasurement measurements. The thresholds are then\
    \ applied to a dataset collected\nby them and also on the SisFall dataset. The\
    \ threshold is determined by performing\na grid search on the extracted features\
    \ from their dataset to maximize specificity and\nsensitivity. They do note that\
    \ some activties like sitting down quickly on a chair or a\nmattress triggered\
    \ false positives. Moreover, when applied to SisFall, their methods\nperformance\
    \ is not as high as achieved by methods based on ML/DL. Koo et. al.\n[446] present\
    \ experiments for post fall detection from a combination of self collected\ndata\
    \ and the SisFall dataset. They conduct tests using sliding windows as well as\
    \ dis-\ncrete windows from these signals and compute statistical features from\
    \ them. After\nfeature extraction, two different classifiers, the artificial neural\
    \ network and support\nvector machine are tested with the computed features as\
    \ well as raw sensor values.\nThey find that both ANN and SVM are suitable for\
    \ use in post fall detection sce-\nnarios. Another approach looking at the different\
    \ phases of a fall has been presented\nin [447] where Hsieh et. al. use accelerometer\
    \ sensor data to differentiate between\nfive phases of a fall, pre-fall, free-fall,\
    \ impact, resting and recovery and the initial\nand end static phases. To do this,\
    \ they compute various time domain and statistical\nfeatures and test five classifiers,\
    \ SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision\nTrees and Adaptive Boosting\
    \ (AdaBoost). For their experimental setup, the best\nresults were achieved using\
    \ the K-NN classifier. In Musci et al. [448], the authors\npropose a RNN based\
    \ method to differentiate between falls, pre-impact falls (state\nwhere a person\
    \ is in a dangerous state of transition which may result in a falls) and\nnormal\
    \ activities. Their motivation for including preimpact falls is to enable timely\n\
    deployment of a fall protection system. First, they label data from the SisFall\
    \ dataset\nto form three classes. They then extract windows of duration 1.28 seconds\
    \ with an\noverlap of 50% from the sensor signals and pass them on to their network\
    \ which\nconsists of two fully connected layers and two-layer LSTM layers. Moreover,\
    \ due to\nan imbalanced training set, they define a new balancing loss function.\
    \ Their method\nresults in fall detection good results for the three classes considered.\
    \ A CNN-LSTM\napproach has been proposed in [449] by Yu et al. for detection of\
    \ pre-impact fall and\nfalls in the SisFall dataset. They provide a comparison\
    \ of standalone CNN, LSTM\nand a combined CNN-LSTM architecture for this task\
    \ and also implement them on\na Jetson Nano. They define a pre-impact fall as\
    \ the time interval where a subject\ntransitions from a controlled state to a\
    \ state which may lead to a fall. First, they\nlabel data in the SisFall dataset\
    \ as described in [448] to form a three class problem.\nThey achieved their best\
    \ results for their CNN+LSTM model having four CNN layers\nfollowed by two LSTM\
    \ layers and a fully connected layer for classification. Their ap-\nproach highlights\
    \ the combined capability of CNN-LSTM for feature extraction. An\naspect of fall\
    \ intelligence is direction, in [450] Lee et al. use the velocity vector from\n\
    the acceleration sensor in a smartphone for fall detection with direction and\
    \ then\nlater on in [451], they use the standard deviation of the accemerometer\
    \ and gyro-\nscope sensor measurements from a smart phone to determine falls and\
    \ fall direction.\nThey perform a small experiment and are able to differentiate\
    \ between left, right,\n86\nfront and backward falls. More work on fall detection\
    \ with direction was performed\nby the authors in [452] who use an accelerometer\
    \ and gyroscope combination along\nwith a kalman filter for tilt estimation. Fall\
    \ detection is then performed using an\nSVM classifier. Falls with direction detection\
    \ has been attempted in [453, 454] by\nthe same authors. They collect accelerometer\
    \ data from various subjects and extract\nthree features from the recordings for\
    \ each axis, the mean, standard deviation and\nprincipal components (using Principal\
    \ Component Analysis). These are then passed\non to a SVM classifier to differentiate\
    \ between a forward, backward, left and right\nfall and ADLs.\nWhile direction\
    \ aware fall detection is an important determination in terms of post\nfall intelligence,\
    \ fall detection with severity is necessary since it could help provide\nindications\
    \ to falls with immediate recovery or otherwise, as falls without immediate\n\
    recovery would be more detrimental to health than a fall with immediate recovery\
    \ as\nhas been suggested in [455]. In [456] the authors attempt to classify between\
    \ different\nfalls (direction: forward, backward, right, left and intensity: hard,\
    \ soft [fall on knees\nfirst, then on floor]) and five different ADLs using accelerometer\
    \ data. They collected\ndata for their experiments using a triaxial accelerometer\
    \ mounted on the chest. Fea-\nture extraction consists of first concatenating\
    \ acceleration values in each axis and\nthen using a Debauchies-2 level-3 wavelet\
    \ which are then sent to the classification\nstage. In the classification stage\
    \ five different classifiers, an ANN, a Radial Basis\nFunction (RBF) Network,\
    \ Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) and\nLinear Discriminant Analysis\
    \ (LDA) are used through a voting machine to determine\nfalls. A voting machine\
    \ (VM) involves multiple classifiers giving a vote towards any of\nthe multiple\
    \ classes and the sum of the vote is compared against a vote threshold to\ndetermine\
    \ the event that has taken place. In their work, the authors train individual\n\
    VMs for all the activity and fall types in their dataset by structuring them all\
    \ in par-\nallel and adding a comparator function at the end of the pipeline.\
    \ Moreover, a K-NN\nmulticlass classifier also feeds in to the comparator and\
    \ is trained while training of\nthe other classifier, it is provided the true\
    \ value of the activity being input to the\nclassification stage. The authors\
    \ show that their dataset works very well. A valuable\ninsight about their work\
    \ is the ensembling mechanism the authors have employed to\ndetermine fall directions.\
    \ In [457], Hussain et al. propose a fall detection system that\ncan first determine\
    \ falls and then the type of fall using data from the SisFall dataset.\nThey accomplish\
    \ this in a hierarchical setup where their system first considers fall\ndetection\
    \ as a binary problem, whether a fall has taken place or not, and if a fall\n\
    has been detected, it classifies between the various falls in the dataset. Their\
    \ system\nis designed to work with 10 second non-overlapping windows of accelerometer\
    \ and\ngyroscope signals. Data from each record is first low pass filtered before\
    \ two different\ntypes of feature sets, consisting of various time domain and\
    \ statistical features, are\ncomputed on the data. This is then followed by the\
    \ machine learning stage where\nthree different classifiers are tested, K-NN,\
    \ SVM and RFC. In the fall detection stage,\nstatistical features are computed\
    \ from ADL and fall signals and sent to the three clas-\nsifiers for the preliminary\
    \ binary classification. After a fall has been determined to\nhave happened, numerous\
    \ other statistical and time domain features are then com-\nputed on the data\
    \ before being sent to the next stage to determine the type of fall\n87\nactivity\
    \ taking place. In their experiments, the authors find that K-NN is most effec-\n\
    tive in differentiating between falls and ADLs where as RFC performs the best\
    \ when\nthe different fall activities need to be determined. This work highlights\
    \ the usefulness\nof a hierarchical approach towards non-binary fall detection.\
    \ One proposed method\nto perform combined activity recognition and fall detection\
    \ has been presented in\n[458]. In this, Li et. al. use multi-modal sensor fusion\
    \ and a Bi-LSTM classification\nnetwork to differentiate between five activities\
    \ of daily living and a fall. The sensors\nthey use are an inertial sensor placed\
    \ on the wrist, waist and ankle as well as a radar\nsensor. After pre-processing\
    \ both the inertial measurement and radar signals, various\nstatistical and moment\
    \ computations were performed to be used as features. These\nwere passed on to\
    \ the multilayer Bi-LSTM network after feature selection to deter-\nmine the output\
    \ class. One thing to note is that both both [458] and [421] consider\nfall as\
    \ a single category rather than considering falls as a detailed problem (direction\n\
    and/or severity) in itself. More recent work by We et al. [459] also considers\
    \ ac-\ntivity recognition and fall detection together. They use inertial measurement\
    \ sensor\ndata from two datasets, the MobiAct dataset [460] and the SmartFall\
    \ dataset [433].\nThe MobiAct dataset contains data from four falls and nine activities\
    \ of daily living\nwhereas the SmartFall dataset has non-fall and fall recordings.\
    \ In their experimenta-\ntion, they compare the performance of different machine\
    \ learning models and several\ndeep learning models, including a CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM\
    \ combination and Gated\nRecurrent Units. The machine learning models are trained\
    \ by computing time and\nfrequency domain features whereas the deep learning models\
    \ are trained using raw\nsensor data. They find that the GRU designed by them\
    \ consisting of two GRU units\nfollowed by a softmax classification layer is the\
    \ best performing model. Another deep\nlearning approach utilizing sequential\
    \ modeling for a fall detection system that also\nconsiders ADLs has been presented\
    \ by Seng¨ul et al. [461]. They collect their own\ndata for two types of falls\
    \ and four activities of daily living. After data augmentation\non the minority\
    \ classes, they use a Bi-LSTM for classification. Le et al. [462] propose\na non-binary\
    \ fall detection scheme utilizing a collection of time, frequency frequency\n\
    domain features in addition to the three Hjorth parameters of activity, mobility\
    \ and\ncomplexity. They use data from two datasets, the MobiAct dataset and the\
    \ UP-Fall\ndataset. They are able to achieve good results on both datasets using\
    \ all three feature\ntypes with a random forest classifier.\nThe use of attention\
    \ based models has also been finding increasing usage in fall\ndetection research.\
    \ Yhdego [463] use an attention model to perform binary fall de-\ntection. The\
    \ fall dataset is collected by them and after windowing, the authors use\ntime2vec\
    \ positional encoding on the data. Their network consists of three attention\n\
    blocks each consisting of multiheaded self attention followed by normalization\
    \ and a\nfully connected network. After the attention blocks follow two fully\
    \ connected layers.\nThey find that their network incorporating attention performs\
    \ well in differentiating\nbetween fall and non-fall samples. Another interesting\
    \ approach using attention is\npresented by Liu et al. [464]. Inorder to apply\
    \ attention on both temporal (step wise)\nand spatial (channel wise) aspects of\
    \ the signals, a gated scheme is suggested. A fully\nconnected layer is used to\
    \ determine the embeddings before positional information is\nadded to the data.\
    \ Positional encoding is only used for stepwise attention as channel\n88\nwise\
    \ positions are not useful. Self attention is performed in the step-wise part\
    \ of the\nnetwork and is carried out for the individual channels in a pairwise\
    \ fashion across all\ntime steps while the channel wise attention is performed\
    \ across the different channels\nacross all time-steps. The outputs of these two\
    \ units are combined through a fully\nconnected network which weighs them before\
    \ concatenation and classification.\n2.7\nFall detection Datasets\nThere are several\
    \ datasets published for use in algorithm development for fall detec-\ntion as\
    \ has been noted in [438]. Of these, for this case study, we choose two datasets,\n\
    these are the SisFall and the K-Fall dataset. The SisFall [417] dataset is chosen\
    \ as\nit contains recordings of elderly people which are most at risk from injury\
    \ due to\nfalls and therefore should provide a good representation of activities\
    \ of the elderly. It\nshould be noted that its one of the most used dataset for\
    \ fall detection purposes [438].\nThe other dataset used is the K-Fall [465] dataset.\
    \ It was released on the pattern of\nthe SisFall dataset and includes more activities\
    \ compared to SisFall. A summary of\nthe datasets is presented in the next section.\n\
    2.7.1\nSisFall Dataset\nThe SisFall dataset consists of accelerometer and gyroscope\
    \ recordings of 19 types of\nactivities of daily living and falls. Two accelerometers\
    \ and one gyroscope were placed\non the waist and used for making the measurements.\
    \ This location was chosen so as\nto ensure that all body movements while performing\
    \ the activities/falls were captured\nby the sensory system. Furthermore, the\
    \ data recordings involved 23 young people\nbetween the ages of 19-30 years old\
    \ and 15 elderly people between the ages of 60-75\nyears. The dataset contains\
    \ annotated sensor measurements of each of these ADLs\nand falls recorded as well\
    \ as video recordings of sample experiments. There are four\nmain types of falls\
    \ present, six of them are forward falls , three backward falls, four\nlateral\
    \ falls and two vertical falls. The types of falls performed were directed through\n\
    a survey taken from elderly people living independently as well as the ones living\n\
    in retirement homes and include scenarios of slipping and tripping. Moreover,\
    \ they\nare preceded by various types of ADLs being performed to make the recordings\
    \ as\nclose to a real world scenario as possible. The ADLs recorded were approved\
    \ by\nmedical personnel and were chosen so as to be similar to falls. The ADLs\
    \ include\nhigh mobility activities such as walking up/down stairs, jogging as\
    \ well as activities\nwhich can be confused with falls such as quickly sitting\
    \ in a chair, bending at the\nknee and stumble while walking etc. In total, there\
    \ were 2706 ADL recordings and\n1798 fall recordings. The SisFall data is utilized\
    \ in this study as it has been the\nthe dataset of choice for several previous\
    \ research approaches addressing the subject\nof fall detection [466, 467, 468,\
    \ 436, 469] and also because the volunteer makeup\nconsists of both men and women,\
    \ young adults and the elderly. The ADLs and Falls\nin the SisFall dataset have\
    \ been presented in Table 32 with a brief description of the\nactivities and falls\
    \ provided as well.\n89\nTable 32. ADL and Falls present in the SisFall dataset.\n\

    \ the SisFall dataset and contains 15\nfall types and 21 ADLs. The falls in K-Fall\
    \ are the same as those in SisFall. However,\nin the case of ADLs, they remove\
    \ the activity of sitting in and getting out of a car\nand combine some of the\
    \ activities while adding static activities of sitting on a chair,\nsitting on\
    \ a sofa and lying down.\nA total of 2729 ADL recordings and 2346 fall\nrecordings\
    \ are present in the dataset. This dataset is included in the study to test\n\
    cross-dataset fall detection. The details of the K-Fall dataset are presented\
    \ in Table\n33.\n2.8\nExperiments\nThis section discusses the experiments conducted\

    \ and severity. The second, third and\nfour experiments involved the inclusion\
    \ of activities of daily living classification in\naddition to the fall classes\
    \ considered in the first experiment. Moreover, experiment\nfour presents results\
    \ for a cross-dataset fall detection scenario.\n2.8.1\nFall Detection with Severity\
    \ and Direction consideration\nThis section describes the work on fall detection\
    \ considering severity and direction\nwhile only considering sensor data for falls.\
    \ The experiment has been performed as\ntwo tasks, one for determining falls considering\
    \ direction only and the other while\nconsidering both direction as well as severity.\n\
    2.8.1.1\nData Labeling\nTo perform fall detection that is direction and severity\
    \ aware, we only considered fall\n91\ndata from the SisFall dataset. As can be\
    \ seen from Table 32, most of the falls in\nthe dataset have been labelled as\
    \ either being in the forward, backward or lateral\ndirection.\nHowever, two of\
    \ the falls (F06 and F07) are not labeled in terms of\ndirection. For the considerations\
    \ of this research work, these were assigned the labels\nof Forward and Lateral\
    \ respectively using the videos of sample trials provided by the\ndataset authors.\n\
    Concerning fall severity, while the original labels from the dataset contained\
    \ in-\nformation for most falls for direction, the approach followed by Gibson\
    \ et al. [456]\nwas used to determine the severity of falls. According to the\
    \ practice followed by\nthem, all falls where in some support was used to soften\
    \ the impact of the fall were\nconsidered as soft falls whereas all falls where\
    \ the subject fell directly were classified\nas hard falls. This resulted in six\
    \ classes for fall types with hard and soft for ima-\npact and forward, backward\
    \ and lateral for direction. These are Forward Soft Falls\n(FSF), Forward Hard\
    \ Falls (FHF), Backward Soft Falls (BSF), Backward Hard Falls\n(BHF), Lateral\
    \ Soft Falls (LSF) and Lateral Hard Falls (LHF). These labels have\nbeen summarized\
    \ in Table 34.\nTable 34. Labeling used for Fall only classification for the SisFall\

    \ Direction and Severity.\n2.8.1.2\nMethodology\nThe methodology used for this\
    \ experiment follows a typ-\nical machine learning pipeline as shown in Figure\
    \ 17. First, we pre-process the data\nwhich involves extraction of sensor segments\
    \ representing falls. This is followed by\nfeature extraction that aims to extract\
    \ useful representations from the accelerometer\nand gyroscope sensor data. Lastly,\
    \ feature selection is carried out where we aim to\nreduce the number of features\
    \ used in the last stage that is classification.\nData Pre-processing\nRecordings\
    \ in the SisFall dataset vary in length between 12 and 100 seconds. The\ntrial\
    \ recordings for falls in the SisFall dataset consist of subjects performing various\n\
    activities before experiencing the fall. For a sound feature extraction process,\
    \ we\nextract equal duration segments of sensor readings from these trials that\
    \ represent\nthe fall taking place along with some part of the pre-fall activity\
    \ being performed.\nTo do this, for each record we first calculate the acceleration\
    \ magnitude (also called\nthe Signal Magnitude Vector (SMV) ) [430] for all sensor\
    \ value samples within a trial\nrecording. The SMV can be calculated as given\
    \ in Eq.1.\nSMVj =\nq\f\fAxj\n\f\f2 +\n\f\fAyj\n\f\f2 +\n\f\fAzj\n\f\f2\n(1)\n\
    93\nwhere SMVj represents the SMV value for a sample j in a given trial. The SMV\n\
    is calculated for all samples and the sample location for the SMV peak value is\n\
    determined within the trial. This is then used as the midpoint for extracting\
    \ a 2.5\nsecond segment from the trial. A segment length of 2.5 seconds was chosen\
    \ as it was\nvisually found to capture all the falls as well as some part of the\
    \ pre-fall activity being\nperformed. Using this scheme, segments were extracted\
    \ for all the fall trials in the\ndataset.\nThere are a total of 1798 fall samples\
    \ in the dataset, after the labeling used, there\nwere a total of 838 samples\
    \ for the forward fall category, 360 samples for the backward\nfall category and\
    \ 600 samples for the lateral fall category. Sample waveforms for the\nthree directions\
    \ of falls and three severity levels have been shown in Appendix A.\nFeature Extraction\n\
    Feature extraction is used to convert inputs in to more useful representations.\
    \ In\nthis experiment, we take cue from the work of [420, 470] who use various\
    \ time and\nfrequency domain features successfully for fall detection and recognition\
    \ of activities\nof daily living. Table 35 lists the features computed for each\
    \ extracted segment. Each\nof these features have been computed for every axis\
    \ of the considered accelerometer\nand gyroscope sensor measurements.\nTable 35.\

    \ Density RMS\nPercentiles (25th Percentile, 75th Percentile) and Interquartile\
    \ Range\nFor a set of numerical values X ordered in arranged ascending order,\
    \ the ith percentile\nis defined as the number n below which i percent of the\
    \ total numbers of X fall below\nit. Therefore, the 25th Percentile (also called\
    \ the First Quartile) is the number in X\nbelow which exactly 25% of the values\
    \ fall. Similarly, 75th Percentile (also called\nthe Third Quartile) is the number\
    \ in X below which exactly 75% of the values fall.\nAnother important quantity\
    \ concerning percentiles is the Interquartile Range (IQ\n94\nRange), also called\
    \ the Midspread. The IQ Range is the difference between the 75th\nPercentiles\
    \ and the 25th Percentiles.\nDelta\nThe Delta represents the difference between\
    \ the minimum and maximum\nvalue of a set of numeric values X.\nKurtosis\nIt’s\
    \ a metric for how much a distribution’s tails diverge from that of\na normal\
    \ distribution. A large Kurtosis values indicates to larger extremity of the\n\
    divergences which can be thought of as outliers. The Kurtosis for a set of numerical\n\
    values X can be calculated as given in Eq. 2.\nKurtosis(X) =\n1\nNσ4\nN\nX\ni=1\n\
    (xi − µ)4\n(2)\nMean\nFor a set of values X, the arithmetic mean or the average\
    \ returns the\ncenter value of X. Mathematically it is given in Eq. 3.\nMean(X)\
    \ =\nPN\ni=1 xi\nN\n(3)\nMedian\nFor a set of values X, the median indicates to\
    \ the central tendency of\nX. It divides a set of values in to two equal parts.\
    \ For a set X of size N arranged in\nascending order, the median can be calculated\
    \ as in Eq. 4.\nMedian(X) = X[N + 1\n2\n]\n(4)\nMaximum\nFor a set of values X,\
    \ the maximum value represents the largest\nvalue in the set X.\nMinimum\nFor\
    \ a set of values X, the minimum value represents the smallest\nvalue in the set\
    \ X.\nSkewness\nThe Skewness measures the lack of symmetry in the probability\
    \ dis-\ntribution of data around its mean. It is calculated as in Eq. 5.\nSkewness(X)\
    \ =\n1\nNσ3\nN\nX\ni=1\n(xi − µ)3\n(5)\nStandard Deviation and Variance\nThe Standard\
    \ Deviation measures the\nvariation of a set of numerical values around its mean.\
    \ For a set of numerical values\nX, the standard deviation can be calculated as\
    \ in Eq. 6.\n95\nStd(X) =\nsPN\ni=1(xi − µ)2\nN\n(6)\nwhere µ is the Mean of X.\
    \ The Variance of X is the square of the Standard\nDeviation.\nPower Spectral\
    \ Density\nThe Power Spectral Density (PSD) is an indication\nto the power content\
    \ of a signal with respect to its frequency. It therefore helps to\nunderstand\
    \ the distribution of power in the signal for the different frequencies that\n\
    comprise it. The PSD has been computed using the Welch method [471]. Once the\n\
    PSD has been computed, the mean, median and Root Mean Squared (RMS) values\nof\
    \ the PSD are computed.\nPower Spectral Entropy\nThe Power Spectral Entropy (PSE)\
    \ is a measure of\nthe entropy in the power spectrum of a signal and indicates\
    \ to the complexity present\ntherein. It is computed as an entropy calculation\
    \ on the normalized PSD estimate.\nSimilar to the PSD computation, the Welch method\
    \ was used to estimate the PSD\nbefore PSE calculations were performed.\nThe aforementioned\
    \ quantities were computed for all windowed samples of the fall\nrecordings. In\
    \ total, this resulted in 96 features being computed for each segment.\nBefore\
    \ these features are passed on to the next stage, normalization was performed\n\
    feature wise for each sensor.\nFeature Selection\nFeature selection is an important\
    \ step in the machine learning pipeline. It not only\nhelps to reduce the feature\
    \ set size used in an application which helps computationally\nbut may also result\
    \ in performance improvement as observed by [472]. Feature se-\nlection is performed\
    \ using Random Forest Recursive Feature Elimination (RF-RFE)\n[473] which involves\
    \ determining the importance of features by eliminating features\niteratively\
    \ and looking at classifier performance. It starts by developing a model us-\n\
    ing all the available features within the dataset, in every iteration, the feature\
    \ that\nhas the ’least importance/contribution’ is discarded and a new model is\
    \ fitted with\nthe remaining features. This process is carried out until a pre-decided\
    \ number of\nfeatures remain. Since in this work, our goal is to reduce the number\
    \ of features\nfrom the original count, we perform manual tests by establishing\
    \ a baseline for the\nperformance of our models. The baseline is formed by using\
    \ all features for each\nof our classification tasks and using the highest weighted\
    \ F1-score achieved as the\nperformance goal cut-off for the reduction of features.\
    \ This step will ensure that we\natleast get the same performance as the original\
    \ feature set.\nClassification\nClassification refers to the usage of a classification\
    \ algorithm, also called a classifier\n96\nto determine the output ’label’ or\
    \ category given a set of input values called features.\nIn the current setting,\
    \ the classification problem is a supervised one wherein the\nclassifier is provided\
    \ inputs and their corresponding output labels which allow it\nto learn the relationship\
    \ between the input and the output.\nOnce this mapping\nhas been sufficiently\
    \ learned (a process called training) the trained classifier can\nbe provided\
    \ unlabeled inputs for it to predict an output label value or class. The\nefficacy\
    \ of the classifier in predicting the correct output is measured through various\n\
    metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score etc. This experiment consists\
    \ of\ntwo classification experiments being performed, one is the direction only\
    \ experiment\nwhere the classifiers used are trained to distinguish between the\
    \ three direction of falls\ngiven the input feature set and another experiment\
    \ where the classifiers are trained\nto determine fall directions and severity\
    \ together.\nFour different classifiers were tested to perform these tasks, these\
    \ are the Random\nForest Classifier, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees and\
    \ Extreme Gradient\nBoost (XGBoost). All of the classifiers were trained using\
    \ five fold cross validation\nwith a stratified split and a parameter search being\
    \ performed for tuning purposes.\nSupport Vector Machines\nSupport Vector Machine\
    \ is a supervised learning\nalgorithm that, in its simplest form tries to fit\
    \ a line in between data samples of two\ndifferent classes to separate them. The\
    \ criteria used by the SVM to fit this line is\nthe maximization of the distance\
    \ between the line and the (data) points closest to it.\nThis concept of using\
    \ a line to separate two dimensional data can be extended to two\ndimensional\
    \ planes being used for separating three-dimensional data and hyperplanes\nfor\
    \ higher dimensional data. SVMs are quite flexible in that they can not only be\
    \ used\nto work with linearly separable data but also with data that is not linearly\
    \ separable.\nThis is achieved using Kernel functions which map the nonlinearly\
    \ distributed data\nin to a higher dimensional space to make it linearly separable\
    \ (as much as possible).\nThere are several kernel functions available to be used\
    \ for this purpose such as the\nhyperbolic tangent, radial basis, sigmoid, polynomial\
    \ etc. Optimizing the SVM re-\nquires the tuning of the cost parameter C, a small\
    \ value of C indicates an underfit\nwhereas a very large value of C indicates\
    \ an overfit.\nEven though, the current experiment considers using SVMs for a\
    \ classification\ntaks, it should also be mentioned that SVM’s are not limited\
    \ to application towards\nclassification problems and they have also been used\
    \ for regression applications too.\nDecision Tree\nDecision Trees are one of the\
    \ most widely used classification\nalgorithms due to their interpretability. The\
    \ aim of the algorithm is to come up with\nas simple a solution as possible while\
    \ successively dividing the data in to simpler and\nsimpler classification tasks\
    \ based on the values of the features. For a classification\nproblem, given a\
    \ set of input features of the training set, decision trees use the values\nof\
    \ the features to divide or split the dataset in to more simpler sub problems.\
    \ The\naim being to get the largest information gain when choosing the feature/s\
    \ for the\nsplit. Each split point in a decision tree is called a node and each\
    \ split is called a\nbranch. Branches from a given node represent all the possible\
    \ outcomes from that\n97\nnode and may contain subsequent decision nodes as well\
    \ which are called child nodes.\nEach branch ends at a node called the leaf node\
    \ where data points are assigned a\nclass label.\nDepending on the number of input\
    \ features and the output classes, decision trees\ncan be built to classify the\
    \ dataset in a ’complete’ manner due to its iterative parti-\ntioning scheme.\
    \ However, this is undesirable since that would lead to overfitting of the\nmodel\
    \ and also because such trees would lead to a complicated model, which is not\n\
    desirable since that would impact interpretability. The process of removing branches\n\
    and replacing them by leaf nodes is called pruning. Pruning aims to increase the\n\
    models generalizations capabilities and increase robustness. Two paramters which\n\
    are used for this purpose are tree depth limits the number of child nodes present\
    \ in\nevery branch and the number of features used at each split.\nRandom Forest\
    \ Classifier\nRandom forest is a bagging approach towards de-\ncision trees where\
    \ instead of deciding on where to split for each node, for each tree\na random\
    \ subset of features is used and the feature/threshold to split the data is\n\
    determined within that subset of features to separate the data in the best manner\n\
    possible. This process is repeated multiple times which results in various trees\
    \ pro-\nducing possibly different predictions. The predictions from each tree\
    \ are combined\nto form an ensemble either through majority voting or by averaging.\
    \ The imple-\nmentation of Random Forests used in this work uses the averaging\
    \ approach. There\nare several parameters that are important in the tuning of\
    \ Random Forests are the\nnumber of trees created before the averaging process\
    \ starts, the number of levels in\neach tree and more.\nExtreme Gradient Boost\n\
    Extreme Gradient Boost is another ensemble based\ntree algorithm, however compared\
    \ to the RFC, XGBoost uses boosting instead of\nbagging. In boosting, the input\
    \ samples are uniformly weighted and first a ’weak’\nlearner (classifier) is created\
    \ for a given task that doesnt perform well but is sufficient\nin the sense that\
    \ it is better than random guessing. In subsequent iterations of the\nlearner,\
    \ input samples which werent classified correctly by the learner are reweighted\n\
    by assigning larger weights to them while the weights for correctly classified\
    \ inputs\nis reduced. This step is repeated for a number of times with different\
    \ weak learners\nbeing trained.\nThe decision of the weak learners are combined\
    \ through majority\nvoting to determine the output class. Parameters used to tune\
    \ XGBoost are the\nmaximum depth allowed in each tree, the weight settings etc.\n\
    2.8.1.3\nResults\nAs mentioned previously, two separate experiments were conducted,\
    \ first was to dif-\nferentiate between fall directions only and the other to\
    \ differentiate between fall\ndirection as well as severity. The results from\
    \ those experiments are presented here.\nThe metrics considered for judging model\
    \ quality is the F1-score. The F1-score is the\nharmonic mean of the precision\
    \ and recall and is given as in Eq. 7.\n98\nF1 Score = 2 ∗ (Precision ∗ Recall)\n\
    Precision + Recall\n(7)\nwhere Precision is the ratio of the True positive samples\
    \ divided by the sum of the\nTrue positive and False positive samples as given\
    \ in Eq. 8. It is also called positive\npredictive value as it indicates to the\
    \ capability of the classifier to identify correctly\nthe samples of a given class.\n\
    Precision =\nTrue Positive\nTrue Positive + False Positive\n(8)\nand recall indicates\
    \ to the models capability to identify the samples of a given\nclass over the\
    \ whole dataset. It is also called the sensitivity and is the ratio of the\nTrue\
    \ positives to the sum of the True positives and False Negatives as shown in Eq.\n\
    9.\nRecall =\nTrue Positive\nTrue Positive + False Negative\n(9)\nWe report on\
    \ the F1-scores for each class when discussing classification perfor-\nmance and\
    \ deciding on the best classifier. Moreover, for the best classifier identified\n\
    the precision and recall have also been provided.\nFall direction\nIn this experiment,\
    \ fall segments labeled for direction only were used as input to the\nclassifiers.\
    \ To establish a baseline to be used as a reference in the feature selection\n\
    process, all computed features (96 in total) were passed to the four classifiers.\
    \ The\nbest performing model was found to be the SVM with a weighted F1-score\
    \ of 90.4%.\nFeature selection was then performed keeping in view baseline performance\
    \ of the\nSVM classifier so as to retain or improve this performance baseline\
    \ when choosing a\ngiven number of ’top’ features. Following this rule, feature\
    \ selection resulted in 90\nfeatures. The results are given in Table 36. It can\
    \ be observed from the table that\nthe SVM has outperformed the other algorithms\
    \ in detecting forward and lateral falls\nwhereas it achieves a slightly lower\
    \ F1-score for the backward fall class. Overall the\nSVM has shown to be better\
    \ at discriminating falls with direction.\nTable 36. Fall F1-scores (Fall direction\

    \ experiment, fall segments from the dataset were labeled for direction and\n\
    severity based on the labeling shown in Table 34 and passed to each of the classifiers\n\
    after feature selection. Like before, to establish a baseline, all computed features\
    \ (96\nin total) were passed to the four classifiers. The best weighted F1-score\
    \ of 78.44% was\nachieved by the SVM classifier. We used this value as the baseline\
    \ we aim to achieve\nafter feature selection. With this condition the number of\
    \ features were reduced to\n93. The performance achieved for each of the four\
    \ tested classifers is summarized in\nTable 37. It can be observed that the SVM\
    \ is the best performing classifier for all fall\ntypes bar FHF where the random\
    \ forest classifer achieves a slightly higher F1-score.\nThe highest F1-score\
    \ overall is achieved for the class BSF where as the lowest has\nbeen achieved\
    \ for LHF. When looking at fall direction, falls in the forward direction\ncan\
    \ be seen to be the hardest to identify followed by lateral falls. No such pattern\n\
    can be noted for soft/hard falls.\nTable 37. Fall F1-scores (Fall severity and\

    Discussion\nTo summarize the results from both experiments, we present the individual\
    \ F1-\nscores, Precision and Recall for the best performing classifier in each\
    \ case. These\nhave been presented in Table 38 and Table 39.\nTable 38. Best Results:\

    92.46\nIn both cases the best performing classifier was the SVM. This is inline\
    \ with\nthe findings of other research work as found from the literature review\
    \ [424, 429].\nA surprising outcome during this work was the unsatisfactory performance\
    \ of tree\nbased algorithms contrary to [420], we attribute this to the difference\
    \ in the data\nsegmentation scheme and also the fact that we follow different\
    \ labelling for the data\n100\nTable 39. Best Results: Fall direction and Severity\n\

    in terms of a direction and severity aware system. Moreover, the final weighted\
    \ F1-\nscores for the fall direction experiment was 92% and for the fall direction\
    \ and severity\nwas 79.53% which resulted in an improvement of just above 1% in\
    \ both cases with a\nsmall reduction in the number of features utilized, 90 and\
    \ 93 respectively compared to\n96 in the original feature set. Commenting on the\
    \ direction, the hardest to predict fall\nwas in the lateral direction and the\
    \ classifier incorrectly predicted forward falls and\nlateral falls in both the\
    \ scenarios tested. This highlights the difficulty in capturing\nthe difference\
    \ between these two fall directions using the features considered.\n2.8.2\nFall\
    \ Detection with Severity and Direction along with ADL consid-\neration using\
    \ Wavelet Pooling and K-NN\nThis section provides a framework for a fall and activity\
    \ recognition system. It aims\nto determine an appropriate sensor modality to\
    \ use and the window size to be used\nfor the task. The framework does this as\
    \ a problem of differentiating between various\nactivities of daily living as\
    \ well as various types of falls with regard to fall datection\nbeing direction\
    \ and severity aware. To do this, data from the SisFall dataset is used\nand after\
    \ suitable pre-processing and feature extraction, machine learning algorithms\n\
    are utilized to differentiate between different activities of daily living and\
    \ falls\n2.8.2.1\nData Labeling\nSince we aim to perform activity recognition\
    \ and fall detection with direction and\nseverity, the ADL labeling of the original\
    \ dataset has been modified. This labeling\nhas been shown in Table 40. As can\
    \ be observed from Table 40, the activities Walking\n(W), Jogging (J), Sitting\
    \ (S) and Standing (SB) have been considered for this work\nwhich are typical\
    \ activities in ADL detection problems. Each of these labels includes\ndata from\
    \ multiple original activities, for e.g. activities with original labels of walking\n\
    upstairs and downstairs, walking slowly and walking quickly have been considered\
    \ as\nwalking in this work. A similar scheme has been used for the other three\
    \ activity\nlabels as well. Some of the activities such as being on one’s back\
    \ change to lateral\nposition, wait a moment, and change to one’s back (D14),\
    \ getting in and out of the\ncar (D17), stumble while walking (D18), and gently\
    \ jumping without falling while\ntrying to reach a high object (D19) have not\
    \ been considered. The reason for this\nis that they have very few samples to\
    \ be considered as standalone activities (only\none type of sub-activity and also\
    \ because most of these are not considered in typical\n101\nADL detection scenarios).\
    \ For falls, the labeling same as that for the direction and\nseverity experiment\
    \ has been retained.\nTable 40. ADL Labels used for SisFall Recordings.\nActivity\

    \ work with individual parts being elab-\norated upon in the proceeding subsections.\
    \ As can be seen, the first stage consists of\ndata preprocessing, followed by\
    \ feature extraction and then evaluation or classifica-\ntion.\nData Preprocessing\n\
    Data preprocessing for this experiment was performed in a similar manner to section\n\
    2.8.1 for most recordings. The SMV was computed for the complete recording and\n\
    windowed segments of a fixed duration were extracted.\nWindowed segments are\n\
    extracted in this manner from all considered activities in the SisFall dataset\
    \ except\nthe activities of D01, D02, D03 and D04 which consist of a single trial\
    \ per subject of\nduration 100s. In such cases, continuous windowed segments of\
    \ duration n seconds\nare extracted from the recordings. It is also pertinent\
    \ to mention here that since\nboth accelerometers are placed at the same position,\
    \ we only consider one of the\naccelerometers along with the gyroscope readings\
    \ present in the recorded trials. To\ndetermine the value of n as well as the\
    \ appropriate sensor modality to use for the\nfinal system, experiments were performed\
    \ on the developed framework and the results\nhave been discussed in subsequent\
    \ sections.\nFeature extraction\nIn this experiment, feature extraction consists\

    \ wavelet decomposition and then performing pooling,\nthe inspiration for this\
    \ type of feature extraction came from the work of [475].\n103\nWavelet Decomposition\n\
    Wavelets can be used for a variety of applications\nsuch as spectral analysis\
    \ where they are used to analye a signal in the time-frequency\ndomain, denoising,\
    \ compression and signal enhancement. A wavelet is a function of\nfinite duration\
    \ and has an average value of zero, an example of a mexican hat wavelet\nis shown\
    \ in Figure. 19. The width of the wavelet is called its scale and it is analogous\n\
    to frequency in an inverse manner. A large value of the scale (wider window) allows\n\
    for capturing of low frequency components of the signal whereas a small scale\
    \ value\ncaptures low frequency components.\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0.2\n0.1\n\

    \ (Mexican Hat).\nWavelets are convolved with an input signal to produce two sets\
    \ of coefficients.\nThese are called the detail and approximation coefficients.\
    \ The detail component\nrepresents the high frequency component captured by the\
    \ wavelet whereas the ap-\nproximation component represents the low frequency\
    \ part. Since the wavelet has\nonly been convolved once with the signal, these\
    \ coefficients are said to be level 1\ncoefficients. At each level, resulting\
    \ coefficients are downsampled by half to result in\na lower resolution signal.\
    \ Subsequent approximation components can be convolved\nwith the wavelet to result\
    \ in approximation and detail components for the next level\nthus forming what\
    \ is called a wavelet decomposition tree.\nTo perform wavelet decomposition, in\
    \ this experiment, we make use of the Haar\nwavelet [476] shown in Figure. 20.\
    \ Level 4 haar wavelets were computed for each of\nthe extracted segments of the\
    \ signals.\nSpatial Pooling\nThe results from the decomposition provide a large\
    \ number\nof features which would pose a problem for use in the proceeding classification\
    \ stage.\nIn order to reduce the feature dimension size, Spatial Pyramid Pooling\
    \ [477] was\nused. Spatial Pyramid Pooling is an adaptive pooling method which\
    \ was developed\nto address the issue of fluctuating input sizes in CNNs for image-based\
    \ applications,\nand it entails converting varying-size convolutional feature\
    \ maps into fixed-length\nsummarizations. These summarizations, having uniform\
    \ length can then be passed\non to the fully connected parts of the CNN where\
    \ a fixed length input is necessary.\n104\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n\

    Figure 20. Haar Wavelet.\nGiven a pooling size pxp, adaptive pooling works by\
    \ dividing the input in to pxp pieces\nwhile computing the size of each piece\
    \ automatically and performing any necessary\npadding. Once these pieces are created,\
    \ a pooling operation is typically performed\n(max pooling or average pooling\
    \ for e.g.) on each of these pieces to summarize the\ninput into an output of\
    \ fixed size pxp. This results in a fixed output length for any\nsize of the input.\
    \ In this experiment, 4-2-1 1D Spatial Pyramid pooling was used\non the detail\
    \ and approximation coefficients of the wavelet decomposition of activity\nand\
    \ fall data. This process has been shown in Figure 21. Each coefficient set was\n\
    divided in to four and two parts and then max pooling was used to determine the\n\
    maximum value in these divided parts and the coefficient set as a whole.\nThese\n\
    maximum values were then concatenated together to form the seven valued output\n\
    from that coefficient set. Furthermore, the results for each coefficient set within\
    \ each\naxis were also concatenated to form the feature vector for a sensor axis\
    \ measurement.\nThis operation was performed for each axis of accelerometer and\
    \ groscope sensor\ndata with the final feature vector of 210 values consisting\
    \ of the concatenations of\nthe individual vectors for each axis. It is hypothesized\
    \ that this way local as well as\nglobal information at each level of the wavelet\
    \ coefficients can be captured. For the\nwavelet decomposition, tests were performed\
    \ with level values of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 and\nit was determined that level-4 produced\
    \ the best results.\nClassification\nA hierarchical classification approach is\
    \ employed to discriminate between the vari-\nous activities and falls considered\
    \ from the SisFall dataset. Hierarchical classification\ninvolves the division\
    \ of a complex taxonomic classification problem in to a set of\nsubsets that are\
    \ potentially easier to differentiate as the task becomes more localized.\nHierarchical\
    \ classifiers have been used in multiple different applications [478] where\n\
    they have been found to improve upon the performance of many flat classification\n\
    schemes. The classification framework used in this work combines hierarchical\
    \ clas-\nsification with a vote based system. The classification problem is divided\
    \ into three\nparts, each with its own classifier to indicate to the subclass\
    \ of the output. The clas-\n105\nMaxpooling Size = 4\nMaxpooling Size = 2\nMaxpooling\

    \ 1-D Spatial Pyramid Pooling.\nsifier in part one consists of differentiating\
    \ whether a given recording is a fall or one\nof the four considered ADLs. In\
    \ order to train this stage, the activities of Standing,\nWalking, Sitting and\
    \ Jogging along with all falls combined in to one class are passed\nto the classifier.\
    \ This dilutes the original ten-class problems in to a five-class sub\nproblem.\
    \ The output of this stage is the determination of whether a given recording\n\
    is either one of the four ADLs (Standing, Walking, Sitting or Jogging) or a fall.\
    \ If a\nrecording has been detected to be a fall, it is sent to the second and\
    \ third stages.\nThe second and third stages work in parallel on samples detected\
    \ as falls from\n106\nthe first stage in the form of a voting machine. These two\
    \ stages vote individually\non the direction and severity of the detected fall\
    \ samples. In order to train them,\nfall samples were relabeled to represent direction\
    \ and severity only and are fed to the\nclassifiers. For the direction, the classification\
    \ problem is formulated as a three-class\nproblem of determining fall directions\
    \ as being Forward, Backward or Lateral. For\nthe severity classifier, the classification\
    \ problem is formulated as a two-class problem\nof a fall being either Soft or\
    \ Hard. After a signal has passed through all necessary\nstages, the outputs of\
    \ the individual stages are combined to indicate to the activity\nor type of fall\
    \ being fed at the input.\nFour classifiers were tested for each part of the hierarchical\
    \ scheme, the classifiers\nconsidered were K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector\
    \ Machines, Random Forests\nand eXtreme Gradient Boosting. Parameter tuning was\
    \ performed using gradient\nsearch for each classifier over a range of values\
    \ for each parameter.\nK-Nearest Neighbor\nCompared to the SVM which attempts\
    \ to create a deci-\nsion boundary between classes on a global level, the K-NN\
    \ algorithm operates locally.\nStarting from a data point, the 1 Nearest Neigbhor\
    \ algorithm will assign each new\nsample the class of its neighbor. However, using\
    \ a single neighborhood point to assign\nnew classes may lead to erroneous classes\
    \ being assigned. Therefore, typically mul-\ntiple neighboring points are used\
    \ to determine the label for a given point. In K-NN,\n’K’ represents the number\
    \ of points used in the neighborhood to assign labels to data\nsamples. Each considered\
    \ sample is assigned the majority label within a neighbor-\nhood of K points around\
    \ it. In this manner, the K-NN algorithm is successively able\nto create a decision\
    \ boundary separating the data in to the different output classes.\n2.8.2.3\n\
    Results\nThree experiments were performed in this section. The first was to choose\
    \ the best\nclassifier to use, once that was determined. experiments were conducted\
    \ to determine\nthe observation window size and different combination of sensor\
    \ modalities. We used\nthe weighted F1-score as our training metric due to the\
    \ imbalance in the samples\nof the different classes in the data. Moreover, for\
    \ evaluation purposes, we report on\nthe individual F1-scores for each output\
    \ class and provide discussions as necessary.\nFurthermore, for the best performing\
    \ results, the Precision and Recall and Specificity\nwere also specified. Specificity\
    \ can be calculated as given in Eq. 10. It is also called\nthe True Negative Rate\
    \ and indicates to a classifiers capability to correctly detect\nsamples which\
    \ don’t belong to a given class. These metrics have been computed on\na one versus\
    \ all basis.\nSpecificity =\nTrue Negative\nTrue Negative + False Positive\n(10)\n\
    The data after the feature extraction stage was split in to a train/test partition\n\
    based on a 75/25 ratio with a parameter grid being searched through to obtain\n\
    107\ntuning parameters for maximizing the weighted F1-score while using five-fold\
    \ cross\nvalidation.\nClassifier Selection\nThis test was conducted to determine\
    \ the best classifier to use for the proceeding\nexperiments of observation window\
    \ selection and sensor modality selection. Here,\nexperiments were performed for\
    \ the considered window durations for each activity\nand the classifier which\
    \ provided the best performance overall was chosen. The mean\nF1-scores for each\
    \ output class for each classifier are shown in Figure 22. It can be\nobserved\
    \ that in general K-NN and SVM perform better compared to the ensemble\nmodels,\
    \ the RFC and XGBoost. However, since the K-NN slightly outperforms the\nSVM in\
    \ eight of the ten considered classes, we choose K-NN as the classifier for this\n\
    framework.\nBHF\nBSF\nFHF\nFSF\nJ\nLHF\nLSF\nS\nSB\nW\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n\

    \ Window Duration\nAn important consideration in working with activity recognition\
    \ systems is to de-\ntermine the appropriate observation window size for the analysis\
    \ of sensor signals\nto accomplish the ADL recognition/fall detection task. The\
    \ size of the observation\nwindow is important as a smaller observation window\
    \ increases the response time of\nthe activity recognition/fall detection system\
    \ and it can also impact the time taken\nin the computation of features. In order\
    \ to find the best observation window size,\nwe perform experiments using five\
    \ values, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 seconds. The classification\nresults in terms of the\
    \ F1-score are presented in Table 41. For each case, samples\nof duration equal\
    \ to half of the observation window were extracted around the peak\nvalue of the\
    \ SMV. From the table, it can be observed that an observation window\n108\nof\
    \ size 3 seconds produces the best results for six out of the ten output classes.\
    \ It\nonly produces poorer results for the classes BHF, BSF and S, SB where window\
    \ sizes\nof 2 seconds, 6 seconds and 4 seconds respectively perform better than\
    \ the 3 second\nwindowing case. Upon further investigation of this phenomenon\
    \ using the result of\nother classifiers, it was observed that the activities\
    \ of (BHF and BHF) were best rec-\nognized by all the classifiers with a window\
    \ size of 2 seconds (for the case of K-NN,\nthere is a small difference between\
    \ the 2 second and 6 second case), for the other two\nactivities of S and SB too\
    \ the F1-score was obtained for the 4 second duration (for\nthe activity S, the\
    \ difference in performance over windows larger than 4 seconds is\nvery small).\
    \ This could be attributed to the feature aggregation process in the max\npooling\
    \ operation in the different spatial segments.\nTable 41. Performance for different\

    Sensor Modality\nThe second experiment in designing the proposed system is the\
    \ determination of\nthe best sensor modality to use.\nUsing a single sensor would\
    \ result in less data,\nfaster processing and reduced hardware costs compared\
    \ to the multisensor approach\ncombining accelerometer and gyroscope. To do this,\
    \ the classification framework was\ntested with 3 second windowed segments of\
    \ the combined acceleromter and gyroscope\ndata as well as data of the accelerometer\
    \ and gyroscope sensors individually. The\nresults of this experiment are presented\
    \ in Table 42. It can be observed that using\na combination of both accelerometer\
    \ and gyroscope data together produces the best\nresults for eight of the ten\
    \ output classes. An accelerometer-only system produces\nbetter results for the\
    \ detection of activity SB and the fall FHF. The outcome of this\nexperiment agrees\
    \ with previous work for fall detection by Waheed et. al. [436] on\nthe SisFall\
    \ dataset.\n2.8.2.4\nDiscussion\nTable 43 reports on the best results obtained\

    \ 43, the best recognized ADLs are W and J whereas the best rec-\nognized fall\
    \ is BSF. The worst performing class in ADLs is SB whereas the worst\nperforming\
    \ fall is LHF. Upon further inspection of the cause of the bad performance\nwith\
    \ LHF, looking at the confusion matrix, it was observed that LHF was most\ncommonly\
    \ confused with FSF which resulted in a reduction of the classification per-\n\
    formance for this class. On the other hand, in the case of FSF (the second worse\n\
    performing class), looking at the confusion matrix, it was observed that FSF was\n\
    confused with LSF and FHF. Furthermore, the specificity values indicate that there\n\
    has been very little mis-identification for each of the classes. When talking\
    \ about\nthe activity S, it was observed that samples from this activity were\
    \ confused with\nthe activity W which resulted in the sub-par performance of the\
    \ classifier for its\nrecognition.\n110\n2.8.3\nFall Detection with Severity and\
    \ Direction along with ADL consid-\neration using CNN-XGBoost\nThis section presents\
    \ a scheme for performing fall detection considering fall direction\nand severity\
    \ as well as activity recognition. Inertial sensor data taken from the SisFall\n\
    dataset is used to develop the methodology. Data pre-processing is first carried\
    \ out\nin terms of windowing and relabeling. Then, data augmentation is carried\
    \ out for\nclasses which do not have a sufficient number of samples. Lastly, feature\
    \ extraction is\nperformed along with classification. This work considers fall\
    \ and activity recognition\nas a holistic problem, in that different types of\
    \ falls and activities are considered\nthereby producing a more ’complete’ recognition\
    \ system for use in cyber-physical\nsystems. Moreover, towards this end, a CNN-XGBoost\
    \ combination is proposed.\n2.8.3.1\nMethodology\nThe proposed scheme follows\
    \ a typical deep learning so-\nlution framework. First, inertial sensor data from\
    \ the IMU sensors contained within\nthe SisFall dataset is pre-processed to extract\
    \ windowed segments, then data aug-\nmentation is performed for minority classes,\
    \ followed by feature extraction and then\nclassification. This has been illustrated\
    \ in Figure 23 and a discussion is provided for\neach of the steps in the proceeding\
    \ sections.\nData Pre-processing\nBefore the IMU sensor recordings can be used\
    \ for ADL and fall detection, raw sensor\nmeasurements need to be suitably processed.\
    \ In this experiment, data pre-processing\nconsists of two steps, the first is\
    \ the extraction of uniform sized windows as was\nperformed in the previous section\
    \ from the IMU recordings and the next is data\naugmentation. Since windowing\
    \ of the signals has already been discussed previously,\nonly data augmentation\
    \ is discussed here.\nData Augmentation\nThe use of deep learning methods require\
    \ a suitable\namount of data to be present for them to learn the data pattern\
    \ sufficiently well. Un-\nfortunately, due to the nature of the problem considered,\
    \ the relabeled data from the\nSisFall dataset contains a reduced amount of data\
    \ for some of the classes, especially\nfall classes and also for the ADL of Standing.\
    \ In order to alleviate this shortcom-\ning, data augmentation was employed to\
    \ increase the number of samples from these\nclasses. Three augmentations were\
    \ performed for each of the extracted recordings\nfor the classes SB, FHF, FSF,\
    \ BHF, BSF, LHFand LSF. These were the addition of\nnoise, scaling and resampling\
    \ after inerpolation [439]. For augmentation with noise,\nwhite gaussian noise\
    \ was added to the extracted windows of the considered classes.\nThe noise was\
    \ generated using a standard deviation equal to 0.01. The addition of\nthe noise\
    \ simulates measurement noise during recording which might be encountered\nwhen\
    \ IMU based fall detection systems are employed. For scale based augmentation,\n\
    the original extracted window was multiplied by a random number from the uniform\n\
    distribution between 0.8 and 1.2 thereby scaling it between 80% and 120% of its\
    \ orig-\ninal form. By doing so, changes in amplitude over the same type of activity/fall\
    \ are\nincorporated. This could indicate to a change in fixation (loosening etc)\
    \ of the sensing\n111\nPeak SMV Detection\nWindowing\nCNN\nXGBoost Classifier\n\

    \ different physique and subsequent fall intensity response.\nLastly, in order\
    \ to incorporate sampling inconsistencies, the windows are first upsam-\npled\
    \ and then downsampled. This was done by a scale of ten. With this strategy,\n\
    each from original window were produced three additional samples. An illustration\n\
    for the results of the augmentation process for an X-axis accelerometer measurement\n\
    for a lateral fall has been shown in Figure 24.\nFeature extraction\nThe aim of\
    \ feature extraction for a classification problem is to produce a representa-\n\
    tion of the input that can be better used to indicate to the output class. In\
    \ this regard,\nresearch in the area of fall detection with inertial sensors has\
    \ made use of different\ntypes of hand crafted features such as statistical, time\
    \ and frequency domain as well\nas wavelet transforms [479, 480, 481, 482]. Convolutional\
    \ Neural Networks (CNNs\nor Covnets) are a set of neural networks developed following\
    \ the visual cortex within\nthe brain [483]. CNNs perform operations on inputs\
    \ by introducing convolutions of\n112\nFigure 24.\nIllustration of data augmentation.\n\
    (X component of Accelerometer,\nLateral Fall)\nseveral filters with learnable\
    \ weights to gauge the importance of each datapoint in\nthe input. These layers\
    \ containing the filters and to which the input is provided are\ncalled convolutional\
    \ layers. Through these learnable weights, CNNs are able to cap-\nture temporal\
    \ and spatial dependencies of the input. Moreover, using the same filters\nfor\
    \ different inputs reduces the number of parameters as the weights are reused.\
    \ This\nallows CNNs to develop a deeper understanding of the provided input compared\
    \ to\ntypical multilayer perceptron models. CNNs have revolutionized the field\
    \ of computer\nvision where they have been used for a variety of tasks such as\
    \ classification, object\ndetection, segmentation and object counting [484, 485]\
    \ and they have also successfully\nbeen used for applications within the speech\
    \ and other time series signal application\ndomain [486, 487, 488]. In this experiment,\
    \ rather than using hand crafted features\n113\nas in the previous experiments,\
    \ a CNN has been used to perform feature extraction\nin order to take advantage\
    \ of the spatial and temporal dependency capturing capa-\nbilities of CNNs. CNNs\
    \ are usually comprised of several convolutional (Conv) layers.\nWithin a multilayer\
    \ CNN, the earlier Conv layers capture low level features from the\ninput with\
    \ more complex features being computed by the successive layers. Also,\nCNNs may\
    \ employ pooling layers between convolutional layers so as to reduce the\nsize\
    \ of the input passed on to successive layers and therefore reduce computation.\n\
    The proposed network along with the XGBoost classification stage is illustrated\
    \ in\nFigure 25.\nConv\n64 filters (3x1)\nConv\n64 filters (3x1)\nConv\n64 filters\

    XGB classification\nStage\nFigure 25. CNN Network for feature extraction and XGBoost\
    \ classification stage.\nAs seen from the figure, the network consists of four\
    \ Conv layers of 64 filters\neach.\nThese layers have filters of size 3x1 and\
    \ are used to extract features from\nraw inertial sensor measurements. Each Conv\
    \ layer is followed by a Relu activation\nfunction which applies a non-linearity\
    \ to the output of the Conv layers. To condense\nthe output of the first three\
    \ Conv layers, a pooling layer is utilized. Instead of max\npooling, average pooling\
    \ is used in this network. Max pooling picks out the largest\nvalue of the patch\
    \ of data being observed currently, in contrast, average pooling uses\nthe average\
    \ of the data being observed. Average pooling has been successfully used in\n\
    114\nplace of max pooling in a variety of scenarios [489, 490]. Normalization\
    \ is performed\nusing a batch normalization layer for each Conv layer. The output\
    \ of the last Conv\nlayer are feature maps derived from the input raw inertial\
    \ sensor measurements from\nboth the accelerometer and the gyroscope.\nClassification\n\
    Classification is carried out by using a eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) clas-\n\
    sifier. The output from the CNN is first flattened and then provided as an input\
    \ to\nthe XGBoost stage. The parameters of the XGBoost classifier are tuned through\
    \ a\nparameter search over a range of values. We make use of an XGBoost classifier\
    \ due\nto its suitability for a large dimensional input which results from the\
    \ flattened CNN\noutput.\n2.8.3.2\nResults\nIn order to use the proposed CNN for\
    \ feature extraction, it must first be trained\naccordingly. In order to train\
    \ the network, a fully connected layer with a softmax\noutput was added as the\
    \ final stage to serve as the intermediate temporary output\ndeterminant stage.\
    \ The windowed data from the SisFall dataset was divided in to\nthree sets, train,\
    \ validation and test in a stratified manner. A learning rate of 0.01\nwas used\
    \ for the network with a batch size of 20 and the stochastic gradient descent\n\
    was used as the optimizer. Moreover, the metric chosen was the average of the\
    \ recall\nscores of all classes together, also called as the unweighted average\
    \ recall (UAR).\nThe recall is considered as one wants the system correctly classify\
    \ as many positive\nsamples for every class as possible. The final network was\
    \ determined using early\nstopping. The unweighted average recall (UAR) can be\
    \ computed as,\nUAR =\nk\nX\nn=0\n\x10\nTPn\nTPn+FNn\n\x11\nk\n(11)\nwhere k stands\
    \ for number of classes and TPn stands for the number of True\nPositive samples\
    \ in the nth class and FNn stands for number False Negative samples\nin the nth\
    \ class. Therefore, the average of the individual recall scores from all classes\n\
    was aimed to be maximized.\nData from the training set was provided to the CNN\
    \ network after performing data\naugmentation on the minority classes, during\
    \ training, the validation set was used\nto observe performance of the network\
    \ and determine the best performing instance.\nOnce training was finished, the\
    \ last fully connected classification layer was removed\nand replaced by an XGBoost\
    \ classification stage. To train the XGBoost stage, the\nweights of the final\
    \ best performing CNN model were loaded in to CNN layers of\nthe network and input\
    \ samples were then passed through them as before. Using the\noutput of the CNN\
    \ stage as an input for the XGBoost, a search was then carried\nout to determine\
    \ the optimal parameter values. After training of the XGBoost stage,\nthe completely\
    \ trained CNN-XGBoost model was tested using the test set.\nTwo\n115\nsets of\
    \ tests were performed, one while considering all ADLs as a single class versus\n\
    individual falls and the other considering common individual ADLs and individual\n\
    falls.\nOne ADL vs Individual Falls\nIn this experiment, all ADLs present in the\
    \ SisFall dataset were combined in to one\nclass to build a generic ADL versus\
    \ fall system. The results are presented in Table 44.\nIt can be observed from\
    \ the table that the ADL class has been detected with perfect\nrecall score. Among\
    \ the falls, the worst performance was observed for LHF with the\nbest performance\
    \ for FHF.\nTable 44. One ADL vs. Individual Falls.\nActivity/ Fall\nPrecision\n\

    \ From Table 45,\nwhen looking at the recall achieved for the individual activities,\
    \ it can be observed\nthat the best recognized activities are W and J with each\
    \ achieving a recall of around\n97%. The worst performance in terms of ADLs was\
    \ achieved for the activity SB for\nwhich a recall of 83.78% was attained. Considering\
    \ the case of falls, out of the six\nfalls, the worst recall score of 75% was\
    \ achieved for BHF and LHF whereas the best\nrecall score was of 95.83% was achieved\
    \ for BSF and LSF. The fall class FSF was also\n116\nnot identified well, achieving\
    \ a recall score of 77.08%. Furthermore, as observed from\nthe table, a high value\
    \ of specificity was obtained for all ADLs and falls indicating\nto correct determination\
    \ of negative samples for each class as well. Investigating the\nperformance of\
    \ the network from the confusion matrix, it was observed that the worst\nperforming\
    \ activity SB was equally confused as S and W, this can be attributed to\nthe\
    \ fact that the SB activity includes slight bending which could lead to confusion\
    \ for\nthe classifier. For the worst performing falls, it was observed that BHF\
    \ was confused\nwith LHF and LSF whereas LHF was confused with FHF and FSF. The\
    \ confusion\nbetween the falls is apparent from plots shown in Appendix A where\
    \ BHF has very\nsimilar accelerometer signal values to these classes.\n2.8.3.3\n\
    Discussion\nInorder to better understand the performance of the network for the\
    \ various fall\ndetection types from Tables 44 and 45, the performance of the\
    \ network for fall severity\nhas been illustrated in Figure 26. It can be observed\
    \ that soft falls are better detected\ncompared to hard falls with UARs for the\
    \ individual ADL and fall experiment being\n79.63% for hard falls and that for\
    \ soft falls is 89.58%. For the one ADL and individual\nfall experiment, the difference\
    \ is less stark, being 85.18% for hard falls and 88.88%\nfor soft falls.\n60\n\

    network\nThis section presents a discussion on fall detection with severity and\
    \ direction along\nwith ADL recognition on the SisFall and the K-Fall datasets.\
    \ Two experiments were\nconducted in this regard, one with all ADLs as one class\
    \ versus the six fall types\nconsidered and another for individual ADLs and falls.\n\
    2.8.4.1\nData Labeling\nSince this experiment also uses the K-Fall dataset, the\
    \ labeling scheme for K-Fall\nis shown in Table 48. The labeling for the SisFall\
    \ dataset was retained the same\nfor the individual ADL and fall experiment.\n\
    However, for the one ADL and fall\nexperiment, all activities were labeled as\
    \ a single class ADL.\n2.8.4.2\nMethodology\nThe methodology consists of the two\
    \ steps of data preprocessing and classifi-\ncation. Data preprocessing has been\
    \ performed in the same manner as in section\n2.8.3.1. Therefore, this section\
    \ focuses on the ConvLSTM network used. The net-\nwork used in this work is illustrated\
    \ in Figure 28. It consists of four layers, the first\nof these is the ConvLSTM\
    \ layer. The ConvLSTM layer combines the properties of\nsequential learning associated\
    \ with LSTMs with the feature extraction capabilities\nof convolutional neural\
    \ networks and they have found successful use in the human\nactivity recognition/fall\
    \ detection domain [491, 492]. By replacing the simple matrix\nmultiplication\
    \ within LSTM cells by a convolutional operation, the ConvLSTM can\ncapture spatio-temporal\
    \ dependencies as opposed to the temporal only qualities of-\nfered by LSTMs.\
    \ Such spatial information is useful for the problem of fall detection\nwhere\
    \ not only the sequence contained within the recordings is important but also\n\
    the spatial information is also important to determine things like direction for\
    \ e.g.\nThe ConvLSTM layer is followed by a Self-Attention layer to incorporate\
    \ attention\n119\nTable 48. Labeling for K-Fall Dataset\nActivity Code\nAssigned\

    mechanism. Through the attention layer, important parts in the signal which can\n\
    help to determine the output class correctly are identified. For the current work,\
    \ a\nglobal attention mechanism which looks at the complete sequence is used.\
    \ After the\nattention layer follow two fully connected layers, one with a relu\
    \ activation function\nand the other with a softmax function to determine the\
    \ output class.\n2.8.4.3\nResults\nTwo experiments were performed in total on\
    \ the two datasets considered. The\nexperiments consisted of a fall vs ADL scenario\
    \ and another scenario in which ADLs\nwere conisdered individually to provide\
    \ a combined fall and ADL recognition system.\nThe results for each of the experiments\
    \ have been presented in this section. The\nnetwork was trained using an Adam\
    \ optimizer for 40 epochs with early stopping\nbeing used to retain the best performing\
    \ model before running it on the test set.\nAlso, during training, the network\
    \ was tasked to maximize the average recall of all\nclasses combined to ensure\
    \ that positive samples of each class were prioritized for\ncorrect detection,\
    \ however, in addition to recall, the precision, specificity and F1-\nscore have\
    \ also been reported in the results presented for the sake of completeness.\n\
    One ADL vs Individual Falls\nIn this experiment, all the ADLs were considered\
    \ a single class while the categories for\nfalls were retained as per individual\
    \ directions and severity levels. Table 49 presents\nthe results for this experiment\
    \ with the SisFall dataset for which an average recall of\n90.02% was achieved.\
    \ It can be observed that the network is able to determine ADLs\nvery well achieving\
    \ a recall of 99.93%. Considering falls, the class LHF is the worst\n120\nConvLSTM\n\

    \ ADLs in\nthis case have been detected very well, resulting in a recall of 99.72%.\
    \ Considering the\nperformance of falls, the best performing fall classes were\
    \ BSF and LSF for which a\nrecall of 96% was achieved. The worst performing fall\
    \ class in this case was FSF with\na recall of 85%.\nIndividual ADL vs Individual\
    \ Falls\nIn this experiment, individual ADLs were considered as separate classes\
    \ in addition\nto the six fall classes mentioned before. This exercise was carried\
    \ out to assess the\ndesigned systems performance as a combined ADL recognition\
    \ and fall detection\nsystem. The result for the SisFall dataset are presented\
    \ in Table 51. The average\nrecall achieved for this experiment using the SisFall\
    \ dataset is 91.49%.\nConsidering fall performance, it can be observed from Table\
    \ 51 that the class\nBSF is the best recognized fall, having a recall of 94.74%\
    \ with the fall LHF being\nthe worst recognized one with a recall of 73.68%. The\
    \ best recognized ADL is the\nclass W with a near perfect recall of 99.06%. The\
    \ worst recognized ADL is S with\n96.98% which is not a large difference compared\
    \ to the performance for falls. Table\n?? presents the results of the network\

    \ dataset is\nSB with a recall of 97.5% with the worst being the class J.\n2.8.4.4\n\
    Discussion\nWhen comparing the performance of ADLs and falls overall for both\
    \ experiments,\nit can be observed that ADL recognition performance was much better\
    \ than the\nperformance for fall detection. For both experiments conducted, when\
    \ comparing the\nperformance of the network across datasets, the network performs\
    \ better on the K-Fall\ndataset compared to the SisFall dataset. This could be\
    \ attributed to the difference\nin the volunteer make up of the participants as\
    \ K-Fall mostly had young people\nvolunteering to perform falls whereas SisFall\
    \ contains a wide variety of age groups\nand gender make up in its volunteers.\
    \ To gather further insights in to the performance\nof the network in terms of\
    \ fall detection for the two experiments conducted across both\ndatasets, Figure\
    \ 29 illustrates the networks performance for falls for both datasets\nand experiments.\
    \ An average recall of 88.37% was achieved for the SisFall dataset\nand 91.49%\
    \ for the K-Fall dataset for the one ADL vs individual falls experiment\nand 88.57%\
    \ and 91.33% respectively for the individual ADL and individual falls\nexperiment.\
    \ It can be observed that the classes LSF, FHF and BSF were recognized\nvery well,\
    \ each achieving a recall of nearly 90% or higher. The class FHF was also\ndetected\
    \ sufficiently well, achieving an average recall of more than 86% across all\n\
    experiments. For SisFall, the least performing class was LHF and for K-Fall it\
    \ was\nBHF.\nFigure 30 investigates the performance of the network when considering\
    \ different\nfall severity levels for all the experiments. It can be observed\
    \ that soft falls have\nbeen consistently better recognized compared to hard falls.\
    \ This difference is largest\n(6%) when individual ADLs are considered as separate\
    \ classes for both datasets. For\nthe experiment where ADLs are grouped in to\
    \ a single class, there is only a slight\n123\n60\n65\n70\n75\n80\n85\n90\n95\n\

    \ segments from the accelerometer\nand gyroscope sensor signals based on the acceleration\
    \ magnitude. This is followed\nby the computation of various time and frequency\
    \ domain features for each of these\nsegments. The next step is feature selection\
    \ and classification which is performed by\nusing four different machine learning\
    \ algorithms popular in fall detection systems.\nFirst, a baseline performance\
    \ is established and then feature reduction is performed\naiming to maintain or\
    \ improve algorithm performance by elimination of redundant\nfeatures. It was\
    \ observed that the weighted F1-score improved slightly (by just over\n1%) for\
    \ both experiments.\nThe other three experiments considered activity of daily\
    \ living and fall detection\nsimultaneously. For the second experiment, utilizing\
    \ inertial sensor data, a hierarchi-\ncal classification framework using wavelets\
    \ and adaptive pooling was presented. To\nachieve this, inertial sensor recordings\
    \ (accelerometer and gyroscope) from the Sis-\nFall dataset were utilized and\
    \ windowed segments were extracted from each recording.\nFollowing this, a level-4\
    \ haar wavelet was used to extract wavelet coefficients from\nthese windowed segments\
    \ and then 4-2-1 1-D Spatial Pyramid pooling was used to\n126\nsummarize the output\
    \ of the wavelet feature coefficients at each approximation and\ndetail level\
    \ before the max pooled coefficients were concatenated to form the final\nfeature\
    \ vector. A hierarchical classification scheme was then used consisting of three\n\
    classification stages, one for determining individual ADLs versus a generic fall\
    \ and the\nsecond and third for fall direction and severity respectively with\
    \ both voting together\nto determine the severity and direction of a fall. Towards\
    \ this end, experiments were\nconducted to determine the most appropriate size\
    \ of the observation window as well as\nsensing modality used. It was found that\
    \ for the proposed setup, a window duration\nof 3 seconds produced the best results\
    \ while using data from both the accelerometer\nand gyroscope. In the third experiment,\
    \ Inertial Measurement Unit (accelerometer\nand gyroscope) data from the SisFall\
    \ dataset is first windowed into non-overlapping\nsegments of duration 3 seconds.\
    \ After suitable data augmentation for the minority\nclasses, the windowed segments\
    \ are passed to a Convolutional Neural Network for\nfeature extraction. The CNN\
    \ is trained to maximize the unweighted average recall\nfor the validation partition.\
    \ Once the CNN is trained, an XGBoost last stage is used\nfor classification.\
    \ Experiments conducted on the test set achieve an unweighted aver-\nage recall\
    \ of 88% for both the one ADL versus individual falls and individual ADLs\nversus\
    \ fall experiments. In comparison with other techniques used for this task, the\n\
    proposed scheme produces sufficiently better results, thereby demonstrating the\
    \ effi-\ncacy of the proposed method. Lastly, a ConvLSTM network with attention\
    \ has been\nused for detection of falls considering fall direction and severity.\
    \ Using data from the\nSisFall and the K-Fall datasets, two experiments were conducted\
    \ on inertial sensor\ndata. The first considered falls versus ADLs and the other\
    \ combined ADL recognition\nand fall detection. Results for both experiments achieved\
    \ an average recall of more\nthan 90%. The results from the cross-dataset performance\
    \ indicate to the robustness\nof the designed methodology.\nTable 55 presents\
    \ the F-1 scores for the four experiments considering fall detection\nwith direction\
    \ and severity for the SisFall dataset. For experiment 1, only the fall\ndetection\
    \ with direction and severity part has been reported. A progression can be\nobserved\
    \ in the detection of falls wherein an increase of nearly 8.5% in the average\n\
    F1-score was achieved.\n127\nCHAPTER VI\nCONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\n1\nConclusion\n\
    This dissertation provided a coverage of the use of Internet of Things towards\
    \ the\ndevelopment of smart communities. While doing so, the main applications\
    \ of ML/DL\nalgorithms as well as optimization algorithms were discussed and mapped.\
    \ Further-\nemore, other technological components of the IoT such as sensing,\
    \ communication,\nsecurity and privacy were also talked about. Lastly, considering\
    \ the case of smart\nhealth, specifically fall detection, experimentation and\
    \ analysis was conducted and\nthe results presented.\nIn this regard, the usage\
    \ of inertial sensor data has been very popular as they do\nnot restrict a users\
    \ movement and are also easy to deploy compared to other methods.\nFour approaches\
    \ that considered fall detection with direction and severity were pre-\nsented.\
    \ In this regard, four experiments were conducted, first was the development\n\
    of a fall only detection system whereas the other three were for a combined ADL\
    \ and\nfall system. For the other three experiments, a hierarchical and two deep\
    \ learning\nbased approaches were tested. The designed methodologies were compared\
    \ to the\nstate of the art and were found to outperform them.\n2\nContribution\n\
    The Internet of Things has spearheaded tremendous change in society by allowing\
    \ for\ncapturing measurements in different facets of our daily lives. With such\
    \ a fundamental\nimpact being made, it is pertinent that researchers commit to\
    \ analyzing the current\npenetration that IoT possesses in city operation and\
    \ also providing impetuses for\nnew and novel application development. This work\
    \ aims to address these needs by\ndiscussing the use and role of the internet\
    \ of things in smart communities.\nThe\ncontribution of the work are as follows:\n\
    1. Provide a coverage of the IoT based smart city ecosystem in terms of the tech-\n\
    nologies utilized. Discussion has been provided about the sensors, communi-\n\
    cation technologies as well as the IoT architectures that enable IoT smart city\n\
    development. Finally a review of the security and privacy issues was also dis-\n\
    cussed.\n2. Present a study of the uses of ML and DL methods for different applications\
    \ of\nsmart cities in an IoT context. To this end, the type of architecture employed\n\
    and the data source type were also covered.\n128\n3. The use of optimization algorithms\
    \ in IoT smart cities has been provided. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is\
    \ the first comprehensive review of optimization\nalgorithms in IoT Smart Cities.\n\
    4. Considering the case of smart health, methodologies have been devised for the\n\
    novel case of fall detection with direction and severity detection. In this respect,\n\
    the performance time, frequency domain and statistical features on inertial\n\
    sensor data has been analyzed and presented.\n5. A combined activity of daily\
    \ living and fall detection framework with fall di-\nrection and severity consideration\
    \ has been discussed.\nFour approaches in\nthis regard have been presented, one\
    \ utilizing time-frequency information us-\ning wavelets along with a hierarchical\
    \ classification scheme, third a Convolu-\ntional Neural Network-eXtreme Gradient\
    \ Boost combination and the last being\na ConvLSTM has been proposed. The proposed\
    \ approaches has been shown to\noutperform the state of the art in the field.\n\
    3\nFuture Work\nThe IoT is revolutionizing development of smart city applications.\
    \ There are several\nopportunities. Some of these are listed below:\n• IoT Systems\
    \ for Smart Cities\n– A major research area is in the security and privacy of\
    \ IoT in smart cities in\nterms of encryption techniques, authentication protocols,\
    \ data anonymiza-\ntion techniques and other methods to prevent unvalidated access\
    \ to the IoT\nnetwork. As mentioned before technologies such as blockchain could\
    \ help\nintroduce access tracking and control, secure device discovery, prevention\n\
    of spoofing, data loss while ensuring that end to end encryption is also\nused.\n\
    – Of the data transfer standards developed till now for IoT, many are not\ncompatible\
    \ with each other. Work needs to be carried out in this regard to\nenable intercommunication\
    \ of sensor nodes using different protocols while\nutilizing low power, which\
    \ is imperative for sensor nodes in the network.\n– Another area to work on, is\
    \ the development of efficient storage techniques\nand low power hardware which\
    \ can reduce operational costs. From a de-\nployment perspective, decentralized\
    \ systems have been proposed as the\nbest solutions to increase reliability of\
    \ the application. Techniques such as\nfederated learning allow for decentralized\
    \ DL system deployments.\n• AI/Combinatorial Optimization in IoT Smart Cities\n\
    – The development of data fusion techniques that can make the use of het-\nerogeneous\
    \ data sources easier, intelligent data reduction/feature selection\nmethods to\
    \ ensure that redundant or ’uninteresting’ data is not part of the\n129\nAI development\
    \ pipeline. This will help in a quicker turnaround time as\nwell as improved performance\
    \ of deployments. Current methods need to be\nused as well as new ones be researched\
    \ for making ML and DL algorithms\nmore explainable to suit the various applications\
    \ in a smart city.\n– Hybrid and novel optimization methodologies (for e.g. graywolf\
    \ optimiza-\ntion [493]) which combine characteristics of multiple heuristic schemes\n\
    could potentially outperform singular methodologies.\nThere have been\nseveral\
    \ works which combine multiple optimization techniques.\n– Reinforcement learning\
    \ (RL) has the potential to provide solutions to com-\nbinatorial optimization\
    \ problems as covered in [494]. The idea is to use\nmachine learning and reinforcement\
    \ learning to get rid of human created\nheurists which may lead to optimizations\
    \ towards local optimums. Agents\ncan be trained to search for these heuristics\
    \ to automate the process.\n• Smart Health: Fall detection\n– The addition of\
    \ additional sensor modalities apart from intertial sensor\nmeasurements might\
    \ help improve performance for the worst detected\nclasses from the experiments\
    \ conducted. Various authors have incorpo-\nrated medical or pressure sensors\
    \ in their fall detection systems.\nData\nfrom these sensors can be used together\
    \ as an input to a deep learning\nnetwork. This additional information gathered\
    \ for subjects while under-\ngoing a fall could also describe valuable health\
    \ parameters that can be used\nfor diagnosis or early detection of ailments which\
    \ might be the underlying\ncause of falls.\n– Another work opportunity in the\
    \ data science domain would be the as-\nsessment of this problem considering a\
    \ data centric approach, where, in\ncontrast to a model centric approach where\
    \ the focus is on developing the\nbest model, data centric focuses on working\
    \ with data to improve applica-\ntion performance using systematic procedures\
    \ for labeling, augmentation\netc. Such systematic procedures and qualitative\
    \ data analysis would aid\nin cross-dataset algorithm deployment as well.\n130\n\

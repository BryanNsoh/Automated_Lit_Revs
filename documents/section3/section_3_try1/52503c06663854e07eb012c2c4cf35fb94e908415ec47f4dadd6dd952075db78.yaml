    Introduction\nNegative effects of surface runoff and soil erosion in watersheds
    can be controlled and miti‐\ngated through hydrological models. Moreover, they
    are suitable to simulate various combi‐\nnations of different scenarios of land
    and water management in a watershed and therefore\nthey are useful for comparative
    analysis of different options and as a guide to what Best\nManagement Practices
    (BMPs) can be adopted to minimize pollution from point and non‐\npoint sources
    (Shrestha et al., 2006).\nContinuous simulation models (e.g. AnnAGNPS, WEPP, SWAT,
    etc.) provide great advan‐\ntages over event-based models as they allow watersheds
    and their response to be studied\nover a longer time period in an integrated way.
    Nowadays, several continuous watershed-\nscale erosion models are available: however,
    relatively little validation of their performance\nunder varying climatic and
    land use conditions has been carried out. The latter is an essen‐\ntial step before
    a model can be reliably applied.\nThe AnnAGNPS (Annualized Agricultural Non-Point
    Source) model (Geter and Theurer,\n1998; Bingner and Theurer, 2001) is among the
    distributed models developed to evaluate the\ncontinuous hydrologic and water
    quality responses of watersheds. Many major hydrologic\nconcepts of the single-event
    AGNPS model (Young et al., 1987) have been updated through\nthe continuous simulation
    modeling of watershed physical processes (Baginska et al., 2003).\n© 2012 Zema

    assess runoff water amount and quality as well as\nsediment yield in small to
    large monitored watersheds (ranging from 0.32 to 2500 km2)\nunder different environmental
    conditions. Such applications were frequently coupled with\ncalibration/validation
    trials. Poor AnnAGNPS predictions of sediment and nutrient loads\nwere achieved
    in a Georgia watershed, covered by both extensive forest and riparian con‐\nditions
    and attributed this to the defective data input used with the model (Suttles et
    al.,\n2003). Moderate accuracy in model simulation of phosphorous and nitrogen
    processes\nwas also highlighted by model applications in two small watersheds
    located in the Missis‐\nsippi Delta (Yuan et al., 2005) and in the Sydney region
    (Baginska et al., 2003). The capa‐\nbility  of  the  model  (coupled  to  the  BATHTUB  eutrophication  reservoirs  model)  in\nsimulating
    nutrients load variations in response to land use changes in a Kansas large res‐\nervoir
    was pointed out by Wang et al. (2005).\nIn applications to a small Mississippi
    watershed reported by Yuan et al. (2001, 2005), An‐\nnAGNPS adequately predicted
    long-term monthly and annual runoff and sediment yield\nand predicted and observed
    runoff from individual events were reasonably close, achieving\ncoefficients of
    determination r2 and efficiency E (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) equal to 0.94 and\n0.91
    respectively). In a small Australian watershed, mainly covered by farming and
    residen‐\ntial land uses, acceptable model predictions (E = 0.82) were assessed
    for runoff at event scale\nafter the calibration of hydrological parameters Baginska
    et al. (2003).\nMore recently AnnAGNPS was implemented at a small Nepalese watershed,
    mainly for‐\nested and cultivated, where the need of calibration for satisfactory
    runoff predictions was\nshown. Despite the calibration process, peak flow and
    sediment yield evaluation resulted\nin  a  much  lower  accuracy  (Shrestha  et  al.,  2006).  The  prediction  performance  of  An‐\nnAGNPS
    in a 48-km2 watershed located in Kauai Island (Hawaii, USA) was considered\ngood
    for monthly runoff predictions and poor on a daily basis (Poliakov et al., 2007).
    Cal‐\nibration/validation tests in two small watersheds in S. Lucia Island (British
    West Indies)\n(agricultural and forested respectively) suggested that AnnAGNPS
    could be used under\nthe conditions tested tested (Sarangi et al., 2007). In an
    agricultural river basin (374 km2)\nof Czech Republic suspended load following
    short duration intensive rainfall events was\naccurately predicted by the AnnAGNPS
    model; there the model was not suitable for con‐\ntinuous simulation in large
    river basins with a high proportion of subsurface runoff (Kli‐\nment et al., 2008).
    In a 63-km2 watershed in Malaysia (tropical region which sometimes\nexperiences
    heavy rainfall runoff) was well predicted while results with respect to sedi‐\nment
    load were moderate (Shamshad et al., 2008).\nSome applications in Spanish catchments
    covered by olive orchards showed the sensitivity\nof AnnAGNPS to different temporal
    scales in modeling runoff and sediment yield under\ndifferent management systems
    (Aguilar and Polo, 2005) and the model applicability to pre‐\ndict runoff and
    sediment at event and monthly scales after calibration (Taguas et al., 2009).\nA
    calibration/validation exercise using a 10-year hydrological database in 53-km2
    watershed\nin Ontario (Canada) highlighted that adjustments of the monthly curve
    number values and\nof the RUSLE parameters are relevant to improve the hydrology
    and sediment components\nof AnnAGNPS, especially during winter and early spring
    periods (Das et al., 2009). A good\nmodel performance was obtained in terms of
    runoff and erosion prediction after calibration/\nSoil Erosion\n4\nvalidation
    processes in a 136-km2 agricultural watershed in south-central Kansas; total phos‐\nphorus
    predictions were instead good only for the calibration period (Parajuli et al.,
    2009).\nFinally, a poor model performance in simulating agricultural pollution
    by nitrogen, phos‐\nphorus and sediment was obtained in a 16.97-km2 watershed
    located in North Dakota\n(USA), mainly due to the large size of the study area
    and the high variability in land use and\nmanagement practices (Lyndon et al.,
    2010).\nThus, the results of AnnAGNPS evaluations that have hitherto been carried
    out are general‐\nly promising. At the same time it can be noticed that model
    performance is variable and the\nboundary conditions under which the model may
    be successfully used for runoff and sedi‐\nment yield prediction have not been
    well defined.\n2. Aim of the work\nIn order to consolidate use of the AnnAGNPS
    model in different climatic and geomorpho‐\nlogic conditions, this investigation
    has verified model prediction capability of surface runoff,\npeak flow and sediment
    yield in two small European watersheds under climate conditions\ntypical of the
    semi-arid (Cannata watershed, southern Italy) and humid-temperate (Gans‐\npoel
    watershed, central Belgium) environments respectively. Through this work we have
    in‐\nvestigated to what extent AnnAGNPS may be expected to provide usable results
    in\nenvironmental conditions outside of research watersheds, where sometimes the
    necessary\ndata for model calibration and validation are not available.\n3. The
    AnnAGNPS model\nAnnAGNPS is a distributed parameter, physically based, continuous
    simulation, daily time\nstep model, developed initially in 1998 through a partnering
    project between the USDA Ag‐\nricultural Research Service (ARS) and the Natural
    Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).\nThe model simulates runoff, sediment,
    nutrients and pesticides leaving the land surface and\nshallow subsurface and
    transported through the channel system to the watershed outlet,\nwith output available
    on an event, monthly and annual scale. Required inputs for model im‐\nplementation
    include climate data, watershed physical information, as well as crop and oth‐\ner
    land uses as well as irrigation management data.\nBecause of the continuous nature
    of AnnAGNPS, climate information, which includes daily\nprecipitation, maximum
    and minimum temperatures, dew point temperatures, sky cover\nand wind speed, is
    necessary to take into account temporal weather variations. The spatial\nvariability
    of soils, land use, topography and climatic conditions can be accounted for by
    di‐\nviding the watershed into user-specified homogeneous drainage areas. The
    basic compo‐\nnents of the model include hydrology, sedimentation and chemical
    transport.\nPrediction of Surface Runoff and Soil Erosion at Watershed Scale:
    Analysis of the AnnAGNPS Model\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/50427\n5\nThe SCS curve
    number technique (USDA-SCS, 1972) is used within the AnnAGNPS hydro‐\nlogic submodel
    to determine the surface runoff on the basis of a continuous soil moisture\nbalance.
    AnnAGNPS only requires initial values of curve number (CN) for antecedent mois‐\nture
    condition AMC-II, because the model updates the hydrologic soil conditions on
    the ba‐\nsis of the daily soil moisture balance and according to the crop cycle.\nThe
    peak flow is determined using the extended TR-55 method (Cronshey and Theurer,\n1998).  This  method  is  a  modification  of  the  original  NCRS-TR-55  technology  (USDA-\nNRCS,
    1986), which is considered as a robust empirical approach suitable for wide varie‐\nty
    of conditions including those where input data might be limited as in the experimental\nwatershed
    (Polyakov et al., 2007).\nThe AnnAGNPS erosion component simulates storm events
    on a daily basis for sheet and\nrill erosion based on the RUSLE method (Revised
    Universal Soil Loss Equation, version 1.5,\nRenard et al., 1997). The HUSLE (Hydrogeomorphic
    Universal Soil Loss Equation, Theurer\nand Clarke, 1991) is used to simulate the
    total sediment volume delivered from the field to\nthe channel after sediment
    deposition.\nThe sediment routing component simulates sheet and rill sediment
    deposition in five parti‐\ncle size classes (clay, silt, sand and small and large
    aggregates) on the basis of density and\nfall velocity of the particles and then
    routes sediment separately through the channel net‐\nwork to the watershed outlet
    as a function of sediment transport capacity (calculated by the\nBagnold equation;
    Bagnold, 1966). A key assumption is that the aggregates break up into\ntheir primary
    particles once they enter the stream channel.\nFor the chemical component of the
    model, dissolved and adsorbed sediment predictions are\nassessed for each cell
    by a mass balance approach. Algorithms for nutrient (nitrogen, phos‐\nphorous
    and organic carbon) and pesticide dynamics are largely similar to the EPIC (Wil‐\nliams
    et al., 1984) and GLEAMS (Leonard et al., 1987) models.\nMore details on the theoretical
    background of AnnAGNPS are reported by Bingner and\nTheurer (2005).\n4. Description
    of the Experimental Watersheds\nThe input data utilised for AnnAGNPS implementation
    in the Cannata watershed was col‐\nlected during a proper monitoring campaign
    providing topographic, soil and land use data\nas well as 7-year hydrological
    observations.\nFor model verification in the Ganspoel watershed the input database
    was drawn from the\nworks by Steegen et al., 2001 and Van Oost et al., 2005. Compared
    to the Cannata watershed,\nthis experimental database reported less geomorphological
    information; moreover, the hy‐\ndrological observations were related only to a
    2-year period: thus this study case represents\na typical “data-poor environment”
    (Merritt et al., 2003).\nSoil Erosion\n6\n4.1. Cannata watershed\n4.1.1. Geomorphological
    information\nThe Cannata watershed, located in eastern Sicily, southern Italy
    (outlet coordinates 37 53''N,\n14 46''E), is a mountainous tributary, ephemeral
    in flow, of the Flascio River (Figure 1).\nThe watershed covers about 1.3 km2
    between 903 m and 1270 m above mean sea level with\nan average land slope of 21%.
    The longest channel pathway is about 2.4 km, with an average\nslope of about 12%
    (Figure 2). The Kirpich concentration time is 0.29 h.\nFigure 1. View of the Cannata
    watershed in proximity of its outlet.\nIn a survey conducted at the start of experimental
    campaign, five different soil textures\n(clay,  loam,  loam-clay,  loam-sand  and  loam-sand-clay)  were  recognized  on  57  topsoil\nsamples;
    clay-loam (USDA classification) resulted as the dominant texture. The soil satu‐\nrated
    hydraulic conductivity, measured by a Guelph permeameter, resulted in the range\n0.2
    to 17.6 mm h-1.\nContinuous monitoring of land use has highlighted the prevalence
    of pasture areas (ranging\nbetween 87% and 92% of the watershed area) with different
    vegetation complexes (up to 15\nspecies) and ground covers. Four soil cover situations
    can be distinguished: a high-density\nherbaceous vegetation (eventually subjected
    to tillage operations), a medium-density herba‐\nceous vegetation, sparse shrubs
    and cultivated winter wheat with a wheat-fallow rotation.\nMore detailed information
    about the watershed characteristics and the monitoring equip‐\nment were reported
    previously (Licciardello and Zimbone, 2002).\nPrediction of Surface Runoff and
    Soil Erosion at Watershed Scale: Analysis of the AnnAGNPS Model\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/50427\n7\nFigure
    2. Location, contour map and hydrographic network of the Cannata watershed.\n4.1.2.
    The hydrological database\nIn the monitoring period of 1996 to 2003 the hydrological
    observations were collected utilis‐\ning the following equipment (Figure 2): a
    meteorological station (A, located outside of the\nwatershed) recording rainfall,
    air temperature, wind, solar radiation and pan evaporation;\ntwo pluviometric
    stations (B and C); and a hydrometrograph (D) connected to a runoff wa‐\nter automatic
    sampler (E) for the measurement of sediment concentration in the flow.\nIn the
    observation period yearly rainfall between 541 and 846 mm (mainly concentrated\nfrom
    September to March) was recorded at the station A, with a mean and standard devia‐\ntion
    (SD) of 662 and 134 mm respectively. The corresponding yearly runoff was in the
    range\n30.7 to 365.8 mm, with a mean of 105.3 mm and SD of 100 mm. The coefficient
    of yearly run‐\noff, calculated as the ratio between total runoff and total rainfall
    as recorded by station A,\nvaried between 5% and 41%, with a mean and SD of 15%
    and 75% respectively. Occasional\nhigh differences in recorded rainfall events
    between the three gauges were found; as expect‐\ned, rainfall spatial variability
    decreased on a monthly and yearly basis.\nSoil Erosion\n8\nAt event scale, rainfall
    depths over 6.8 mm gave runoff volumes higher than 1 mm; the max‐\nimum runoff
    volume and discharge recorded in the observation period were 159.6 mm and\n3.4
    m3 s-1 (2.6 l s-1 km-2) respectively. Twenty-four erosive events were sampled
    with a sus‐\npended sediment concentration between 0.1 and 9.2 g l-1; the maximum
    event sediment yield\n(estimated on the basis of runoff volume and suspended sediment
    concentration in the flow)\nwas 283 Mg (2168.4 kg ha-1).\n4.2. Ganspoel watershed\n4.2.1.
    Geomorphological information\nThe Ganspoel watershed (outlet coordinates 50 48’N,
    4 35’E), located in central Belgium,\ncovers 1.15 km2 between 60 m and 100 m a.s.l.
    with an average slope of about 10%, but\nwhich can locally exceed 25%. A dense
    network of dry channels characterizes the area (Fig‐\nure 3). The topography of
    the area is formed in sandy deposits overlain by a loess layer that\nwas deposited
    during the latest glacial period. Soils are therefore dominantly loess-derived\nluvisols,
    with their physical parameters related much more to land use than to soil texture\n(Van
    Oost et al., 2005).\nTop soils have a very high silt percentage (on the average
    75%) and moderate clay and sand\ncontent (on the average 11% and 14% respectively)
    (Van Oost et al., 2005).\nThe watershed land use is mainly agricultural. Forested
    (5%) and pasture (4%) zones cover\nthe steep slopes as well as some of the thalweg
    areas. A built-up zone is located in north-\nwestern part of the Ganspoel watershed
    and represents 9% of its area (Steegen et al., 2001).\nThe main\nFigure 3. Location
    and aerial view of the Ganspoel watershed.\n4.2.2. The hydrological database\nThe
    climate of central Belgium shows relatively cool summers and mild winters resulting
    in\nan average annual temperature of 11 C. Annual precipitation varies normally
    between 700\nPrediction of Surface Runoff and Soil Erosion at Watershed Scale:

    year-1 and is well distributed over the year. High intensity rainfall events occur\nmainly
    in spring and summer: such thunderstorms may reach peak rainfall intensities of
    ca.\n70 mm h-1 while total rainfall amounts may amount to 40 mm, exceeding rarely
    60 mm.\nThe hydrological database was collected during a recording period of about
    2 years (May\n1997-February 1999). The rainfall and flow/sediment measurement
    station was located at the\noutlet of the watershed. The rainfall events were
    recorded by a tipping-bucket rain gauge\n(logging interval equal to 1 minute with
    0.5-mm tips). Water depths were continuously\nmeasured with a time interval of
    2 minutes and an accuracy of 2 mm by a San Dimas flume\nequipped with a flowmeter,
    using a submerged probe level sensor. Water discharge was\nthen calculated by
    a constant relationship between water depth and discharge. The suspend‐\ned sediment
    concentration, measured by an automated water sampler which a flow-propor‐\ntional
    sampling rate (every 30 m3 runoff), was determined by oven-drying every sample
    at\n105 C for 24 hours.\nSeventeen runoff events, corresponding to rainfall depths
    in the range 5.5-57.5 mm, were ade‐\nquately sampled (Table 1). The sampled events
    concerned generally low runoff volumes (15\nwith runoff depths lower than 2 mm),
    but the most intense event (13-14 September 1998) pro‐\nduced a runoff volume
    of 9.5 mm. Event-based sediment yields were in the range 2 to 604 kg\nha-1 (Table
    1). Ten other events were not taken into account because of inadequate sampling.\nEvent\nRainfall\nRunoff\nvolume\nRunoff\ncoefficient\nPeak\nflow\nSediment

    Event not taken into account, because of inadequate sampling (see Van Oost et
    al., 2005 for\nmore details).\nTable 1. Main characteristics of the observed events
    used for the AnnAGNPS model implementation at the Ganspoel\nwatershed (Ganspoel
    database, 2007).\n5. Model implementation\nThe watershed discretization into homogeneous
    drainage areas (“cells”) and the hydro‐\ngraphic network segmentation into channels
    (“reaches”) were performed for both water‐\nsheds using the GIS interface incorporated
    into AnnAGNPS.\nThe geometry and the density of the drainage network were modeled
    by setting the Critical\nSource Area (CSA) to 1.25 ha and the Minimum Source Channel
    Length (MSCL) to 100 m for\nthe Cannata watershed, which allowed a suitable representation
    of the same watershed in a\nprevious study (Licciardello et al., 2006). Such values
    were decreased to 0.5 ha and 50 m re‐\nspectively for the Ganspoel watershed,
    because of its higher land use heterogeneity (Near‐\ning et al., 2005). The Cannata
    watershed resulted in 78 cells and 32 reaches (Figure 4a), while\nthe Ganspoel
    watershed in 155 cells and 65 reaches (Figure 4b).\nThe elevation GIS layer was
    arranged by digitizing contour lines every 2 m on a 5-m resolution\nDEM; land
    use and soil input data were derived from 25-m resolution GIS maps. The morpho‐\nlogic
    parameters (i.e., cell slope length and steepness) as well as the dominant land
    uses and\nsoil types were directly associated with each drainage area by means
    of the GIS interface.\nPrediction of Surface Runoff and Soil Erosion at Watershed
    Scale: Analysis of the AnnAGNPS Model\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/50427\n11\nMeteorological
    and pluviometric input data were properly arranged by the AnnGNPS\nweather subroutines.
    For the Cannata watershed daily values of maximum and minimum\nair temperatures,
    relative humidity, solar radiation and wind velocity were measured at the\nmeteorological
    station within the watershed. Daily rainfall input data were derived from re‐\ncords
    provided by the three working rain gauges in the different periods and input to
    each\ndrainage area by applying the Thiessen polygon method, except when only
    the rainfall re‐\ncorded at a single station was available (Figure 2). For the
    Ganspoel watershed, as no mete‐\norological information (except for rainfalls)
    was provided in the database, air temperature,\nrelative humidity and wind velocity
    data were collected at the nearest meteorological sta‐\ntion (Bruxelles, 50 54’N,
    4 30’E, about 13 km far from the watershed outlet). Solar radiation\nwas evaluated
    by the Hargreaves'' formula. For both watersheds daily values of dew point\ntemperature
    were calculated on the basis of air temperature and humidity.\nFigure 4. Layouts
    of the Cannata (left) and Ganspoel (right) watershed discretisation by the AnnAGNPS
    model.\nTo allow the model to adjust the initial soil water storage terms, the
    first two years were ap‐\npended to the beginning of the precipitation and meteorological
    dataset. The initial values\nof CN, unique throughout the whole simulation period,
    were initially derived from the\nstandard procedure set by the USDA Soil Conservation
    Service (Table 2).\nTable 3 shows the values or range of the RUSLE parameters
    set utilised by the erosive sub‐\nmodel. The average annual rainfall factor (R),
    its cumulative percentages for 24 series of 15-\nday periods in a year and the
    soil erodibility factor (K) were determined according to\nguidelines by Wischmeier
    and Smith (1978), the latter on the basis of a field survey of soil\nhydrological
    characteristics (Indelicato, 1997; Steegen et al., 2001; Van Oost et al., 2005).\nIn
    the Cannata watershed, for each of the five soil textures, a uniform soil profile
    was\nmodeled up to 1500 mm by averaging the required physical characteristics
    from the field\nsamples. Soil wilting point and field capacity were derived from
    the experimental dataset.\nThe whole Ganspoel watershed was modelled assuming
    a unique soil type (silt loam) up\nto a depth of 1000 mm. Values of soil wilting
    point and field capacity, not available from\nthe Ganspoel dataset, were estimated
    by a pedo-transfer function (Saxton et al., 1986). The\nvalues of the soil saturated
    hydraulic conductivity (Ksat, in the range 0.001-205 mm h-1)\nwas derived from
    the LISEM Limburg database, as these data were collected on very sim‐\nSoil Erosion\n12\nilar
    soils (Takken et al., 1999; Nearing et al., 2005). Given that, as above mentioned,
    soil\nphysical parameters were much more related to land use than to soil texture
    (Van Oost et\nal., 2005), six different values of Ksat (one for each soil land
    use surveyed into the water‐\nshed) were input to the model.\nParameter\nCannata\nGanspoel\nLand\nuse\nValue\nLand\nuse\nValue\ndefault\nmodel\nafter\ncalibration\nHYDROLOGICAL

    simulation\nAfter processing the input parameters of the hydrological and erosive
    sub-models (respec‐\ntively requiring the determination of the initial Curve Numbers
    for the USDA SCS-CN mod‐\nel and the calculation of the RUSLE model factors),
    daily values of surface runoff, peak flow\nand sediment yield were continuously
    simulated at the outlet of both watersheds by An‐\nnAGNPS (version 3.2).\nConsidering
    that baseflow is not considered by AnnAGNPS, the surface runoff separation\nfrom
    baseflow was performed by the traditional manual linear method applied to observed\nstream
    flow data. Based on studies by Arnold et al. (1995) as well as Arnold and Allen\n(1999),
    these results match reasonably well with those obtained through an automated digi‐\ntal
    filter; the differences in the surface runoff component extracted by the two methods
    are\nup to 20% at yearly scale.\n5.1.1. Cannata watershed\nBoth the hydrological
    and erosion components of AnnAGNPS were calibrated/validated\nseparating the calibration
    and validation periods by the split-sample technique. The cali‐\nbration/validation
    process was carried out by modifying the initial values of CN, which\nrepresent
    a key factor in obtaining accurate prediction of runoff and sediment yield (Yuan\nSoil
    Erosion\n14\net al., 2001; Shrestha et al., 2006); and the most important input
    parameter to which the\nrunoff is sensitive (Yuan et al., 2001; Baginska et al.,
    2003), besides soil (field capacity,\nwilting point and saturated hydraulic conductivity)
    as well as climate parameters (precipi‐\ntation, temperature and interception).\nIn
    order to calibrate/validate the peak flows and the sediment yields, both 24-h
    rainfall dis‐\ntributions typical of a Pacific maritime climate (types I and Ia)
    with wet winter and dry\nsummers (USDA-NCRS, 1986) derived by the extended TR-55
    method database were used.\nThe sediment yields were evaluated at event scale
    by adjusting the surface long-term ran‐\ndom roughness coefficient (which affects
    the RUSLE C-factor) as well as the sheet and con‐\ncentrated flow Manning''s roughness
    coefficients (Table 3).\n5.1.2. Ganspoel watershed\nFor simulation of surface
    runoff, peak flow and sediment yield events, the AnnAGNPS\nmodel run with default
    input parameters (Table 3). No calibration/validation processes\nwere undertaken.\n6.
    Model evaluation\nIn both the experimental watersheds surface runoff volumes and
    sediment yields were eval‐\nuated at the event scale; in the Cannata watershed
    the analysis of surface runoff was extend‐\ned to the monthly and annual scale.\nModel
    performance was assessed by qualitative and quantitative approaches. The qualita‐\ntive
    procedure consisted of visually comparing observed and simulated values. For quanti‐\ntative
    evaluation a range of both summary and difference measures were used (Table 4).\nThe
    summary measures utilized were the mean and standard deviation of both observed\nand
    simulated values. Given that coefficient of determination, r2, is an insufficient
    and often\nmisleading evaluation criterion, the Nash and Sutcliffe (1970) coefficient
    of efficiency (E) and\nits modified form (E1) were also used to assess model efficiency
    (Table 4). In particular, E is\nmore sensitive to extreme values, while E1 is
    better suited to significant over- or underpre‐\ndiction by reducing the effect
    of squared terms (Krause et al, 2005). As suggested by the\nsame authors, E and
    E1 were integrated with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), which de‐\nscribes
    the difference between the observed values and the model predictions in the unit
    of\nthe variable. Finally, the Coefficient of Residual Mass (CRM) was used to
    indicate a preva‐\nlent model over- or underestimation of the observed values
    (Loague and Green, 1991).\nThe values considered to be optimal for these criteria
    were 1 for r2, E and E1 and 0 for RMSE\nand CRM (Table 4). According to common
    practice, simulation results are considered good\nfor values of E greater than
    or equal to 0.75, satisfactory for values of E between 0.75 and\n0.36 and unsatisfactory
    for values below 0.36 (Van Liew and Garbrecht, 2003).\nPrediction of Surface Runoff

    summary and difference measures applied to runoff volumes at different time\nscales
    for calibration and validation tests at the Cannata watershed.\nThe simulated
    total runoff volume for the period of October 1996 to December 2000 (405.72\nmm)
    was only slightly higher than the observed value (393.23 mm), showing a runoff
    pre‐\ndiction capability for long periods, which was also detected by other Authors
    (Yuan et al.,\n2001). The improvement in the annual runoff volume predictions
    after the calibration is due\nto the reduction of the cumulated volume overprediction
    relative to events with smaller\nrunoff (Figure 5). In some cases, at the beginning
    of the wet season, runoff was generated by\nAnnAGNPS but not observed (Figure
    6). This was probably due to the peculiarity of the hy‐\ndrological processes
    governing runoff formation in Mediterranean regions, depending not\nonly on catchment
    characteristics but also on antecedent hydrological conditions and char‐\nacteristics
    of the rainfall events, with low runoff coefficients as a result of short-duration,\nhigh-intensity
    convective storms over dry soils (Latron et al., 2003).\nPrediction of Surface

    found in the model\ncalibration test reported by Baginska et al. (2003).\nThe
    apparent best results achieved for monthly and event-scale runoff volume predictions\nwith
    respect to annual values may depend on the fact that the simulation period only
    repre‐\nsents a few years of data (four years and three years for the calibration
    and validation peri‐\nods, respectively), while monthly and event-scale simulations
    provide more data for the\nstatistics. Moreover, in Table 5, results of simulations
    related to the period of October to De‐\ncember 1996, which was very well simulated
    by the model, are not reported.\nFigure 7. Comparison between observed and simulated
    runoff at event scale for (left) calibration and (right) valida‐\ntion tests at
    the Cannata watershed.\nAs expected, the coefficient E1 is less sensitive to peaks
    (Krause et al., 2005) and was general‐\nly lower than E, but nevertheless satisfactory
    after the calibration process.\nAdjustments of minimum and maximum interception
    evaporation (the portion of precipita‐\ntion that neither runs off nor infiltrates)
    within the lower and upper default bounds as‐\nsumed by AnnAGNPS for daily pluviometric
    and meteorological data did not improve the\nmodel prediction capability.\nPeak
    flow predictions were closer to the observed values when the type Ia synthetic
    24-h\nrainfall distribution (less intense than type I) was used. The overall model
    performance was\nsatisfactory for less intense events, as shown by the E1 coefficient

    performance of the calibrated model was evaluated for the period of January 2001
    to\nDecember 2003 in terms of runoff, peak flow and sediment yield.\nAnnAGNPS
    runoff volume predictions confirmed the satisfactory model performance both at\nthe
    event and annual scales and the good performance at the monthly aggregated values
    (Ta‐\nble 5). However, an underprediction was highlighted by the difference in
    summary measures\nand the values of RMSE and CRM. This tendency was mainly due
    to underestimation of the\nmore significant events (Figure 7), as also found in
    the tests performed by Yuan et al. (2001).\nThe poor performance of the model
    in predicting extreme peak flows was confirmed in the val‐\nidation period. The
    overall model prediction capability was unsatisfactory (Table 6), as shown\nby
    the poor value of the coefficient of efficiency (E = 0.05). A high overprediction
    (over 105%)\nfor the most significant event, which occurred on 12 December 2003,
    is also noted.\nA satisfactory model efficiency (E1 = 0.55) and a very high coefficient
    of determination (r2> 0.90)\nwere also found for the suspended sediment yield
    events observed in the period of 2001 to 2003\n(Table 7 and Figure 8). The satisfactory
    value achieved for the Nash and Sutcliffe coefficient (E\n= 0.87) was mainly due
    to the successful performance of the model for large rainfall events, in\nparticular
    for the highest sediment yield, which occurred on 12 December 2003.\n7.2. Ganspoel
    watershed\nRunoff depths were in general underpredicted (see the positive value
    of the CRM coefficient\nin Table 8). The accuracy achieved for the prediction
    of the largest event (13-14/09/1998)\ngave a coefficient of determination exceeding
    0.90 (Figure 9) and a model efficiency (E) of\n0.89 for runoff depth (Table 8).
    The mean and standard deviation of simulated runoff vol‐\nPrediction of Surface
    Runoff and Soil Erosion at Watershed Scale: Analysis of the AnnAGNPS Model\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/50427\n21\nume
    depths were close to the corresponding observed values with differences lower
    than\n12% and 16%. When the events for which zero runoff was simulated events
    were excluded\nfrom the analysis, the values for r2 and E become 0.98 and 0.97
    respectively. Similarly high\nvalues for the coefficient of determination were
    found for runoff simulations by AnnAGNPS\nat the event scale by Yuan et al. (2001),
    Shrestha et al. (2006) and Shamshad et al. (2008) and\nfor the coefficient of
    determination and model efficiency by Sarangi et al. (2007). However,\nin these
    studies AnnAGNPS was calibrated before a validation was carried out.\nFrom such
    outcomes it can be remarked that the AnnAGNPS model provided a generally\ngood
    capability to simulate the greatest runoff event in the Ganspoel watershed, as
    shown\nby the high coefficients of efficiency (E and E1) and determination (r2)
    achieved without any\na priori calibration. The latter is an important observation
    as it shows that, at least for signif‐\nicant events, adequate runoff modeling
    is possible without calibration provided that suffi‐\nciently detailed input data
    are available. The latter should not only contain land use, but\nalso surface
    characteristics and soil roughness as these are important controls on runoff pro‐\nduction.
    This result contrasts somewhat with that of many other studies, where the need
    for\nappropriate calibration is stressed (e.g. Refsgaard, 1997; Beven, 2006).
    A possible reason for\nthis is that in many cases the available input data are
    less detailed than those available for\nthe Ganspoel watersheds in terms of soil
    surface characteristics and coverage. The latter are\nimportant controls on runoff
    generation: if such data are not available, model predictions\ncannot be expected
    to be accurate without prior calibration.\nThe majority of the observations available
    in the hydrological database was of low magni‐\ntude (14 out of 17 with runoff
    depths lower than 1 mm); for them the model simulation ac‐\ncuracy was basically
    less accurate, achieving a mean deviation between simulations and\nobservations
    of about 50%. Moreover, seven events (five of them concentrated at the end of\nrelatively
    dry periods and generated by storms with a depth up to 13 mm) resulted in zero\nrunoff
    simulation, even tuning the values of the initial CNs or saturated hydraulic conduc‐\ntivity
    (which represent the most important input parameters to which the runoff is sensitive\n(Yuan
    et al., 2001; Baginska et al., 2003) and setting up pre-run before the first event
    simulat‐\ned (which is important for initial soil moisture). The AnnAGNPS model,
    calculating daily\nand sub-daily water budgets using NRCS TR-55 method coming
    from the SWRRB and EPIC\nmodels (Williams et al, 1984; USDA-NRCS, 1986), presumably
    would have adjusted the CNs\nto antecedent moisture condition AMC-I based on the
    NRCS criteria, minimising the effect\nof varying the CNs (Sarangi et al., 2007).
    The climatic characteristics of the studied water‐\nshed caused the model to produce
    unrealistic CN values during its initialization and, as a\nresult, too low or
    no predicted runoff, as also found in various experimental applications in\ndifferent
    climatic conditions (Polyakov et al., 2007; Sarangi et al., 2007).\nEven in the
    Ganspoel watershed adjustments of minimum and maximum interception, as\noperated
    for model’s implementation at the Cannata watershed, did not further improve the\ncoefficients
    E, E1 and r2 calculated for runoff volume prediction.\nThe AnnAGNPS model provided
    the highest accuracy in peak flow predictions when the\ntype “II” synthetic 24-h
    rainfall distribution (typical of continental climate, with cold winter\nand warm
    summer) was set in simulation tests (Figure 9). Even though statistics of observed\nSoil
    Erosion\n22\nand predicted values were of the same order of magnitude (Table 8),
    the low values ach‐\nieved by the coefficients of efficiency (E and E1 lower than
    0.35) and conversely the high\nRMSE (163% of observed mean, Table 8) utilized
    for model evaluation confirmed the unsat‐\nisfactory prediction capability of
    the model for peak flow, also found elsewhere in different\nmodel tests (Shrestha
    et al., 2006). The model uses the extended TR-55 methods through syn‐\nthetic
    24-h rainfall distributions to calculate the peak flow (Cronshey and Theurer,
    1998).\nApparently, the latter method results is not suitable for the study area,
    leading to a severe\nunderestimation of rainfall intensities and hence peak flows,
    a fact also noted by Shrestha et\nal. (2006). A prediction method that takes into
    account the actual patterns of rainfall intensi‐\nty would be expected to provide
    better accuracy in peak flow estimations.\nRunoff\nValues\nMean\n(mm)\nStd. Dev.\n(mm)\nr2\nE\nE1\nRMSE\n(mm)\nCRM\nObserved\n1.04\n2.26\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nPredicted\n0.87\n2.53\n0.92\n0.89\n0.59\n0.73\n0.16\nPeak

    to the observed values\n(up to one order of magnitude in three cases); the correlation
    between observed and predict‐\ned values was relatively low (Table 9; Figure 9).
    Coefficients of efficiency (E and E1) were\nclose to zero and the coefficient
    of determination did not exceed 0.60 (Table 8). Those results\nwere in accordance
    of what reported by Yuan et al. (2001), Shrestha et al. (2006), Polyakov et\nal.
    (2007) and Shamshad et al. (2008) in sediment yield modeling by AnnAGNPS.\nThe
    model tendency to strongly underpredict peak flow is probably one of the main
    rea‐\nsons for the underestimation of erosive events and, consequently, of sediment
    yield (also\nPrediction of Surface Runoff and Soil Erosion at Watershed Scale:

    the separate comparison of deposition and erosion values for observed and si‐\nmulated
    events, Van Oost et al., 2005), but is not the only one. Also in the case of a
    good\nestimation of the runoff volume and an overestimation of the peak flow (13-14/09/1998),\nthe
    sediment yield was underestimated. Runoff alone is not adequate for erosion and\nsediment
    delivery predictions, but in the AnnAGNPS erosion sub-model it is used to esti‐\nmate
    the delivery of the particle sizes of eroded sediment (simulated through the RUSLE\nmodel)
    based on runoff and peak flow.\nFigure 9. Comparison of 17 observed and simulated
    (by AnnAGNPS) events in the Ganspoel watershed, for runoff\n(upper left), peak
    flow (upper right) and sediment yield (bottom) (values are in logarithmic scale).\nHowever,
    another factor that may also play a role in poor model simulations of erosion
    was\nthe limited availability of input parameters. The AnnAGNPS model requires
    up to 100\nunique parameters for runoff volume assessment and up to an additional
    80 unique parame‐\nters for sediment yield prediction. As values for these parameters
    were not all available in\nthe Ganspoel dataset data from the literature had to
    be used in some cases.\nSoil Erosion\n24\nDate\nRainfall\nRunoff\nvolume\nPeak

    9. Main characteristics of the observed events and simulations by the AnnAGNPS
    model at the Ganspoel\nwatershed.\nMoreover, the following factors can explain
    the low correlation between observed and pre‐\ndicted sediment yields:\n• AnnAGNPS
    uses the RUSLE method as the erosion sub-model. RUSLE has been devel‐\noped to
    deliver estimates of long-term average erosion rates rather than event-based sim‐\nulations.
    For this reason, comparison of individual events may not agree as well as long-\nterm
    annual values (Shrestha et al., 2006), even in the case of adequate prediction
    for the\nmost intense runoff events, as achieved in our model tests;\n• we deliberately
    opted to evaluated the AnnAGNPS model without prior validation in or‐\nder to
    assess its performance in cases where no data for validation are available;\n•
    the Ganspoel watershed contains more than 80 fields (roads, buildings, forest,
    grassed chan‐\nnels and several crops with differing planting and harvesting schedules),
    showing difficul‐\nties for modeling of interactions between physical processes

    infiltration and runoff as well as soil detachment and transport) and water and\nsediment
    routing associated with its complexity (Nearing et al., 2005; Licciardello et
    al.,\n2009). Probably, the scale of soil property measurements within the available
    geomorpho‐\nlogical database does not correspond to the discretisation scale of
    the Ganspoel watershed\n(characterized by land use heterogeneity and crop schedule
    complexity, as mentioned\nabove) performed by the GIS interface of the data-intensive
    AnnAGNPS model.\n8. Conclusion\nThe implementation of the AnnAGNPS in two small
    agricultural watersheds (Cannata,\nsouthern Italy, and Ganspoel, central Belgium)
    provided interesting indications about mod‐\nel’s prediction capability of surface
    runoff, peak flow and sediment yield and thus about its\napplicability in the
    experimental conditions.\nThe study case of the Cannata watershed has highlighted
    a good prediction capability of run‐\noff and erosive events, particularly for
    the events of highest relative magnitude (higher than 15\nmm and 100 kg ha-1 respectively);
    a good accuracy has been achieved also for monthly runoff\nvolumes simulation.
    The over-estimation of runoff volumes at yearly scale has been limited by\nsetting
    up the initial CNs in the calibration phase, with mean differences between observed\nand
    simulated yearly values lower than 20%. Peak flow predictions have been satisfactory
    on‐\nly for the less intense events (lower than 0.3 m3/s); the utilisation of
    the different synthetic hye‐\ntographs available for the hydrologic sub-model
    has not hallowed to eliminate the high over-\nestimation of the most intense peak
    flows. On the whole, the results provided by the analysis of\nthis study case
    encourage further efforts in order to verify the model transferability to the
    cli‐\nmatic conditions typical of the semi-arid Mediterranean environment.\nThe
    evaluation of AnnAGNPS in the Ganspoel watershed has highlighted a good prediction\ncapability
    only for the most intense runoff events (higher than 1 mm) in absence of calibra‐\ntion.
    The prediction capability of peak flows and sediment yields have resulted instead
    un‐\nsatisfactory (as also highlighted by the low coefficients of efficiency):
    the poor model’s\nsediment yield predictions reflect the unreliability of simulated
    values of peak flows, re‐\nquired as input by the erosive sub-model.\nThe influence
    of the limited availability of geomorphologic parameters (balanced by the esti‐\nmation,
    even reasonable, of some input parameters) as well as of hydrological observations\n(which
    even has advised against realistic calibration processes) on the model performance\ncan
    not be excluded.\nHowever, the availability of proper climatic (allowing set-up
    of input meteorological data)\nand GIS sub-routines (helping to process available
    DEM and themes) together with the user-\nfriendly graphical interfaces in the
    model software made easy in AnnAGNPS the input data\nprocessing. In spite of the
    large number of input parameters required (more than 100), as for\nthe majority
    of continuous, physically-based and distributed models, we have remarked a\nbasical
    easiness of model implementation at the Cannata watershed, thanks to the good\nSoil
    Erosion\n26\navailability of geomorphologic and hydrologic information within
    the experimental data‐\nbase as well as the easiness of finding/measuring the
    majority of input parameters (e.g. me‐\nteorological data, soil physical properties).
    Nevertheless, in some cases processing of\nsimulated hydrologic variables resulted
    in a time consuming task, especially for surface run‐\noff analysis at event scale.\nThe
    model performance could be further improved by optimising algorithms for water
    bal‐\nance of soil (in order to improve the simulation of more realistic moisture
    conditions) or by\nutilising as input the observed rainfall patterns (at hourly
    or sub-hourly scales) instead of\nthe synthetic hyetographs utilised at present
    by AnnAGNPS. Sensitivity analyses, which\nwould allow a more precise estimation
    of the input parameters to which model response is\nmore sensitive, would be advisable
    for a better model implementation.\nSuch improvements, together further research
    activities aiming at model verification in dif‐\nferent environmental conditions,
    could enhance the model consolidation and stimulate its\nwider diffusion in professional
    activities for controlling surface runoff and soil erosion as\nwell as planning
    mitigation countermeasures.\nAuthor details\nDemetrio Antonio Zema1*, Giuseppe

    Introduction\nNegative effects of surface runoff and soil erosion in watersheds
    can be controlled and miti‐\ngated through hydrological models. Moreover, they
    are suitable to simulate various combi‐\nnations of different scenarios of land
    and water management in a watershed and therefore\nthey are useful for comparative
    analysis of different options and as a guide to what Best\nManagement Practices
    (BMPs) can be adopted to minimize pollution from point and non‐\npoint sources
    (Shrestha et al., 2006).\nContinuous simulation models (e.g. AnnAGNPS, WEPP, SWAT,
    etc.) provide great advan‐\ntages over event-based models as they allow watersheds
    and their response to be studied\nover a longer time period in an integrated way.
    Nowadays, several continuous watershed-\nscale erosion models are available: however,
    relatively little validation of their performance\nunder varying climatic and
    land use conditions has been carried out. The latter is an essen‐\ntial step before
    a model can be reliably applied.\nThe AnnAGNPS (Annualized Agricultural Non-Point
    Source) model (Geter and Theurer,\n1998; Bingner and Theurer, 2001) is among the
    distributed models developed to evaluate the\ncontinuous hydrologic and water
    quality responses of watersheds. Many major hydrologic\nconcepts of the single-event
    AGNPS model (Young et al., 1987) have been updated through\nthe continuous simulation
    modeling of watershed physical processes (Baginska et al., 2003).\n© 2012 Zema

    assess runoff water amount and quality as well as\nsediment yield in small to
    large monitored watersheds (ranging from 0.32 to 2500 km2)\nunder different environmental
    conditions. Such applications were frequently coupled with\ncalibration/validation
    trials. Poor AnnAGNPS predictions of sediment and nutrient loads\nwere achieved
    in a Georgia watershed, covered by both extensive forest and riparian con‐\nditions
    and attributed this to the defective data input used with the model (Suttles et
    al.,\n2003). Moderate accuracy in model simulation of phosphorous and nitrogen
    processes\nwas also highlighted by model applications in two small watersheds
    located in the Missis‐\nsippi Delta (Yuan et al., 2005) and in the Sydney region
    (Baginska et al., 2003). The capa‐\nbility  of  the  model  (coupled  to  the  BATHTUB  eutrophication  reservoirs  model)  in\nsimulating
    nutrients load variations in response to land use changes in a Kansas large res‐\nervoir
    was pointed out by Wang et al. (2005).\nIn applications to a small Mississippi
    watershed reported by Yuan et al. (2001, 2005), An‐\nnAGNPS adequately predicted
    long-term monthly and annual runoff and sediment yield\nand predicted and observed
    runoff from individual events were reasonably close, achieving\ncoefficients of
    determination r2 and efficiency E (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) equal to 0.94 and\n0.91
    respectively). In a small Australian watershed, mainly covered by farming and
    residen‐\ntial land uses, acceptable model predictions (E = 0.82) were assessed
    for runoff at event scale\nafter the calibration of hydrological parameters Baginska
    et al. (2003).\nMore recently AnnAGNPS was implemented at a small Nepalese watershed,
    mainly for‐\nested and cultivated, where the need of calibration for satisfactory
    runoff predictions was\nshown. Despite the calibration process, peak flow and
    sediment yield evaluation resulted\nin  a  much  lower  accuracy  (Shrestha  et  al.,  2006).  The  prediction  performance  of  An‐\nnAGNPS
    in a 48-km2 watershed located in Kauai Island (Hawaii, USA) was considered\ngood
    for monthly runoff predictions and poor on a daily basis (Poliakov et al., 2007).
    Cal‐\nibration/validation tests in two small watersheds in S. Lucia Island (British
    West Indies)\n(agricultural and forested respectively) suggested that AnnAGNPS
    could be used under\nthe conditions tested tested (Sarangi et al., 2007). In an
    agricultural river basin (374 km2)\nof Czech Republic suspended load following
    short duration intensive rainfall events was\naccurately predicted by the AnnAGNPS
    model; there the model was not suitable for con‐\ntinuous simulation in large
    river basins with a high proportion of subsurface runoff (Kli‐\nment et al., 2008).
    In a 63-km2 watershed in Malaysia (tropical region which sometimes\nexperiences
    heavy rainfall runoff) was well predicted while results with respect to sedi‐\nment
    load were moderate (Shamshad et al., 2008).\nSome applications in Spanish catchments
    covered by olive orchards showed the sensitivity\nof AnnAGNPS to different temporal
    scales in modeling runoff and sediment yield under\ndifferent management systems
    (Aguilar and Polo, 2005) and the model applicability to pre‐\ndict runoff and
    sediment at event and monthly scales after calibration (Taguas et al., 2009).\nA
    calibration/validation exercise using a 10-year hydrological database in 53-km2
    watershed\nin Ontario (Canada) highlighted that adjustments of the monthly curve
    number values and\nof the RUSLE parameters are relevant to improve the hydrology
    and sediment components\nof AnnAGNPS, especially during winter and early spring
    periods (Das et al., 2009). A good\nmodel performance was obtained in terms of
    runoff and erosion prediction after calibration/\nSoil Erosion\n4\nvalidation
    processes in a 136-km2 agricultural watershed in south-central Kansas; total phos‐\nphorus
    predictions were instead good only for the calibration period (Parajuli et al.,
    2009).\nFinally, a poor model performance in simulating agricultural pollution
    by nitrogen, phos‐\nphorus and sediment was obtained in a 16.97-km2 watershed
    located in North Dakota\n(USA), mainly due to the large size of the study area
    and the high variability in land use and\nmanagement practices (Lyndon et al.,
    2010).\nThus, the results of AnnAGNPS evaluations that have hitherto been carried
    out are general‐\nly promising. At the same time it can be noticed that model
    performance is variable and the\nboundary conditions under which the model may
    be successfully used for runoff and sedi‐\nment yield prediction have not been
    well defined.\n2. Aim of the work\nIn order to consolidate use of the AnnAGNPS
    model in different climatic and geomorpho‐\nlogic conditions, this investigation
    has verified model prediction capability of surface runoff,\npeak flow and sediment
    yield in two small European watersheds under climate conditions\ntypical of the
    semi-arid (Cannata watershed, southern Italy) and humid-temperate (Gans‐\npoel
    watershed, central Belgium) environments respectively. Through this work we have
    in‐\nvestigated to what extent AnnAGNPS may be expected to provide usable results
    in\nenvironmental conditions outside of research watersheds, where sometimes the
    necessary\ndata for model calibration and validation are not available.\n3. The
    AnnAGNPS model\nAnnAGNPS is a distributed parameter, physically based, continuous
    simulation, daily time\nstep model, developed initially in 1998 through a partnering
    project between the USDA Ag‐\nricultural Research Service (ARS) and the Natural
    Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).\nThe model simulates runoff, sediment,
    nutrients and pesticides leaving the land surface and\nshallow subsurface and
    transported through the channel system to the watershed outlet,\nwith output available
    on an event, monthly and annual scale. Required inputs for model im‐\nplementation
    include climate data, watershed physical information, as well as crop and oth‐\ner
    land uses as well as irrigation management data.\nBecause of the continuous nature
    of AnnAGNPS, climate information, which includes daily\nprecipitation, maximum
    and minimum temperatures, dew point temperatures, sky cover\nand wind speed, is
    necessary to take into account temporal weather variations. The spatial\nvariability
    of soils, land use, topography and climatic conditions can be accounted for by
    di‐\nviding the watershed into user-specified homogeneous drainage areas. The
    basic compo‐\nnents of the model include hydrology, sedimentation and chemical
    transport.\nPrediction of Surface Runoff and Soil Erosion at Watershed Scale:
    Analysis of the AnnAGNPS Model\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/50427\n5\nThe SCS curve
    number technique (USDA-SCS, 1972) is used within the AnnAGNPS hydro‐\nlogic submodel
    to determine the surface runoff on the basis of a continuous soil moisture\nbalance.
    AnnAGNPS only requires initial values of curve number (CN) for antecedent mois‐\nture
    condition AMC-II, because the model updates the hydrologic soil conditions on
    the ba‐\nsis of the daily soil moisture balance and according to the crop cycle.\nThe
    peak flow is determined using the extended TR-55 method (Cronshey and Theurer,\n1998).  This  method  is  a  modification  of  the  original  NCRS-TR-55  technology  (USDA-\nNRCS,
    1986), which is considered as a robust empirical approach suitable for wide varie‐\nty
    of conditions including those where input data might be limited as in the experimental\nwatershed
    (Polyakov et al., 2007).\nThe AnnAGNPS erosion component simulates storm events
    on a daily basis for sheet and\nrill erosion based on the RUSLE method (Revised
    Universal Soil Loss Equation, version 1.5,\nRenard et al., 1997). The HUSLE (Hydrogeomorphic
    Universal Soil Loss Equation, Theurer\nand Clarke, 1991) is used to simulate the
    total sediment volume delivered from the field to\nthe channel after sediment
    deposition.\nThe sediment routing component simulates sheet and rill sediment
    deposition in five parti‐\ncle size classes (clay, silt, sand and small and large
    aggregates) on the basis of density and\nfall velocity of the particles and then
    routes sediment separately through the channel net‐\nwork to the watershed outlet
    as a function of sediment transport capacity (calculated by the\nBagnold equation;
    Bagnold, 1966). A key assumption is that the aggregates break up into\ntheir primary
    particles once they enter the stream channel.\nFor the chemical component of the
    model, dissolved and adsorbed sediment predictions are\nassessed for each cell
    by a mass balance approach. Algorithms for nutrient (nitrogen, phos‐\nphorous
    and organic carbon) and pesticide dynamics are largely similar to the EPIC (Wil‐\nliams
    et al., 1984) and GLEAMS (Leonard et al., 1987) models.\nMore details on the theoretical
    background of AnnAGNPS are reported by Bingner and\nTheurer (2005).\n4. Description
    of the Experimental Watersheds\nThe input data utilised for AnnAGNPS implementation
    in the Cannata watershed was col‐\nlected during a proper monitoring campaign
    providing topographic, soil and land use data\nas well as 7-year hydrological
    observations.\nFor model verification in the Ganspoel watershed the input database
    was drawn from the\nworks by Steegen et al., 2001 and Van Oost et al., 2005. Compared
    to the Cannata watershed,\nthis experimental database reported less geomorphological
    information; moreover, the hy‐\ndrological observations were related only to a
    2-year period: thus this study case represents\na typical “data-poor environment”
    (Merritt et al., 2003).\nSoil Erosion\n6\n4.1. Cannata watershed\n4.1.1. Geomorphological
    information\nThe Cannata watershed, located in eastern Sicily, southern Italy
    (outlet coordinates 37 53''N,\n14 46''E), is a mountainous tributary, ephemeral
    in flow, of the Flascio River (Figure 1).\nThe watershed covers about 1.3 km2
    between 903 m and 1270 m above mean sea level with\nan average land slope of 21%.
    The longest channel pathway is about 2.4 km, with an average\nslope of about 12%
    (Figure 2). The Kirpich concentration time is 0.29 h.\nFigure 1. View of the Cannata
    watershed in proximity of its outlet.\nIn a survey conducted at the start of experimental
    campaign, five different soil textures\n(clay,  loam,  loam-clay,  loam-sand  and  loam-sand-clay)  were  recognized  on  57  topsoil\nsamples;
    clay-loam (USDA classification) resulted as the dominant texture. The soil satu‐\nrated
    hydraulic conductivity, measured by a Guelph permeameter, resulted in the range\n0.2
    to 17.6 mm h-1.\nContinuous monitoring of land use has highlighted the prevalence
    of pasture areas (ranging\nbetween 87% and 92% of the watershed area) with different
    vegetation complexes (up to 15\nspecies) and ground covers. Four soil cover situations
    can be distinguished: a high-density\nherbaceous vegetation (eventually subjected
    to tillage operations), a medium-density herba‐\nceous vegetation, sparse shrubs
    and cultivated winter wheat with a wheat-fallow rotation.\nMore detailed information
    about the watershed characteristics and the monitoring equip‐\nment were reported
    previously (Licciardello and Zimbone, 2002).\nPrediction of Surface Runoff and

    2. Location, contour map and hydrographic network of the Cannata watershed.\n4.1.2.
    The hydrological database\nIn the monitoring period of 1996 to 2003 the hydrological
    observations were collected utilis‐\ning the following equipment (Figure 2): a
    meteorological station (A, located outside of the\nwatershed) recording rainfall,
    air temperature, wind, solar radiation and pan evaporation;\ntwo pluviometric
    stations (B and C); and a hydrometrograph (D) connected to a runoff wa‐\nter automatic
    sampler (E) for the measurement of sediment concentration in the flow.\nIn the
    observation period yearly rainfall between 541 and 846 mm (mainly concentrated\nfrom
    September to March) was recorded at the station A, with a mean and standard devia‐\ntion
    (SD) of 662 and 134 mm respectively. The corresponding yearly runoff was in the
    range\n30.7 to 365.8 mm, with a mean of 105.3 mm and SD of 100 mm. The coefficient
    of yearly run‐\noff, calculated as the ratio between total runoff and total rainfall
    as recorded by station A,\nvaried between 5% and 41%, with a mean and SD of 15%
    and 75% respectively. Occasional\nhigh differences in recorded rainfall events
    between the three gauges were found; as expect‐\ned, rainfall spatial variability
    decreased on a monthly and yearly basis.\nSoil Erosion\n8\nAt event scale, rainfall
    depths over 6.8 mm gave runoff volumes higher than 1 mm; the max‐\nimum runoff
    volume and discharge recorded in the observation period were 159.6 mm and\n3.4
    m3 s-1 (2.6 l s-1 km-2) respectively. Twenty-four erosive events were sampled
    with a sus‐\npended sediment concentration between 0.1 and 9.2 g l-1; the maximum
    event sediment yield\n(estimated on the basis of runoff volume and suspended sediment
    concentration in the flow)\nwas 283 Mg (2168.4 kg ha-1).\n4.2. Ganspoel watershed\n4.2.1.
    Geomorphological information\nThe Ganspoel watershed (outlet coordinates 50 48’N,
    4 35’E), located in central Belgium,\ncovers 1.15 km2 between 60 m and 100 m a.s.l.
    with an average slope of about 10%, but\nwhich can locally exceed 25%. A dense
    network of dry channels characterizes the area (Fig‐\nure 3). The topography of
    the area is formed in sandy deposits overlain by a loess layer that\nwas deposited
    during the latest glacial period. Soils are therefore dominantly loess-derived\nluvisols,
    with their physical parameters related much more to land use than to soil texture\n(Van
    Oost et al., 2005).\nTop soils have a very high silt percentage (on the average
    75%) and moderate clay and sand\ncontent (on the average 11% and 14% respectively)
    (Van Oost et al., 2005).\nThe watershed land use is mainly agricultural. Forested
    (5%) and pasture (4%) zones cover\nthe steep slopes as well as some of the thalweg
    areas. A built-up zone is located in north-\nwestern part of the Ganspoel watershed
    and represents 9% of its area (Steegen et al., 2001).\nThe main\nFigure 3. Location
    and aerial view of the Ganspoel watershed.\n4.2.2. The hydrological database\nThe
    climate of central Belgium shows relatively cool summers and mild winters resulting
    in\nan average annual temperature of 11 C. Annual precipitation varies normally
    between 700\nPrediction of Surface Runoff and Soil Erosion at Watershed Scale:

    year-1 and is well distributed over the year. High intensity rainfall events occur\nmainly
    in spring and summer: such thunderstorms may reach peak rainfall intensities of
    ca.\n70 mm h-1 while total rainfall amounts may amount to 40 mm, exceeding rarely
    60 mm.\nThe hydrological database was collected during a recording period of about
    2 years (May\n1997-February 1999). The rainfall and flow/sediment measurement
    station was located at the\noutlet of the watershed. The rainfall events were
    recorded by a tipping-bucket rain gauge\n(logging interval equal to 1 minute with
    0.5-mm tips). Water depths were continuously\nmeasured with a time interval of
    2 minutes and an accuracy of 2 mm by a San Dimas flume\nequipped with a flowmeter,
    using a submerged probe level sensor. Water discharge was\nthen calculated by
    a constant relationship between water depth and discharge. The suspend‐\ned sediment
    concentration, measured by an automated water sampler which a flow-propor‐\ntional
    sampling rate (every 30 m3 runoff), was determined by oven-drying every sample
    at\n105 C for 24 hours.\nSeventeen runoff events, corresponding to rainfall depths
    in the range 5.5-57.5 mm, were ade‐\nquately sampled (Table 1). The sampled events
    concerned generally low runoff volumes (15\nwith runoff depths lower than 2 mm),
    but the most intense event (13-14 September 1998) pro‐\nduced a runoff volume
    of 9.5 mm. Event-based sediment yields were in the range 2 to 604 kg\nha-1 (Table
    1). Ten other events were not taken into account because of inadequate sampling.\nEvent\nRainfall\nRunoff\nvolume\nRunoff\ncoefficient\nPeak\nflow\nSediment

    Event not taken into account, because of inadequate sampling (see Van Oost et
    al., 2005 for\nmore details).\nTable 1. Main characteristics of the observed events
    used for the AnnAGNPS model implementation at the Ganspoel\nwatershed (Ganspoel
    database, 2007).\n5. Model implementation\nThe watershed discretization into homogeneous
    drainage areas (“cells”) and the hydro‐\ngraphic network segmentation into channels
    (“reaches”) were performed for both water‐\nsheds using the GIS interface incorporated
    into AnnAGNPS.\nThe geometry and the density of the drainage network were modeled
    by setting the Critical\nSource Area (CSA) to 1.25 ha and the Minimum Source Channel
    Length (MSCL) to 100 m for\nthe Cannata watershed, which allowed a suitable representation
    of the same watershed in a\nprevious study (Licciardello et al., 2006). Such values
    were decreased to 0.5 ha and 50 m re‐\nspectively for the Ganspoel watershed,
    because of its higher land use heterogeneity (Near‐\ning et al., 2005). The Cannata
    watershed resulted in 78 cells and 32 reaches (Figure 4a), while\nthe Ganspoel
    watershed in 155 cells and 65 reaches (Figure 4b).\nThe elevation GIS layer was
    arranged by digitizing contour lines every 2 m on a 5-m resolution\nDEM; land
    use and soil input data were derived from 25-m resolution GIS maps. The morpho‐\nlogic
    parameters (i.e., cell slope length and steepness) as well as the dominant land
    uses and\nsoil types were directly associated with each drainage area by means
    of the GIS interface.\nPrediction of Surface Runoff and Soil Erosion at Watershed
    Scale: Analysis of the AnnAGNPS Model\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/50427\n11\nMeteorological
    and pluviometric input data were properly arranged by the AnnGNPS\nweather subroutines.
    For the Cannata watershed daily values of maximum and minimum\nair temperatures,
    relative humidity, solar radiation and wind velocity were measured at the\nmeteorological
    station within the watershed. Daily rainfall input data were derived from re‐\ncords
    provided by the three working rain gauges in the different periods and input to
    each\ndrainage area by applying the Thiessen polygon method, except when only
    the rainfall re‐\ncorded at a single station was available (Figure 2). For the
    Ganspoel watershed, as no mete‐\norological information (except for rainfalls)
    was provided in the database, air temperature,\nrelative humidity and wind velocity
    data were collected at the nearest meteorological sta‐\ntion (Bruxelles, 50 54’N,
    4 30’E, about 13 km far from the watershed outlet). Solar radiation\nwas evaluated
    by the Hargreaves'' formula. For both watersheds daily values of dew point\ntemperature
    were calculated on the basis of air temperature and humidity.\nFigure 4. Layouts
    of the Cannata (left) and Ganspoel (right) watershed discretisation by the AnnAGNPS
    model.\nTo allow the model to adjust the initial soil water storage terms, the
    first two years were ap‐\npended to the beginning of the precipitation and meteorological
    dataset. The initial values\nof CN, unique throughout the whole simulation period,
    were initially derived from the\nstandard procedure set by the USDA Soil Conservation
    Service (Table 2).\nTable 3 shows the values or range of the RUSLE parameters
    set utilised by the erosive sub‐\nmodel. The average annual rainfall factor (R),
    its cumulative percentages for 24 series of 15-\nday periods in a year and the
    soil erodibility factor (K) were determined according to\nguidelines by Wischmeier
    and Smith (1978), the latter on the basis of a field survey of soil\nhydrological
    characteristics (Indelicato, 1997; Steegen et al., 2001; Van Oost et al., 2005).\nIn
    the Cannata watershed, for each of the five soil textures, a uniform soil profile
    was\nmodeled up to 1500 mm by averaging the required physical characteristics
    from the field\nsamples. Soil wilting point and field capacity were derived from
    the experimental dataset.\nThe whole Ganspoel watershed was modelled assuming
    a unique soil type (silt loam) up\nto a depth of 1000 mm. Values of soil wilting
    point and field capacity, not available from\nthe Ganspoel dataset, were estimated
    by a pedo-transfer function (Saxton et al., 1986). The\nvalues of the soil saturated
    hydraulic conductivity (Ksat, in the range 0.001-205 mm h-1)\nwas derived from
    the LISEM Limburg database, as these data were collected on very sim‐\nSoil Erosion\n12\nilar
    soils (Takken et al., 1999; Nearing et al., 2005). Given that, as above mentioned,
    soil\nphysical parameters were much more related to land use than to soil texture
    (Van Oost et\nal., 2005), six different values of Ksat (one for each soil land
    use surveyed into the water‐\nshed) were input to the model.\nParameter\nCannata\nGanspoel\nLand\nuse\nValue\nLand\nuse\nValue\ndefault\nmodel\nafter\ncalibration\nHYDROLOGICAL

    simulation\nAfter processing the input parameters of the hydrological and erosive
    sub-models (respec‐\ntively requiring the determination of the initial Curve Numbers
    for the USDA SCS-CN mod‐\nel and the calculation of the RUSLE model factors),
    daily values of surface runoff, peak flow\nand sediment yield were continuously
    simulated at the outlet of both watersheds by An‐\nnAGNPS (version 3.2).\nConsidering
    that baseflow is not considered by AnnAGNPS, the surface runoff separation\nfrom
    baseflow was performed by the traditional manual linear method applied to observed\nstream
    flow data. Based on studies by Arnold et al. (1995) as well as Arnold and Allen\n(1999),
    these results match reasonably well with those obtained through an automated digi‐\ntal
    filter; the differences in the surface runoff component extracted by the two methods
    are\nup to 20% at yearly scale.\n5.1.1. Cannata watershed\nBoth the hydrological
    and erosion components of AnnAGNPS were calibrated/validated\nseparating the calibration
    and validation periods by the split-sample technique. The cali‐\nbration/validation
    process was carried out by modifying the initial values of CN, which\nrepresent
    a key factor in obtaining accurate prediction of runoff and sediment yield (Yuan\nSoil
    Erosion\n14\net al., 2001; Shrestha et al., 2006); and the most important input
    parameter to which the\nrunoff is sensitive (Yuan et al., 2001; Baginska et al.,
    2003), besides soil (field capacity,\nwilting point and saturated hydraulic conductivity)
    as well as climate parameters (precipi‐\ntation, temperature and interception).\nIn
    order to calibrate/validate the peak flows and the sediment yields, both 24-h
    rainfall dis‐\ntributions typical of a Pacific maritime climate (types I and Ia)
    with wet winter and dry\nsummers (USDA-NCRS, 1986) derived by the extended TR-55
    method database were used.\nThe sediment yields were evaluated at event scale
    by adjusting the surface long-term ran‐\ndom roughness coefficient (which affects
    the RUSLE C-factor) as well as the sheet and con‐\ncentrated flow Manning''s roughness
    coefficients (Table 3).\n5.1.2. Ganspoel watershed\nFor simulation of surface
    runoff, peak flow and sediment yield events, the AnnAGNPS\nmodel run with default
    input parameters (Table 3). No calibration/validation processes\nwere undertaken.\n6.
    Model evaluation\nIn both the experimental watersheds surface runoff volumes and
    sediment yields were eval‐\nuated at the event scale; in the Cannata watershed
    the analysis of surface runoff was extend‐\ned to the monthly and annual scale.\nModel
    performance was assessed by qualitative and quantitative approaches. The qualita‐\ntive
    procedure consisted of visually comparing observed and simulated values. For quanti‐\ntative
    evaluation a range of both summary and difference measures were used (Table 4).\nThe
    summary measures utilized were the mean and standard deviation of both observed\nand
    simulated values. Given that coefficient of determination, r2, is an insufficient
    and often\nmisleading evaluation criterion, the Nash and Sutcliffe (1970) coefficient
    of efficiency (E) and\nits modified form (E1) were also used to assess model efficiency
    (Table 4). In particular, E is\nmore sensitive to extreme values, while E1 is
    better suited to significant over- or underpre‐\ndiction by reducing the effect
    of squared terms (Krause et al, 2005). As suggested by the\nsame authors, E and
    E1 were integrated with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), which de‐\nscribes
    the difference between the observed values and the model predictions in the unit
    of\nthe variable. Finally, the Coefficient of Residual Mass (CRM) was used to
    indicate a preva‐\nlent model over- or underestimation of the observed values
    (Loague and Green, 1991).\nThe values considered to be optimal for these criteria
    were 1 for r2, E and E1 and 0 for RMSE\nand CRM (Table 4). According to common
    practice, simulation results are considered good\nfor values of E greater than
    or equal to 0.75, satisfactory for values of E between 0.75 and\n0.36 and unsatisfactory
    for values below 0.36 (Van Liew and Garbrecht, 2003).\nPrediction of Surface Runoff

    total runoff volume for the period of October 1996 to December 2000 (405.72\nmm)
    was only slightly higher than the observed value (393.23 mm), showing a runoff
    pre‐\ndiction capability for long periods, which was also detected by other Authors
    (Yuan et al.,\n2001). The improvement in the annual runoff volume predictions
    after the calibration is due\nto the reduction of the cumulated volume overprediction
    relative to events with smaller\nrunoff (Figure 5). In some cases, at the beginning
    of the wet season, runoff was generated by\nAnnAGNPS but not observed (Figure
    6). This was probably due to the peculiarity of the hy‐\ndrological processes
    governing runoff formation in Mediterranean regions, depending not\nonly on catchment
    characteristics but also on antecedent hydrological conditions and char‐\nacteristics
    of the rainfall events, with low runoff coefficients as a result of short-duration,\nhigh-intensity
    convective storms over dry soils (Latron et al., 2003).\nPrediction of Surface

    apparent best results achieved for monthly and event-scale runoff volume predictions\nwith
    respect to annual values may depend on the fact that the simulation period only
    repre‐\nsents a few years of data (four years and three years for the calibration
    and validation peri‐\nods, respectively), while monthly and event-scale simulations
    provide more data for the\nstatistics. Moreover, in Table 5, results of simulations
    related to the period of October to De‐\ncember 1996, which was very well simulated
    by the model, are not reported.\nFigure 7. Comparison between observed and simulated

    performance of the calibrated model was evaluated for the period of January 2001
    to\nDecember 2003 in terms of runoff, peak flow and sediment yield.\nAnnAGNPS
    runoff volume predictions confirmed the satisfactory model performance both at\nthe
    event and annual scales and the good performance at the monthly aggregated values
    (Ta‐\nble 5). However, an underprediction was highlighted by the difference in
    summary measures\nand the values of RMSE and CRM. This tendency was mainly due
    to underestimation of the\nmore significant events (Figure 7), as also found in
    the tests performed by Yuan et al. (2001).\nThe poor performance of the model
    in predicting extreme peak flows was confirmed in the val‐\nidation period. The
    overall model prediction capability was unsatisfactory (Table 6), as shown\nby
    the poor value of the coefficient of efficiency (E = 0.05). A high overprediction
    (over 105%)\nfor the most significant event, which occurred on 12 December 2003,
    is also noted.\nA satisfactory model efficiency (E1 = 0.55) and a very high coefficient
    of determination (r2> 0.90)\nwere also found for the suspended sediment yield
    events observed in the period of 2001 to 2003\n(Table 7 and Figure 8). The satisfactory
    value achieved for the Nash and Sutcliffe coefficient (E\n= 0.87) was mainly due
    to the successful performance of the model for large rainfall events, in\nparticular
    for the highest sediment yield, which occurred on 12 December 2003.\n7.2. Ganspoel
    watershed\nRunoff depths were in general underpredicted (see the positive value
    of the CRM coefficient\nin Table 8). The accuracy achieved for the prediction
    of the largest event (13-14/09/1998)\ngave a coefficient of determination exceeding
    0.90 (Figure 9) and a model efficiency (E) of\n0.89 for runoff depth (Table 8).
    The mean and standard deviation of simulated runoff vol‐\nPrediction of Surface
    Runoff and Soil Erosion at Watershed Scale: Analysis of the AnnAGNPS Model\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/50427\n21\nume
    depths were close to the corresponding observed values with differences lower
    than\n12% and 16%. When the events for which zero runoff was simulated events
    were excluded\nfrom the analysis, the values for r2 and E become 0.98 and 0.97
    respectively. Similarly high\nvalues for the coefficient of determination were
    found for runoff simulations by AnnAGNPS\nat the event scale by Yuan et al. (2001),
    Shrestha et al. (2006) and Shamshad et al. (2008) and\nfor the coefficient of
    determination and model efficiency by Sarangi et al. (2007). However,\nin these
    studies AnnAGNPS was calibrated before a validation was carried out.\nFrom such
    outcomes it can be remarked that the AnnAGNPS model provided a generally\ngood
    capability to simulate the greatest runoff event in the Ganspoel watershed, as
    shown\nby the high coefficients of efficiency (E and E1) and determination (r2)
    achieved without any\na priori calibration. The latter is an important observation
    as it shows that, at least for signif‐\nicant events, adequate runoff modeling
    is possible without calibration provided that suffi‐\nciently detailed input data
    are available. The latter should not only contain land use, but\nalso surface
    characteristics and soil roughness as these are important controls on runoff pro‐\nduction.
    This result contrasts somewhat with that of many other studies, where the need
    for\nappropriate calibration is stressed (e.g. Refsgaard, 1997; Beven, 2006).
    A possible reason for\nthis is that in many cases the available input data are
    less detailed than those available for\nthe Ganspoel watersheds in terms of soil
    surface characteristics and coverage. The latter are\nimportant controls on runoff
    generation: if such data are not available, model predictions\ncannot be expected
    to be accurate without prior calibration.\nThe majority of the observations available
    in the hydrological database was of low magni‐\ntude (14 out of 17 with runoff
    depths lower than 1 mm); for them the model simulation ac‐\ncuracy was basically
    less accurate, achieving a mean deviation between simulations and\nobservations
    of about 50%. Moreover, seven events (five of them concentrated at the end of\nrelatively
    dry periods and generated by storms with a depth up to 13 mm) resulted in zero\nrunoff
    simulation, even tuning the values of the initial CNs or saturated hydraulic conduc‐\ntivity
    (which represent the most important input parameters to which the runoff is sensitive\n(Yuan
    et al., 2001; Baginska et al., 2003) and setting up pre-run before the first event
    simulat‐\ned (which is important for initial soil moisture). The AnnAGNPS model,
    calculating daily\nand sub-daily water budgets using NRCS TR-55 method coming
    from the SWRRB and EPIC\nmodels (Williams et al, 1984; USDA-NRCS, 1986), presumably
    would have adjusted the CNs\nto antecedent moisture condition AMC-I based on the
    NRCS criteria, minimising the effect\nof varying the CNs (Sarangi et al., 2007).
    The climatic characteristics of the studied water‐\nshed caused the model to produce
    unrealistic CN values during its initialization and, as a\nresult, too low or
    no predicted runoff, as also found in various experimental applications in\ndifferent
    climatic conditions (Polyakov et al., 2007; Sarangi et al., 2007).\nEven in the
    Ganspoel watershed adjustments of minimum and maximum interception, as\noperated
    for model’s implementation at the Cannata watershed, did not further improve the\ncoefficients
    E, E1 and r2 calculated for runoff volume prediction.\nThe AnnAGNPS model provided
    the highest accuracy in peak flow predictions when the\ntype “II” synthetic 24-h
    rainfall distribution (typical of continental climate, with cold winter\nand warm
    summer) was set in simulation tests (Figure 9). Even though statistics of observed\nSoil
    Erosion\n22\nand predicted values were of the same order of magnitude (Table 8),
    the low values ach‐\nieved by the coefficients of efficiency (E and E1 lower than
    0.35) and conversely the high\nRMSE (163% of observed mean, Table 8) utilized
    for model evaluation confirmed the unsat‐\nisfactory prediction capability of
    the model for peak flow, also found elsewhere in different\nmodel tests (Shrestha
    et al., 2006). The model uses the extended TR-55 methods through syn‐\nthetic
    24-h rainfall distributions to calculate the peak flow (Cronshey and Theurer,
    1998).\nApparently, the latter method results is not suitable for the study area,
    leading to a severe\nunderestimation of rainfall intensities and hence peak flows,
    a fact also noted by Shrestha et\nal. (2006). A prediction method that takes into
    account the actual patterns of rainfall intensi‐\nty would be expected to provide
    better accuracy in peak flow estimations.\nRunoff\nValues\nMean\n(mm)\nStd. Dev.\n(mm)\nr2\nE\nE1\nRMSE\n(mm)\nCRM\nObserved\n1.04\n2.26\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nPredicted\n0.87\n2.53\n0.92\n0.89\n0.59\n0.73\n0.16\nPeak

    between observed and predict‐\ned values was relatively low (Table 9; Figure 9).
    Coefficients of efficiency (E and E1) were\nclose to zero and the coefficient

    of what reported by Yuan et al. (2001), Shrestha et al. (2006), Polyakov et\nal.
    (2007) and Shamshad et al. (2008) in sediment yield modeling by AnnAGNPS.\nThe
    model tendency to strongly underpredict peak flow is probably one of the main
    rea‐\nsons for the underestimation of erosive events and, consequently, of sediment
    yield (also\nPrediction of Surface Runoff and Soil Erosion at Watershed Scale:

    the separate comparison of deposition and erosion values for observed and si‐\nmulated
    events, Van Oost et al., 2005), but is not the only one. Also in the case of a
    good\nestimation of the runoff volume and an overestimation of the peak flow (13-14/09/1998),\nthe
    sediment yield was underestimated. Runoff alone is not adequate for erosion and\nsediment
    delivery predictions, but in the AnnAGNPS erosion sub-model it is used to esti‐\nmate
    the delivery of the particle sizes of eroded sediment (simulated through the RUSLE\nmodel)
    based on runoff and peak flow.\nFigure 9. Comparison of 17 observed and simulated

    flow (upper right) and sediment yield (bottom) (values are in logarithmic scale).\nHowever,
    another factor that may also play a role in poor model simulations of erosion
    was\nthe limited availability of input parameters. The AnnAGNPS model requires
    up to 100\nunique parameters for runoff volume assessment and up to an additional
    80 unique parame‐\nters for sediment yield prediction. As values for these parameters
    were not all available in\nthe Ganspoel dataset data from the literature had to

    9. Main characteristics of the observed events and simulations by the AnnAGNPS
    model at the Ganspoel\nwatershed.\nMoreover, the following factors can explain
    the low correlation between observed and pre‐\ndicted sediment yields:\n• AnnAGNPS
    uses the RUSLE method as the erosion sub-model. RUSLE has been devel‐\noped to
    deliver estimates of long-term average erosion rates rather than event-based sim‐\nulations.
    For this reason, comparison of individual events may not agree as well as long-\nterm
    annual values (Shrestha et al., 2006), even in the case of adequate prediction
    for the\nmost intense runoff events, as achieved in our model tests;\n• we deliberately
    opted to evaluated the AnnAGNPS model without prior validation in or‐\nder to
    assess its performance in cases where no data for validation are available;\n•
    the Ganspoel watershed contains more than 80 fields (roads, buildings, forest,
    grassed chan‐\nnels and several crops with differing planting and harvesting schedules),
    showing difficul‐\nties for modeling of interactions between physical processes

    infiltration and runoff as well as soil detachment and transport) and water and\nsediment
    routing associated with its complexity (Nearing et al., 2005; Licciardello et
    al.,\n2009). Probably, the scale of soil property measurements within the available
    geomorpho‐\nlogical database does not correspond to the discretisation scale of
    the Ganspoel watershed\n(characterized by land use heterogeneity and crop schedule
    complexity, as mentioned\nabove) performed by the GIS interface of the data-intensive
    AnnAGNPS model.\n8. Conclusion\nThe implementation of the AnnAGNPS in two small
    agricultural watersheds (Cannata,\nsouthern Italy, and Ganspoel, central Belgium)
    provided interesting indications about mod‐\nel’s prediction capability of surface
    runoff, peak flow and sediment yield and thus about its\napplicability in the
    experimental conditions.\nThe study case of the Cannata watershed has highlighted
    a good prediction capability of run‐\noff and erosive events, particularly for
    the events of highest relative magnitude (higher than 15\nmm and 100 kg ha-1 respectively);
    a good accuracy has been achieved also for monthly runoff\nvolumes simulation.
    The over-estimation of runoff volumes at yearly scale has been limited by\nsetting
    up the initial CNs in the calibration phase, with mean differences between observed\nand
    simulated yearly values lower than 20%. Peak flow predictions have been satisfactory
    on‐\nly for the less intense events (lower than 0.3 m3/s); the utilisation of
    the different synthetic hye‐\ntographs available for the hydrologic sub-model
    has not hallowed to eliminate the high over-\nestimation of the most intense peak
    flows. On the whole, the results provided by the analysis of\nthis study case
    encourage further efforts in order to verify the model transferability to the
    cli‐\nmatic conditions typical of the semi-arid Mediterranean environment.\nThe
    evaluation of AnnAGNPS in the Ganspoel watershed has highlighted a good prediction\ncapability
    only for the most intense runoff events (higher than 1 mm) in absence of calibra‐\ntion.
    The prediction capability of peak flows and sediment yields have resulted instead
    un‐\nsatisfactory (as also highlighted by the low coefficients of efficiency):
    the poor model’s\nsediment yield predictions reflect the unreliability of simulated
    values of peak flows, re‐\nquired as input by the erosive sub-model.\nThe influence
    of the limited availability of geomorphologic parameters (balanced by the esti‐\nmation,
    even reasonable, of some input parameters) as well as of hydrological observations\n(which
    even has advised against realistic calibration processes) on the model performance\ncan
    not be excluded.\nHowever, the availability of proper climatic (allowing set-up
    of input meteorological data)\nand GIS sub-routines (helping to process available
    DEM and themes) together with the user-\nfriendly graphical interfaces in the
    model software made easy in AnnAGNPS the input data\nprocessing. In spite of the
    large number of input parameters required (more than 100), as for\nthe majority
    of continuous, physically-based and distributed models, we have remarked a\nbasical
    easiness of model implementation at the Cannata watershed, thanks to the good\nSoil
    Erosion\n26\navailability of geomorphologic and hydrologic information within
    the experimental data‐\nbase as well as the easiness of finding/measuring the
    majority of input parameters (e.g. me‐\nteorological data, soil physical properties).
    Nevertheless, in some cases processing of\nsimulated hydrologic variables resulted
    in a time consuming task, especially for surface run‐\noff analysis at event scale.\nThe
    model performance could be further improved by optimising algorithms for water
    bal‐\nance of soil (in order to improve the simulation of more realistic moisture
    conditions) or by\nutilising as input the observed rainfall patterns (at hourly
    or sub-hourly scales) instead of\nthe synthetic hyetographs utilised at present
    by AnnAGNPS. Sensitivity analyses, which\nwould allow a more precise estimation
    of the input parameters to which model response is\nmore sensitive, would be advisable
    for a better model implementation.\nSuch improvements, together further research
    activities aiming at model verification in dif‐\nferent environmental conditions,

    Resumo em inglês The objective of this study was to quantify the water use efficiency
    of upland rice (Oryza sativa L.) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) under
    precision irrigation management as well as the morphological and physiological
    responses of these crops to drought situations. The experiments were carried out
    under rain shelter conditions at the Biosystems Engineering Department (LEB),
    Sao Paulo University (ESALQ), Piracicaba SP, Brazil. In the upland rice experiment,
    four cultivars were tested and water depletion levels were 70 and 40%, which were
    imposed at two phenological stages: flowering and grain filling. In the common
    bean experiment, water depletion levels were 75 and 50% and irrigation strategies
    included long-term periods (20 DAS until the end of the crop cycle) and short-term
    periods (vegetative and flowering stages). Irrigation management was based on
    tensiometry measurements in control plots (100% of the field capacity). Irrigation
    depth reductions were a fraction of this control management. Under well-watered
    conditions, water use efficiency (WUE) for upland rice and common bean was on
    average of 1.4 and 1.6 kg m-3, respectively. WUE for upland rice was higher than
    traditional values reported in the literature, whereas for common bean it was
    similar to reported values for this crop under drip irrigation. WUE was not improved
    in any experiment under deficit irrigation strategies. Water stress occasioned
    significant decreases in grain yield and grain yield components of upland rice
    and common bean. Also, physiological traits were affected by irrigation withholding
    to a greater extent with the least replenishment levels. WUE derived from gas
    exchange measurements was not correlated with WUE measured at the end of the crop
    cycle. In conclusion, water use efficiency can be increased with the use of precision
    irrigation management, whereas irrigation deficits can affect WUE and grain productivity
    in both upland rice and common bean. Título em português Eficiência do uso da

    Palavras-chave em português Oryza sativa Phaseolus vulgaris Déficit hídrico Fisiologia
    Rendimento de grão Resumo em português O presente trabalho teve como objetivo
    quantificar a eficiência do uso da água do arroz de terras altas (Oryza sativa
    L.) e do feijão comum (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) sob manejo de irrigação de precisão,
    bem como as respostas morfológicas e fisiológicas destas culturas a situações
    de seca. Os experimentos foram realizados em um ambiente protegido localizado
    no Departamento de Engenharia de Biossistemas (LEB), Universidade de São Paulo
    (ESALQ), Piracicaba - SP, Brasil. No experimento de arroz de terras altas, foram
    testadas quatro cultivares e os níveis de reposição de água foram de 70 e 40%
    CC, os quais foram impostos em duas fases fenológicas: floração e enchimento de
    grãos. No experimento do feijão comum, os níveis de reposição de água foram 75
    e 50% CC e as estratégias de irrigação incluíram períodos de longo prazo (20 DAS
    até o fim do ciclo de cultivo) e períodos de curto prazo (fases vegetativas e
    de floração). O manejo da irrigação foi baseado em medições de tensiometria em
    um tratamento testemunha (100% da capacidade do campo). As reduções dos demais
    tratamentos foram frações do tratamento testemunha. Em condições de irrigação
    plena, a eficiência do uso da água (WUE) para o arroz de terras altas e feijão
    comum foi em média de 1,4 e 1,6 kg m-3, respectivamente. A WUE para o arroz de
    terras altas foi superior aos valores tradicionais reportados na literatura, enquanto
    que para o feijão comum foi semelhante aos valores reportados para esta cultura
    sob irrigação por gotejamento. A WUE não foi melhorada em nenhum experimento sob
    estratégias de irrigação deficitária. O estresse hídrico provocou diminuições
    significativas no rendimento e componentes de rendimento do arroz de terras altas
    e do feijão comum. Além disso, os caracteres fisiológicos foram afetados pela
    retenção de irrigação em maior medida com os níveis mínimos de reposição. A WUE
    derivada das medições de trocas gasosas não esteve correlacionada com a WUE medida
    no final do ciclo de cultivo. Em conclusão, a eficiência do uso de água pode ser
    aumentada com o uso de irrigação de precisão, enquanto que os déficits de irrigação
    podem afetar a WUE e a produtividade dos grãos tanto no arroz de terras altas
    como no feijão comum.   AVISO - A consulta a este documento fica condicionada

    no Departamento de Engenharia de Biossistemas (LEB), Universidade de São Paulo
    (ESALQ), Piracicaba - SP, Brasil. No experimento de arroz de terras altas, foram
    testadas quatro cultivares e os níveis de reposição de água foram de 70 e 40%
    CC, os quais foram impostos em duas fases fenológicas: floração e enchimento de
    grãos. No experimento do feijão comum, os níveis de reposição de água foram 75
    e 50% CC e as estratégias de irrigação incluíram períodos de longo prazo (20 DAS
    até o fim do ciclo de cultivo) e períodos de curto prazo (fases vegetativas e
    de floração). O manejo da irrigação foi baseado em medições de tensiometria em
    um tratamento testemunha (100% da capacidade do campo). As reduções dos demais
    tratamentos foram frações do tratamento testemunha. Em condições de irrigação
    plena, a eficiência do uso da água (WUE) para o arroz de terras altas e feijão
    comum foi em média de 1,4 e 1,6 kg m-3, respectivamente. A WUE para o arroz de
    terras altas foi superior aos valores tradicionais reportados na literatura, enquanto
    que para o feijão comum foi semelhante aos valores reportados para esta cultura
    sob irrigação por gotejamento. A WUE não foi melhorada em nenhum experimento sob
    estratégias de irrigação deficitária. O estresse hídrico provocou diminuições
    significativas no rendimento e componentes de rendimento do arroz de terras altas
    e do feijão comum. Além disso, os caracteres fisiológicos foram afetados pela
    retenção de irrigação em maior medida com os níveis mínimos de reposição. A WUE
    derivada das medições de trocas gasosas não esteve correlacionada com a WUE medida
    no final do ciclo de cultivo. Em conclusão, a eficiência do uso de água pode ser
    aumentada com o uso de irrigação de precisão, enquanto que os déficits de irrigação
    podem afetar a WUE e a produtividade dos grãos tanto no arroz de terras altas

    Resumo em inglês The objective of this study was to quantify the water use efficiency
    of upland rice (Oryza sativa L.) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) under
    precision irrigation management as well as the morphological and physiological
    responses of these crops to drought situations. The experiments were carried out
    under rain shelter conditions at the Biosystems Engineering Department (LEB),
    Sao Paulo University (ESALQ), Piracicaba SP, Brazil. In the upland rice experiment,
    four cultivars were tested and water depletion levels were 70 and 40%, which were
    imposed at two phenological stages: flowering and grain filling. In the common
    bean experiment, water depletion levels were 75 and 50% and irrigation strategies
    included long-term periods (20 DAS until the end of the crop cycle) and short-term
    periods (vegetative and flowering stages). Irrigation management was based on
    tensiometry measurements in control plots (100% of the field capacity). Irrigation
    depth reductions were a fraction of this control management. Under well-watered
    conditions, water use efficiency (WUE) for upland rice and common bean was on
    average of 1.4 and 1.6 kg m-3, respectively. WUE for upland rice was higher than
    traditional values reported in the literature, whereas for common bean it was
    similar to reported values for this crop under drip irrigation. WUE was not improved
    in any experiment under deficit irrigation strategies. Water stress occasioned
    significant decreases in grain yield and grain yield components of upland rice
    and common bean. Also, physiological traits were affected by irrigation withholding
    to a greater extent with the least replenishment levels. WUE derived from gas
    exchange measurements was not correlated with WUE measured at the end of the crop
    cycle. In conclusion, water use efficiency can be increased with the use of precision
    irrigation management, whereas irrigation deficits can affect WUE and grain productivity
    in both upland rice and common bean. Título em português Eficiência do uso da

    Matrouh Univ., Egypt. 10.21608/SINJAS.2019.79091 Abstract Two open-field experiments
    were conducted during 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 seasons at the experimental farm,
    Faculty of Environ. Agric. Sciences, Arish University (31° 08'' 04.3\" N, 33°
    49'' 37.2\" E). Egypt. This work was aimed to evaluate the performance of four
    bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars i.e.; Misr-1, Sakha-93, Giza-168
    and Gemmeiza-9) in relation to different irrigation pattern i.e. surface supplemental
    irrigations (12 irrigations) and rainfed under the metrological conditions of
    North Sinai. Results obtained from the experimental field studies were used as
    indicators to test the performance of DSSAT-CSM (Cropping System Model) Ver. 4.5.1.023.
    Field experiment results indicated that under North Sinai environmental conditions,
    the significantly highest values of the most significant values of vegetative
    growth and yield and it''s component were recorded by Gemmeiza-9 cultivar under
    supplementary irrigation pattern, followed by rainfed Misr-1 cultivar. The output
    data from the CERES-Wheat model showed that Gemmeiza-9 cultivar recorded the highest
    observed grain yield in the 1st and 2nd seasons (7344 and 5928 kg ha-1, respectively)
    and the highest predicted grain yield (3957 kg ha-1 and 4619 kg ha-1, respectively)
    as compared to other wheat cultivars Misr-1, Sakha-93 and Giza-168. Generally,
    Supplementary irrigated Gemmeiza-9 cultivar is recommended to maximize bread wheat
    grain yield under North Sinai environmental conditions and all similarity regions.

    The efficient operation and management of an existing water supply system require
    short-term water demand forecasts as inputs. Conventionally, regression and time
    series analysis have been employed in modelling short-term water demand forecasts.
    The relatively new technique of artificial neural networks has been proposed as
    an efficient tool for modelling and forecasting in recent years. The primary objective
    of this study is to investigate the relatively new technique of artificial neural
    networks for use in forecasting short-term water demand at the Indian Institute
    of Technology, Kanpur. Other techniques investigated in this study include regression
    and time series analysis for comparison purposes. The secondary objective of this
    study is to investigate the validity of the following two hypotheses: 1) the short-term
    water demand process at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur campus is a
    dynamic process mainly driven by the maximum air temperature and interrupted by
    rainfall occurrences, and 2) occurrence of rainfall is a more significant variable
    than the rainfall amount itself in modelling the short-term water demand forecasts.
    The data employed in this study consist of weekly water demand at the Indian Institute
    of Technology, Kanpur campus, and total weekly rainfall and weekly average maximum
    air temperature from the City of Kanpur, India. Six different artificial neural
    network models, five regression models, and two time series models have been developed
    and compared. The artificial neural network models consistently outperformed the
    regression and time series models developed in this study. An average absolute
    error in forecasting of 2.41% was achieved from the best artificial neural network
    model, which also showed the best correlation between the modelled and targeted
    water demands. It has been found that the water demand at the Indian Institute
    of Technology, Kanpur campus is better correlated with the rainfall occurrence
    rather than the amount of rainfall itself. Article PDF Similar content being viewed

    Streamflow model including rainfall–runoff and river flow models play an important
    role in water resources management, especially in arid inland area. Traditional
    conceptual models have the disadvantage of requirement of spatial variation parameters
    about the physical characteristics of the catchments. To overcome this difficulty,
    in this study, several integrated Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were presented
    to estimate monthly river flow, and the models include the semi-distributed forms
    of ANNs that can explore spatial variation in hydrological process (such as rainfall
    distribution and evaporation distribution) and no requirement of physical characteristic
    parameters of the catchments. In an arid inland basin of Northwest, integrated
    ANNs were developed using hydrological and agricultural data, and its performance
    was compared with that of lumped ANN and local linear regression model (LLR).
    Results showed that the integrated ANNs perform well to estimate the monthly streamflow
    at outlet of mountain with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.36 × 107 m3 and
    Relative Error (RE) of 9%. Similarly, the integrated ANNs can also accurately
    estimate the monthly river flow downstream of the basin with RMSE of 0.35–0.38
    × 107 m3 and RE of 22–27%. When compared with integrated ANNs, the lumped ANN
    and LLR models have lower precision to simulate monthly streamflow in arid inland
    basin. Presented integrated ANN models retain the advantages of the semi-distributed
    models considering the heterogeneity and spatial variation of hydrological factors
    and the physical characteristics in the catchment, while taking advantage of the
    potential of ANNs as an effective tool in nonlinear mapping or functional relationship
    establishment. In contrast to traditional models either in the lumped ANN or in
    empirical regression forms, the new approach of integration of Artificial Neural
    Networks has shown great potential in streamflow modeling. Highlights ► Integrated
    ANNs were present to estimate monthly river flow and the models. ► Integrated
    ANNs can explore spatial variation in rainfall and evaporation distribution. ►
    Integrated ANNs’ performance was compared with that of lumped ANN and local linear
    regression model. ► Integrated ANNs perform well to estimate the monthly streamflow
    than other models. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Artificial
    Neural NetworkRiver flowSimulationNorthwest China 1. Introduction Streamflow model
    including rainfall–runoff and river flow models plays an important role in water
    resources management. Especially in arid regions where water resources are scarce,
    streamflow simulations are useful to water resources’ temporal and spatial plan
    and distributions. To address this, different types of models with various degrees
    of complexity have been developed. Recently, hydrologists have endeavored to better
    understand the streamflow transformation process and many conceptual models had
    been developed, such as the Xinanjiang Model (Zhao and Liu, 1995), the Soil Moisture
    Accounting and Routing (SMAR) Model (Tan and Connor, 1996), and the Tank Model
    (Sugawara, 1995). However, the rainfall–runoff transformation is one of the most
    complex hydrological phenomena to comprehend, as it usually involves a number
    of interconnected elements, such as evapotranspiration, infiltration, surface
    and subsurface runoff generation and routing. It is hard to accurately describe
    rainfall–runoff in a catchment. In fact, the streamflow process is further complicated
    as heterogeneity of the catchment geomorphological characteristics (such as soil
    type and vegetation cover) and the spatial and temporal variations of model’s
    inputs (such as rainfall patterns). For further improving the performance of rainfall–runoff,
    a lot of recent researches focus on the distributed hydrological model (Schumann
    et al., 2000), such as Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. However, the
    distributed hydrological model need a number of catchment parameters, such as
    soil type and vegetation cover, and generally these data are hard to be observed.
    Although some optimized techniques, such as genetic algorithm (GA) and fuzzy optimal
    model (FOM), were used to calibrate the model (Cheng et al., 2002), and web-based
    flood forecasting system has been attempted (Li et al., 2006), the distributed
    hydrological model is not convenient to use widely. Artificial Neural Networks
    (ANNs) are flexible mathematical structures, which are capable of identifying
    complex nonlinear relationships between input and output data. A comparison between
    model performances was made by Hsu et al. (1995) using daily time steps. They
    concluded that ANN could better simulate the rainfall–runoff relationship on a
    river basin in Mississippi, USA, when compared to a conceptual model and a linear
    autoregressive moving average with exogenous inputs (ARMAX) model. ANNs have been
    compared to other methods including genetic algorithm (GA), support vector machine
    (SVM), fuzzy logic (FL), and linear transfer function (LTF) for river flow simulation
    and obtained better performance (Wang et al., 2009, Lohani et al., 2011, Lin et
    al., 2006). The recent decade has seen a tremendous growth in the interest of
    application of ANNs in streamflow modeling (Kumar and Minocha, 2001; Tokar and
    Markus, 2000, Sajikumar and Thandaveswara, 1999, Zhang and Govindaraju, 2003).
    Some researches had been conducted to improve ANNs’ performance, such as the data-preprocessing
    techniques of singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and moving average (MA) (Wu et
    al., 2009), and particle swarm optimization techniques (PSO) for ANNs’ training
    (Chau, 2006). ANNs had also been used to predict further long-term streamflows
    (Gao et al., 2010). However, most of the ANN models for streamflow process reported
    in literature used a total rainfall value over the catchments in the input vector,
    that is, a single ANN was used to simulate hydrological processes for a catchment.
    Similar to traditional conceptual hydrological model, present ANN models cannot
    reflect the effect of heterogeneity of the catchment’s geomorphological characteristics
    on hydrological processes. Furthermore, the ANN and conceptual models have been
    combined to estimate the river flow (Ashu and Sanaga, 2006, Corzo et al., 2009,
    Chen and Adams, 2006, Kamp and Savenijie, 2007, Jeong and Kim, 2005, Nilsson et
    al., 2006). These models combining conceptual hydrological models and ANN models
    usually include two parts, a conceptual model for streamflow of every sub-catchment
    and an ANN model to ensemble the streamflow from each catchment. In fact, these
    combined distributed hydrological models have not avoided the requirement of parameters
    for conceptual hydrological model for every sub-catchment. In addition, overall,
    traditional conceptual models have the disadvantage of requirement of spatial
    variation parameters about the physical characteristics of the catchments, and
    a single ANN cannot reflect the spatial variations of hydrometeorological factors
    and geomorphological characteristics. Thus, a kind of integrated ANN model is
    a better method to overcome these faults for hydrological process simulation over
    a catchment. The integrated ANN model will model flow for every sub-catchment
    and does not require physical characteristic parameters of the catchments. The
    objectives of the present study are (i) to propose an integrated ANN model to
    estimate streamflow; (ii) to perform a case study and compare the performance
    of the integrated ANNs with that of single ANN and of local linear regression
    (LLR) models to estimate monthly streamflow. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study
    area The Shiyang River Basin, one of three continental rivers in the Hexi corridor,
    located in the eastern portion of the corridor in Gansu Province of Northwest
    China was selected as the study area. The basin encompasses an area of 4.16 ×
    104 km2 with a population of 2.2 million and covers the area between 101°41′–104°16′E
    and 36°29′–39°27′N (Fig. 1). The Shiyang River Basin includes three climate zones
    (Kang et al., 2004). The Qilian Mountain in the south of the basin comprises a
    very frigid, semiarid humid area. The middle part of the basin is the Wuwei sub-basin,
    cool and arid. The northern part of the basin, also called the Minqin sub-basin,
    is warmer and more arid. The Shiyang River starts from the north of the Qilian
    Mountains and includes eight tributaries, but only five tributaries (the Zamu,
    Gulang, Huangyang, Jinta, and Xiying) converge as the Shiyang River in the outlet
    of the Qilian Mountains, and then flow into the Hongyashan reservoir in the Minqin
    oasis, the largest desert reservoir in Asia (Fig. 1). Characteristics of five
    catchments in the Shiyang River Basin and proportion of major land use in the
    five catchments of the Shiyang River Basin in 2000 were presented in Tables 1
    and 2, respectively. The five tributaries are mainly fed by rainfall, snowmelt,
    and glacier melt from the Qilian Mountain. In summary, all streamflows have steadily
    decreased, particularly the inflow into the Hongyashan reservoir, as climate changes
    and water-related human activities such as irrigation using river flow have increased
    in recent years. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Study area and the

    space within the Shiyang River Basin, data including monthly total precipitation,
    monthly average maximum air temperature and minimum air temperature, relative
    humidity, sunshine hours, wind speed for the period of 1956–2003 from 15 weather
    stations located within the basin and the surrounding areas were selected. Potential
    evapotranspiration (ET) was calculated using the Penman–Monteith equation recommended
    by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) (Allen et al., 1998). Linear regression
    relationship between monthly precipitation and catchments’ characteristics such
    as elevation, latitude, and longitude was developed. Similar relationships were
    also developed for monthly potential evapotranspiration. A digital elevation model
    (DEM) with grid resolution 100 m × 100 m supplied by Western Eco-environmental
    Data Center of National Natural Science Foundation of China (WEDC-NSFC) was used
    to interpolate monthly precipitation and ET according to elevation, latitude,
    and longitude. Then, average monthly precipitation and ET for every tributary
    and downstream of the basin can be calculated in Geographic Information System
    (GIS) (Ma et al., 2008). Previous researches have showed that average annual precipitation
    varied between 513 and 660 mm during 1950–1975 and decreased to 441 and 557 mm
    during 1975–2005. Average potential evapotranspiration showed an increasing trend
    over the two periods (Ma et al., 2008, Huo et al., 2008). It is clear that these
    changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration would lead to reduction
    in streamflow. Monthly streamflow time series from 1956 to 2003 for five tributaries
    and downstream of the basin was used in this study. The streamflow data for the
    five tributaries are from observation stations at mountain outlets. Flow data
    downstream of Shiyang River were measured at the Caiqi station (Fig. 1). Flows
    for both the tributaries and the Shiyang River exhibit decreasing tendencies.
    The total flow in mountain outlets varied from 12.1 × 108 m3 in 1950s to 9.2 ×
    108 m3 in 1970s and 8.2 × 108 m3 in 1990s. Similarly, observation data show that
    annual streamflow at Caiqi station has decreased from 5.4 × 108 m3 in 1950s to
    3.2 × 108 m3 in 1970s and 1.1 × 108 m3 in 1990s (Fig. 2). In addition, irrigation
    area and irrigation water ratio for unit area was collected to estimate the effect
    of agricultural activities on streamflow. Download : Download full-size image

    models that attempt to exploit the massively parallel local processing and the
    distributed storage properties believed to exist in the human brain. In recent
    decades, the ANN technique, also called parallel distributed processing, has received
    a great deal of attention as a tool of computation by many researchers and scientists.
    There are many kinds of ANNs, and the most common learning rule for ANNs is the
    back propagation algorithm. Back propagation involves two phases, a feed-forward
    phase in which the external input information at the input nodes is propagated
    forward to compute the output information signal at the output unit, and a backward
    phase in which modifications to the connection strengths are made based on the
    differences between the computed and observed information signals at the output
    units (Rumelhart et al., 1986). There are several parameters including numbers
    of hidden layers and hidden nodes, and learning rate for ANN architecture and
    training. Theoretically, the numbers of hidden layers and hidden nodes in a neural
    network can be unlimited. However, as pointed out by Funahashi (1989) and Hornik
    et al. (1989), an ANN with a single hidden layer containing a sufficient number
    of nodes can approximate any functional relationships to any degree of accuracy.
    Therefore, ANNs designed with three layers, including only one hidden layer, are
    usually preferred in practical applications. So, the neural network structure
    in this study possessed a three-layer learning network consisting of an input
    layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. Furthermore, trial-and-error experiments
    can be performed to determine the optimal nodes of hidden layer by starting with
    a few hidden layer nodes and comparing validation error when the number of hidden
    layers and nodes are gradually increased. The procedure of adding hidden nodes
    is repeated and network training is restarted until the validation error is observed
    to bottom out and start increasing. Usually, every input and output of ANN does
    not belong to the same dimension, and all inputs and outputs need to be normalized
    to the same dimension, which mean that all input and output values are within
    the same scope. In this study, the input and output data were normalized in the
    range from 0.1 to 0.9. From the input layer to the hidden layer, the log sigmoid
    function has been commonly used in hydrological ANN models. From the hidden layer
    to the output layer, a linear function was employed as the transfer function as
    other studies. In the present study, the scaled conjugate gradient method (SCGM)
    proposed by Moler (1993) is employed. Learning rate can be adjusted automatically
    according to error of ANN when trained, and effect of initial learning rate on
    ANN training is little. So, this technique is more powerful than the conventional
    gradient descent techniques (Cigizogilu, 2005) and had been used to training ANNs
    for river flow model (Turan and Yurdusev, 2009). The scaled conjugate gradient
    method, an efficient second-order learning algorithm, is somewhat intermediate
    between the steepest descent method and Newton’s method. It accelerates the typically
    slow convergence associated with the steepest descent, while maintaining calculation
    simplicity by avoiding the requirements associated with the evaluation, the storage,
    and the inversion of the Hessian matrix in the Newton’s method (Liu et al., 2005).
    Its advantages are the increased learning speed (since it avoids the line search)
    and the fact that it eliminates the dependence on critical user-selected parameters
    (Learning rate, Momentum Coefficient) (Falas and Stafylopatis, 2005). The detailed
    calculating process of the SCGM can be found in literature Moler (1993). 2.4.
    Local linear regression (LLR) model The local linear regression model is a popular
    nonparametric regression technique that has been widely used in many low-dimensional
    forecasting and smoothing problems (Remesan et al., 2009). Reliable modeling even
    on a small amount of sample data and accurate predictions in regions of high data
    density in the input space are considered as the major advantages of LLR models.
    The LLR procedure requires only three data points to obtain an initial prediction
    and then uses all newly updated data in the order they are available to make further
    predictions. Deciding the size of pmax, (the number of near neighbors to be included
    for the local linear modeling) is the tricky part in LLR modeling. Given a neighborhood
    of pmax points, we must solve a linear matrix equation, (1) where X is a pmax
    × d matrix of the pmax input points in d-dimensions, xi (1 ⩽ i ⩽ pmax) are the
    nearest neighbor points, y is a column vector of length pmax of the corresponding
    outputs, and m is a column vector of parameters that must be determined to provide
    the optimal mapping from X to y. If the matrix X is square and not singular, then
    a unique solution to equation is m = X−1y. If X is not square or singular, we
    should find a vector m that minimizes (2) where the unique solution to this problem
    is provided by m = Xy where X is a pseudo-inverse matrix. 3. Integrated ANN model
    for monthly streamflow 3.1. Schematic diagram of the integration of ANNs In the
    development of the lumped ANN models, the spatial variations of model parameters
    and model inputs are not explicitly considered in the modeling process. However,
    spatial variations in rainfall and catchment heterogeneity are common in nature
    and can be significant factors affecting the overall model performance. Traditionally,
    the river flow for an inland basin can be estimated by combining two ANNs, namely
    lumped ANN (Fig. 3). One ANN is to estimate total streamflow at outlet of mountain
    using weather data upstream of the basin, and another is to estimate the river
    flow downstream of the basin using output of first ANN, weather data, and human
    activity data. In this lumped ANN, precipitation and evaporation for every tributary
    are respectively averaged to one value and as the inputs of first ANN. In other
    words, the heterogeneity and spatial variation of the rainfall, evaporation, and
    land cover are not considered in the lumped ANN. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. Structure of lumped ANN model (LANN). To overcome this deficiency,
    two integrated forms of the ANN models are proposed in this study. These integrated
    forms of ANNs retain the advantages of the semi-distributed models considering
    the heterogeneity and spatial variation of the rainfall in the catchment, while
    taking advantage of the potential of ANNs as an effective tool in nonlinear mapping
    or functional relationship establishment. Flowcharts of the two integrated ANNs
    are illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5. As shown in the figures, similar to the lumped
    ANN, the integrated ANNs contain two parts. The first part is the distributed
    form with several ANNs for sub-catchments, and the second part is a single ANN
    for middle stream. The development of a distributed form of ANNs is intended to
    reflect the spatial variations of rainfall, evapotranspiration, and the heterogeneity
    of the catchment characteristics across the catchment. As indicated in Figs. 4
    and 5, the entire catchment is divided into five sub-catchments based on the characteristics
    of the catchment as illustrated in Fig. 1, and five ANNs were developed to simulate
    streamflow from the five sub-catchments respectively. Download : Download full-size

    are summed as one input of second part). Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    5. Structure of integrated ANN model (IANN2, streamflow from tributaries are respectively
    inputs of second part). There are two methods to develop a single ANN for streamflow
    downstream of the basin. For the first model (IANN1), the outputs of five ANNs
    were added up as the inputs of ANN for flow downstream (Fig. 4). For another (IANN2),
    the outputs of five ANNs for streamflow of tributaries were used respectively
    as the inputs of ANN for streamflow downstream (Fig. 5). Similar to the lumped
    ANN, the inputs of ANN in the second part include weather and water-related human
    activity data besides streamflow from tributaries. 3.2. Training and testing integrated
    ANN model for monthly streamflow An important issue in the ANN modeling is the
    choice of input variables, but there is no general theory yet to solve this issue,
    and it is still a problem. According to the hydrological processes in sub-catchments,
    the five tributaries are mainly fed by rainfall, snowmelt, and glacier melt from
    the Qilian Mountain. Snowmelt and glacier are determined by some meteorological
    factors such as temperature and wind speed. In addition, soil moisture over the
    catchment also affects the rainfall–runoff processes and correlates with evapotranspiration.
    So, input variables used for these monthly streamflow models are the previous
    and current month’s precipitation and evapotranspiration calculated by Peman–Motieth
    equation, and using the current month’s streamflow as the target variable. However,
    in the middle stream of the catchments, the Wuwei Basin, river flows were affected
    by human activities, especially agricultural production activities, besides climate
    conditions. As a result, input variables used for monthly streamflow model are
    current monthly streamflow from tributaries, the previous and current month’s
    precipitation and evaporation, irrigation area, and irrigation ratio of unit area.
    Cross-correlation analysis between the target streamflow Q(t) and different lag
    time series of precipitation and ET data (viz P(t), P(t − 1), P(t − 2), P(t −
    3), P(t − 4), ET(t), ET(t − 1), ET(t − 2), ET(t − 3), ET(t − 4)) was performed
    to obtain the important factors for streamflow estimation. The analysis results
    are shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively, for five tributaries and Caiqi station.
    As observed in Tables 3 and 4, up to a time lag of 2 months, the cross-correlations
    are higher for precipitation and ET information. It indicated that the two hydrological
    factors time series after a time lag of 2 months would not possess any significant
    effect on the target streamflow data, Q(t), as the cross-correlation values are
    close to zero. For the application of the model, rainfall (P(t)) can be obtained
    from public weather forecast information in several stations. Similarly, some
    meteorologic variables such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed can also
    be obtained from weather forecast information. Then, potential evapotranspiration
    (E(t)) can be calculated using P–M equation. Table 3. Cross-correlations of Q(t)

    patterns should be representative of similar physical systems for the development
    of ANN models. For this study, the physical process of streamflow change is typical
    agreement over the period of 1956 to 2003. So, the observed precipitation, ET,
    irrigation data, and streamflow data from 1956 to 1991 were used for training
    ANNs for monthly streamflow, and the recent 12-year data from 1992 to 2003 were
    used for testing the performance of the trained ANN models. Furthermore, scope
    of rainfall, evaporation, and streamflow from testing sample are within the scope
    of training sample. In this study, each member model of the integrated ANN models
    was developed using the same procedure as the single modeling. For example, the
    SCGM algorithm, the log sigmoid, the linear transfer functions, and the early
    stopping method were also employed for the each ANN. The capacity of each ANN
    to estimate monthly streamflow was checked by applying the calibrated or generated
    model to the testing data. Results were compared by means of the Root Mean Square
    Error (RMSE), the mean relative error (MRE), and the coefficient of determination
    (R2). RMSE and MRE provided different types of information about the predictive
    capabilities of the model. The RMSE measured the goodness of fit relevant to high
    streamflow, whereas the RE yielded a more balanced perspective of the goodness
    of fit at moderate groundwater levels. The R2 measures the degree to which two
    variables were linearly related. The RMSE and RE were respectively defined as:
    (3) (4) (5) where m is the number of observations, and Oi and yi are the ith observed
    and predicted data, respectively, (using the ANN procedures). and are the averages
    of the data arrays of yi and Oi. In addition, residual statistic analysis was
    also carried out to indicate error change of ANN model. Hidden nodes of ANNs for
    five tributaries (ANN1, ANN2, ANN3, ANN4, ANN5) and outlet of mountain (IANN-om,
    LANN-om), downstream (LANN, IANN1, IANN2) were optimized by trial-and-error method.
    RMSE, MRE, and R2 were used to assess the precision of ANN with different hidden
    nodes. All of ANNs with hidden nodes from 5 to 20 were trained and tested. As
    demonstrated earlier (Dai et al., 2011), error of ANN decreases with an increase
    in hidden node until the optimized node number was reached. After this node number,
    the error keeps changing slightly for training sample. However, error will rise
    when hidden node is more than the optimized node number. According to this fundamental
    principle, an optimized hidden node can be obtained. 4. Result analysis and discussion
    4.1. Performance of ANNs for five tributaries The optimized hidden node architecture
    and performances of ANNs for streamflows of five tributaries are evaluated using
    the three criteria, RMSE, RE, and R2, presented in Table 5. Results showed that
    there is a consistent trend between observed and simulated monthly streamflow
    from ANN data for five tributaries (Fig. 6). According to the evaluated criteria,
    all ANN models have higher precision with RMSE of 0.08–0.33 × 107 m3, MRE of 13–19%,
    and R2 of 0.89–0.93 for training data and RMSE of 0.18–0.53 × 107 m3, MRE of 18–37%,
    and R2 of 0.88–0.91 for testing data. It was also observed that the higher the
    monthly stream values, the higher the RMSE of the model. For example, RMSE of
    Xiying and Zamu tributaries are 0.33 × 107 m3 and 0.25 × 107 m3, and 0.53 × 107
    m3 and 0.42 × 107 m3, respectively, for training and testing data. RMSE of ANNs
    for other three tributaries is comparably lower than that of Xiying and Zamu tributaries
    both for training and testing data. Residual statistic analysis results are presented
    in Table 6, which showed that there are some variations among ANNs for five tributaries.

    and minimum residual from ANN. Var means the variance of residual from ANN. However,
    MRE of ANN models is higher for tributaries where agricultural activities are
    comparably intensive. For example, MRE of ANN models is 19% and 37%, respectively,
    for training and testing data in Gulang tributary where the planted area makes
    up 35.69% of the total land area. Similarly, RE of ANN models is 17% and 32%,
    respectively, for training and testing data in Huangyang tributary where the planted
    area makes up 25.83% of the total land area. For other three tributaries, agricultural
    activities are comparably few and the proportion of planted area is lower than
    15%. As a result, MRE of ANN models is within the scope of 13–16% and 18–22%,
    which is obviously lower than that of ANN models for Gulang and Huangyang tributaries.
    It can be concluded that agricultural activities affect the hydrological process
    of land surface and that rainfall–runoff becomes complex in these tributaries.
    ANNs are more difficult to model streamflow in catchments where agricultural activities
    are intensive. 4.2. Comparison of integrated ANNs with lumped ANN for streamflow
    at outlet of mountain For assessing the overall performance of integrated ANNs
    to simulate monthly streamflow at outlet of mountain, monthly streamflow of the
    five tributaries estimated by ANNs was summed as the total monthly streamflow
    at outlet of mountain. Fig. 7 presents the time series plot of observed and estimated
    monthly streamflow at outlet of mountain with integrated ANNs. This resulted in
    the overall RMSE value of 0.25 × 107 m3 and 0.36 × 107 m3, respectively, for training
    and testing data. The MRE is 7% and 9%, respectively, for training and testing
    data when compared with observed streamflow. Furthermore, R2 is 0.91 and 0.9,
    respectively, for training and testing data. Compared with that of single ANN
    respectively for the five tributaries, errors of ANN for outlet of mountain are
    significantly lower. The RMSE of integrated ANNs had the same scope with that
    of single ANN for every tributary, and this can be contributed to the offset of
    errors of every single ANN when estimated streamflow of five tributaries was summed
    as the streamflow at outlet of mountain. However, the MRE of the integrated ANNs
    to estimate monthly streamflow at outlet of mountain is markedly lower than that
    of single ANN for every tributary as a notable increase in total streamflow at
    outlet of mountain comparing to streamflow of single tributaries. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 7. Observed and estimated by ANN total monthly streamflow
    at outlet of mountain ((a) lumped ANN; (b) integrated ANNs). At the same time,
    a lumped ANN for monthly streamflow at outlet of the mountain was developed to
    compare its performance with that of integrated ANNs. As pointed in the former
    sections, precipitations and ET of the five sub-catchments were averaged as the
    inputs of the lumped ANN, and the lag of precipitation and evaporation was two
    months. The output of the lumped ANN was total monthly streamflow of the five
    tributaries. The same technology was used to develop a single ANN, and the training
    and testing data were consistent with those of integrated ANNs. The time series
    of observed and estimated monthly streamflow at outlet of mountain with lumped
    ANN is presented in Fig. 7. The difference between observed and estimated values
    is evident when streamflow values are relatively high. The optimized hidden node
    architecture and error statistics for the two ANN models (integrated ANN and lumped
    ANN) are listed in Table 7. It can be observed that errors of the lumped ANN are
    obviously higher than those of the integrated ANNs to estimate monthly streamflow
    at outlet of mountain. The RMSE of the lumped ANN is 1.64 × 107 m3 and 2.43 ×
    107 m3, respectively, for training and testing data and increases by about five
    times when compared with that of the integrated ANNs. Similarly, the MRE and R2
    of the lumped ANN are 42% and 52%, and 0.79 and 0.75, respectively, for training
    and testing data and increase remarkably when compared with those of the integrated
    ANNs. Table 7. Error statistics of integrated ANNs and lumped ANN for total streamflow

    in precision of the two models that estimate streamflow at outlet of mountain
    can be explained by the structure of the models. The integrated ANNs include several
    single ANNs for tributaries and consider the spatial variation of precipitation
    and ET. In other words, the integrated ANNs are similar to semi-distributed models,
    which represents the change in parameters affecting hydrological processes. However,
    the lumped ANN assumed that the rainfall and ET are uniformly distributed over
    the catchments and can be understood as a lumped nonlinear ‘total-response’ model.
    As a result, precision of the integrated ANNs is significantly higher than the
    lumped ANN. 4.3. Comparison of integrated ANNs with lumped ANN for monthly streamflow
    downstream Two integrated ANNs (IANN1 and IANN2) and one lumped ANN (LANN) were
    used to estimate monthly streamflow at Caiqi station located downstream of the
    study area, and the time series of observed and estimated monthly streamflow is
    presented in Fig. 8. It is obvious that the results of IANN1 and IANN2 models
    are better than that of LANN because the former estimates the streamflow at outlet
    of mountain using semi-distributed method while the latter estimates using lumped
    method. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Observed and estimated by
    ANN monthly streamflow downstream ((a) IANN1; (b) IANN2; (c) LANN). The optimized
    hidden node architecture errors of the three combined ANN models for monthly streamflow
    downstream are listed in Table 8, and the results indicate that IANN1 and IANN2
    perform significantly better than LANN. For training data, two IANN models have
    the same precision with RMSE of 0.28–0.29 × 107 m3, MRE of 13%, and R2 of 0.91–0.92.
    However, the LANN obviously has higher error with RMSE of 0.58 × 107m3, MRE of
    27%, and R2 of 0.78 for training data. Similarly, errors of two IANN models are
    lower with RMSE of 0.35–0.38 × 107 m3, MRE of 22–27%, and R2 of 0.88–0.90 for
    testing data, but RMSE, MRE, and R2 of LANN increased respectively to 0.71 × 107
    m3, 46%, and 0.7 for testing data. Overall, the LANN has about twice the error
    than IANN to estimate monthly streamflow downstream. In fact, the differences
    between the two kinds of combining ANN models to estimate streamflow downstream
    are from their different precision to estimate streamflow at outlet of mountain.

    0.78 0.71 44 0.7 As for the two IANN models, IANN1 has higher precision than IANN2
    and this can be explained with structure of ANN. There are seven inputs for IANN1
    and 11 inputs for IANN2 that are relatively complex. For ANN, the increase in
    input factors can make ANN more complex and the parameters (weights and thresholds)
    further increase. It is difficult to train a more complex ANN, especially when
    excess input factors do not include further useful information to output. In this
    study, streamflow from five tributaries at outlet of mountain was summed as an
    input of ANN in IANN1, but they were respectively different in IANN2. In fact,
    inputs of IANN1 contain the information of inputs of IANN2. As a result, IANN2
    can be overtrained and its ability had been declined. Furthermore, another ANN
    model for monthly streamflow downstream was developed to test the capability of
    different ANN models to simulate streamflow of arid inland area. In this ANN,
    P and ET in every tributary were directly arranged as inputs. It is noticeable
    that the precision of the model is lower than the two IANN models, and the RMSE,
    MRE, and R2 are respectively 0.60 × 107 m3, 30%, and 0.77 for testing sample.
    This error is almost equivalent to that of LANN. This can be attributed to change
    cause of streamflow in upper reach of basin is different than in down reach in
    arid region. Again, usually there are hydrological stations in every outlet of
    tributary, and ANNs for river flow at outlet of mountain and down reach can be
    easily developed and used. 4.4. Comparison of ANN models with LLR models for monthly
    streamflow Several LLR models were developed to further assess the performance
    of ANNs to estimate monthly streamflow. The hydrological data used to develop
    LLRs are same as those of ANNs. For the LLRs downstream of the basin, estimated
    monthly streamflow by a lumped LLR model was arranged as inputs. The observed
    and estimated scatter plots of using LLR and ANN monthly streamflow for the five
    tributaries are shown in Fig. 9. Similarly, the observed and estimated scatter
    plots of using monthly streamflow data obtained from both the methods at outlet
    of mountain and Caiqi station downstream are presented in Figs. 10 and 11, respectively.
    The performance of LLRs in terms of the two model evaluation criteria, namely
    RMSE and RE, are presented in Table 9. Download : Download full-size image Fig.

    50 0.71 2.62 61 0.63 Caiqi 0.64 30 0.77 0.85 56 0.65 Results imply that errors
    of LLRs to estimate monthly streamflow of five tributaries, outlet of mountain,
    and downstream of the basin are higher than corresponding ANNs. For the five tributaries,
    LLRs have errors with RMSE of 0.14–0.47 × 107 m3, MRE of 19–33%, R2 of 0.78–0.83,
    and RMSE of 0.32–0.64 × 107 m3, MRE of 27–57%, and R2 of 0.66–0.77, respectively,
    for training and testing data. Overall, the errors of LLRs are significantly higher
    than those of ANNs and especially at the period in which the streamflow values
    are low (Fig. 9). For the total monthly streamflow of an outlet of mountain, the
    LLR has errors with RMSE of 1.91 × 107 m3, MRE of 50%, and R2 of 0.71 in training
    period and RMSE of 2.62 × 107 m3, MRE of 61% and R2 of 0.63 in testing period.
    Although error of the LLR is near to that of the lumped ANN, it is obviously higher
    than that of the integrated ANNs with RMSE of 0.36 × 107 m3 and RE of 61%. Also,
    it can be observed from Fig. 10 that the observed and estimated scatter plot of
    using the integrated ANN is near to 1:1 line very much, but the plots for the
    LLR and the lumped ANN are dispersive. Similarly, integrated ANNs performed remarkably
    well in both training and testing data than LLR downstream (Fig. 11). According
    to the two evaluation criteria, LLR have errors with RMSE of 0.64 × 107 m3, MRE
    of 30%, and R2 of 0.77 for training data, and RMSE of 0.85 × 107 m3, MRE of 56%,
    and R2 of 0.65 for testing data, which are more than twice than that of integrated
    ANNs. As pointed out in former sections, hydrological process is a complex and
    nonlinear system, and LLRs do not have enough ability to capture the relationship
    between runoff and rainfall, evaporation, etc. However, ANN can statistically
    simulate the hydrological process as its nonlinear feature. Especially in this
    study, the integrated ANNs considered variations in rainfall and evaporation among
    the five sub-catchments and can simulate total monthly streamflow at outlet of
    mountain well than lumped ANN and LLR. Downstream of the basin, a number of agricultural
    activities impact the hydrological process and change the streamflow. Although
    the streamflow estimate is more difficult to obtain using LLRs, integrated ANNs
    have higher precision to estimate monthly streamflow downstream of the basin.
    5. Conclusions The new approach of integration of Artificial Neural Networks (integrated
    ANN model) for streamflow estimation has been developed and used in an arid inland
    basin. The integrated ANN model has shown great potential in streamflow modeling
    when compared with traditional models. By developing the semi-distributed form
    of ANNs to explore the spatial variation in hydrological process, such as rainfall
    distribution and evaporation distribution, streamflow generated from individual
    sub-catchments can be summed as the streamflow at the outlet of mountain. Furthermore,
    river flow estimation downstream of the basin can be improved by the application
    of the semi-distributed form of ANNs upstream. The integrated ANN models in this
    study retain the advantages of the semi-distributed models considering the heterogeneity
    and spatial variation of hydrological factors and physical characteristics in
    the catchment, while taking advantage of the potential of ANNs as an effective
    tool in nonlinear mapping or functional relationship establishment. As demonstrated
    in this study, the integrated form of ANNs offer the most promising results compared
    to single ANN and LLR models. However, it need be pointed out that use of the
    integrated ANNs is limited in some regions where long-term hydrological and meteorological
    data are lacking. Moreover, because of the limitation of soil and other parameters,
    the distribution physics model has not been further used to assess the ability
    of integrated ANNs and this will be performed in future study. Acknowledgements

    science, showing the potential of this tool for hydrological modelling, especially
    rainfall-runoff transformation for daily, weekly and monthly time intervals (Aichouri

    Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) continues to grow exponentially, in number
    of devices and the amount of data they generate. Processing this data requires
    an exponential increase in computing power. For example, aggregation can be done
    directly at the edge. However, aggregation is very limited; ideally we would like
    to do more general computations at the edge. In this paper we propose a framework
    for doing general-purpose edge computing directly on sensor networks themselves,
    without requiring external connections to gateways or cloud. This is challenging
    because sensor networks have unreliable communication, unreliable nodes, and limited
    (if any) computing power and storage. How can we implement production-quality
    components directly on these networks? We need to bridge the gap between the unreliable,
    limited infrastructure and the stringent requirements of the components. To solve
    this problem we present Achlys, an edge computing framework that provides reliable
    storage, computation, and communication capabilities directly on wireless networks
    of IoT sensor nodes. Using Achlys, the sensor network is able to configure and
    manage itself directly, without external connectivity. Achlys combines the Lasp
    key/value store and the Partisan communication library. Lasp provides efficient
    decentralized storage based on the properties of CRDTs (Conftict-Free Replicated
    Data Types). Partisan provides efficient connectivity and broadcast based on hybrid
    gossip. Both Lasp and Partisan are specifically designed to be extremely resilient.
    They are able to continue working despite high node churn, frequent network partitions,
    and unreliable communication. Our first implementation of Achlys is on a network
    of GRiSP embedded system boards. We choose GRiSP as our first implementation platform
    because it implements high-level functionality, namely Erlang, directly on the
    bare hardware and because it directly supports Pmod sensors and wireless connectivity.

    Kyoto, Japan I. Introduction The edge computing paradigm has been widely accepted
    as an important concept for sustainability of future Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)
    and Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) [1], [2]. It is well acknowledged by both
    enterprise and academia as a valid approach and is actively under research [3]–[5].
    Newer and more performant infrastructures are continuously elaborated both by
    CSPs and MNOs [6]. Concurrently, IoT devices are getting closer to being actually
    ubiquitous, i.e., closer to Mark Weiser''s idea of hundreds of wireless computing
    devices per person. This is already true in some scenarios, e.g., airplanes generate
    around 10 TB of data every 30 minutes. Such cases require very responsive and
    robust systems for sensor data processing, and could not rely on remote hosts
    for it, even if these are close to the edge. Since the Internet of Things is rapidly
    expanding and devices are becoming more powerful, IoT applications are putting
    severe strain on cloud providers. The edge computing paradigm is one way to solve
    this problem by distributing the workload in a more sustainable way across the
    whole network. With this paradigm, computational and storage resources move closer
    to the edge and IoT applications are able to preserve their QoS. Tasks that were
    previously done in the cloud are now be delegated to intermediates between datacenters
    and IoT edge networks. Existing designs are enabling this by bridging edge networks
    with intermediate gateways[7]. However, it is generally considered that the sensor
    and actuator networks themselves, such as traditional Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSNs), are too limited and unreliable to do their own management. Thus even in
    recent distributed sensor and IoT networks, a gateway node or a cloud connection
    is necessary, which adds a single point of failure and increases infrastructure
    complexity. If such a point is unable to provide its service, network management
    becomes impossible and sensor data cannot be retrieved anymore. And if gateways
    need to be permanently available, even short intervals of downtime can disrupt
    the entire system. A recent survey has portrayed the full landscape of emerging
    paradigms that strive towards the edge and fog principles[8]. It describes a few
    designs that share common goals with Achlys, such as mist computing and suggests
    that such architectures are a best fit for systems that require autonomous behavior,
    ability for distributed processing directly on IoT devices, little or no Internet
    connectivity and privacy preservation. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures

    Reprints & Permissions View PDF Abstract Water resources in the Santa Basin in
    the Peruvian Andes are increasingly under pressure from climate change and population
    increase. Impacts of temperature-driven glacier retreat on streamflow are better
    studied than those of precipitation changes, yet present and future water resources
    are mostly dependent on precipitation, which is more difficult to predict with
    climate models. This study combines a broad range of projections from climate
    models with a hydrological model (WaterWorld), showing a general trend towards
    an increase in water availability due to precipitation increases over the basin.
    However, high uncertainties in these projections necessitate basin-wide policies
    aimed at increased adaptability. Keywords: Water resourcesclimate changeWaterWorldtropical

    Introduction Water resources in many regions of the world are increasingly under
    pressure from climate change, with precipitation changes affecting water availability
    and runoff directly, and temperature, radiation and humidity impacting evapotranspiration
    (Solomon, 2007) and snow and ice dynamics. In the Peruvian Andes, climate change
    pressure on water resources is considered to be exacerbated by the retreat of
    glaciers that act as seasonal water stores, providing freshwater during the dry
    season (Vuille et al., 2008). More than 99% of all tropical glaciers are in the
    Andes (Kaser & Georges, 1999), of which nearly 70% are in Peru (Vuille et al.,
    2008). Most water resources on the Pacific slopes of Peru originate from snow
    and ice in the Andes, according to Vuille et al. ( 2008). Pressures of climate
    change and glacier retreat are particularly pertinent for Peru’s Rio Santa basin,
    where growing water demand has resulted from increases in human population, export
    agriculture, mining and hydropower production, leading to increased competition
    for water (Lynch, 2012). This competition and developing strategies for better
    sharing the benefits of available water were the focus of the CGIAR Challenge
    Programme on Water and Food Project AN3 (COMPANDES), under which the research
    for this article was carried out (CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land & Environment,
    2014). Most studies on the impacts of climate change on water resources in the
    Peruvian Andes focus on glacier retreat and associated impacts on streamflow.
    For example, Pouyaud et al. ( 2005), using an increase in temperature of 0.1 °C/decade,
    projected increases in streamflow for the next 20–50 years under melting glacier
    conditions in the Llanganuco River basin, after which streamflow will become rain-
    and snowmelt-dominated. Juen ( 2007) obtained similar results using a more sophisticated
    tropical-glacier-hydrology model driven by four IPCC AR4 (Fourth Assessment Report;
    Solomon, 2007) emission scenarios, which resulted in less dry-season runoff because
    of diminishing glacier size but more wet-season runoff due to more direct runoff
    from more rainfall. Generally, these studies show that overall discharge may not
    change very much, but there are significant changes in seasonality under climate
    change due to the loss of water stored and released seasonally by glaciers. There
    are however significant differences between the various climate change projections,
    which lead to large differences in glacier discharge between scenarios (Vuille,
    2008), and these are a key uncertainty associated with assessing the impacts of
    climate change on water resources, particularly in the Peruvian Andes. These uncertainties
    derive from a number of sources associated with the general circulation models
    (GCMs), most importantly the emission scenario but also difficult-to-model mechanisms
    such as rainfall and cloud behaviour and sub-grid heterogeneity associated with
    simplified representation of topography. This can result in different GCMs producing
    very different projections. Even more uncertainty is introduced when combining
    these GCMs with hydrological models, as the GCM outputs will need to be downscaled.
    Due to the typically coarse resolution of GCMs, natural gradients in precipitation
    and temperature are smoothed out, and this is particularly problematic in mountainous
    regions, as their hydrology is characterized by strong elevational gradients (Buytaert,
    Vuille, Dewulf, Urrutia, & Karmalkar, 2010; Wilby et al., 2004). This article
    aims to evaluate the potential outcomes of climate change on the water resources
    of the Santa Basin by combining a range of statistically downscaled climate models
    using scenarios from the IPCC AR4 with a physically based spatial hydrological
    model (WaterWorld, Mulligan, 2013a) which is capable of simulating snowfall and
    snowmelt dynamics (WaterWorld version 2, Mulligan, 2013b). This allows the assessment
    of some of the uncertainty in future discharge projections and water resource
    availability in the basin, and especially the relative roles of changes in different
    fluxes (particularly rainfall, snowfall and meltwater) on water resources at different
    scales. Study area Study location and topography The Rio Santa basin is in Peru,
    in the Ancash Region, about 400 km north of the capital, Lima (Figure 1). The
    basin has a total drainage area of around 12,200 km2 and a total length of 316
    km, which makes it the second-largest river and the most regular flowing Peruvian
    river to flow into the Pacific ocean (Mark, 2010). The river originates at Lake
    Conococha at an altitude of 4080 m and then runs north through the Callejón de
    Huaylas Valley, which is between the Cordilleras Blanca and Negra. It then turns
    west at the confluence with the Rio Manta towards the city of Chimbote, at the
    Pacific coast (McKinney, Anderson, & Byers, 2011). The Cordillera Blanca towards
    the east of the Rio Santa has about one-quarter of all tropical glaciers (more
    than 600 km2) and over 30 peaks that are higher than 6000 m above sea level (Kaser,
    Juen, Georges, Gómez, & Tamayo, 2003; Vuille et al., 2008). Of the 23 tributary
    streams of the Rio Santa, 20 originate from the glaciers of the Cordillerra Blanca,
    making glacier melt an important contributor to the Rio Santa discharge, particularly
    in the dry season (McKinney, 2011). Conservative estimates of this contribution
    by Mark, McKenzie, and Gomez ( 2005) indicate that about two-thirds of the dry-season
    flow of the Rio Santa in the Huaylas Valley originates in the Cordillera Blanca,
    with 40% of the total flow in the dry season coming from glacier melt. Annual
    and wet-season contributions were not assessed in this study. Figure 1. Rio Santa
    Basin in Peru with main rivers and location of two largest high altitude cities
    Caraz and Huaraz. Display full size Current and recent climate Temperature in
    the area is dominated by the Intertropical Convergence Zone and trade winds, leading
    to only small variations in annual air temperature seasonally (Mark et al., 2005).
    Mean annual temperature in the basin, based on WorldClim data (Hijmans, Cameron,
    Parra, Jones, & Jarvis, 2005), is 9.6 °C, with a mean monthly minimum of 8.2 °C
    in August and a mean monthly maximum of 10.9 °C in March. More than 80% of precipitation
    falls in the wet season, between October and May, when the Intertropical Convergence
    Zone is in the region (Mark, 2010; Mark et al., 2005). The Cordillera Blanca acts
    as a barrier between the humid Amazon and the extremely dry coastal region, with
    the Amazonian side being up to three times wetter than the Pacific side (Racoviteanu,
    Arnaud, Williams, & Ordoñez, 2008). Average precipitation for the basin amounts
    to 548 mm a year, according to WorldClim data. However, this is extremely spatially
    variable, with the highest precipitation found along the Cordillera Blanca and
    the lowest in the dry coastal region. Recent and projected climate changes A temperature
    increase of around 0.35–0.39 °C per decade has been found in central Peru between
    1951 and 1999 based on 29 temperature stations (Mark et al., 2005), while Vuille
    et al. ( 2008), using 279 temperature stations, found a 0.10 °C increase per decade
    between 1939 and 2006 for the tropical Andes between 1° N and 23° S, leading to
    an overall temperature increase of nearly 0.7 °C since 1939. No clear trends in
    precipitation have been found, partly as a result of the lack of long-period,
    high-quality precipitation records. Vuille, Bradley, Werner, and Keimig ( 2003)
    analyzed 42 precipitation stations in the region and found only 5 with a significant
    increase and 2 with a significant decrease in annual precipitation. There was
    no clear dependence on elevation. Some other studies have found clear precipitation
    increases, mostly on the Eastern slopes of the Andes (Vuille et al., 2003). Projected
    changes in climate for the region under the IPCC AR4 emission scenarios point
    to a warming of 3–3.5 °C for 2041–2071 as well as a consistent pattern of increasing
    precipitation, up to 10%. However, for the precipitation projections, there is
    relatively low agreement between climate models (Met Office, 2011). Water resources
    and land use The basin can roughly be divided into three zones based on elevation:
    the high mountains, above 2000 metres; the Callejón de Huaylas Valley, between
    1000 and 2000 metres; and the coastal region, below 1000 metres. The highland
    areas mostly support subsistence farming and grazing. Land use in the Callejón
    de Huaylas Valley mostly consists of small irrigated farming, and the coastal
    region is dominated by large commercial irrigated agriculture in the Chavimochic
    and Chinecas project areas. Furthermore, the coastal cities of Chimbote and Trujillo
    further north are dependent on water from the Rio Santa for their drinking water
    supplies. Methods To assess the implications and uncertainties of climate change
    for water supply in the Santa Basin the WaterWorld hydrological model (Mulligan,
    2013a) was used, with a total of six multi-model ensemble climate change scenarios,
    in order to capture the widest range of possible futures. Changes in meltwater
    contribution, total streamflow and meltwater-generated streamflow were analyzed
    at the basin level and for two of the largest, most populous, high-altitude cities
    in the basin: Caraz, with a population of ca. 13,000; and Huaraz, with a population
    of ca. 96,000. The WaterWorld hydrological model WaterWorld is a fully distributed,
    process-based hydrological model that utilizes remotely sensed and globally available
    data-sets to support hydrological analysis and decision making at national and
    local scales globally, with a particular focus on ungauged and/or data-poor environments,
    which makes it well suited to this study. The model (version 2) currently runs
    on either 10° tiles, large river basins or countries at 1 km2 resolution or 1°
    tiles at 1 ha resolution utilizing different data-sets. It simulates a hydrological
    baseline as a mean for the period 1950–2000 and can be used to calculate the hydrological
    impact of scenarios of climate change, land use change, land management options,
    impacts of extractives (oil and gas and mining) and impacts of changes in population
    and demography as well as combinations of these. The model is “self parameterising”
    (Mulligan, 2013a) in the sense that all data required for model application anywhere
    in the world are provided with the model, removing a key barrier to model application.
    However, if users have better data than those provided, it is possible to upload
    these to WaterWorld as GIS files and use them instead. Results can be viewed visually
    in the web browser or downloaded as GIS maps. The model’s equations and processes
    are described in more detail by Mulligan and Burke ( 2005) and Mulligan ( 2013b).
    The model’s parameters are not routinely calibrated to observed flows, as it is
    designed for hydrological scenario analysis, in which the physical basis of the
    parameters must be retained, and the model is also often used in ungauged basins.
    Calibration is inappropriate under these circumstances (Sivapalan, Blöschl, Zhang,
    & Vertessy, 2003). The freely available nature of the model means that anyone
    can apply it and replicate the results shown here. Snow and ice model A number
    of studies have modelled water resources under future climate scenarios in the
    tropical Andes using various approaches and models for capturing snow and ice
    responses. For instance, Chevallier, Pouyaud, Suarez, and Condom ( 2011) used
    a simple temperature–discharge correlation approach to project future discharges
    given temperature increases. Condom et al. ( 2012) extended the Water Evaluation
    and Planning (WEAP; Yates, Sieber, Purkey, & Huber-Lee, 2005) model with a glacier
    module based on a degree-day model approach, while Andres, Vegas Galdos, Lavado
    Casimiro, and Zappa ( 2014) used a semi-distributed hydrological model (PREVAH;
    Viviroli, Zappa, Gurtz, & Weingartner, 2009). While the latter type of model provides
    good results, such models are calibrated to current conditions and require large
    amounts of (daily) input data, which are generally lacking in this region and
    for the future (Huggel et al., 2015). In WaterWorld, the snow and ice dynamics
    are resolved in a fully distributed, integrated approach without the need for
    additional parameterization data and applicable at the wider basin scale. WaterWorld’s
    (version 2) snow and ice module is capable of simulating the processes of meltwater
    production, snowfall and snowpack, making this version well suited to the current
    application. The model component is based on a full energy balance for snow accumulation
    and melting based on Walter et al. ( 2005), with input data provided globally
    by the SimTerra database (Mulligan, 2011), upon which the model relies. In particular,
    initial monthly snow cover is based on Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
    (MODIS) snow-cover data processed by Mulligan ( 2006), and precipitation where
    ground-level temperature is below 0 °C is assumed to fall as snow. Changes in
    meltwater production and snowpack as a result of climate change are based on changes
    in seasonal and spatial patterns of temperature and precipitation for scenario
    conditions. Higher temperatures lead to less precipitation falling as snow and
    to more snow and ice melt, while more precipitation can lead to more snowfall.
    Both snow melt and glacier melt are governed by temperature, with temperatures
    above 0 °C leading to melting conditions. This means that on days with temperatures
    above 0 °C and no snowpack available, glacier melt will occur. WaterWorld takes
    into account diurnal temperature ranges by iterating through four diurnal time-steps
    that represent the mean diurnal cycle for each of the 12 monthly time-steps represented
    by the 50-year climatology. Glaciers are represented by the World Glacier Inventory
    of the World Glacier Monitoring Service and National Snow and Ice Data Center
    (NSIDC, 1989/2012), whose water equivalents are added to the initial snowpack
    water equivalent in the model. Changes in glacier extent under scenario conditions
    are accounted for by allowing the model to spin up. The database identifies some
    390 km2 of glacier within the Santa Basin (2.8% of the surface area), with a mean
    water equivalent of 0.9 mm, but ranging up to 146 mm on a 1 km grid cell basis.
    Model validation In order to test model performance in the basin, simulated streamflow
    was compared with observed flow. Data for observed streamflow were obtained through
    the COMPANDES project, with original data supplied by the Peruvian Institute of
    Natural Resources (INRENA), with data available for 16 sub-catchments for measurement
    periods ranging from 9 to 57 years. Two input precipitation data-sets were used
    in the validation, the WaterWorld default WorldClim data (Hijmans et al., 2005),
    based on 15 precipitation stations in and around the basin for observation periods
    of up to 50 years, and a TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) monthly precipitation
    climatology, based on the TRMM 2B31 data-set for the years 1997–2006 developed
    by Mulligan ( 2006). According to Condom et al. ( 2012), there are 39 precipitation
    stations in the Santa watershed, which is more than are included in the WorldClim
    data-set; hence this underrepresentation of stations may account for uncertainty
    in the precipitation input data. However, Ward, Buytaert, Peaver, and Wheater
    ( 2011) showed that observational climatology data products such as the CRU CL
    2.0 and WorldClim data-sets compare well with Thiessen-interpolated averages of
    observed data for long-term mean annual precipitation in two Andean basins, mainly
    due to these products being generated from very similar observed data-sets; differences
    may be attributed to availability of precipitation data and averaging time period.
    Table 1 shows the results of the streamflow validation for both precipitation
    climatologies for all available observed streamflow stations and for stations
    that have an average flow of at least 5 m3/s (eight stations). Modelled annual
    streamflow shows a good fit to observed data for all stations (R2 = 0.84), but
    particularly for the stations with higher flow rate (R2 = 0.99), using WorldClim
    precipitation. Validation results for TRMM climatology show a slightly weaker
    fit, probably due to underestimation of precipitation in TRMM data. This underestimation
    of TRMM precipitation has also been shown by Ward, Buytaert, Peaver, and Wheater
    ( 2011) and Lavado Casimiro et al. ( 2009) for a number of basins in the Andes
    and Andes-Amazon. Table 1. WaterWorld streamflow (Q) validation for WorldClim
    and TRMM rainfall climatologies. Download CSVDisplay Table Climate change scenarios
    In order to better understand the high uncertainties in projections of climate
    change, the full available range of GCMs from IPCC AR4, downscaled to 1 km spatial
    resolution by the Research Program on Climate Change Agriculture and Food Security
    of the CGIAR (Ramirez and Jarvis, 2010) using the delta method for the 2050s,
    is used in this study. Two AR4 emissions scenarios were used: the SRES A2A scenario,
    representing high growth and a global 3.5 °C warming (relative to 1900) by 2100;
    and the SRES A1B scenario, a more balanced scenario representing moderate growth
    and a global 2.5 °C warming by 2100 (Nakicenovic et al., 2000). Individual monthly
    downscaled GCM output (Ramirez & Jarvis, 2010) for temperature and precipitation
    were combined by WaterWorld into multi-model ensemble per-pixel mean scenarios
    using 17 available GCMs for the A2A scenario and 24 GCMs for the A1B scenario
    (see Appendix Table A1, in the supplemental online material at http://dx.doi//10.1080/07900627.2016.1259101,
    for more details on the GCMs used). Using ensembles of GCMs is advocated as a
    way to obtain reliable information on the range of possible regional changes and
    associated uncertainties (Murphy et al., 2004; Solomon, 2007). More recent downscaled
    GCM data is currently available (e.g. Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase
    5, CMIP5) using the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios (van
    Vuuren et al., 2011). At the time of analysis these were not yet incorporated
    in the WaterWorld model, but analysis of mean monthly precipitation and temperature
    changes for 17 GCMs under the RCP 4.5 scenario for the basin for 2050 resulted
    in similar directions of change and model disagreement as for the A2A and A1B
    scenarios. Figure 2 shows the range of monthly GCM projections for the Santa Basin
    for precipitation and temperature for both A2A and A1B emission scenarios. Clearly,
    between-model differences are significant, particularly for precipitation, which
    differs between GCMs in the direction of projected change (i.e. positive or negative
    relative to baseline) as well as the magnitude of change for nearly all months.
    To capture this wide range of possible futures, as well as the multi-model mean
    for A2A and A1B, the multi-model mean plus and minus the inter-model standard
    deviation (SD) for both temperature and precipitation were also used as scenarios
    to drive the WaterWorld model, resulting in a total of six ensemble scenarios
    (mean, mean – 1 SD, and mean + 1 SD for two emissions scenarios). Mean – 1 SD
    can be considered the cool, dry end of projections, whilst mean + 1 SD is the
    warm, wet end of projections. Figure 2. a-d: between scenario variability for

    changes Table 2 shows the annual contributions of the different fluxes to projected
    change in water balance derived from WaterWorld as averages for the Rio Santa
    basin for the six multi-model climate change scenario-ensemble metric combinations
    as well as the proportion of the basin that contributes to that direction of change
    (a metric calculated by WaterWorld to better understand spatial variability when
    examining basin mean changes). The mean and mean + 1 SD scenarios result in increases
    in water balance, in all cases because change is dominated by increases in rainfall
    (Figures 2a and 2b). Temperature-driven change in actual evapotranspiration (ET)
    increases for all scenarios, but in all cases this is only a marginal increase
    compared to increases in rainfall (change in ET is 5–6% of the change in rainfall
    for the mean of all GCM scenarios). Table 2. Contribution of annual change in
    different fluxes to the change in mean basin wide water balance and overall outcome
    of the ensemble mean (% values relative to baseline). Download CSVDisplay Table
    Changes in annual total fog inputs are only significant in the A2A + 1 SD scenario
    as a result of changes in lifting condensation level due to higher temperatures,
    which results in more fog capture on exposed ridges in the band between the former
    and new maximum lifting condensation levels, while less fog interception occurs
    at lower elevations as a result of a higher cloud base level. Annual total snow
    and ice melt decreases for all scenarios as a result of precipitation falling
    as rain instead of snow due to higher temperatures, and this is reflected in the
    observed decrease in the snowfall model output. Therefore, in all scenarios except
    A1B – 1 SD, the water balance becomes more rainfall-dominated (with less influence
    of snowmelt). Under baseline conditions, around 60% of the water balance derives
    from rainfall, which increases to 70–75% for the mean of all models and mean +
    1SD scenarios. It should be noted that meltwater production in the model combines
    melt from new snowfall as well as glacial and snowpack melt. The contribution
    of glacial melt is not output as a separate variable. Declines in meltwater production
    are mostly attributable to reductions in snowfall. This means that reductions
    in snowmelt are as much a function of changes in precipitation as they are of
    changes in temperature in the short term, until an equilibrium with the new temperature
    has been established. Given the uncertainties in precipitation projections by
    GCMs for this and any other high mountain area (Buytaert et al., 2010; Ramirez
    & Jarvis, 2010), the resulting impacts on changes in meltwater are also highly
    uncertain. Seasonal changes The results in Table 2 describe the annual impacts
    of climate change on the water balance, but since the supply of water resources
    in this region is highly seasonal, it is necessary to assess changes in seasonality
    of the various fluxes. Under baseline conditions the hydrology in the basin is
    governed by highly seasonal precipitation, with 80% of rain falling in the wet
    season (October–April), meaning that stores such as glaciers are required to sustain
    streamflow in the dry season. However, changes in precipitation under climate
    change could either increase or reduce this seasonality. To assess shifts in seasonality
    for the Rio Santa basin for all water balance fluxes, the seasonality index of
    Walsh and Lawler ( 1981), modified to handle negative values (by offsetting by
    the minimum so that all negatives become positive), was calculated using WaterWorld
    for the baseline and for the climate change scenarios for comparison. An index
    over 0.4 is considered seasonal, over 0.8 marked seasonal with a long dry season,
    and over 1.2 extreme seasonal, with almost all water available in one or two months.
    Table 3 shows the basin-average index values as well as the direction of change
    from the baseline, indicated by up and down arrows. Changes in water balance seasonality
    are minor at the basin scale, with three scenarios showing an increase and three
    scenarios showing a decrease, although none of the values are considered highly
    seasonal. In general, small increases in water balance seasonality can be found
    in the uplands and small decreases at lower elevations. Rainfall seasonality,
    however, is already seasonal under the baseline, and this seasonality is projected
    to decrease at the basin scale for the multi-GCM mean scenarios as well as the
    multi-GCM mean + 1 SD scenarios. This effectively means that the increase in basin
    average precipitation seen in Table 2 and Figure 3a is more evenly distributed
    throughout the year than current precipitation. Table 3. Seasonality statistics

    represent the range between the upper (+SD) and lower (-SD) scenarios for basin
    runoff. Display full size Snowfall and meltwater are extremely seasonal but are
    projected to become more so under all climate change scenarios, since snowfall
    and snowmelt occur over a shorter time period, with significant melt on average
    occurring in only two to three months, compared to six in the baseline. However,
    their impact on catchment average water balance is low, so their impact on catchment
    average water balance seasonality is also low. Figures 3c and 3d show the impacts
    of the changing water balance fluxes on runoff at the outlet of the basin for
    the A1B and A2A mean scenarios, respectively, with the mean + 1 SD and mean –
    1 SD scenarios representing the boundaries of the potential range of runoff under
    these scenarios. Figures 3a and 3b show the variability of (a) precipitation and
    (b) temperature projections for all scenarios. Both A1B and A2A mean scenarios
    result in more runoff from the basin for nearly all months, with A1B showing more
    uncertainty in the wet season while the A2A scenarios have a wider range in the
    dry season. The majority of the range of projections for both A1B and A2A scenario
    sets show a tendency towards increased runoff in the dry season as a result of
    increased precipitation in those months. Implications for water resources So far
    all results have been presented as basin-wide averages. However, water resource
    availability varies significantly throughout the basin, as does demand. To assess
    the implications of climate change for water supply, including changes in meltwater
    contribution, total streamflow and meltwater-generated streamflow, two of the
    largest, most populous high-altitude cities in the basin were identified: Caraz
    (population of ca. 13,000) and Huaraz (population of ca. 96,000). For these locations,
    runoff and contributions to it for the baseline and for the climate change scenarios
    were analyzed (see Figure 1 for locations). Furthermore, to assess the impact
    of changes in meltwater contribution to basin outflow, modelled streamflow and
    meltwater contribution near the outflow of the Santa River into the Pacific was
    analyzed. Table 4 shows the annual total streamflow, meltwater-generated streamflow
    and the proportion of total streamflow derived from meltwater for these areas.
    The contribution of meltwater to total streamflow diminishes for all scenarios,
    but overall streamflow volume is projected to increase for all mean and mean +
    1 SD scenarios. Under baseline conditions, the proportion of snow and ice melt
    in the streamflow at Huaraz and Caraz is more than 10%, while for all climate
    change scenarios this decreases to below 10% for the A2A scenarios (2.7% and 6.5%
    for Huaraz and Caraz, respectively, for the mean of all models scenario) and well
    below 10% for the A1B scenarios (2.6% and 1.2% for Huaraz and Caraz ,respectively,
    for the mean of all models scenario). Baseline meltwater contribution to streamflow
    at the basin outlet is around 5%, which decreases to a maximum of 1.6% under projected
    climate change. Table 4. Percentage of snowmelt-generated runoff (Q) at cities
    of Caraz and Huaraz and at Santa outflow under different multi-model climate change

    Table Policy implications The results of this analysis are a clear indication
    that projected climate change across a wide range of scenarios generally leads
    to increased water availability for the Rio Santa basin and a trend towards runoff
    being more rainfall-dominated, particularly in the dry season. Though snowmelt
    increases, rainfall increases more, so the relative contribution of snowmelt lessens.
    However, projections of precipitation by GCMs are highly uncertain, particularly
    for a highly heterogeneous landscape such as the Andes mountain range (Buytaert,
    Celleri, & Timbe, 2009; Ramirez & Jarvis, 2010). This is clear from our different
    ensemble summaries (mean, mean + 1 SD, and mean – 1 SD), which show very different
    results. Therefore, to best deal with this unpredictability and uncertainty in
    future streamflow, more and better-distributed storage and distribution systems,
    alongside efficient water use, are essential. This analysis did not take into
    account groundwater stores, even though a number of studies have demonstrated
    that groundwater contributions in small glacier-dominated sub-watersheds of the
    Santa Basin are proportionally as important as glacier melt for dry-season streamflows
    (Baraer et al., 2015; Gordon et al., 2015; Mark, 2010). WaterWorld assumes groundwater
    stores to be in equilibrium in the long term as it uses a long-term climatology
    and groundwater resources at these timescales are controlled by the long-term
    water balance. In reality, a projected reduction or increase of water balance
    because of the combined impacts on precipitation, evapotranspiration and snowmelt
    will thus affect both runoff and groundwater stores in the same direction. Therefore,
    under those scenarios that project overall increases in water balance (four of
    the six scenarios), it is likely that groundwater stores will be adequately replenished
    and can thus act as seasonal buffers, whereas the reverse might be true for scenarios
    projecting a decrease in water balance. While groundwater stores are important
    for freshwater resources in the region, they cannot replace the storage function
    of current snow and ice. With the disappearance of these stores, new storage solutions
    that can provide a buffer against seasonal shortage should be considered. This
    could include small reservoirs, modified lakes and household-scale water storage
    systems (Vuille, 2008; McKinney, Anderson, & Byers, 2011). A recognition of the
    potential of natural infrastructure for harnessing and storing glacial and snow
    meltwater, particularly at high altitudes, is therefore required in policy and
    implementation institutions. In addition, targeted investments in physical water
    infrastructure can increase resilience to uncertain climate changes by regulating
    water flows. On the demand side, policies aimed at changes in irrigation practices
    and shifts in crop types and varieties could lead to diminished water demand and
    less competition in times of low supply. The continuing population growth, however,
    will increase domestic demands year-round, as will agricultural, hydropower and
    mining water users, who are all dependent on reliable water flows throughout the
    year. To balance these competing demands amongst all water users in the basin
    necessitates watershed-level dialogue between all upstream and downstream water
    users. The range of possible outcomes of climate change highlighted in this study
    require policies aimed at creating capacity to respond to such changing and unpredictable
    conditions and strategies that are robust under the full range of possible future
    scenarios: in short a focus on adaptability rather than a specific adaptation
    per se. Conclusions Impacts of climate change on water resources are extremely
    difficult to project, particularly in a highly heterogeneous landscape such as
    the Peruvian Andes. The uncertainties in projections by GCMs, particularly for
    precipitation, lead to a wide range of possible outcomes for water resources even
    for the same emissions scenario. Model simulations with the WaterWorld model and
    climate change scenarios that encompass a very broad range of projections for
    the Santa Basin show a general trend towards an increase in water availability
    as a result of projected increases in precipitation. This is in contrast to previous
    studies that examined the impact of temperature increases on snow and ice alone
    (Chevallier et al., 2011; Pouyaud et al., 2005). Although the level of uncertainty
    around glacial retreat with warming is already high, if studies do not examine
    the impact of precipitation change then impacts on water resources are not fully
    accounted for. Although impacts on precipitation change are even more uncertain,
    they have to be considered alongside snow and ice melt in basins like the Santa.
    Higher temperatures lead to less snowfall (more precipitation falls as rain),
    and thus less snowpack accumulation, ultimately producing decreases in snow melt
    volumes (even though the per-unit-area rate of melting of the snowpack may increase
    with warming, the extent of the snowpack – and thus total snowmelt – declines).
    This leads to a more rainfall-dominated hydrological system at the basin scale
    and also at critical sites of water demand (for example key cities). A more rainfall-dominated
    system is more prone to short-onset drought in response to monthly rainfall than
    one fed from snow and ice stores that respond to longer-term accumulation and
    melt dynamics. Seasonal water availability is likely to be affected, but the projected
    decreases in water storage in glaciers and snowpack are potentially offset by
    an increase in direct runoff from greater rainfall in the dry season. The very
    high uncertainties associated with climate change in these environments necessitate
    basin-wide policies aimed at increased adaptability, and the development of adaptive
    capacity to respond to such changing conditions, including through demand-side
    management. Simplistic notions of climate change leading to drying-up of Andean
    water supplies as a result of deglaciation have to be considered within the context
    of projected changes in precipitation and in the partitioning of precipitation
    between rain and snow, as well as the commonly studied impact of warming on snow
    and ice melt. Without the former, studies on the latter alone can be highly misleading.

    One of the main challenges in agriculture is to sustainably meet the demand for
    food while preserving natural resources for future productions. Information Technology
    can assist producers to make better decisions by providing them with data and
    tools that enhance decision-making process, consequently allowing better management
    of the natural resources. Cloud-computing platforms and the extraction of data
    available on public weather related data sets allow the development of web applications
    that can assist producers with their investing and planning decisions. This paper
    describes the Big Weather solution, an agricultural decision-making support system
    that utilizes a cloud-computing platform, distributed processing technologies,
    and a big data framework. This paper also presents Big Weather architecture and
    an example of metric calculations (average temperature and humidity) and discusses
    the performance of the solution when tested in different virtual machine scenario
    configurations. The novelty is the transparency of the framework, which allows
    farmers to make better decisions based on data available on the cloud. Published

    ABSTRACT The rapid growth of remote sensing big data (RSBD) has attracted considerable
    attention from both academia and industry. Despite the progress of computer technologies,
    conventional computing implementations have become technically inefficient for
    processing RSBD. Cloud computing is effective in activating and mining large-scale
    heterogeneous data and has been widely applied to RSBD over the past years. This
    study performs a technical review of cloud-based RSBD storage and computing from
    an interdisciplinary viewpoint of remote sensing and computer science. First,
    we elaborate on four critical technical challenges resulting from the scale expansion
    of RSBD applications, i.e. raster storage, metadata management, data homogeneity,
    and computing paradigms. Second, we introduce state-of-the-art cloud-based data
    management technologies for RSBD storage. The unit for manipulating remote sensing
    data has evolved due to the scale expansion and use of novel technologies, which
    we name the RSBD data model. Four data models are suggested, i.e. scenes, ARD,
    data cubes, and composite layers. Third, we summarize recent research on the application
    of various cloud-based parallel computing technologies to RSBD computing implementations.
    Finally, we categorize the architectures of mainstream RSBD platforms. This research
    provides a comprehensive review of the fundamental issues of RSBD for computing
    experts and remote sensing researchers. KEYWORDS: Remote sensingbig datacloud
    computingdata cubeanalysis ready dataparallel computingdata model 1. Introduction
    The accumulation of historical archives and the advancement of sensors in recent
    years has led to an explosion of remote sensing datasets (Toth and Jóźków 2016;
    Zhu et al. 2019), which are often regarded as remote sensing big data (RSBD) (Ma
    et al. 2015) or big remotely sensed data (Casu et al. 2017). With the launch of
    Landsat 9 on 27 September 2021, the Landsat series of satellites has been continuously
    observing Earth for nearly 50 years (Masek et al. 2020; Roy et al. 2014). The
    Sentinel satellites from the European Space Agency (ESA) had acquired 24.87 petabytes
    of remote sensing data by the end of 2020 (Drusch et al. 2012). Series of high-resolution
    remote sensing satellites such as SPOT (French ‘Satellite pour l''Observation
    de la Terre’), Gaofen (Chinese high-resolution Earth imaging satellites), and
    IRS (Indian Remote Sensing Satellites) have been successively launched for various
    applications. Satellite data can be better leveraged and explored with the efforts
    of international organizations such as the Global Earth Observation System of
    Systems (Mhawish et al. 2021). RSBD has profoundly advanced remote sensing science,
    enabling a global perspective and a long-term historical view to re-conceptualize
    Earth (Guo et al. 2020). It not only expands the spatiotemporal scope of the study
    area but also stimulates a revolution in the remote sensing methodology. Over
    the past several decades, remote sensing research has gradually developed from
    qualitative remote sensing based on the statistical models of digital signal processing
    to quantitative remote sensing characterized by the consideration of physical
    models (Asrar et al. 1985; Liang 2003). Recently, remote sensing research has
    entered the data-driven era (Hey, Tansley, and Tolle 2009; Zhang et al. 2019),
    e.g. machine learning (Jordan and Mitchell 2015) and deep learning (Lecun, Bengio,
    and Hinton 2015). Most of all, with the progress of RSBD, an increasing number
    of researchers and engineers are working with RSBD, effectively contributing to
    research on global sustainable development, global climate, food security, natural
    disasters, agriculture, etc. (Allen et al. 2021; Gray et al. 2020; Moon, Kim,
    and Chan 2019; Liu et al. 2020; Neal et al. 2019). Although RSBD has a promising
    future, its technical implementation remains difficult, and the identification
    of current technical challenges facing RSBD remains a broad issue. Yang et al.
    ( 2017) identified eleven main challenges for implementing RSBD, including data
    storage, transmission, analysis, architecture, and quality. In addition, Chi et
    al. ( 2016) found three common challenges, including proper data identification
    and big data computing and collaboration. These challenges have been mainly induced
    by the dramatic increase in data volume, which far exceeds the capacity of conventional
    computing technologies. For instance, Hansen et al. ( 2013) mapped global forest
    gains and losses from 2000 to 2012 at a 30 m spatial resolution, processing 20
    terapixels of data. However, the manipulation of these massive datasets requires
    abundant human and material resources. As a result, only a few leading research
    institutions or companies have had access to RSBD, unfortunately leading to difficulty
    in leveraging RSBD and seriously restricting development. Cloud computing is a
    big data service delivered through the Internet (Yu et al. 2017; Armbrust et al.
    2010). It originated from E-commerce and social networks (Sakr et al. 2011), and
    has been widely applied to RSBD over the past several years (Varghese and Buyya
    2018). These applications include Google Earth Engine (GEE) (Tamiminia et al.
    2020), Microsoft Planetary Computer (‘Planetary Computer’ 2022), and Earth on
    Amazon Web Services (AWS) (‘Data and Information Access Services’ 2021). Cloud
    computing is underpinned by big data technology and mainly consists of five service
    models, including Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS),
    Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Data storage as a Service (DaaS), and Function
    as a Service (FaaS) (Dillon, Wu, and Chang 2010). These services differ from previous
    computing technologies (e.g. high-performance computing) and make RSBD more accessible
    to the public. First, cloud computing typically relies on a set of commodity machines,
    and is usually priced as ‘pay-per-use’ and supports the elastic expansion of resources
    on-demand (Wang et al. 2010). As a result, the cost is much lower than sophisticated
    and expensive high-performance computers (Ferreira et al. 2020; Gupta et al. 2013).
    Second, cloud computing is delivered through the Internet, which helps the open
    sharing of remote sensing data and research, therefore promoting the progress
    of FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) (Wilkinson
    et al. 2016). Third, a robust big data ecology has been formed around cloud computing
    after years of development, shielding users from the technicalities of massive
    computing. Thus, cloud computing helps RSBD researchers and engineers focus more
    on algorithms and analysis rather than being hindered by computer technology (Saxena
    et al. 2020). Fourth, cloud computing is suitable for data-intensive computing
    such as RSBD applications (Yang et al. 2019). The combination of cloud computing
    and remote sensing has proven to facilitate and promote RSBD. This has attracted
    a growing interest in remote sensing research as a potential solution for large-scale
    spatiotemporal analysis. Previous studies have evaluated the progress of cloud-based
    RSBD in terms of the acquisition, storage, computing, analysis, transmission,
    and visualization (Ma et al. 2015; Chi et al. 2016; Zhang, Zhou, and Luo 2021;
    Wang and Yan 2020) and in specific applications (Sarker et al. 2020; Balti et
    al. 2020; Qu et al. 2020). In this research, we performed a broad technical review
    of cloud-based RSBD storage and computing and summarized the key architectures
    of cloud-based RSBD platforms. Section 2 discusses four concerns posed by RSBD
    storage and computing, namely raster storage, metadata management, data homogeneity,
    and the computing paradigm. Section 3 and 4 review the available cloud-based technologies
    and our current understanding of RSBD storage and computing. Finally, Section
    5 provides the conclusion of the review. Overall, four data models, two computing
    types, four processing models, and five types of RSBD platform architectures are
    identified and discussed in this research, which broadly assesses state-of-the-art
    RSBD technologies and helps readers explore advanced RSBD. 2. Concerns and challenges
    2.1. Raster storage The volume of remote sensing data long ago stepped into the
    petabyte era and is moving towards the exabyte and zettabyte era. Conventionally,
    raster data is stored as arrays in multiple file formats, including the hierarchical
    data format (HDF) (MODIS), GeoTIFF (Landsat), and JP2000 (Sentinel-2). The size
    of a single dataset generally ranges from megabytes to terabytes. In addition,
    some cloud-based platforms store raster data as tiles in lightweight data formats
    (Yao et al. 2020) following grid discretization with Discrete Global Grid Systems
    (DGGS) for fast visualization and online computing. These include portable network
    graphics (PNG) and the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) image format. The
    unprecedented increase in remote sensing data poses severe challenges for RSBD
    raster data storage (Guo et al. 2020). First, the volume of RSBD far exceeds the
    capacity of standalone storage hardware, such as block storage or the redundant
    array of independent disks (RAID) (Gomes, Queiroz, and Ferreira 2020). Distributed
    storage systems (DFS, introduced in Section 3.1) can preserve petabytes of data
    (Lü et al. 2011). However, the storage cost is extremely high for both individuals
    and government departments. For instance, the United States Geological Survey
    (USGS) considered charging for access to widely used sources of remote sensing
    data (e.g. Landsat) in 2018 to recover costs from users (Popkin 2018). Second,
    the retrieval of array data generates costly operations due to the specificity
    of remote sensing data structures, leading to a decrease in I/O efficiency and
    an increase in access latency. These types of operations differ from conventional
    big data I/O operations and are rarely optimized by existing big data technologies
    (Zhao et al. 2018). For example, in the case of time-series analysis, remote sensing
    data are often scattered in several individual files/objects, resulting in numerous
    random access and expensive data transformations (Extract-Transform-Load). Consequently,
    data storage schemes need to be further developed to support big data storage
    technologies and remote sensing data. 2.2. Metadata management Remote sensing
    data comes with complex and vital metadata information. The full utilization of
    metadata is valuable for the reliability and quality of raster data. The management
    of remote sensing datasets must rely on metadata information, such as the band,
    resolution, capturing time, etc. In addition, the complete metadata describes
    essential information for tracing raster data quality, such as cloudiness and
    solar altitude, and ensuring the robustness and reliability of the subsequent
    analysis (Barsi et al. 2019). Several bottlenecks limit the use of complete metadata.
    First, there are substantial metadata entries for remote sensing datasets, and
    the quantity often exceeds the capacity of conventional metadata management systems.
    For example, the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2 product includes hundreds
    of metadata fields. Second, there are differences in metadata information formats.
    Generally, the metadata for remote sensing data is stored in the form of key-value
    pairs. However, some metadata, such as cloud masks and pixel quality assessments,
    are stored as vectors or rasters. Unfortunately, traditional metadata storage
    technologies do not support the management of unstructured metadata. Third, the
    metadata structures of the remote sensing data acquired from different sources
    are heterogeneous and lack a unified standard, leading to semantic ambiguities
    between datasets (Closa et al. 2019). Therefore, standards and management systems,
    such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Unified Metadata
    Model (‘NASA Unified Metadata Model’ 2022), need to be formulated for metadata
    to ensure multi-source remote sensing data interoperability. These standards need
    to be developed and adapted for the novel RSBD applications emerging in the era
    of cloud computing (e.g. tile data retrieval, metadata queries). Therefore, it
    is crucial to implement the technology migration from big data to remote sensing
    metadata (Al-Yadumi et al. 2021). 2.3. Homogeneity The homogeneity of input data
    is essential for data mining (Yu et al. 2017), while heterogeneity is a common
    feature of big data (Wu et al. 2014). In Section 2.2, we mentioned the heterogeneous
    characteristics of metadata. However, the heterogeneity of raster data is more
    complex and essential, especially for multisource remote sensing data (Zhan et
    al. 2018; Pastor-Guzman et al. 2020). Specifically, we assess the homogeneity
    of remote sensing raster data in terms of two aspects. Homogeneity refers to the
    identical physical characteristics and quality of remote sensing data, such as
    the spectral meaning (e.g. central wavelength), processing level, accuracy, resolution,
    and projection. These characteristics can affect the accuracy and robustness of
    any subsequent analysis. Typically, heterogeneous data can be fixed during pre-processing
    (Young et al. 2017). However, pre-processing large amounts of data is difficult
    because some pre-processing steps still require manual intervention and cannot
    be executed in a fast and parallelized fashion (Rittger et al. 2021; Wei, Chang,
    and Bai 2020). Moreover, homogeneity restricts the integrity and continuity of
    remote sensing data in both the temporal and spatial dimensions. Spatiotemporal
    continuity is necessary for remote sensing analysis to ensure greater accuracy
    over a more extensive scale (Kuo et al. 2018). A remote sensing analysis with
    discontinuous data can lead to inconsistent results (Li and Long 2020). Nevertheless,
    continuity is commonly inaccessible over a large region of interest due to the
    specificity of remote sensing data acquisition modes and plans (Figure 1). Figure

    map with continuous remote sensing coverage. b) NDVI map with discontinuous remote
    sensing coverage due to cloud cover. Display full size It is a challenge to improve
    the types of homogeneity mentioned above, which relates to remote sensing science
    and big data processing. Specific data pre-processing theories and algorithms
    are needed for technical support. Recent research has made great efforts toward
    improving the homogeneity of remote sensing data, e.g. spatial–temporal data fusion
    (Liu et al. 2021; Zhu et al. 2018) and multi-source remote sensing data harmonization
    (Claverie et al. 2018). Additionally, corresponding computational technologies
    are expected to implement rapid homogenization for large remote sensing datasets
    (Guo et al. 2020; Gao et al. 2022). 2.4. Parallel computing Parallel computing
    simultaneously implements computation by dividing the main computation into smaller
    processes (Almasi and Gottlieb 1989). Parallel remote sensing computing lies at
    the core of RSBD, and enables the full exploitation of big data’s scalable computing
    capability. Previous reviews have described the processing in remote sensing computing
    as (Chi et al. 2016): Y = F ( X ) (1) where Y denotes the computing results, X
    is the input remote sensing dataset, and F is the mapping function that transfers
    the input datasets into the result. There is no need to consider implementing
    parallelized computing for a single-threaded application scenario. Therefore,
    Eq. (1) can be simplified as: Y = f ( X ) (2) where f refers to a single-threaded
    remote sensing algorithm. Eq. (2) is the most basic case. However, in a big data
    scenario, the scale of X may be huge and beyond the capacity of a standalone computing
    node. In this case, the computation needs to be simultaneously processed with
    more computational resources to reduce the overhead time cost. However, the parallelization
    execution strategies are largely different among algorithms. Therefore, it is
    not easy to find a generalized computational framework that can be adapted to
    all remote sensing analysis algorithms, such as Eq. (1) . RSBD analysis can be
    grouped into two types, data-separable computing and data-inseparable computing,
    to further decompose the problem and investigate different solutions. Data-inseparable
    computing cannot be parallelized by partitioning the data. This type of computing
    requires a large amount of global information from the whole dataset, such as
    unsupervised classification, principal component analysis (PCA), etc. A parallel
    processing method that simply divides the dataset will produce side effects due
    to the tile edges (Lassalle et al. 2015). Parallel computing methods for such
    analysis are usually individualized. In other words, it is difficult to generalize
    a parallel computing paradigm for all data-inseparable remote sensing algorithms.
    Google Earth Engine’s ‘spatial aggregations data distribution model’ pre-implements
    several data-inseparable computing algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented individually
    and transparently by Earth Engine using the MapReduce computing paradigm (introduced
    in Section 4) (Gorelick et al. 2017). On the contrary, data-separable computation
    can be considered as a series of independent sub-tasks by partitioning the datasets.
    In other words, not much external information is needed while processing each
    partition, and: Y = F X ( f x ( x 0 ) , f x ( x 1 ) , … , f x ( x n ) ) (3) where
    f is the processing algorithm for a sub-partition, F is the algorithm for integrating
    the partitions into a complete output Y, x is a sub-partition of X, and X = {
    x 0 , x 1 , … , x n } . Data-separable computing is supported by cloud computing
    and is known as embarrassingly parallel or pleasingly parallel computing in computer
    science (Barcelona-Pons et al. 2019). This type of computing has been widely applied
    in RSBD using quantitative remote sensing, artificial intelligence, etc. For example,
    Pekel et al. integrated the computing power of 10,000 computers to map 30 m global
    water bodies for almost 30 years based on an expert system classifier (Pekel et
    al. 2016). Ni et al. extracted 10 m rice-growing areas in northeast China using
    machine learning (Ni et al. 2021). Xie et al. produced 30 m annual irrigation
    maps based on MODIS and Landsat data for the United States from 1997 to 2017 using
    a random forest classifier (Xie and Lark 2021). All of the above studies have
    relied on the parallelization of data-separable computing. Additionally, the studies
    used Earth Engine’s ‘image tilling data distribution model’ for spatial partitioning
    and ‘streaming collections’ for temporal partitioning (Gorelick et al. 2017).
    Overall, data-inseparable computing requires custom implementation, while data-separable
    computing can be implemented based on generic processing paradigms. However, despite
    the similarities in parallel computing paradigms, there are differences in the
    data partitioning strategies, analysis algorithms, and combination algorithms
    for each specific analysis. In addition, there are strong relationships between
    the way the data is partitioned and parallel algorithms. Therefore, a unified
    framework is urgently needed to regulate and constrain remote sensing algorithms
    and distributed execution paradigms. 2.5. Challenges in the DIKW hierarchy This
    section introduces the four primary challenges facing RSBD, which are expected
    to be resolved with cloud-based approaches. However, there are significant differences
    between RSBD and traditional data processing. RSBD involves both remote sensing
    technology and computer science, which fully illustrates its multidisciplinary
    nature. Traditionally, remote sensing science has only been applied to limited
    scales and needs to be re-examined to support large-scale applications. In addition,
    computer science and technology have been traditionally oriented to conventional
    business, and need to be tailored to remote sensing to support the management
    and mining of RSBD. This cross-fertilization perspective is closely related to
    the four challenges. Rowley ( 2007) defined the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom
    (DIKW) hierarchy. This concept can help explain the relationships between the
    four identified challenges and RSBD (Figure 2). DIKW Data corresponds to raw remote
    sensing data, which is associated with the challenges of data storage and metadata
    management. DIKW Information corresponds to data that conforms to homogeneity,
    such as the data cube or analysis ready data (ARD) (‘CEOS’ 2022). Homogeneity
    should be addressed when transforming DIKW Data into DIKW Information. The parallel
    computing problem exists in both the process of transforming DIKW Data into DIKW
    Information and DIKW Information into DIKW Knowledge. Finally, DIKW Information
    is transformed into DIKW Wisdom using human intelligence, which is used to assist
    real-world decisions and practices. The process of transforming and formalizing
    wisdom from knowledge remains challenging for RSBD. Figure 2. Relationship between
    the DIKW pyramid and the four major concerns. Display full size 3. Cloud-based
    RSBD storage 3.1. Cloud-based big data storage Currently, there are five leading
    cloud computing and big data technologies applicable to RSBD storage, including
    the Object Storage System (OSS), Distributed File System (DFS), Relational Database
    Management System (RDBMS), NoSQL, and array database management systems (array
    DBMSs). The Object Storage System (OSS) manages data in the form of objects, each
    of which is identified with a globally unique identifier. In particular, the RESTful
    API allows data access via HTTP, which means that the object can be easily accessed
    from anywhere on the network. In addition, OSS can manage additional metadata
    for data descriptions. However, OSS does not support I/O operations such as open,
    read, write, etc. Users can deploy OSS in the cloud using open-source software
    or directly leverage OSS-based storage services (e.g. Amazon S3 and Microsoft
    Azure). The Distributed File System (DFS) is another commonly used big data storage
    technology, and examples include the Google File System (Ghemawat, Gobioff, and
    Leung 2003) known as Colossus (Dean and Denis 2021) and the Hadoop Distributed
    File System (Shvachko et al. 2010). DFS supports more comprehensive interfaces
    and features in comparison to OSS (Weil et al. 2006). However, DFS can suffer
    from the bottleneck problems of primary nodes, which restricts the upper limit
    of scaling to some extent. For example, the metadata of the Hadoop Distributed
    File System is stored in the primary node''s memory, which restricts the number
    of files that are stored (Shvachko et al. 2010). In addition, the files stored
    in DFS can only be accessed through the mounted hosts, which is not as flexible
    as OSS. Relational database management systems (RDBMS) are a widely used database
    model (Codd 1970). RDBMS is oriented toward transactional operations and focuses
    on the properties of atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID).
    The reliability and stability of RDBMS have been greatly improved with the development
    of RSBD. Some RDBMS, such as PostgreSQL, can manage spatial data and have been
    widely used for remote sensing metadata management. However, there are apparent
    bottlenecks in the standalone RDBMS load capacity. A cloud-based distributed RDBMS,
    NewSQL, was proposed to enhance the scalability of traditional RDBMS for massive
    structured data (Pavlo and Aslett 2016). Google Spanner is an example of this
    technology (Corbett et al. 2013). The onset of Web 2.0 drove an increasing need
    to manage a large amount of unstructured data, which gave rise to NoSQL, e.g.
    MongoDB, HBase (Mehul Nalin 2011), and Google Big Table (Chang et al. 2006). Unlike
    RDBMS, NoSQL does not support transactional operations and ACID properties. On
    the contrary, NoSQL emphasizes the principles of consistency, availability, and
    partition tolerance (CAP) (Gray and Reuter 1992; Cattell 2010), thus improving
    concurrency, efficiency, and horizontal scalability. The various NoSQL technologies
    have distinct technical characteristics that can be applied in different application
    scenarios. These are generally classified into four types, including wide-column,
    key-value, document, and search engine. More detailed reviews of NoSQL can be
    found in the respective literature (Davoudian, Chen, and Liu 2018; Guo and Onstein
    2020). Array database management systems (array DBMSs) are a type of scientific
    database dedicated to the storage and management of array-like scientific data
    (Zalipynis 2021). Array DBMSs are often grouped as NoSQL. However, we decided
    to introduce them individually due to their natural affinity for remote sensing
    and geospatial data (Zalipynis 2020). Array DBMSs support SQL-like queries and
    operations on arrays (e.g. resampling and aggregations). Such advanced manipulations
    are essential for remote sensing data management because they simplify data retrieval
    and pre-processing (Zalipynis 2021; Appel et al. 2018). In addition, array DBMSs
    generally optimize I/O through the underlying technology, which is beneficial
    for online RSBD computing. For example, TileDB optimizes the performance of concurrent
    I/O and sparse arrays by turning multiple random-writes into a single sequential
    write (Papadopoulos et al. 2016). Furthermore, some advanced array DBMSs support
    horizontal scaling. For example, SciDB (Brown 2010) and RasDaMan (Baumann et al.
    2018) support distributed deployment, and TileDB supports share-nothing cloud
    computing architecture, storing files as AWS (Amazon Web Services) S3 objects
    in the cloud. However, importing massive scientific data into an array DBMS may
    be time-consuming. In addition, as far as we know, no cloud services directly
    provide array DBMS services, and users can only build an array DBMS through IaaS.
    Users can build most of the storage technologies introduced above using IaaS.
    In addition, cloud services also provide out-of-the-box storage services (SaaS).
    SaaS helps users focus more on business by avoiding database maintenance. Table
    1 identifies the open-source technologies corresponding to different storage technologies
    and mainstream cloud computing SaaS products. Table 1. Storage technologies for
    RSBD (open source Google Microsoft and Amazon). Download CSVDisplay Table 3.2.
    Cloud-based data storage for RSBD Massive remote sensing data storage consists
    of raster data and metadata storage. 3.2.1. Raster storage Currently, remote sensing
    raster data is generally stored as cloud-optimized data formats in an OSS or DFS.
    In addition, it can be stored in NoSQL databases in the form of tiles or in an
    array DBMS in the form of arrays. Cloud-optimized data formats are optimized to
    improve I/O performance in cloud storage. As we mentioned earlier, OSS does not
    support file opening and writing operations, which is inconvenient for computing.
    For example, even though only a portion of the data is accessed, the complete
    remote sensing dataset must be downloaded, resulting in high redundant overhead
    costs. Cloud-optimized data storage formats for remote sensing data such as Zarr
    and Cloud Optimized GeoTiff (COG) have emerged and improved the performance of
    RSBD data storage. Among them, Cloud Optimized GeoTiff (COG), a GeoTiff data format
    optimized for cloud computing and storage, has been widely adopted (‘Cloud Optimized
    GeoTIFF’ 2022). A 16-kilobyte header file is first parsed when accessing COG within
    OSS. Subsequently, a portion of the remote sensing data can be read on demand
    without downloading the entire dataset. Furthermore, the COG file retains the
    original data resolution and creates internal overview copies for lower resolutions,
    significantly improving the data retrieval efficiency of web-based applications.
    As a result, COG can improve the retrieval efficiency in both DFS and OSS. Currently,
    COG is attracting increased attention. For example, COG replaced GeoTiff in 2021
    as the standard data format for Landsat series data Collection 2. OSS can store
    remote sensing tile and raster data, and cloud-optimized data formats, especially
    COG, are becoming major storage formats for OSS. Amazon, Microsoft, and Google
    currently use OSS to store a large amount of remote sensing data (Table 2). The
    data stored in an OSS can be easily shared through the Internet and leveraged
    for analysis and visualization, promoting open sharing and the use of remote sensing
    data. Users can efficiently access the data with little charge and without considering
    data management and server maintenance, greatly promoting FAIR principles. Table
    2. Remote sensing data stored in the OSSs published by Amazon Microsoft and Google.
    Download CSVDisplay Table DFS is a mature big data storage technology and the
    dominant storage system of RSBD platforms. Distributed file systems cannot share
    data as easily as OSS, but provide advantageous functions such as appending writes
    and modifications. There is no apparent requirement for direct data sharing for
    a computing platform, but there is a clear need for functions such as append write
    and random read. For example, Digital Earth Australia (successor of the Australian
    Geoscience Data Cube) stores Landsat archives in the Lustre system (Braam 2019)
    within the Australian National Computational Infrastructure (Lewis et al. 2017).
    The JRC Earth Observation Data and Processing Platform (JEODPP) stores remote
    sensing datasets in EOS, a DFS designed for the European Organization for Nuclear
    Research (Peters, Sindrilaru, and Adde 2015; Soille et al. 2018), and Earth Engine
    stores a large amount of remote sensing data in Google Colossus. NoSQL supports
    the storage of large amounts of unstructured data and can therefore preserve RSBD
    raster data. Wide-column NoSQL is suitable for storing a vast amount of unstructured
    data such as tiles. GeoTrellis (Kini and Emanuele 2014), a Spark-based RSBD computation
    engine, stores remote sensing tiles and vector geospatial data in wide-column
    NoSQL. However, wide-column NoSQL lacks support for data indexing, especially
    the spatial index needed for remote sensing data. Therefore, users must carefully
    design the row keys to enable spatiotemporal queries (Xu et al. 2020). In-memory
    key-value NoSQL databases store data as key-value pairs in distributed memory
    and can cache the intermediate data for online remote sensing computation. For
    example, Earth Engine stores the cached data from the service in an in-memory
    database to reduce secondary access latency (Gorelick et al. 2017). However, the
    volume of remote sensing data can far exceed the memory storage capacity. Thus,
    in-memory key-value NoSQL is not suitable for persistent remote sensing data.
    Document NoSQL provides spatial indexing capability and can support the storage
    of extensive individual data with more comprehensive capabilities. Wang et al.
    ( 2019) and Cheng et al. ( 2020) implemented storage systems for RSBD based on
    MongoDB. They stored the data in MongoDB after further slicing and achieved the
    management of remote sensing data based on MongoDB’s rich query capability. Overall,
    NoSQL supports more advanced functions than OSS or DFS, such as spatiotemporal
    data management. It has obvious advantages in RSBD application scenarios, but
    the cost of NoSQL is much greater than DFS or OSS. As far as we know, the practice
    of petabyte-level NoSQL-based RSBD storage still requires further research and
    exploration. Unlike other storage systems that store remote sensing data as files,
    array DBMSs store and manipulate remote sensing data as arrays. Array DBMSs optimize
    efficiency based on the underlying storage technology. More importantly, array
    DBMSs support high-level array manipulation for managing remote sensing data,
    including data storage, metadata management, indexing, etc. In other words, an
    array DBMS can be used as an RSBD data management system with a few additional
    components. For example, EarthServer (Baumann et al. 2016) implements the storage
    of a large amount of remote sensing data using RasDaMan (Baumann et al. 1998).
    Furthermore, some array DBMSs can process remote sensing data (e.g. reprojection,
    resampling) and have been applied in tandem with machine learning (Ordonez, Zhang,
    and Lennart Johnsson 2019). However, array DBMS-based RSBD data management is
    still in its infancy. One of the major challenges lies in incorporating data into
    NoSQL, which can be costly. Specifically, all raw datasets should be pre-processed
    into the unified format recognized by each type of array DBMS, which is a time-consuming
    process (Lewis et al. 2017). 3.2.2. Metadata storage & management RSBD metadata
    storage and management are mainly based on NoSQL, RDBMS, and NewSQL. RDBMS is
    suitable for storing and managing remote sensing metadata and is the mainstream
    technical approach for RSBD management systems. For example, Li and Tang ( 2019)
    and Zhou et al. ( 2021) stored remote sensing data in distributed MySQL and PostgreSQL
    systems, respectively. The Open Data Cube stores metadata in PostgreSQL (Killough
    2018). In our case, we managed the metadata of petabytes of remote sensing datasets
    (ten million metadata entries) with a standalone PostgreSQL instance. However,
    there is an upper limit to the storage capacity of RDBMS. Therefore, RDBMS is
    only suitable for the rapid construction of structured remote sensing metadata
    storage for medium-sized datasets. Cloud-native NewSQL overcomes the problems
    with scalability and is ideal for storing significant metadata volumes. For example,
    Earth Engine uses Spanner as one of its data management tools (Gorelick et al.
    2017). NewSQL open-source technology and cloud computing services are still being
    developed. NoSQL can store unstructured data such as heterogeneous remote sensing
    metadata (Guo and Onstein 2020). For RSBD data storage systems, data and metadata
    are often rarely modified after they are input into the database. Therefore, compared
    to RDBMS, NoSQL’s lack of support for ACID is acceptable for RSBD management systems.
    Search engine is a type of NoSQL that supports full-text search such as Solr and
    Elastic Search. Search engine NoSQL builds inverted indexes in memory to achieve
    high performance and a robust full-text index. Fan et al. ( 2017) stored the metadata
    of remote sensing in SolrCloud and implemented a full-text search. Their process
    supports advanced functions such as fuzzy queries and has good adaptability for
    the complex structures of remote sensing metadata. However, it is costly to implement
    such storage systems using search engine NoSQL. Wide-column and document NoSQL
    are also used for metadata storage. For example, Earth Engine adopted the Big
    Table storage system (Gorelick et al. 2017). Wang et al. ( 2019) and Cheng et
    al. ( 2020) used MongoDB to store both raster data and metadata to achieve integrated
    data/metadata storage. 3.3. Data model: scene, ARD, data cube, composite layer
    The ultimate purpose of data storage is to prepare data for analysis, and thus,
    homogeneity must be considered. The homogeneity of raster data is not prominent
    in the case of small-scale remote sensing analysis, and computing is mainly implemented
    within a scene by a standalone processing node. There is an increasing requirement
    for advanced remote sensing data organization due to the expansion of spatiotemporal
    scales, which we propose as a data model related to data organization, data structure,
    and data production methods. It is necessary to adopt a suitable remote sensing
    data model for large-scale analysis within cloud computing for specific application
    scenarios (algorithms, parallel computing strategies, etc.). In the past few years,
    several data organization schemes have been developed for RSBD analysis, including
    scenes, ARD, data cubes, and composite layers (Figure 3). Figure 3. Relationships
    between scenes ARD data cubes and composite layers. Display full size Scenes are
    the most basic organization for remote sensing data and have been widely applied
    during the past several decades. Conventionally, satellites collect remote sensing
    data in strips and transmit them to the ground segment. The ground segment processes
    the remote sensing data through corrections and evaluations and profiles them
    according to a regular grid (e.g. the Military Grid Reference System adopted by
    Sentinel). The pre-processed remote sensing data are the most common form of remote
    sensing data corresponding to the remote sensing images fetched from data providers
    (e.g. USGS, ESA Copernicus). The use of cloud computing greatly diminishes the
    cost of acquiring scene data. In addition, COG technology also enhances the efficiency
    of remote sensing data access with higher degrees of freedom. Analysis Ready Data
    (ARD) (Potapov et al. 2020) was initiated by the Committee on Earth Observation
    Satellites (CEOS) (‘CEOS’ 2022). The original intent of ARD was to reduce the
    threshold for users to leverage the data by reorganizing discrete datasets into
    regular blocks with a fixed size, resolution, and projection, thus minimizing
    data processing and correction (Dwyer et al. 2018). ARD must be radiometrically
    and geometrically corrected, and evaluated for quality at the pixel level using
    a uniform standard to achieve homogeneous physical characteristics (Frantz 2019).
    In addition, ARD is commonly reorganized into global unified Discrete Global Grid
    Systems in the form of tiles. For example, the USGS produces Landsat ARD applying
    the latest Collection 2 archive standard. Zhong et al. ( 2021) developed an ARD
    data product based on GaoFen satellite data. Most of the previous RSBD research
    stacked multiple datasets into a ‘composite’ before analysis according to specific
    rules, which we name as the composite layer (Thorp and Drajat 2021). The composite
    layer refers to layer-like datasets produced by pre-processing and combining all
    available data over a certain spatial–temporal range, such as remote sensing data
    products (Gong et al. 2020). We borrowed the term ‘layer’ from geographic information
    systems (GIS) to emphasize that there is one and only one value for each pixel
    in the region of interest. It is characterized by its ideal homogeneity. Thus,
    it is the best input data model for non-time series analysis. Therefore, the composite
    layer is the closest remote sensing data model to the ‘Information’ in DIKW. For
    small-scale applications, scenes or ARD can be approximated as the composite layer,
    especially when the scale of the region of interest is comparable to that of scenes
    or ARD. However, data coverage at large scales is not guaranteed for medium and
    high-resolution remote sensing data, which is caused by the data acquisition model
    or long revisit periods. Therefore, the differences between scenes and layers
    are more prominent in large-scale applications. Recently, the data cube has gradually
    become the focus of RSBD research, especially cloud-based RSBD applications (Lewis
    et al. 2016; Giuliani et al. 2017). The data cube reorganizes and stacks ARD data
    along a time dimension and dissects them according to a regular grid. A data cube
    can be a sparse collection of time-series data or a dense mosaic of the best available
    values over time. In contrast to the composite layer, which discards multiple
    available values, the data cube aggregates all available ARD datasets over time
    to approximate the layer as closely as possible. It is the best input for large-scale
    remote sensing analysis (especially time-series analysis). However, the data cube
    tends to be sparse in medium- and high-resolution remote sensing applications.
    Xu et al. ( 2022) further developed the connotation of the data cube to improve
    the homogeneity and proposed Computation Ready Data (CRD). CRD considers the continuity
    of remote sensing data and the diverse computational needs. This approach helps
    promote the use of interpolation and spatiotemporal fusion algorithms to fill
    missing data in the data cube. CRD further reorganizes data according to computational
    needs and fills in the data model and computation gap. As shown in Figure 3, the
    relationships between the data models can be summarized as follows. The data volume
    and information quantity decrease from left to right. The scene datasets retain
    the most information and the largest volume. The generation of ARD data filters
    out poor-quality data and reduces the data volume. The data cube screens out data
    outside a specific spatial and temporal range according to certain conditions,
    which further decreases the available data. Ultimately, the composite layer generally
    reduces the dimensionality of the data cube and therefore possesses the smallest
    data volume. The smaller the data volume, the more convenient it is for transmission
    and sharing. Consequently, the composite layer is the ideal data model for data
    propagation. There is a significant difference in the complexity of data production
    between data models. The production of ARD from raw scene data involves time-consuming
    and computation-intensive processing, such as rigorous radiation and geometric
    correction. However, the creation of the data cube or composite layer is mostly
    a reorganization of datasets with relatively low computational complexity. The
    cost has been significantly reduced for such data-intensive processing due to
    the support of cloud computing technologies (e.g. COG). Hence, it is not efficient
    to produce ARD on-demand since the online construction of the data cube can be
    quickly implemented with the use of cloud computing (Giuliani et al. 2020). Any
    processing will cause a loss of accuracy, and the accuracy loss of different data
    models can vary. The loss of accuracy caused by the correction process in ARD
    production is acceptable and unavoidable in most RSBD applications (Qiu et al.
    2018). However, the production of data cubes or composite layers will affect accuracy
    in comparison with the original datasets. In most cases, data cubes transform
    the original datasets with different projections and resampling, and composite
    layers filter values according to customized rules. Therefore, storing datasets
    in the form of data cubes or composite layers can lead to irreversible losses
    in accuracy compared with ARD. Homogeneity gradually increases from left to right.
    ARD datasets possess homogeneous physical characteristics and data cubes and composite
    layers are observed to approach continuity. Additionally, the layers and data
    cubes are closer to the array data model in computer science. Therefore, both
    are suitable for implementing remote sensing analysis. In this section, the current
    cloud-based storage technologies are introduced and cloud-based remote sensing
    data storage technologies are reviewed. Finally, we provide insights into the
    data models for RSBD applications. Table 3 summarizes the remote sensing data
    storage schemes and data models for fifteen systems and studies produced from
    2016 to 2021. The conclusions are drawn as follows. NoSQL, DFS, Array DBMS, and
    OSS can store raster data, while NoSQL and RDBMS can manage remote sensing metadata.
    Figure 4 further summarizes the characteristics of the four NoSQL databases, aside
    from array DBMS. For cloud-based RSBD raster storage, OSS is the mainstream solution
    for sharing open data, while DFS is the primary solution for RSBD platforms. In
    the context of cloud computing, public cloud-based OSS services can significantly
    lower the cost of RSBD management. Therefore, the RSBD systems in recent years
    have been more inclined to use OSS. NoSQL and array DBMSs have great potential,
    but there are still some limitations such as the high cost of use. Both NoSQL
    and RDBMS can be used to implement cloud-based RSBD metadata storage, and the
    choice of technology depends on the specific application scenario. On the one
    hand, NoSQL can manage the complete archive of remote sensing data, which is difficult
    to achieve through RDBMS (Wang et al. 2019; Cheng et al. 2020). On the other hand,
    the functionality and performance of RDBMS has been widely demonstrated. For example,
    RDBMS has a higher cost performance in the scenario of small and medium volume
    RSBD management. However, NoSQL is more applicable for larger RSBD systems. Data
    models are becoming critical for RSBD applications. The cost of producing ARD
    is generally high and results in an acceptable loss of accuracy (D’Andrimont et
    al. 2021). Therefore, it is appropriate to store remote sensing data as ARD in
    the cloud for common applications. In contrast, data cubes and composite layers
    have less production overhead, suffer from significant accuracy loss, and possess
    a much smaller data volume than scenes (Sudmanns et al. 2020). Therefore, it is
    better to produce data cubes or composite layers on-demand in the cloud before
    propagation (Li et al. 2019). Most importantly, composite layer and data cube
    models are more suitable for implementing remote sensing computing due to their
    homogeneity. Figure 4. The pros and cons of the four types of NoSQL databases

    Table 4. Cloud-based RSBD computing 4.1. Cloud-based big data processing Technologies
    for cloud computing and big data are complex, specialized issues that are beyond
    this work''s scope. This section introduces three active and promising processing
    technologies for RSBD computing: simple batch, MapReduce, and array-based processing
    (Figure 5). In addition, we introduce a lightweight virtualization technology
    known as containerization. Figure 5. Simplified frameworks for the three processing
    models. Display full size 4.1.1. Simple batch processing Simple batch processing
    refers to a simple processing model where each task is independent of others.
    This method has been used for more than twenty years. Some examples include the
    Portable Batch System (PBS), Azure Batch, and AWS Batch (Casado and Younas 2015;
    Henderson 1995). Typically, users pre-define the execution program and execute
    a series of identical computing tasks in a batch. Each input set corresponds to
    a processing instance and outputs a result. Each independent computing task does
    not affect other computing tasks, and such tasks can be executed asynchronously.
    Simple batch processing has been widely used in offline batch processing. However,
    simple batch processing cannot accomplish complex analysis because it does not
    support inter-task communication. 4.1.2. Mapreduce processing MapReduce (Wang
    et al. 2010) is a popular batch processing model for cloud and distributed processing
    that was first announced by Google in 2004 (Dean and Ghemawat 2008). MapReduce
    adapts the idea of functional programming and uses two core operators, Map and
    Reduce, to implement individual data and aggregate operations, respectively. In
    2010, Zaharia et al. developed Spark based on MapReduce, a memory-based distributed
    processing engine (Zaharia et al. 2010). Spark supports more affluent operators
    and uses programming languages to support flexible batch processing. In addition,
    Spark optimizes scheduling by building directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for workflows
    and employing a ‘lazy’ mechanism. Under the ‘lazy’ mechanism, some of Spark''s
    operators only record processes and defer the actual computation to optimize the
    execution route. Spark preserves intermediate data with a memory-based data model
    called Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). RDD can improve the computation
    efficiency by nearly a hundred times compared with MapReduce (Zaharia et al. 2010),
    especially for tasks with multiple iterations such as machine learning and deep
    learning (Lunga et al. 2020). However, the large data volume of data-intensive
    computations often exceeds memory storage capacity, leading to decreased efficiency.
    Cloud processing provides services that help users quickly implement MapReduce
    jobs. Users can build their MapReduce clusters on virtual machines or directly
    use cloud-hosted Hadoop or Spark services, such as Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon
    EMR) and Google Dataproc. 4.1.3. Array-based processing Array-based processing
    is a computational technology for scientific array data (Lu, Appel, and Pebesma
    2018). The well-known Numpy and OpenCV can implement a variety of complex processes
    for array data. However, such software is limited by the resources of a single
    machine and cannot be efficiently applied to very-large arrays. Recent technologies
    have implemented array manipulations with parallel batch processing for large-scale
    arrays, e.g. Dask (Rocklin 2015), such as the computational functions of Earth
    Engine and array DBMSs. Earth Engine adopts FlumeJava (Chambers et al. 2010),
    a MapReduce processing engine, to manipulate remote sensing data as an array-like
    Collection or Image. However, from the usage point of view, such array-based processing
    is different from MapReduce processing. Users of array-based processing do not
    need to worry about the underlying parallel processing implementation, such as
    task scheduling, but directly use arrays as the processing object. At present,
    array-based processing is still developing and has some known flaws. Array DBMSs
    lack the flexibility for implementing user-defined functions (Mehta et al. 2017).
    Furthermore, performance optimization is still not as robust as traditional batch
    processing technologies (Mehta et al. 2017). However, most scientific data, such
    as remote sensing, mainly consist of arrays. The direct manipulation of arrays
    can shield users from many underlying problems. Therefore, we believe that array-based
    processing will play an increasingly important role in scientific big data processing
    in the future. All three processing technologies introduced above can implement
    large-scale remote sensing analysis computations. In Table 4 we briefly summarize
    the mainstream open-source technologies and the related cloud-based solutions.
    However, batch processing technology requires the rewrite of remote sensing analysis
    algorithms, which hinders researchers from performing scientific analysis based
    on RSBD to some extent (Mehta et al. 2017; Camara et al. 2016). Table 4. Processing

    Table 4.1.4. Containerization Containerization is one of the core concepts of
    cloud-native computing (Li 2019; Pelle et al. 2019). It is widely used in cloud-based
    processing such as FaaS and serverless applications. Containerization is a virtualization
    technology that packages algorithms with lightweight containers and provides the
    runtime environments needed for algorithms, e.g. Docker (Merkel 2014). This technology
    allows the stable execution of various remote sensing algorithms in different
    host environments, which improves the portability of remote sensing algorithms
    by decoupling the algorithms from the host machine (Xu et al. 2022). The technology
    is essential for cloud-based RSBD because it can port remote sensing algorithms
    from the local environment to the cloud (Wang et al. 2015). Containers can be
    leveraged jointly with the big data processing technologies mentioned above (e.g.
    batch processing). In addition, they can be managed by container orchestration
    platforms in the cloud. Kubernetes is one of the most famous open-source container
    orchestration platforms; it was developed by Google and contributed to the Cloud
    Native Computing Foundation in 2015 (Bernstein 2014). Borg (Verma et al. 2015),
    the internal Google version of Kubernetes, is used for resource scheduling and
    load balancing within Earth Engine. 4.2. Cloud-based computing for RSBD As introduced
    in Section 2.4, RSBD applications can be grouped into two types, data-separable
    computing and data-inseparable computing. We introduce cloud-based computing for
    RSBD from these two perspectives. 4.2.1. Data-separable computing Data-separable
    computing covers most remote sensing analysis applications, such as pixel-based
    and tile-based analysis and has a simple parallelization strategy with better
    feasibility. The following example illustrates the processing paradigm. Bishop-Taylor
    et al. ( 2021) extracted the coastal zone changes for Australia from 1988 to 2019.
    The study partitioned the region of interest into sub-regions by space and then
    produced data cube datasets for each sub-region. Subsequently, the shoreline changes
    from 1988 to 2019 in each sub-region were extracted using simple batch processing.
    Finally, the study combined all sub-regions and obtained the complete coastline
    change for Australia. This example outlines most of the routines for data-separable
    computing with a simple batch, including (1) partitioning the region of interest,
    (2) constructing data cubes for each partition, (3) computing each partition,
    and (4) combining the partitions. This kind of computing has been widely applied
    in RSBD, especially in data pre-processing and mapping. Each partition’s implementation
    can be considered as an individual computing task, which corresponds with the
    computing paradigm of simple batch processing. In addition, other processing models,
    such as MapReduce, can perform such computing as well. 4.2.2. Data-inseparable
    computing There are dependencies between data-inseparable computing tasks, and
    thus, the input data should be homogeneous as data cubes or composite layers.
    Currently, data-inseparable computing is mainly processed using MapReduce and
    array-based processing. The implementation of parallel remote sensing processing
    algorithms based on MapReduce provides flexibility (Chebbi et al. 2018). MapReduce
    and Spark offer a range of flexible operators which can build complex computational
    pipelines to implement diverse parallelized computations for remote sensing analysis.
    There are a number of studies that have implemented various data-inseparable remote
    sensing computations based on MapReduce-like technologies, such as K-Means clustering
    analysis (Chebbi, Boulila, and Farah 2016), parallelized mosaics (Jing et al.
    2017), deep learning (Sun et al. 2019), and object-based segmentation (Wang et
    al. 2020). GeoTrellis (Kini and Emanuele 2014) is a Spark-based MapReduce processing
    technology that is oriented to remote sensing data processing and provides a set
    of APIs for remote sensing analysis. The MapReduce paradigm has also been widely
    used in the spatial information domain, such as SpatialHadoop (Eldawy and Mokbel
    2015), GeoSpark (Yu, Wu, and Sarwat 2015), and GeoMesa (Hughes et al. 2015). However,
    there are still some known shortcomings in implementing data-inseparable computing
    with MapReduce. Compared with high-performance computing and message passing interfaces,
    there has been an attempt to shield the user from the underlying programming issues
    as much as possible. However, remote sensing researchers still must deal with
    complicated issues in manual parallel computing. The performance of some memory-based
    MapReduce technologies, such as Spark, is considerable. Yet, they are not suitable
    for ‘data-intensive’ RSBD analysis (Makrani et al. 2018). Memory-based processing
    requires a large memory capacity to handle large remote sensing datasets, but
    there is a slight improvement for algorithms with low iterative computation requirements.
    Apart from MapReduce processing, array-based processing is also suitable for data-inseparable
    computing. Arrays, especially composite layers, are the principal unit of remote
    sensing analysis. Array-based processing generally pre-defines diversified APIs
    to manipulate arrays in parallel. The built-in array operations and machine learning
    algorithms can be used for remote sensing analysis, such as vegetation index extraction
    and classification (Villarroya and Baumann 2020). For example, Earth Engine is
    dedicated to remote sensing analysis with many algorithms specializing in remote
    sensing science, such as time series analysis (Hamunyela et al. 2020) and cloud
    detection algorithms (Qiu, Zhu, and He 2019). Array-based processing shields remote
    sensing researchers from the underlying implementation of parallel computing,
    thus helping them to focus more on the computation itself. However, current array-based
    processing still has specific problems. Most array-based processing technologies,
    such as array DBMSs or Dask, are not designed for remote sensing applications,
    and the provided APIs do not support professional remote sensing processing. Therefore,
    additional computing implementations are required as post-processers. For example,
    (Pagani and Trani 2018) constructed a data system with RasDaMan and implemented
    subsequent remote sensing analysis based on R programming. Furthermore, the highly
    packaged APIs reduce the flexibility of implementing user-defined algorithms.
    For example, users cannot extend any analysis that Earth Engine does not support.
    Fortunately, this problem might be gradually alleviated with the development of
    open-source array-based processing technologies. Furthermore, the efficiency of
    current array-based processing (e.g. Dask) is lower than that of MapReduce (e.g.
    Spark) with some additional restrictions (Fu et al. 2020). Finally, current array-based
    processing services are mainly maintained by the open-source community (e.g. Pangeo),
    restricting the available computational resources. 4.3 RSBD platforms The RSBD
    platform is the best practice for RSBD applications. Any RSBD storage or computing
    systems cannot work individually. Instead, RSBD computing should work closely
    with storage systems, and platforms should implement RSBD applications by integrating
    storage and computing. Figure 6 summarizes the five architectures of RSBD platforms
    as characterized by the data model. The four components from left to right are
    storage, the data model, processing, and output. Type 1 platforms parallelize
    the computation of scenes using simple batch processing and data-separable computing.
    The outcome of such platforms is delivered in the form of scenes. In terms of
    architecture, Type 1 platforms are composed of two parts, the data storage system
    and simple batch processing system. The data storage system is responsible for
    providing data services to the processing system, and the simple batch processing
    system manages the analysis algorithms and maintains execution tasks. Such platforms
    were widely used in early batch remote sensing data production and analysis (Li
    and Tang 2019; Giuliani et al. 2017). For example, the European Space Agency''s
    G-POD project pre-populates many algorithms for remote sensing scenes and data
    and offers batch processing services. Type 2 platforms are the mainstream technology
    route adopted for large-scale remote sensing analysis and computation. They consist
    of three main parts: the data storage system, data cube production system, and
    simple batch processing system. Type 2 platforms are similar to Type 1 platforms
    in that they support data-separable computing. In contrast, this type of platform
    processes the data into data cubes as the input and then outputs data cube datasets.
    For example, JEODPP divides the computational tasks of the data cube into independent
    subtasks and then uses HTCondor to implement multi-task batch processing (Soille
    et al. 2018; Corbane et al. 2017). Type 3 platforms adopt MapReduce processing
    and support data-inseparable computing. For example, the ScienceEarth platform
    has been used to process remote sensing data as a data cube with the implementation
    of large-scale remote sensing analysis using Spark (Xu et al. 2022; Xu et al.
    2020). Though MapReduce is powerful, it is not friendly to remote sensing researchers.
    Users must deal with detailed configuration issues in parallel computing by themselves,
    which prevents the widespread use of MapReduce in RSBD applications. Therefore,
    such platforms have a high difficulty threshold for their implementation and use.
    Type 4 platforms use array-based processing as the data processing system and
    support data-inseparable computing. Such platforms consist of three parts, including
    the data storage system, data cube production system, and array-based processing
    system. To be specific, the data cube production system is responsible for processing
    remote sensing scene data into array-like data types (e.g. data cubes and composite
    layers). The array-based processing system pre-defines many high-level APIs for
    the analysis of large arrays. Type 5 platforms use array DBMSs as the core component
    and support data-inseparable computing. An array DBMS can store and manage massive
    remote sensing data with distributed systems. More importantly, it can internally
    implement array-based processing. Therefore, an array DBMS can independently construct
    an RSBD platform. For example, Kuo et al. ( 2018) built an RSBD platform based
    on SciDB, which supported shared-memory parallelization (SMP) and distributed
    memory parallelization (DMP). However, only simple array processing is supported
    by current array DBMS technology. Therefore, other computing systems are needed
    in most cases to achieve the complex analysis and computation of remote sensing
    data (Pagani and Trani 2018). Figure 6. Five architectures of RSBD platforms.
    Display full size In addition to the five types of platforms, some studies further
    package the technologies on top of existing RSBD platforms. For example, BACI
    offers web-based services based on Google Earth Engine (Poortinga et al. 2018).
    OpenEO proposes a unified API for data management as well as the computational
    resources of different platforms (Schramm et al. 2021). OpenEO accesses data and
    services in virtual data cubes, allowing for deeper comparisons between compatible
    Earth observation cloud services rather than accessing them directly. This section
    identifies four significant cloud-based processing technologies and provides insights
    into data-separable and data-inseparable computing for RSBD. In addition, we summarize
    the five major architectures of current RSBD platforms in terms of their data
    models, data storage, and type of processing. As shown in Table 5, we summarize
    the representative platforms according to their technology routes. The conclusions
    are provided below. Simple batch processing has been widely applied in RSBD applications,
    especially in data-separable computing, while data-inseparable computing is becoming
    a popular topic in RSBD. Data-inseparable computing can be implemented using MapReduce
    or array-based processing. Although current array-based processing is in its infancy,
    this promising technology may lead to the next generation of remote sensing processing.
    There are five principal types of RSBD platforms. Type 1 and Type 2 architectures
    can only handle the most basic data-inseparable computing. Type 3 platforms have
    the best scalability for various algorithms but have a specific use threshold
    for computer technologies. Type 4 platforms are the most advanced implementation
    at present. However, Type 4 platforms require high construction costs and pose
    significant technical challenges. Type 5 platforms have reasonable prospects but
    are restricted by the development of array DBMSs. Regardless of the type of RSBD
    platform, no single platform can comprehensively handle all diversified RSBD applications
    (Ni et al. 2021; Xie and Lark 2021; Chen et al. 2021). Under these circumstances,
    multiple platforms should be jointly leveraged. Thus, data must be transported
    between platforms (Lu and Wang 2021; Arvor et al. 2021; Brombacher et al. 2020),
    and a standard RSBD data model is necessary. Data cubes are a promising approach
    for meeting this standard. Table 5. Summary of the RSBD platforms (DC = Data Cube
    CL = Composite Layer). Download CSVDisplay Table 5. Conclusion The joint promotion
    of space technology, remote sensing science and technology, and computer technology
    has enabled humans to enter a new era of Remote Sensing Big Data (RSBD). RSBD
    is the best means to realize global remote sensing analysis and will become the
    backbone of Big Earth Data, making additional contributions to sustainable human
    development (Guo et al. 2017; Guo et al. 2021). This research introduces state-of-the-art
    technologies and research trends concerning RSBD storage and computing. In addition,
    this study provides a preliminary glance over the basic issues of RSBD for computing
    experts and remote sensing researchers, especially those who tend to work with
    large-scale remote sensing research and applications. We would like to arouse
    the reader’s interest in RSBD through this research. However, RSBD is a broad
    topic, and we could not thoroughly review it from a comprehensive perspective.
    Therefore, some issues (e.g. open data, data security, confidentiality, visualization,
    etc.) are not mentioned. Additionally, despite our extensive literature references,
    there are inevitably controversial representations and claims in the manuscript.
    Remote sensing data mainly consists of raster data and metadata. Many studies
    have already accumulated valuable research for RSBD storage. The storage technology
    for RSBD has achieved satisfactory results for moving data from a single machine
    to clusters and from the local environment to the cloud. Among them, cloud-based
    optimized remote sensing data storage technology and cloud storage technology
    represented by OSS, NewSQL, and NoSQL will become mainstream technical solutions
    for RSBD storage and management. Data homogeneity is necessary for large-scale
    analysis. In this regard, the current RSBD technology mainly adopts four data
    models with different homogeneity characteristics; these include scenes, ARD,
    data cubes, and composite layers. The data cube has good compatibility with cloud
    computing and can provide RSBD analysis through homogeneous multi-dimensional
    remote sensing data. We suspect that this data model will become the mainstream
    RSBD data model in the future. According to the computational paradigm, RSBD computing
    can be divided into data-separable and data-inseparable computing. Data-separable
    computing has better parallelism and remains the computation type in most RSBD
    analyses. On the other hand, data-inseparable computing is the current hot topic.
    There are three mainstream cloud-based big data technologies for remote sensing
    data analysis: simple batch processing, MapReduce processing, and array-based
    processing. Simple batch processing has been widely used. The MapReduce-based
    parallel computing paradigm can be applied to more complex remote sensing analysis
    applications. Moreover, array-based processing provides an easy-to-use and promising
    technical tool for remote sensing scientists. In this review, the five types of
    RSBD platform architectures were summarized. Type 4 has the most advanced architecture,
    which adopts the data cube model and array-based processing. The multidisciplinary
    methodologies of RSBD are growing rapidly, and RSBD platforms have already played
    important roles in various fields. However, in the future, the integration of
    satellite, airborne, ground-based, geospatial, and even socioeconomic data is
    needed to produce more effective solutions to real-world problems, which will
    face additional challenges. Novel real-time data processing paradigms, artificial
    intelligence algorithms, and innovative tools are expected to be assembled into
    RSBD platforms to extract more desired information from remote sensing data. The
    emergence of Federated Learning, a novel distributed processing paradigm, guarantees
    data security during training and RSBD analysis. In addition, recent advancements
    in deep learning models provide a promising approach for RSBD interpretation over
    large scales. GPU-accelerated RSBD platforms are an ideal host for neural network
    architectures and open datasets. The high-quality information extracted at a global
    scale will provide a new impetus for improving RSBD methodologies and platforms
    in remote sensing. In addition, the information will aid the scientific community
    in assessing global disaster risk, monitoring climate change, and addressing the
    United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Disclosure statement No potential

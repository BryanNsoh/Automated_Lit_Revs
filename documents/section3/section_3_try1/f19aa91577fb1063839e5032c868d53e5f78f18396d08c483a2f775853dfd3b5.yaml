    protocols have undergone significant developments and adaptations to cater for
    unique communication needs within the IoT paradigm. However, meeting these requirements
    in the context of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications becomes a multidimensional
    problem due to factors like high mobility, intermittent connectivity, rapidly
    changing topologies, and an increased number of nodes. Thus, examining these protocols
    based on their characteristics and comparative analyses from the literature has
    shown that there is still room for improvement, particularly in ensuring efficiency
    in V2I interactions. This study aims to investigate the most viable network protocols
    for V2I communications, focusing on ensuring data quality (DQ) across the first
    three layers of the IoT protocol stack. This presents an improved understanding
    of the performance of network protocols in V2I communication. The findings of
    this paper showed that although each protocol offers unique strengths when evaluated
    against the identified dimensions of DQ, a cross-layer protocol fusion may be
    necessary to meet specific DQ dimensions. With the complexities and specific demands
    of V2I communications, it’s clear that no single protocol from our tri-layered
    perspective can solely fulfil all IP-based communication requirements given that
    the V2I communication landscape is teeming with heterogeneity, where a mixture
    of protocols is required to address unique communication demands. Keywords: data
    quality; IoT protocols; IP communication; V2I 1. Introduction Smart cities have
    continued to grow worldwide, giving rise to various innovations such as smart
    agriculture, smart buildings, smart health, and smart transportation. At the core
    of this growth is the Internet of Things (IoT) [1,2,3]. The shift to ubiquitous
    computing has led to the interconnection of smart and embedded devices, resulting
    in the generation of substantial amounts of data, aka “big data” [4]. The continuous
    increase in IoT-generated data underscores the critical importance of data quality
    (DQ) [5]. The success of this IoT paradigm shift relies heavily on DQ guarantees
    [6]. However, ensuring DQ under the current big data collection and transmission
    methods of IoT networks becomes a challenge for various applications. The multifaceted
    nature of big data, characterised by the five Vs, volume, velocity, variety, veracity,
    and value, are some of the constraints faced in ensuring data quality [7]. These
    complexities demand the adoption of meticulous data quality management methodologies
    encompassing comprehensive validation, cleaning, and integration techniques for
    big data applications in various smart city segments. DQ is essential across various
    domains of smart cities, including the cooperative intelligent transportation
    system (C-ITS), which is defined by its interactive components, facilitating various
    communications crucial for its operation. These components include communication
    between Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), Vehicle-to-Network
    (V2N) and Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P). The integration of communication technologies
    into transportation has ushered in a transformative transference from autonomous
    systems to cooperative ones, which is an integral aspect of smart cities requiring
    high DQ for efficiency and effectiveness. Communications between these components
    of C-ITS are reliant on several protocols to transmit data between nodes, and
    hence, the need to ensure DQ within each of the protocols is paramount. Over the
    past three decades, network protocols have defined and maintained principles of
    data communications and provided foundational protection for data transmission
    [8]. With the emergence of IoT, network protocols have experienced an evolution
    due to the dynamic and constrained nature of IoT devices and networks. Such characteristics
    pose a major challenge, as identified by Shang et al. [9], in integrating the
    existing Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) [10] in IoT
    networks. Despite these challenges, IoT supports interoperability with the TCP/IP
    protocol stack, which, however, faces some drawbacks such as throughput, link
    delay, and energy consumption—are metrics that the current TCP/IP protocol stack
    struggles to meet in IoT applications. Furthermore, without optimisation, the
    TCP/IP protocol stack is inadequate for IoT communications within the cloud and
    distributed computing services [11]. To mitigate these challenges, suitable and
    lightweight IoT protocols have been revealed in the literature as fixable alternatives
    for constrained devices [12]. These advancements have led to the application of
    IoT in transportation to increase road safety and enhance cooperative driving
    and traffic management [13]. However, vehicular communications must be precise,
    which requires advanced embedded DQ measures to achieve efficiency, safety, and
    sustainability. Some protocols in the TCP/IP protocol stack do not meet specific
    criteria, such as ensuring the dimensions of DQ for vehicular communications.
    For example, certain protocols lack agility, while others are unreliable or vulnerable
    to cyber-attacks, which impedes the accurate flow of data in vehicular communications.
    Vehicular communication networks are still an active area of research [14,15],
    although several technologies have emerged to support C-ITS. V2I, specifically,
    is an integral part of vehicular communication technologies that promises to optimise
    the efficiency of transportation systems. V2I communications span a wide range
    of applications, including safety and non-safety related. V2I safety applications
    include collision warning, emergency vehicle priority, driver assistance and road
    hazards warming, and speed and intersection warning messages, all aimed at preventing
    road crashes and enhancing mobility [16]. Meanwhile, non-safety applications focus
    on traffic efficiency and optimisation, remote vehicle diagnostics, air pollution
    monitoring and onboard infotainment [17]. These diverse arrays of applications
    stem from various components, technologies and data types involved in the interconnected
    V2I ecosystems. These applications are facilitated using Dedicated Short Range
    Communication (DSRC) [18] and Cellular-Vehicle-to-Everything C-V2X technologies
    [19]. The DSRC and C-V2X technologies establish a communication link between Onboard
    Units (OBU) and Roadside Units (RSU) [20]. An OBU, which is mounted on vehicles,
    allows communication with other OBUs and RUSs [21]. RSUs are part of the infrastructure
    which are strategically positioned along road networks to serve as communication
    nodes or access points for exchanging vital information with trusted authorities
    for traffic management [22]. Collectively, this ecosystem exchanges data for time-critical,
    urban planning, and infotainment use cases with the aim of revolutionising and
    redefining road transportation to improve road safety, comfort, and efficiency.
    Figure 1 shows the V2I communications landscape. Figure 1. Heterogeneous V2I communications.
    The success of the V2I communications ecosystem hinges heavily on the quality
    of data being exchanged and, hence, the importance of assuring DQ in V2I interactions.
    Vehicular communication has a plethora of use cases, and some of these use cases
    have a unique and customised protocol stack. Some use cases in V2I communications
    are time-sensitive or time-critical. Delayed or incomplete data can result in
    vehicles receiving inaccurate information, potentially leading to catastrophic
    outcomes. Therefore, ensuring DQ in V2I communication scenarios is of paramount
    importance. This research aims to investigate the most viable IoT protocols for
    V2I communications, ensuring DQ across the application, transport, and Internet
    layers. This research makes the following contributions: Presents an unconventional
    viewpoint on the IoT protocol stack, underscoring the drawbacks of depending solely
    on a single protocol/layered approach for ensuring reliable data transmission
    within IoT applications. Provides a support framework with a focus on DQ for identifying
    and selecting suitable IoT protocol stack for a specific use case requiring efficient
    data transmission within the V2I ecosystem and IoT applications in general. Presents
    a structured way of organising and customising the IoT protocol stack, making
    it easier to pinpoint areas for adaptation and optimisation. The rest of the paper
    is structured as follows. Section 2 presents a summary of data quality and related
    dimensions. An overview of network protocols is presented in Section 3. Section
    4 presents a survey of the IoT protocol stack. Section 5 presents the research
    methodology. Section 6 presents findings and discussion. The conclusion is presented
    in Section 7. 2. Data Quality and Related Dimensions There is no universally established
    definition for DQ since the concept is subjective to the user, the domain, and
    the context of the use case [23]. Thus, providing DQ continues to pose a challenge
    for developing and deploying the various components of smart cities [24,25,26].
    Due to constant changes in big data characteristics [7,27,28], the demand for
    DQ continues to change. In the context of C-ITS, we define DQ dimensions as data
    characteristics that assess the suitability of data for a specific use case. 2.1.
    Accuracy We define accuracy as the precision and correctness of data while it
    is being transmitted from source to destination. The primary objective is to maintain
    the precision and integrity of data during transmission, preventing any loss,
    errors, or compromise. Localisation accuracy is an example of a use case to support
    automated driving systems [29]. Another use case example can be seen in a real-time
    map update using an MQTT network proposed by Szántó et al. [30] to accurately
    support trajectory planning. 2.2. Availability Availability refers to the continuous
    and uninterrupted data flow between systems or devices in real-time. It ensures
    that data remains readily available and immediately accessible after transmission,
    free of interruptions, delay, or loss. A typical use-case example within V2I is
    incident detection and reporting. As observed by Bhatti et al. [31], inefficient
    accident detection and reporting systems have resulted in an increase in the number
    of fatalities from auto crashes. The authors proposed an accident detection and
    reporting system (ADRS) using Wi-Fi or 3G/4G to transmit and report vehicle telemetry
    data from a crash site to an emergency response unit and a nearby hospital. 2.3.
    Completeness Completeness refers to the extent to which all relevant and necessary
    data elements are included and conveyed in data exchange. It guarantees that no
    critical information is lost on transmission, enabling a comprehensive comprehension
    of the transmitted data for effective use. Completeness is an important characteristic
    of DQ and one of the essential DQ dimensions. For data to be considered complete,
    it must meet the requirements of its intended application. Completeness impacts
    other DQ dimensions, including accuracy, consistency, and timeliness [32]. Kaneyasu
    et al. [33] proposed a transmission control mechanism that considers data completeness
    of large Spatial-temporal data. (STD). In their scheme, each node keeps accounts
    of received packet statuses and dispatches the information only when all packets
    have been accounted for, thereby minimising2 unnecessary transmission and optimising
    wireless bandwidth. STD combines geographical locations and timestamps to provide
    insights. It is worth noting that there is a plethora of applications in V2I interactions,
    ranging from traffic management applications to location-based services. 2.4.
    Confidentiality Confidentiality pertains to safeguarding privacy and preventing
    unauthorised access to sensitive data during transmission. It ensures that sensitive
    or private information remains protected and inaccessible to unauthorised entities.
    A secure and reliable routing approach for mobile networks was proposed by Bhalaji
    [34], using cryptography and the Euclidean Distance formula for confidentiality,
    reliability, and integrity in data transmission. 2.5. Consistency Refers to preserving
    coherence and uniformity of data throughout the data circle. It involves maintaining
    data integrity, a consistent format, meaning, and structure during transmission
    between sending and receiving nodes. Consistency is crucial for accurate interpretation
    and reliable utilisation by intended recipients. A beneficial use-case example
    in V2I is a beacon message broadcasting where homogeneity in broadcast messages
    is essential to relay important/emergency communications. As observed by Liu et
    al. [35], spatial consistency is fundamental in supporting the targeting and effective
    distribution of beacon messages to vehicles within the proximity of infrastructure
    elements, ensuring seamless communication in V2I scenarios. 2.6. Data Integrity
    Refers to the assurance that data remains unaltered, complete, and reliable throughout
    its transmission process. It ensures that data is not tampered with, modified,
    or corrupted during its exchange, maintaining its accuracy and trustworthiness.
    Integrity is measured using data conformity to defined protocols, information
    assurance principles, and standards [36]. Gopinath, Vinoth, and Jaya [37] proposed
    a protocol to support data integrity, using location integrity and multicasting
    to secure data transmission. 2.7. Reliability Pertains to the dependability and
    consistency of data in transmission. It focuses on ensuring that data is delivered
    accurately and consistently without loss, errors, or disruptions. Ensuring packet
    delivery reliability depends on multiple factors. The utilisation of a retransmission-based
    recovery mechanism and packet loss awareness leads to congestion and routing failure
    awareness protocols to guarantee packet reception [38]. These reliability-centric
    initiatives in protocol communications are pivotal in achieving accurate and effective
    data transmission, contributing to overall performance and reliability in V2I
    interactions and communication networks in general. 2.8. Timeliness Timeliness
    refers to the prompt and timely delivery of data within a specified time, ensuring
    its relevance and currency for the intended use. Timeliness underscores the significance
    of transmitting and receiving data within predefined time boundaries, catering
    to the demands of real-time or time-sensitive applications. Timeliness measures
    the currency of data. That is when data was generated and arrived at the destination
    [39]. The timeliness dimension has received a lot of attention in IoT protocol
    research and is one of the most important dimensions in V2I interactions to facilitate
    communications for various use cases, such as emergency warning messages, pedestrian
    safety messages and traffic signal pre-emption, which are safety-critical V2I
    communications. 2.9. Traceability Traceability refers to accurately documenting
    and tracking the provenance of data from source to destination [40]. It involves
    capturing and maintaining a comprehensive audit that identifies data sources,
    including the entities that have accessed or modified the data and the timestamps
    of these activities. Integrating traceability in a system will offer better security
    management, safety management, better response to crises, and overall strengthen
    the performance and coordination of the system [41]. The traceability dimension
    will benefit V2I use case examples like Pseudonym resolution [42,43]. 2.10. Validity
    Validity refers to the quality and trustworthiness of transmitted data. It ensures
    that data is legitimate, accurate, and conforms to predefined criteria, standards,
    or specifications. Various methods determine data validity, including accuracy,
    timeliness, and usability [44]. In addition, validity assesses the fitness of
    data for the desired purpose. 3. Overview of Network Protocols Technological advancements
    and evolution in various IoT applications have spurred the development of various
    lightweight protocols and adaptation of some of the existing TCP/IP protocol stack
    to improve communication in IoT networks [9]. Several studies have addressed shortcomings
    of the conventional TCP/IP protocol stack in fulfilling the fast-paced real-time
    data transmission requirements of vehicular communications [45,46]. In addition,
    the TCP/IP protocol stack was originally designed for best-effort delivery of
    packets across the internet and does not support a fine-grained Quality of Service
    (QoS) coveted in IoT networks. The TCP/IP protocol stack faces significant challenges
    in effectively interfacing with cloud computing and distributed computing services
    without adaptation [11], which is critical for managing the enormous amounts of
    data generated by vehicular networks. In contrast, IoT protocols have demonstrated
    exceptional performance in seamlessly integrating with cloud services and have
    demonstrated compatibility with heterogeneous protocols [47]. This section provides
    an overview of the existing structures of the TCP/IP protocol stack and the new
    IoT protocol stack, solely focusing on the application, transport, and Internet
    layers. The network access layer (Data Link and Physical layers) can operate efficiently
    irrespective of the underlying technologies deployed at the layers above [48].
    Figure 2 Shows the IoT protocol stack. Figure 2. IoT Protocol Stack. 3.1. Application
    Layer The application layer sits at the top of the communication protocol suite,
    irrespective of the prevailing network environment or conditions. It is an abstract
    layer that contains a combination of protocols to facilitate and define how applications
    communicate with others. In addition, these protocols specify how data is formatted,
    transmitted, and received. Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol
    (FTP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and Domain Name Server (DNS) are
    some of the most popular TCP/IP application protocols. Most TCP/IP application
    protocols operate on a client-server model, in which a client device sends a request
    to the server, and the server acknowledges and responds with the required information
    [49]. This method works well with a typical client-server architecture. Meanwhile,
    the demands for real-time communication in the IoT domain require more efficient
    application protocols. Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Extensible
    Messaging, Presence Protocol (XMPP), Data Distribution Service (DDS), and WebSocket
    have been developed and upscaled to address these fast-paced communications in
    IoT applications by providing publish-subscribe or request-reply communication
    architecture which can reduce latency and provide communication improvements in
    IoT systems [50]. Some of these IoT protocols support different QoS, ensuring
    that communication in the IoT environment receives the necessary performance level
    to meet operational requirements, including interoperability and scalability.
    3.1.1. Constrained Application Protocol CoAP is a lightweight protocol apt for
    the ever-increasing Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications in resource-constrained
    environments [51]. Supporting specific features suitable for V2I communication,
    this protocol implements a request-response architecture between application endpoints,
    which supports QoS that ensures reliable transmissions, simple congestion control,
    and flow control. In addition, CoAP underpins asynchronous message exchange and
    offers a built-in discovery of services and resources. Furthermore, the protocol
    implements an optional subscription mechanism for resource observation. The CoAP
    protocol operates a client-server model like TCP and relies on UDP as the underlying
    transport protocol, establishing a robust connection that ensures reliable communication
    even in dynamic and intermittent connected environments, such as those with high-speed
    connectivity and rapidly changing topologies. CoAP’s compatibility with mobility
    management [52] further enhances its capability to handle high mobility-related
    and handover challenges. Refer to Figure 3 for CoAP architecture. Figure 3. CoAP
    architecture. 3.1.2. The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport MQTT is a lightweight
    protocol designed and used in a plethora of IoT applications and M2M communications
    [53], utilising the publish/subscribe architecture, which is well-suitable for
    remote connections with limited network bandwidth and system resources. This model
    facilitates efficient data dissemination techniques. Its ability to process massive
    volumes of data concurrently while consuming little bandwidth becomes an asset
    in V2I communications, where real-time, widespread information sharing is critical.
    Furthermore, MQTT’s QoS levels ensure message delivery, which is critical in the
    context of traffic safety and infrastructure coordination. The protocol supports
    scalability, which aligns well with the requirements of the V2I environment that
    necessitates efficient and dynamic connectivity between a multitude of clients
    and a central broker. The broker plays an integral role in the MQTT network, effectively
    managing a catalogue of topics, e.g., traffic information and weather conditions,
    that function akin to communication channels. These topics facilitate the publishing
    and subscription of messages, thereby orchestrating the flow of information within
    the V2I domain. Specifically, when a client publishes a message on a given topic,
    the broker ensures this message reaches all clients subscribed to that specific
    topic. The multi-topic subscription capability of MQTT [54] provides clients with
    the advantage of receiving messages from diverse sources, enhancing the scope
    and versatility of information dissemination within the context of V2I. Refer
    to Figure 4 for MQTT architecture. Figure 4. MQTT architecture. 3.1.3. Data Distribution
    Service DDS protocol is a communication standard designed for messaging and data-centric
    exchange in distributed systems, and the protocol dynamically discovers a new
    node within a network architecture such as Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) and
    Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) [55]. DDS uses the publish-subscribe architecture,
    allowing publishers to disseminate data to multiple subscribers asynchronously
    and in a decoupled manner. DDS is characterised by its support for real-time and
    high-performance communication, achieved using a decentralised architecture with
    a focus on data-centric principles. In the context of V2I applications, supporting
    high data rates and low latency requirements, enabling a single node to subscribe
    and receive information from multiple sources bi-directionally, facilitating effective
    communication. In addition, DDS is a highly functional middleware that is suitable
    for a multitude of V2I communication that supports efficient distributed communication.
    This protocol’s inherent features, such as its reliable communication, scalability,
    interoperability, and flexible configuration of various QoS settings, make it
    a suitable option for V2I applications. Refer to Figure 5 for DDS architecture.
    Figure 5. DDS architecture. 3.1.4. Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
    XMPP is an XML-based protocol designed for real-time, extensible communications.
    Originally designed for communication on the internet with ample resources, XMPP
    has now found relevance in the field of IoT applications owing to its distinctive
    attributes [56]. The protocol’s decentralised architecture promotes heterogeneous
    and federated communication by facilitating seamless communication between servers
    and clients. XMPP also support the publish-subscribe communication model, facilitating
    the simultaneous broadcasting of messages to multiple nodes [57]. The extensibility
    and decentralised characteristics present distinct advantages in V2I communication,
    enabling the management of diverse communication services, including real-time
    traffic monitoring, as noted by Hayes and Omar [58]. XMPP could enable immediate
    communication of safety alerts or evacuation instructions from central control
    units to all vehicles in a specific geographic location. The flexibility of XMPP
    also supports the potential for future expansions or adaptations as the requirements
    of the V2I communication system evolve. Refer to Figure 6 for XMPP architecture.
    Figure 6. XMPP architecture. 3.1.5. Advanced Message Queuing Protocol AMQP is
    an open-standard application layer protocol designed and tailored to support communication
    in a distributed environment [59]. AMQP supports various messaging models such
    as point-to-point, publish-and-subscribe, and request-reply, providing flexibility
    in designing distributed systems and enabling effective message-based communication.
    The core feature of AMQP is the guaranteed delivery of messages with its store-and-forward
    feature that ensures reliability [60]. This utilitarian feature is paramount in
    a V2I communication environment where real-time messages are important for the
    successful operation of the entire system. Refer to Figure 7 for AMQP architecture.
    Figure 7. AMQP architecture. 3.1.6. HTTP REST Representational State Transfer
    (REST), often referred to as HTTP REST, is an architectural-style protocol widely
    employed in web development [61]. It adheres to the principle of statelessness,
    where every HTTP request includes all the essential information needed to comprehend
    and handle the request. REST employs GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods for various
    operations. This protocol is well suited for scenarios where a vehicle node periodically
    requests information from a server or sends occasional updates. Hireche, Dennai,
    and Kadri [62] present a GET method to disseminate and visualise real-time traffic
    data over REST vehicle web service. This architecture is characterised using clear
    client-server segregation, with the client handling the user interface and experience
    and the server managing data [63]. Refer to Figure 8 HTTP REST Architecture. Figure
    8. HTTP REST Architecture. 3.1.7. WebSocket Established by the Internet Engineering
    Task Force (IETF) in 2011, WebSocket facilitates continued full-duplex communication
    over a single TCP connection. Initially designed for web servers and web browsers,
    WebSocket has gained increasing popularity in IoT applications [64,65]. Contrasting
    HTTP’s request-response model, WebSocket supports both the request-respond and
    publish-subscribe model using real-time data transfer, thus enabling servers to
    provide continuous updates to clients via an ongoing WebSocket connection. This
    dynamic capability is particularly important in IoT applications and is integral
    for V2I applications requiring sustained data exchange for real-time analytics
    and decisions. The real-time data transfer capability of WebSocket is particularly
    valuable in V2I use cases requiring bi-directional communications and interaction
    between vehicles and infrastructural elements like roadside units or traffic control
    centres [66]. For instance, WebSocket is suitable for facilitating instantaneous
    relay of traffic light status to oncoming vehicles, enabling them to adjust their
    speed or plan alternate routes, thereby improving traffic efficiency and safety.
    Refer to Figure 9a for publish and subscribe architecture, Figure 9b for request
    and respond architecture, and Table 1 for the characteristics of application layer
    protocols. Figure 9. (a) WebSocket Req/Res Architecture, (b) WebSocket pub/Sub
    Architecture. Table 1. Characteristics of application layer protocols. 3.2. Transport
    Layer The Transport Layer plays a crucial role in ensuring the successful delivery
    of data packets to the destination. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and
    User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are the two traditional transport protocols. TCP
    is a reliable, connection-oriented protocol that guarantees the delivery of data
    packets to the intended destination. It is a heavyweight protocol with high packet
    overhead. Conversely, UDP is a connectionless protocol that lacks reliability
    in data transmission. While UDP does not provide guaranteed packet delivery, it
    is known for its speed and is used for applications that can tolerate packet loss
    during transmission. With the introduction of innovative transport protocols like
    SCTP [67], DCCP [68], and QUIC [69], the transport layer has attracted significant
    research interest. Additionally, there have been efforts focused on the performance
    optimisation of traditional transport protocols [70] as well as congestion and
    error control [71]. The development of new protocols and upscaling of the traditional
    transport layer protocols are crucial in enabling reliable and efficient communication
    in the rapidly evolving IoT paradigm. 3.2.1. Datagram Congestion Control Protocol
    In 2006, DCCP [68] was standardised by IETF to support applications that require
    timely delivery of data packets, an inherent feature of UDP, also benefiting from
    the congestion control mechanisms of TCP. DCCP aims to reduce network congestion
    while enabling speedy data transfer between nodes. It achieves this by offering
    an unreliable flow of datagrams with congestion control mechanisms in place. DCCP
    is specifically designed to cater to applications like streaming media, online
    multiplayer games, and Voice over IP (VoIP) services. These applications can tolerate
    certain data loss but are sensitive to delays, making them suitable for application
    in IoT communication. 3.2.2. Steam Control Transmission Protocol SCTP was initially
    designed for VoIP and telephony services and standardised in 2007; SCTP is a transport
    layer protocol developed to address limitations inherent in TCP and UDP [72].
    It is distinguished by its multi-streaming and multi-homing capabilities, along
    with the capability to support multiple IP addresses per association. Consequently,
    these unique facets have propelled the expansion of SCTP into a wider array of
    applications, augmenting its significance and relevance in the IoT communication
    landscapes [73]. 3.2.3. Quick UDP Internet Connection The QUIC protocol was developed
    by Google in 2013 specifically to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of
    web applications [74]. QUIC is a purpose-built protocol that prioritises low-latency
    and secure data transfer across a network. It achieves this objective by leveraging
    UDP as its underlying transport protocol and features similar techniques, such
    as connectionless communication and header compression. QUIC integrates various
    functionalities, including encryption, multiplexing, and connection migration,
    to enhance the efficiency, reliability, and security of data transfer. Its effectiveness
    in reducing latency and enhancing the overall user experience has garnered significant
    attention, especially in applications that necessitate real-time communication
    and low-latency transmission. In addition, QUIC boasts advanced congestion control
    mechanisms and rapid packet loss recovery techniques, contributing to optimised
    network performance [75]. These unique functionalities maintain and preserve connection
    continuity during hand-off, making the protocol particularly desirable in the
    V2I communication landscape. 3.3. Internet Layer The Internet layer, often referred
    to as the network layer, plays a pivotal role in the TCP/IP protocol stack. The
    Internet Protocol (IP) holds paramount significance at this layer. The layer’s
    fundamental role entails facilitating the transmission and reception of data packets
    across interconnected networks, encompassing tasks such as packet forwarding,
    logical addressing, routing and error handling. Unlike connection-oriented protocols,
    the IP protocol operates in a connectionless manner, foregoing the use of acknowledgements
    or connection establishment. These responsibilities are delegated to the protocols
    situated above and below its layer. Consequently, the IP protocol is sometimes
    perceived as lacking reliability on its own [48]. Nevertheless, the IP protocol
    remains indispensable in today’s communication landscape, particularly considering
    the proliferation of networked devices. The surge in Internet connectivity and
    IoT deployments has impacted the availability of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)
    addressing schemes. As a result, IPv4 has exhausted its available addresses for
    internet nodes. To mitigate this issue, the IETF has introduced a new version,
    Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) [76]. In addition to the introduction of IPv6
    as a solution for addressing the shortage, several protocols have been developed
    to support efficient communication in constrained networks. IPv6 over Low-Power
    Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LowPAN), Routing Protocol for Low-Power, and
    Lossy Networks (RPL) are notable protocols in IoT’s Internet layer to support
    efficient transmission and routing in a resource-constrained environment, respectively.
    3.3.1. Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks 6LowPAN is an IETF standard facilitating
    the integration of low-power devices into the IoT communication paradigm by transmitting
    IPv6 packets over low-power wireless networks [77]. Providing support to address
    the challenges posed by resource-constrained devices by employing efficient packet
    and header compression techniques, effectively reducing overhead [78]. In addition,
    IPv6 incorporates adaptation and fragmentation mechanisms to handle packet loss
    and variable link quality in low-power nodes. By optimising data transmission
    and network efficiency, 6LowPAN facilitates the seamless integration of IoT devices
    with limited resources into the larger IPv6-based network infrastructures. 6LowPan
    is easily adaptable to an increase in the number of nodes in a network, making
    it a suitable, easy choice for V2I communications. 3.3.2. Routing Protocol for
    Low-Power and Lossy Networks RPL is a distance-vector routing protocol designed
    specifically for low-power and lossy networks (LLNs) to support efficient packet
    routing and reliable paths from source to destination. It is one of the initiatives
    observed by the IETF to solve the unique communication needs of LLNs. These networks
    have a unique set of characteristics, including a limited power supply (often
    battery-powered), high loss rates, low data rates, and a large number of devices.
    [79,80]. LLNs are typically used in sensor networks, smart transportation, smart
    grid, home and building automation, industrial monitoring, and a host IoT application.
    4. Survey of Network Protocols The computing limitations of IoT devices have received
    extensive attention from academia and industry. These efforts have resulted in
    the development of several lightweight protocols to compensate for the constrained
    nature of IoT devices [81]. As a result, several application layer protocols have
    been developed to support communication in IoT networks, each with a unique and
    problem-specific communication solution. Various studies have employed a range
    of methodologies, including experiments [82,83], simulations [84], and testbed
    implementation [85], to compare the performance of various protocols. These evaluations
    used several performance metrics such as bandwidth consumption, efficiency, energy
    consumption, latency, reliability, Round Trip Time (RTT), upload and download
    time, average response time, and throughput. With these metrics, more emphasis
    has been placed on investigating timeliness in the IoT application layer. Mijovic,
    Shehu, and Buratti [81] performed an experiment by comparing the performance of
    three application layer protocols, CoAP, WebSocket, and MQTT, using different
    Internet connections. Protocol efficiency and RTT were the measured metrics. Their
    experiment showed that CoAP achieved the highest protocol efficiency and the lowest
    average RTT, closely followed by WebSocket. The performance of MQTT depended on
    QoS profiles. QoS1 generally achieved better RTT. Another set of comparisons was
    conducted via an experiment by Tandale, Momin, and Seetharam [82]. They measured
    the performance metrics of CoAP, MQTT, and REST HTTP using time and bandwidth
    consumption on a 4G cellular network with a speed of 6 Mbps and an Internet broadband
    connection with a speed of 50 Mbps. Their results showed that CoAP is faster among
    the protocols when transmitting payloads less than 10 kb. MQTT and CoAP outperformed
    REST HTTP when sending smaller payloads. With larger payloads, REST HTTP became
    the faster protocol. Additionally, the experiment showed bandwidth consumption
    is equally reduced in CoAP and MQTT when transmitting smaller payloads. With an
    increase in Payloads, REST HTTP consumed less bandwidth. Assessing these protocols
    over a 4G cellular network is favourable for CoAP and MQTT in V2I communications
    use cases requiring the broadcast of smaller payloads. In Babovic, Protic, and
    Milutinovic [86], the transmission latency and throughput of various sensor data
    sizes and formats were studied using AMQP, DDS, MQTT, and XMPP over the web with
    MQTT outperforming the other protocols in latency. Another experiment was observed
    by Kayal and Perros [87]; their study measured and compared the RTT for different
    loads using CoAP, MQTT, XMPP and WebSocket. CoAP and MQTT showed better response
    times. In another study, Ghotbou and Khansari [88] performed an analytical comparison
    between AMQP, CoAP, DDS, MQTT, MQTT-SN, XMPP, WebSocket, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2.0, and
    RTP to investigate the most suitable IoT protocol for video transmission over
    LLN. Their comparative analysis showed that CoAP is the most appropriate protocol
    for video transmission due to its associated transport protocol (i.e., UDP), which
    supports best-effort packet delivery. A comparison between CoAP, MQTT, XMPP, and
    AMQP was observed by Sharma and Gondhi [12]; their study revealed that CoAP, AMQP,
    and XMPP ensure reliability by some built-in features. In addition, AMQP and XMPP
    both benefit from the reliability provided by their associated transport protocols,
    e.g., TCP. On the other hand, reliability is provided using the various QoS in
    MQTT. Their research further showed that CoAP, MQTT, and XMPP all support real-time
    communication, while AMQP does not. + A study by Chaudhary, Peddoju, and Kadarla
    [89] compared the performance of AMQP, MQTT, and CoAP and found that MQTT exhibited
    high packet overhead, especially in 3G networks due to QoS requirements. At high
    message volumes, MQTT delivered superior throughput, while CoAP and MQTT (QoS
    1 and 2) maximised bandwidth usage. Furthermore, Gupta [90] conducted a comparative
    study of CoAP, MQTT, WebSocket, XMPP and AMQP to ascertain the most reliable protocol
    using better power usage and latency. CoAP and MQTT performed better when transmitting
    smaller messages, while AMQP and MQTT are in the pole position for QoS reliability,
    and XMPP and AMQP lead in security. Al-Qassab and Aal-Nouman [91] conducted a
    simulation study to compare the most power-efficient protocol for wireless sensor
    networks using CoAP and MQTT-SN. The results showed that CoAP consumed less power.
    Timeliness and reliability have also received much research attention at the application
    layer. While V2I will certainly benefit from this research, more effort is required
    to investigate other factors like security. In the transport layer, TCP and UDP
    are the most prevalent protocols; their limitation in the IoT paradigm has brought
    about the introduction of QUIC, SCTP, and DCCP as promising alternatives. These
    protocols offer improvements in ACK, connection management, and cryptographic
    integration. QUIC shows potential with flexible deployment and promising performance
    [92]. AL-Dhief et al. [93] conducted a study comparing the performance of TCP
    and UDP under varying conditions using simulations to analyse two scenarios: varying
    bandwidth with a fixed packet size and varying packet size with a fixed bandwidth.
    The key metrics used for performance evaluation included end-to-end delay, throughput,
    packet delivery ratio, and packet loss ratio. Their findings indicated that TCP
    consistently outperforms UDP across all metrics in both scenarios, thereby demonstrating
    its greater reliability. Similarly, Wheeb [94] conducted an in-depth comparative
    study of the performance of transport protocols, including UDP, DCCP, SCTP, and
    TFRC (TCP-Friendly rate control), within a wired network environment. Their findings
    indicated that SCTP generally outperformed its counterparts in terms of throughput.
    However, for video streaming, TFRC demonstrated superior performance. This edge
    is attributed to its association with the UDP transport, which provides a TCP-style
    congestion control solution suitable for multimedia and interactive applications
    that demand low-latency and consistent data delivery. Furthermore, DCCP was found
    to have the least end-to-end delay in data traffic transmissions, whereas UDP
    exhibited better performance in video streaming scenarios. The evidence from this
    study suggested that for high throughput and reliable transport requirements,
    SCTP and TFRC could be the optimal choices. In another study, Sahraoui et al.
    [95] conducted a simulation to compare the performance of TCP and UDP for video
    streaming in VANET, examining metrics like throughput, packet delivery ratio,
    end-to-end delay, and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Their results showed
    that UDP offers superior throughput and lower end-to-end delay in comparison to
    TCP due to the absence of congestion control, making it potentially beneficial
    for real-time video streaming despite its relative unreliability. However, TCP’s
    retransmission technique results in a slightly better packet delivery ratio. Park
    and Koh [96] compared the performance of SCTP and TCP using throughput, traffic
    competition, and multi-homing. Their results showed that TCP outperforms SCTP
    with small data sizes, but SCTP surpasses TCP with larger sizes. Both protocols
    compete fairly in traffic handling, and SCTP’s multi-homing offers faster data
    transmission and better throughput compared to its single-homing. Performance
    comparison of modified QUIC (ModQUIC), QUIC, and TCP was carried out by Kharat
    and Kulkarni [97], and ModQUIC produced superior performance both in throughput,
    delay, and loss rate, demonstrating better network performance overall, particularly
    with maximised bandwidth utilisation. In addition, ModQUIC and QUIC outperformed
    TCP in packet loss rate, even in lossy links. Patel, Chatbar, and Shah [98] highlighted
    the performance factors of IPv4 and IPv6. Address space, throughput, security,
    and jitter values were examined, highlighting the advantages of IPv6 over IPv4,
    including efficient routing, simplified configuration, built-in IPsec security,
    and support for new services and mobility. In another study, Sandur and Giri [99]
    compared the performance of 6LoWPAN-CoAP and RPL-CoAP, evaluating average latency
    and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). Both protocols saw improved PDR, but RPL-CoAP
    outperformed 6LoWPAN-CoAP in latency. In a similar study, Mahmud et al. [100]
    investigated the pairing of RPL-CoAP and 6LoWPAN-CoAP protocols. Their study showed
    that RPL-CoAP surpassed the 6LoWPAN-CoAP combination in received packets, suggesting
    that the former is a superior option for efficient IoT communication. Table 2
    shows a comparative analysis of IoT protocol from the application, transport,
    and Internet layer in the literature, highlighting performance metrics and the
    best-performing protocols from the analysis. Table 2. Performance evaluation of
    network protocol. 5. Methodology Significant advancements have been made in the
    field of IoT networking concepts due to the extensive array of applications and
    use cases; IoT networking protocols have evolved into a vibrant research area
    influenced by their diverse characteristics [101]. Consequently, considerable
    studies have been dedicated to evaluating and comparing the effectiveness of various
    IoT and related protocols. This study has adopted a simple but effective methodology
    by conducting a literature survey to carefully select publications related to
    networking protocols for constrained devices. To gather pertinent literature within
    this study domain, our literature screening and selection were focused on protocols
    at the application, transport, and Internet layers of the IoT protocol suite.
    The selection process prioritised publications that directly compared the performance
    of different protocols, as these studies provide valuable insights into the strengths
    and weaknesses of each protocol. Additionally, publications that examined the
    fundamental functions and design purposes of the protocols were included in the
    survey. DQ is integral to the success and broad adoption of the IoT paradigm [6].
    Recognising this paramount importance, the second phase of this study focuses
    on identifying the protocols capable of satisfying our study-specific DQ dimensions.
    This was achieved by performing an exhaustive evaluation and analysis of the performances
    of each of the selected protocols [102]. In following this course, we hoped to
    distil the sets of protocols that not only meet but optimally satisfy our study-specific
    DQ dimensions for V2I applications and use cases. To achieve this, we conducted
    a mapping exercise, linking each of the protocols’ design objectives, performance
    evaluations and inherent characteristics to our study-specific DQ dimensions.
    This crucial step was carried out to assess the strengths, suitability, and limitations
    of the protocols and to establish a clear correlation between the capabilities
    of each protocol and their potential to fulfil the communication requirements
    in IP-based V2I interactions, thereby laying the groundwork for a use-case -driving
    approach in V2I. 6. Findings and Discussion 6.1. Mapping Each protocol within
    the protocol suite plays a specific and pivotal role in the overall network performance,
    with combined responsibilities ranging from formatting, managing, routing, forwarding,
    and receiving data packets between nodes. Ensuring communication efficiency in
    a multifaceted V2I communication landscape requires each protocol to perform optimally
    to ensure reliable data transmission across diverse use cases, e.g., beacon message
    broadcasting [103]. It’s imperative to understand the most suitable protocols
    for V2I communications within the context of DQ. In achieving this, mapping the
    protocols to our identified DQ dimensions is essential in identifying: 1. The
    most suitable protocols to deploy in specific use cases. 2. Providing a structured
    way to effectively manage the layered suite to achieve efficiency in data transmission,
    and 3. Making it easier to pinpoint areas for optimisation which leads to an operational
    improvement in the overall performance of the network. This mapping can act as
    a blueprint to support network engineers and managers working on V2I systems in
    deploying IoT devices within traffic infrastructures, providing a useful guide
    in selecting the most suitable protocols based on their identified DQ requirements
    inherent in their specific V2I use-case, such as traffic light managements requiring
    XMPP protocol to communicate traffic light information to upcoming traffic simultaneously,
    the application of MQTT to timely update the availability of parking space in
    a smart parking scenario, the use WebSocket to continually communicate real-time
    traffic information and the use of SCTP to support vehicle infotainments by reliable
    streaming multimedia data. In addition, software developers can also leverage
    this mapping when designing IoT applications, as observed in [104], providing
    them with a detailed understanding of how different protocols may impact their
    application’s performance. Another useful application is that this research can
    provide a support framework for policy formation and standardisation when setting
    guidelines for IoT protocol development and deployments, ensuring that protocols
    are optimised for the IoT paradigm’s diverse and evolving communication demands.
    In a broader sense, this research can stimulate networking communication innovations
    to support V2I communication ecosystems by providing a clear understanding of
    the strengths and weaknesses of various IoT protocols, which could lead to more
    robust and efficient V2I systems, enhancing safety, improving traffic management,
    and ultimately paving the way for fully autonomous driving systems. Refer to Table
    3 for the mapping of DQ dimensions against the various protocols. Table 3. Dimensions
    of DQ against IoT protocols. 6.2. Data Quality Acting as a Complement of Quality
    of Service It is worth noting that this mapping has shown an overlap between DQ
    and QoS with a shared objective of enhancing the performance of networked applications
    and services. These two concepts have shared attributes such as accuracy, availability,
    completeness, reliability, and timeliness [105]. QoS focuses on managing network
    traffic efficiency, resource allocation, and error handling to satisfy expected
    performance for various applications and use cases. Most Application layer protocols
    investigated in this study support QoS with the exception of HTTP REST, XMPP,
    and WebSocket, while at the Transport layer, TCP and SCTP support QoS, and the
    Internet layer supports QoS mechanism by default with the help of Ipv6. However,
    while QoS levels supported at these layers may be sufficient for specific IoT
    applications and use cases, the existing QoS levels and specific configurations
    need further investigation to satisfy the communication standards required in
    some V2I use cases. The focal point of DQ, on the other hand, is “content suitability”,
    which encompasses the assurance that data transmitted via various protocols aligns
    with the expected standards necessary for reliable decision-making processes and
    applications. Within the context of data transmission in IP-based communication
    using the IoT protocol stack, the intersection of QoS and DQ is evident, as mentioned
    earlier. QoS mechanisms available in various layers of the IoT protocol stack,
    depending on the type of protocol deployed, play a pivotal role in maintaining
    and managing the data flow and ensuring end-to-end delivery while supporting various
    DQ dimensions. For instance, prioritisation mechanisms [106,107] enable the delivery
    of time-critical data with high accuracy, meeting accuracy and timeliness dimensions,
    while retransmission mechanisms ensure reliability. The interfacing of these two
    concepts will collectively bolster efficiency and reliability in IP-based V2I
    communications. 6.3. Discussion CoAP and MQTT protocols notably distinguish themselves
    within this multifaceted landscape, largely owing to their broad research base
    and wide deployments. From our in-depth analysis, both protocols satisfactorily
    address five of our specified ten dimensions, including Availability, Completeness,
    Consistency, Data Integrity, and Reliability. The successful adherence to these
    critical DQ dimensions has effectively positioned CoAP and MQTT as the predominant
    protocols in the application layer for V2I communication scenarios. However, their
    prevalence is not a testament that they are the ultimate solution. Rather, it
    indicates the efficacy of these protocols at their domiciled layer. They possess
    a unique characteristic that is beneficial to V2I systems. Nonetheless, acknowledging
    that they can fulfil only five of the ten dimensions effectively either due to
    their design, leveraging the capabilities of their associated transport protocol,
    or other mechanisms infer the importance of employing a variety of other methodologies,
    e.g., cross-layer approach [108,109] to compensate for other dimensions. For example,
    the reliability of data is one of the most coveted dimensions in IoT communications
    and is predominantly supported by layers underneath the application layer, the
    path layers (network and transport layer), and the link layers (data link and
    physical layer) [110]. Protocols such as MQTT and CoAP effectively support reliability
    due to mechanisms present in the protocols [111]. This is a testament to the heterogeneous
    and complex nature of V2I communication, which necessitates a versatile mix of
    protocols for optimal performance. In the transport layer, TCP has always been
    a dominant force. The inherent characteristics of reliability, guaranteed packet
    delivery, and error-checking ensure relevance, which has earned the trust of numerous
    developers. UDP, on the other hand, offers an effortless ‘fire and forget’ transmission
    model which excels in availability due to its connectionless nature and timeliness,
    making it a suitable choice for use cases like Emergency Vehicle Pre-emption [85]
    where low overhead and latency are prioritised. In addition, DCCP mirrors UDP’s
    connectionless architecture but further augments it with a built-in congestion
    control mechanism, making it a promising candidate for streaming media feeds.
    Paralleling the features of UDP, the QUIC protocol offers superior performance
    under various metrics TCP is known for [112], making it a viable choice for a
    plethora of V2I applications. Leveraging the strengths of both TCP and UDP, SCTP
    uniquely combines these traditional protocols to create a distinctive transport
    layer solution. The efficacy of SCTP among its peers in addressing five of our
    DQ dimensions is largely attributed to its inherent multipath, multi-homing, and
    multi-streaming capabilities [113], which can significantly enhance the reliability,
    efficiency, and robustness of V2I communications. The multipath capabilities ensure
    uninterrupted data flow between V2I nodes, even under challenging network conditions.
    This feature is particularly important for real-time traffic management, enabling
    smooth data transmission. The multi-homing feature allows vehicles to maintain
    a sustained connection with multiple infrastructures simultaneously, increasing
    reliability. This is especially beneficial for safety-critical applications like
    collision detection and avoidance. Finally, the multi-streaming capability can
    enable the transfer of diverse data types in separate streams, enhancing data
    delivery efficiency. This capability can significantly improve the performance
    of use cases that involve the exchange of a variety of data, such as traffic information,
    vehicle telemetry, and multimedia data. V2I communications necessitate high availability
    and timely and reliable packet delivery, even under challenging network conditions.
    These are key characteristics the transport layer protocols should effectively
    support that are beneficial to the numerous use cases and are particularly beneficial
    to smart traffic signal coordination [114,115]. Finally, as earlier discussed
    in Section 3, 6LoWPAN is specifically designed to enable IPv6 packets to be transmitted
    while RPL provides routing functionalities for IPv6 packets over constrained networks.
    These protocols underscore their critical role in maintaining robust V2I communication
    by satisfying three critical DQ dimensions: availability, confidentiality and
    reliability. 7. Conclusions Despite the unique capabilities of the various protocols
    within our tri-layered study, there exists a gap in the traceability and validity
    dimensions. Addressing these gaps would involve incorporating additional methodologies,
    such as logging and monitoring systems, data validation rules and implementing
    anomaly detection techniques. Furthermore, adopting a cross-layer fusion approach
    by leveraging the synergy between protocols and layers, such as network conditions
    from the Internet layer, can enhance validity checks in the application layer.
    While all these approaches can potentially improve DQ across all layers, they
    could also lead to potential violations of the existing layered architecture principles.
    Thus, these strategies might introduce trade-offs, such as increased computational
    overhead or system complexity. Hence, achieving an optimal balance between DQ,
    security, system performance and efficiency in a protocol fusion approach is a
    compelling future research direction. Author Contributions Conceptualisation,

    Sensor Networks 1. Introduction and research background The digital twin is a
    revolutionising technology in the industry 4.0 era. The advent of the concept
    can be traced back to Grieve''s presentation for a Product Lifecycle Management
    module at the University of Michigan in 2002 [1]. The concept was not conclusive
    at the time but elaborated the components of a digital twin to be a ‘physical
    product in real space’, a ‘virtual product in virtual space’ and a connection
    between both the physical and virtual products for data exchange. It became more
    evident in 2010 when it was published in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (NASA) modelling, simulation, information technology processing roadmap where
    a digital twin was defined as “an integrated multiphysics, multiscale, probabilistic
    simulation of an as-built vehicle or system that uses the best available physical
    models, sensor updates, fleet history, etc., to mirror the life of its corresponding
    flying twin” [2]. Several definitions of the concept have been made in the following
    years. For example, a digital twin has been referred to as a “realistic model”
    [3], “digital representation” [4], “dynamic virtual model” [5] that possesses
    the properties and behaviour of a system in the physical world. This study adopts
    the early definition of digital twins by Grieves [1]. The digital twin was first
    practically applied in NASA''s Apollo program in 2010, and its application has
    evolved and has spread to other industries since then. Digital twin applications
    have been mainly investigated in manufacturing, aviation, and healthcare [6].They
    have been reported to improve, automate and enhance the efficiency of various
    activities in those industries. The promising abilities of digital twins and the
    rapid advances in emerging smart technologies have attracted interest in their
    application for the construction industry. The term ‘digital twin’ is relatively
    new in the construction research literature. However, there is quite some lack
    of clarity in the concept because of its confusion with the term ‘BIM’. Some authors
    use the two terms interchangeably while others consider them to be different.
    For example, the digital twin has been referred to as BDOs (BIM Digital Objects)
    [7] and as a BIM model with lifecycle data and the ability to carry out simulations
    [8] . The confusion in the usage of the terms might hinder the acceptance of digital
    twins as a new concept in the construction industry [9] . Therefore, it is essential
    to differentiate between digital twins and BIM. BIM has been defined by the UK
    BIM task group as “a collaborative way of working, underpinned by the digital
    technologies which unlock more efficient methods of designing, delivering and
    maintaining physical built assets” [10] . A key feature of BIM is the 3D model
    commonly known as the BIM model which is realised with object-oriented software
    [11]. The BIM model acts as a rich data repository that contains information on
    geometric and functional aspects of an asset [12] and other related data like
    time schedules (4D) [13], cost (5D) estimation [14], asset management [15], etc.
    It can be used to integrate multi-disciplinary information from different project
    lifecycle phases to promote communication [16]. When properly developed and managed,
    the BIM model can provide a wealth of accurate geometric, descriptive and operable
    metadata that can be used to enhance project delivery practices [17]. However,
    the BIM model is limited in providing dynamic real-time data of the physical environment.
    Construction projects and assets are both implemented within a dynamic physical
    environment generating a vast amount of non-geometric data. A significant volume
    of this data is not fully taken advantage of yet it is critical for informed decision-making
    [18] .Thus, the need to collect this data by monitoring assets and projects in
    real time is required. Also, the BIM model has limited capability to process large
    sets of dynamic and multi-form data that require advanced technologies for storage
    and processing. These limitations of BIM models can lead to underutilisation of
    data, ineffective decision-making and inefficient practices with significant cost
    implications. The emerging concept of the digital twin offers an opportunity to
    address the limitations of BIM. In a digital twin system, the physical entity
    is connected to its equivalent virtual model by a data connection that allows
    data exchange between both entities. This implies that a BIM model is a merely
    starting point for the development of a digital twin in construction. With digital
    twin technology, the BIM model is connected to the physical environment to enable
    the bi-directional transfer of data between both entities. This enables the BIM
    model to be updated with real-time data which facilitates improved decision-making
    in the implementation and management of assets. Moreover, digital twins leverage
    advanced data analytics techniques like artificial intelligence for processing
    large sets of data to enable condition monitoring, predictions, diagnostics, prognostics
    and system optimisation . These digital twin capabilities have the potential to
    significantly improve information management and decision-making in various construction
    practices which in turn enhances the efficiency of construction and asset management
    activities. The application of digital twins in the construction industry is a
    growing area of research. Five systematic literature reviews that include Boje,
    et al. [19], Jiang, et al. [20], Opoku, et al. [21], Deng, et al. [22] and Ozturk
    [23] on digital twin applications in construction already exist. Ozturk [23] conducted
    a bibliometric analysis to provide an overview of the research landscape for digital
    twins in the AECO-FM industry. Boje, et al. [19] analysed the perceived abilities
    of a digital twin as applied across various engineering domains and identified
    potential areas in BIM application in the construction phase that can be enhanced
    by a digital twin. Opoku, et al. [21] investigated digital twin applications in
    various project lifecycle phases while Deng, et al. [22] examined the built areas
    that concern digital twins and the capabilities of current state-of-the-art digital
    twins. Jiang, et al. [20] investigated the applications of digital twins in the
    civil engineering sector. None of the reviews has focussed on establishing the
    state of the art of existing technologies for digital twin development in the
    literature. It has been reported that digital twins present significant challenges
    in their development from a technological perspective [[24], [25], [26]]. A wide
    variety of emerging technologies are being used in their development for various
    applications but it is not immediately clear from the literature which ones are
    key to their successful development, necessitating a systematic literature review
    with a focus on technologies. Although the focus here is on technologies, it has
    to be acknowledged that the application and adoption of digital technologies in
    the AEC industry is affected by several organisational challenges such as inadequate
    expertise [27,28], financial constraints [29], cultural barriers [30], resistance
    to change [31] and competing initiatives [32,33] etc., which are out of the scope
    of this study. This paper aims to identify the key technologies used in the development
    of digital twins in construction in the existing literature, the research gaps
    and the potential areas for future research. Typically, the development of a digital
    twin requires a data connection between a physical entity and its equivalent virtual
    model. Modelling technologies are used to generate a virtual model which mirrors
    the parameters of the physical environment such as the geometric structure, functionality,
    state, location, process, and performance [25]. The Internet of Things (IoT) technologies
    enable data connection, which allow for the bi-directional flow of data between
    physical and virtual entities [34]. The IoT technologies collect data from the
    physical environment which is then transmitted to the virtual model using communication
    transmissions in application layer protocols. The collected data is of high volume
    and can be multi-source, requiring big data storage technologies. The dynamic
    data from the physical environment is then integrated and fused into the virtual
    model to provide human-understandable abstractions and inferences [35]. The digital
    twin data can be processed using advanced data analytics technologies to provide
    various services to the users. The processed data is finally available to the
    end users straightforwardly and interactively through data visualisation which
    is supported by visualisation technologies [36]. These technologies collectively
    form the basis for implementing a viable digital twin consisting of a high-fidelity
    model with bi-directional data transfer and data processing capabilities. The
    technologies have been conceptualised into a digital twin system architecture
    with five development layers that include data acquisition, data transmission,
    digital modelling, data/model integration and the service [37]. The data acquisition
    layer consists of technologies for data collection and the collected data set.
    The transmission layer consists of the networking, communications and transmission
    protocols technologies. The digital modelling layer considers the technologies
    for measuring the parameters of the physical entity and for modelling the virtual
    model. The data/model integration layer consists of technologies that support
    data storage, data/model integration and fusion, data processing and analysis,
    visualisation and AI, machine learning and simulation engine. For this study,
    four broad categories that include data storage, data/model integration and fusion,
    data processing and analysis and data visualisation are treated as sub-categories
    of the data/model integration layer. The study uses this architecture as a guiding
    framework to identify the various technologies used in the five development layers
    of digital twins. The study adopts a systematic literature review methodology
    of selected digital twin application studies with construction-related demonstrative
    case studies and experimental setups. Firstly, the generic composition of digital
    twins in the studies is examined. This is followed by the elicitation of data
    about the technologies against the five conceptual digital twin development layers
    by [37]. Moreover, gaps and research issues for digital twin applications are
    discussed in this paper. Following this introduction, the research design is presented
    in Section 2 followed by data collection in Section 3 and data extraction in Section
    4. This is followed by Section 5 which presents the findings and discussions and
    Section 6 that presents the research gaps and future research. Finally, the conclusions
    and limitations are presented in Section 7. 2. Research design 2.1. Research methodology
    A systematic literature review (SLR) is applied in this paper because it follows
    a rigorous and explicit procedure to identify, evaluate and synthesise the existing
    body of knowledge on a specific subject [38]. This approach helps in establishing
    the current state of the art on a subject which aids in identifying research gaps
    and determining future research directions in that subject field. Kitchenham,
    et al. [39] propose that an SLR comprises three stages which include: planning,
    implementation and reporting. The planning phase involves framing the research
    questions and creating criteria for locating the material and search methods.
    This is followed by the implementation phase where the material is collected and
    selected for the study. Lastly, the literature is combined and analysed in the
    reporting phase. This paper applies the preferred reporting items for systematic
    reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) method for collecting data for the systematic
    review. The PRISMA method is widely used in systematic reviews since it clearly
    describes the rationale and procedures for identifying, selecting, excluding and
    including literature to improve the accuracy of the systematic review [40]. The
    methodology of the study consists of 1) framing the research questions, 2) data
    collection and processing, 3) data extraction and analysis and 4) summary of findings
    and discussions. 2.2. Research questions To define the scope of interest of the
    SLR, the following research questions were addressed: Q1: What are the components
    of digital twins in digital twin applications in construction? Q2: What are the
    existing technologies used in the development of digital twins? Q3: What are the
    research gaps and potential areas for future research? 3. Data collection for
    the literature This section describes the steps taken to collect the relevant
    literature for the study. A PRISMA workflow diagram for the study is shown in

    image Fig. 1. PRISMA workflow diagram. 3.1. Performing the search process An initial
    literature search was conducted in the ScienceDirect database because it is one
    of the biggest databases covering a wide range of scientific publications. Moreover,
    it possesses desired attributes for conducting search queries like advanced search
    fields where systematic searches can be conducted [41]. An advanced search with
    keywords executed in the ScienceDirect database with a search string set to (“digital
    twin OR “virtual twin“ OR “cyber-physical system“) AND (“construction industry”
    OR “AEC” OR “construction management” OR “construction engineering“), for publications
    between 2015 and September 2022 and set to only research and review articles.
    The period selected for the search is appropriate because there are very few publications
    on digital twins before 2015. This search yielded a result of 508 records. A similar
    search using the keywords of “digital twin” and “construction industry” was run
    in similar databases like Web of Science and Google Scholar. An additional 153
    records were identified by reading through the titles of the papers in the databases
    and selecting only those that had not been found in ScienceDirect. 3.2. Inclusion
    and exclusion criteria The study gathered a total of 661 articles from both ScienceDirect
    and other additional databases. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied
    in three phases. The screening phase began by removing 51 records that were duplicates
    and studies that are not construction-industry related leaving a total of 610
    articles. The second phase of screening involved reading of titles and abstracts
    of the publications and 343 articles were excluded because they were BIM application
    studies and on other related technologies in the construction industry. This left
    behind a total of 267 records. In phase three, 142 records were excluded of which,
    25 were conceptual papers, 92 focused on one feature or technology of the digital
    twin and 25 records emphasised the service or function area for which the digital
    twin is developed. A total of 125 records remained for full-text assessment. An
    inclusion criterion was applied to the remaining 125 records. The inclusion criteria
    considered having 1) a detailed systematic architecture for a digital twin application
    2) a methodology for the implementation 3) the technologies used for the implementation
    and 4) the demonstrative case studies and laboratory setups presented. The introduction,
    methodology and figures of the remaining studies were assessed and scored up to
    4 in terms of those 4 criteria. The eligible papers obtained for the review were
    38 in total and these are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Selected practical studies

    Warning alerts for potential failures 5. Findings and discussions This section
    presents the findings from the data extraction and analysis of the selected studies
    (Table 1) that is indicated in Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4. 5.1. Components of
    digital twins in construction applications The digital twin applications consisted
    of various physical entities. Most of the studies used buildings and the associated
    building spaces [44,50,51,59,61,64,67,68,70,71,73,[75], [76], [77]]. Some studies
    focused on specific building components and systems such as lighting and surveillance
    system [43], air handling unit [47], fan coil [52], building systems [37], centrifugal
    pumps [60], chiller for an HVAC system [62] and building façade [66,72]. Other
    studies considered the construction and assembling sites for buildings [45,48,49,[53],
    [54], [55], [56],58,63,65,74,78] and road construction sites [46,57,69]. In these
    environments, various resources such as machinery, materials, and workers were
    monitored. Pregnolato, et al. [42] used an existing suspension bridge as their
    physical entity. All the studies contained a 3D model of the physical entity with
    the BIM model being the commonest virtual model. A 3D FEM (Finite Element Model)
    was used for the suspension bridge. The (IoT) Internet of Things sensors were
    the most used devices for creating a data connection between the physical entities
    and their corresponding virtual models. Other technologies that were used include
    RFID (Radio frequency identification), image sensors and image recognition artificial
    intelligence, vision and component-based sensing systems, satellite positioning
    and recognition devices, laser scanning and Restful APIs. 5.2. Technologies in
    digital twin applications The data elicited in Table 3 and Table 4 for is categorised
    under five layers that include data acquisition, data transmission, digital modelling,
    data/model integration and service layers. The data/model integration layer is
    further classified into data storage, data/model integration and fusion, data
    processing and analysis and data visualisation. 5.2.1. Data acquisition layer
    Dynamic data from the physical environment is collected depending on the intended
    functionality of the digital twin. IoT sensors and technologies were the technologies
    used for data acquisition from the physical environment. The IoT sensor networks
    use sensing nodes to communicate the status of a parameter in a surrounding in
    a wireless manner [79]. They measure changes in physical, chemical and electrical
    properties of a surrounding and generate a response in the form of an electrical
    output. Various types of intelligent sensors are used to measure environmental
    parameters that include temperature, humidity, air quality, motion, pressure,
    airflow rates, air velocity, CO2, lux levels, gas, particulate matter (PM) 10,
    smoke and acoustic levels. A wide range of sensors is available to collect data
    on various environmental parameters. For example, DHT11 sensors [50,76] and Monnit
    wireless sensors [64] were used for measuring temperature and humidity. Other
    types of sensors used include Rev. P wind sensors (MD0555 category) for air velocity
    [50], DHT22 sensors for ambient temperature, humidity and a light-dependent resistor
    (LDR) [52], TA465-X sensor system for airflow, temperature and humidity [70],
    Texas Instruments (TI) Sensortag CC2650 light sensors [72] and PT550 light sensors
    [76]. In other cases, sensor data is obtained from already existing monitoring
    systems of buildings. [47] used a Restful API (Application Programming Interface)
    over a conventional BMS (Building Management System) to collect data of the BMS
    hard-wired sensors that include NTC-12 K-sensors for temperature, TTH-6040–0 for
    the outdoor temperature and the IVL10 temperature-sensitive airflow transmitters
    and PTH-3202-DR for pressure. Similarly, a RESTful API was applied to collect
    sensor data from the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system for
    HVAC plants with temperature, humidity and CO2 sensors [51]. Cheng, et al. [62]
    obtained sensor data from a direct digital control (DDC) system in an IoT sensor
    network consisting of temperature sensors, humidity sensors, flow rate sensors
    and pressure sensors. IoT sensor technologies are also used to collect mechanical
    data in various applications. For a suspension bridge, temperature sensors were
    used to measure the temperature of the chain links while displacement transducers
    measured the displacement of the saddles [42]. The piezoelectric acceleration
    sensor was used to acquire the vertical acceleration of the vibration wheel to
    monitor the quality of road compaction [46]. To monitor the safety of a scaffolding
    system Yuan, et al. [78] and cables on a prestressed steel structure Liu, et al.
    [56], a column tension-compression sensor and accelerometer with a displacement
    sensor were used respectively. Lu, et al. [60] applied vibration sensors to monitor
    the mechanical condition of a chiller pump. To monitor the mechanical condition
    of a fan coil, SCT-013-000 current sensor, EU:77DE-06-09 voltage sensor, and DS18B20
    and PT100 temperature sensors were used [52]. Meža, et al. [57] used various sensors
    that included temperature sensors, inductive displacement network sensor, soil
    moisture sensors, asphalt strain sensors, horizontal inclinometers network sensors
    and surface sensor pressure pads to obtain real-time data on a road construction
    project. Load cells, switch sensors, an accelerometer and displacement sensor
    were used to monitor the safety of a scaffolding system [78]. The IoT sensor technologies
    can also be used to obtain positioning data in dynamic environments. For example,
    the ultrasonic sensor and gyroscopic sensors were used to collect positioning
    data of resources to detect clashes and accurate placement [49] and track locations
    of resources on site [63]. Zhou, et al. [69] used both ultrasonic sensors and
    laser ranging sensors to track the location of machinery during tunnel operations.
    Akanmu, et al. [65] used vision and wearable IMUs (Inertia Measurement Units)
    with a 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer as well as Velcro vive
    trackers to obtain body kinematic data. Another use of IoT sensors involved the
    application of cameras and laser scanners. Tan, et al. [43] used a building surveillance
    system to obtain video streams of scenes which were processed by an algorithm
    to detect pedestrians and perceive ambient brightness. A FLIR lepton 2.5 thermal
    imaging module was connected to the Raspberry Pi microprocessor to measure surface
    temperatures to monitor MRT (Mean Radiant Temperature) values at different points
    in the building enclosure [50]. Smart cameras provided video streams recording
    the wearing of safety equipment on site and uploaded to the cloud storage for
    analysis [55]. Seghezzi, et al. [59] used high-quality Bullet Pro Camera sensors
    to capture image data of occupant movement which was registered as a human by
    the deep learning algorithm embedded in the camera sensors to provide a count
    of occupants. Three Microsoft Kinect cameras acquired image data of a robot''s
    workspace environment in Gazebo which was then converted to point clouds [67].
    Antonino, et al. [71] used cameras with image sensors coupled with image recognition
    (Im) artificial intelligence to detect users'' movements in an office building.
    Two overhead cameras were applied to record the entrance and exit events of occupants
    in a room which were then translated into counts of occupants [70]. On the other
    hand, 3D point clouds for a construction site were obtained using a UAV (Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicle) equipped with a LiDAR scanner [53]. To obtain positioning and
    location data, identification and tracking technlogies that include RFID tags,
    UWB tags and the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) were used. RFID systems
    consist of one or more readers and several RFID tags that contain a unique identifier
    which is applied to objects. A tag transmission is triggered by the readers using
    electromagnetic fields to automatically query for the possible presence of tags
    in the surroundings to receive their IDs (identifications) [80]. This enables
    the RFID systems to track or monitor physical objects in real time. On the other
    hand, UWB is a short-range and high-bandwidth communication technology that uses
    radio signals [81]. It can be used to locate and track human beings and objects
    in real time. The GNSS is an outdoor localisation system that uses a satellite-based
    navigation system at a global level. From the analysis, RFID and UWB tags were
    used to collect positioning data of prefabricated components on an assembling
    site (UWB) [48] and smart objects on a construction site [45]. Lee, et al. [54]
    used RFID tags and the GPS (Global Positioning System) to track and locate prefabricated
    blocks on a mock-up bridge site. RFID and UWB tags were used to locate precast
    building components [74] and the position of a ladder [68] respectively. UWB anchors
    and tags provided the position and orientation data on appliances in an office
    room [73]. The real-time kinematic global navigation satellite system (RTK – GNSS)
    was used to obtain location data for construction machinery [46]. The use of sensors,
    RFID and UWB devices, cameras and laser scanning in the construction industry,
    is growing and is well covered in the literature [[81], [82], [83], [84], [85]].
    To be able to collect and transmit useful data, sensor systems consist of various
    functional layers like sensing and transduction, signal processing, data processing,
    signal transmission, etc., [86]. This follows that a high-level sensor system
    architecture can include a microcontroller, wired or wireless interface, memory,
    sensors, display and power. Examples of sensor platforms indicated in some studies
    include NodeMCU micro-controller Böke, et al. [66], Aurdino Mega 2560 R3 microcontroller
    board [75], Raspberry Pi 3B+ [72] and Raspberry Pi 3 [77]. The details on sensor
    architectures and platforms can be found in various studies such as [[87], [88],
    [89]] etc. 5.2.2. Data transmission layer Data transmission involves the processing
    and transporting of raw data from the data acquisition layer. The collected data
    is generally transmitted through the wire and wireless transmission technologies.
    The Wi-Fi wireless short-range technology was used in several applications [44,45,48,52,55,63,69,70,77].
    Wi-Fi is a common communication technology that connects devices in a local area
    network using radio waves. Other examples of short-range wireless technologies
    included wireless local area network (WLAN) [66], Bluetooth [46,63,72,74] and
    ultra-wide-band (UWB) radio communication [68,73]. On the other hand, one study
    used Ethernet wired transmissions [37] while another study by Pregnolato, et al.
    [42] used a hybrid of both wired and wireless networks. In the case of sensor
    data obtained from a Building Management Systems (BMS), the internet and the BACnet
    (Building Automation and Control Networks) protocols were used for data communication
    among the various equipment, devices and sensors as indicated by [47]. The transmission
    of data must conform to communication layer protocols. These protocols are defined
    by different groups such as IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers),
    IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), etc., and are officially used as standards
    in the industry. They can be categorised into file transfer protocols and messaging
    protocols which are best suited for web applications and IoT frameworks respectively
    [90]. The most commonly used transmission protocol was MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport) [42,[44], [45], [46],48,52,66,68,76]. MQTT is a lightweight publish/subscribe
    messaging transmission protocol that connects remote sensors to other software
    layers of an application [91]. It is characterised by high latency and suitable
    for restricted equipment, unreliable networks and low bandwidth. It uses a client-server
    architecture whereby the MQTT client publishes messages to an MQTT broker to be
    subscribed to by other clients or retained for future use [92]. The HTTP (Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol) was the other mostly used transmission protocol [37,50,61,63,64].
    The HTTP is a web messaging protocol that supports request/response RESTful web
    architecture [92]. It uses the Universal Resource Identifier (URI) to send data
    from the servers to the client who receives the data through a specific URI. In
    Hosamo, et al. [47] study, a specific URL from the sensor data API was used for
    data transfer to the BIM model. Jiang, et al. [63] used both the HTTP and socket
    protocols for their study. A socket protocol is a standard protocol for transferring
    data from one machine to another [93]. On the other hand, Lee, et al. [54] applied
    an Azure blockchain platform to provide an IoT hub for receiving the GPS data
    from the IoT sensors which was then later sent to the as-built BIM model. Seghezzi,
    et al. [59] stored sensor data in an online database and downloaded it as CSV
    files which was then visualised in the SophyAI online platform. The gazebo_ros_pkgs,
    a set of robot operating software, was used to create a communication interface
    between the Gazebo platform with sensor data and the ROS (Robot Operating Software)
    [67]. 5.2.3. Digital modelling layer This layer involves the development of the
    corresponding virtual model of the physical entity. This process is generally
    done by modelling the digital model. Modelling is the process of “representing
    a physical entity in digital forms that can be processed, analysed, and managed
    by computers” [24]. Through modelling, the physical entity and related information
    are represented in a digital environment. To be able to model the physical entity,
    the parameters of the physical environment such as the geometric structure, functionality,
    state, time, location, process, performance [25] etc. are measured to produce
    a virtual replica that mirrors the physical environment. From the analysis, laser
    scanning was used to obtain the 3D point cloud model of the physical assets [37,53,56,61].
    Other measurement methods included laser tape measurement [73], Mixed Reality
    (MR) [61] and photogrammetry [37]. Modelling parametric design software is used
    to develop the virtual model that mirrors the features of the physical entity.
    Most of the studies used a 3D model (BIM model) to represent the virtual equivalent
    of the physical entity. Autodesk Revit was the most used software for 3D modelling
    of buildings as indicated in these studies [43,47,50,52,60,62,71,75,77].Other
    3D geometric software tools that were applied include Autodesk Navisworks [78],
    Solidworks and 3D Max [45], Sketchup 3D [49] and Rhinoceros 6 software [66].To
    create a BIM model of a road, Autodesk Civil 3D and Autodesk Revit were used [57].
    The former was used to generate the road model while the latter was used to model
    sensors to create the BIM model. Autodesk Revit and AECOsim building designer
    were used to develop geometry models at the system, building and city levels Lu,
    et al. [37]. On the other hand, game development software is also used to develop
    the virtual entity of the digital twin application. A human avatar was modelled
    using the Unity game engine and Autodesk 3D Max [65]. Four studies imported geometric
    data into Unity 3D to develop 3D models [48,54,58,73]. A Virtual Reality (VR)
    environment was created using the Unity 3D platform, Oculus Rift S VR headset
    and the Oculus touch controllers [67].To create a human-robot construction system,
    the Robot arm model was developed using the Unified Robotics Description Format
    (UDRF) and sent to Robot Operating Software (ROS) to be loaded as a game object
    in VR. Moreover, BIM components for the construction site were also loaded into
    the VR environment. Other 3D modelling platforms that were used include Three.js
    program [46] and Midas Gen software [42]. 5.2.4. Data/model integration and fusion
    layer 5.2.4.1. Data storage In the data/model integration layer, the digital twin
    data undergoes a series of stages that include data storage, data/model integration
    and fusion, data processing and analysis and data visualisation to produce useful
    information. Digital twin data is multi-source and of high volume requiring big
    data storage technologies [24]. The selection of a storage database depends on
    the accessibility, scalability, high-performance and management capability of
    massive data. The studies mostly used cloud-based computing platforms for data
    storage. Cloud databases provide adaptable and exceptional backend access for
    computing applications [94]. Examples of the cloud-databases from the studies
    include Internet my openHAB cloud [44], Google cloud platform [50], web database
    [45], BIM cloud database [53], Azure Microsoft for cloud storage [54], cloud servers
    [55,59,66,74], Alibaba cloud server [69], Microsoft Azure SQL cloud database [71],
    Cloud database and SQL server [77], Heidi SQL [78], Amazon Web service (AWS) DynamoDB
    [60,64], MSSQL [47,77], MySQL [43,46,52,61], ArangoDB database [68] and influx
    database [76]. To collect data from already existing building systems like the
    BMS (Building Management System) with security firewalls, a mirrored database
    was used to store all data sets in the protected BMS into DynamoDB NoSQL schema
    [37]. Data was also stored on-premise in Mongo database [76] and using a PHP interpreter
    server and Apache web service [52]. 5.2.4.2. Data/model integration and fusion
    The various digital twin data from the physical and virtual spaces are integrated
    through data fusion techniques to provide human-understandable inferences [35].
    This involves integrating sensor data like environmental data, mechanical data,
    and image and video data into the BIM models to reflect the real-time status of
    the physical entity in the virtual model. This requires the use of technologies
    to provide a platform for hosting the digital twin with both sensor and model
    data. To enable this data integration, customised APIs are built into the 3D model
    software platforms. Therefore, API add-in plug-ins were developed for Autodesk
    Revit [47,62,77], Midas Gen software [42], Bexel Manager [57], Dynamo into Revit
    [75], Autodesk Navisworks [78], Autodesk forge [37,52,60] and Three.js program
    [43,46]. The Unity game engine platform by Unity technologies was used by eight
    studies as the data/model platform [45,48,49,54,58,65,73]. Shahinmoghadam, et
    al. [50] used the Datasmith tool to import geometric data for building spaces
    into an Unreal Engine 4 game engine using Oculus Rift S headsets. Other platforms
    used for data/model integration and fusion included the ‘Processing’ development
    environment [66] and SophyAI online platform [59]. Peng, et al. [61] used data
    processing frameworks that include Apache Kafka and Flink and Scheduled ETL (Extract,
    Transform and Load) to integrate sensor data from 13 subsystems into a virtual
    environment. To integrate the multi-form sensor data and data from other systems
    into the BIM model, the data can be modelled into formal data structures to allow
    for seamless fusion of the data into the model. Four studies provided details
    on the data structures for the integration of the sensor data and 3D models. Hosamo,
    et al. [47] used the Brick schema for the semantic description of the metadata.
    Three studies used semantic data description to map the BIM model data in the
    IFC schema with the sensor systems and asset management systems [37,60,62]. 5.2.4.3.
    Data processing and analysis The digital twin data is processed and analysed using
    advanced technologies to obtain useful information. Table 4 analysis consists
    of both simple and advanced data analysis techniques. Examples of simple data
    analysis techniques include the comparison of measured values against target values/thresholds
    [42,46,50,54,66,68,72,78], visibility analysis [49,59,69,71,74], numerical models
    [48,75] and rule-based reasoning [44,45,52,65]. The other studies applied artificial
    intelligence techniques that include machine learning, deep learning and artificial
    intelligence algorithms for data analysis. Artificial intelligence (AI) involves
    programming a machine to behave in an intelligent manner [95]. Machine learning
    was the most used technique in the studies. Various machine learning techniques
    that include the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and support vector machine (SVM)
    [47,62], Markov model preparation and ANN (artificial neural network) training
    [51], Apriori algorithms and complex network analysis [55], Markov chain [55],
    Cumulative sum charts and machine learning [37] and ensemble learning algorithms
    [70] were applied. Tan, et al. [43] applied deep learning to convert video stream
    data into text data to analyse the pedestrian trend, time and determine the most
    saving energy saving option. Artificial intelligence models using popular frameworks
    like TensorFlow, Keras and Pytorch deep learning were used for event identification,
    fault diagnosis and automated decision making [61]. Algorithms were developed
    for face recognition, personnel positioning and mechanical attitude positioning
    [63], anomaly detection [64], Bayesian online change point detection [60], planning
    rescue paths [77] and positioning [73]. Pan and Zhang [53] applied data mining
    techniques to produce process models, diagnose bottlenecks, and predict progress
    of works. Other studies analysed data using Python and Chronograf tool [76], Bexel
    manager [57], computation mechanical analysis [69], Robot Operating Software (ROS)
    [67] and 3D simulations [58]. 5.2.4.4. Data visualisation The visualisation of
    temporal sensor data in a virtual environment is one of the powerful aspects of
    digital twins. From the analysis, the 3D modelling software platforms are used
    for data visualisation. Examples of these include Autodesk Revit [47,56,62,[75],
    [76], [77]], Midas Gen software [42], Autodesk Navisworks [78], and Autodesk Civil
    3D [57]. Some studies used Autodesk forge [37,52,60] for visualising the sensor
    data in the BIM model. Gaming environment platforms like Unity 3D game engine,
    which possess powerful visualisation capabilities are also used for visualisation
    [45,48,54,58,67,68,73]. Furthermore, game engine platforms can be used to create
    VR (Virtual Reality) environments as indicated by Akanmu, et al. [65] Wang, et
    al. [67] and Shahinmoghadam, et al. [50]. Akanmu, et al. [65] applied a VR environment
    using the Unity game engine. Wang, et al. [67] created a Virtual Reality (VR)
    environment in Unity 3D and Oculus Rift S VR headset that was connected to the
    ROS (Robot Operating Software). Similarly, Shahinmoghadam, et al. [50] used Unreal
    Engine 4 game engine with Oculus Rift S headsets for the VR environment. On the
    other hand, AR (Augmented Reality) was used for visualisation [49,64]. An AR mobile-based
    application was applied to allow the users to interact with the application for
    remotely operating of construction machinery [49]. This was developed using Unity3D
    in the form of a server with AR interfaces and marker images that were uploaded
    as assets. Other software that were used for visualisation include the Three.js
    program [43,46], SophyAI online platform [59] and a Node-RED dashboard in the
    ‘Processing development’ [66]. The processed digital twin data is finally availed
    to the end users straightforwardly in various visualisation forms. The two most
    used methods of visualisation for the digital twin data were colour coding in
    2D and 3D schematics, performance dashboards, and time series graphs supported
    by the visualisation platforms. Other forms of visualisation included trend graphs
    [43,59,61,70], pie charts [43], line graphs [48,55,56,61], real-time status Kanban
    [48], thermal comfort charts [50], S curves [37] and cumulative sum control charts
    [60]. In many studies, the values for monitored parameters like pedestrian count
    and sensor readings for ambient temperature and humidity were indicated on the
    visualisation platforms. Other forms of visualisation involved the use of anonymous
    virtual agents [59,67,77] and real-time animations [61]. Most studies had more
    than one form of visualisation of the data. 5.2.5. Service layer The last layer
    represents the service that digital twin offers to the users. Digital twin offers
    a diverse range of service depending on the context within which it is applied.
    The most common service offered in the studies was real-time monitoring of assets
    and activities. This included monitoring a suspension bridge [42], building façade
    [66], façade brightness [72], pedestrian trends and time [43], construction site
    activities [48], compaction progress and quality [46], smart objects [45], machine
    and worker operations [49,63], construction progress [53,54,74], structural health
    [55], the safety of materials [57], occupancy trends and movements [59], ambient
    environment monitoring [37], working conditions [60], energy consumption [61],
    chiller condition [62], workers'' postures during operations [65], tunnel operations
    [69] and room occupancy [70,71]. Another functionality of the digital twin involved
    early detection: of potential failures in a scaffolding system [78], faults in
    building AHUs [47,61], bottlenecks in on-site construction [53], anomalies in
    a pump''s operations [37] and indoor environment [64], and fires in a building
    [77]. Moreover, digital twins were applied for the prediction of faults in building
    systems [37,47], the condition of a chiller system [62], and comfort and CO2 levels
    in spaces [51]. Also, some applications used digital twins to provide early warnings
    about potential accidents [69] and alarm signals when thresholds are exceeded
    [52]. Some studies showed that digital twin enabled the visualisation of environmental
    and thermal comfort levels [50], fan coil status [52], space use [61], construction
    progress [74] and indoor ambient conditions [75,76]. Other studies showed that
    digital twins can be used for simulations [44,53,56,58,68], real-time control
    of robotic operations [45,67] and home appliances [73]. 5.3. Summary of findings
    The existence of the three components of a physical entity, its virtual model
    and the data connection between both entities highlights a shift away from static
    BIM models to the emerging technology of digital twins in construction. The studies
    show the diverse application of digital twins to various entities in the physical
    environment from building components, buildings, workers, machinery, site resources,
    civil engineering structures, and even at the city level. This implies that digital
    twins can be applied at different levels of granularity of the construction industry
    ecosystem. Data from the physical environment was mainly acquired using IoT sensor
    technologies. Other technologies that include vision and component-based sensing
    devices, RFID and UWB tags were also used. In some cases, sensor data was acquired
    from already existing monitoring systems like the BMS. For the transmission of
    the data, the applications mostly relied on wireless technology. MQTT protocol
    was most used standard communication protocol followed by the HTTP protocol. MQTT
    protocol is favoured for IoT networks because it is designed for use in low bandwidth
    and high latency networks. Moreover, its publish-subscribe strategy that allows
    for one-to-one and one-to-many connections makes it useful for digital twin development
    as it allows for several subscriptions to the sensor data. Also, it is considered
    to be faster than other transmission protocols [91]. On the other hand, the HTTP
    protocol uses a specific Universal Resource Identifier (URI) to send data from
    the servers to the client [92]. However, there was lack of emphasis on the technologies
    for networking, communication and transmission protocols under the data transmission
    layer as over 18 studies did not provide these details in their system architectures.
    For the digital modelling layer, most of the studies used a 3D model, mostly a
    BIM model and four studies used 3D point cloud models. Various parametric design
    software was used to generate the 3D models, with Autodesk Revit being the most
    used modelling software. Four studies imported geometric data into the Unity 3D
    software. One study used a VR environment. For the storage of digital twin data,
    studies mostly used cloud-based computing platforms that exist on the market.
    Customised plug-ins were added to the geometric software platforms for data integration
    and fusion. The Unity cross-platform by Unity technologies was the most used platform
    for data/model integration. However, most of the studies did not provide the details
    of the integration of the sensor, model and other digital twin data in the data/model
    layer. Only four studies provided some details on their data structures for the
    sensor and model data integration. Both simple and advanced data analysis techniques
    were used in the processing and analysis of data, with machine learning being
    the most applied technique for data processing. The visualisation of the data
    was done using the data/model integration platforms. Four studies used VR/AR technologies
    for visualisation and interaction with the users. The presentation of the digital
    twin data was done using 2D graphical methods mostly in form of performance dashboards,
    colour-coding and time-series graphs. 6. Research gaps and future research Through
    the analysis, some challenges and opportunities were identified in three areas
    namely 1) data transmission 2) interoperability and data integration and 3) data
    processing and visualisation, as discussed in this section. 6.1. Data transmission
    The use of wireless technology for creating the network was the most commonly
    used approach in the studies. However, the focus was on the use of short-range
    wireless technologies that included Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and UWB. The use of long-distance
    wireless transmission technologies like digital radio and satellite communication
    needs to be investigated. This is essential for the future of digital twins to
    be expanded to city digital twins, country digital twins and the worldwide scale.
    The most applied standard transmission protocols for data transfer in the studies
    were the MQTT and HTTP protocols. These two protocols are popular in IoT technologies
    [91].However, over 20 studies did not state the details of their communication
    protocols for their applications. It is also the case that the acquisition of
    digital twin data from heterogeneous systems, networks and devices increases the
    complexity of data transmission. Transmission protocols create mediums for data
    transmission using standardised formats. This is essential for achieving a two-way
    data synchronous transmission channel in a digital twin application and enabling
    machine to machine communication. Therefore, the use of standard communication
    protocols for data transmission in digital twins of varying complexity should
    be further investigated. It is the case that digital twins use a diverse range
    of data, some of which is confidential in nature to people and organisations.
    The transmission of such data is prone to cyber-attacks which can essentially
    become a security threat to people''s lives and the infrastructure that is monitored.
    Therefore, it is necessary to consider security requirements and secure transmission
    protocols for the network and communication layer. From the analysis of the studies,
    three studies considered the security and privacy aspects in their digital twin
    monitoring systems. In their proposed digital twin for management of a hospital
    facility, Peng, et al. [61] used only private HTTP APIs inside hospital firewalls
    to address the safety issues about the use of security monitoring videos and visiting
    records of patients. Shahinmoghadam, et al. [50] opted to use a marker-based registration
    method to obtain orthogonal thermal image mosaics taken by a FLIR lepton thermal
    camera instead of using visual cameras to avoid undermining the privacy-preserving
    aspect of their system. Smart contract and block chain technology were integrated
    in a digital twin prototype to increase network security and traceability of data
    [59]. Thus, the issues of privacy-preserving networks and context-aware privacy
    policies are some of the areas that need to be researched [96]. 6.2. Interoperability
    and data integration in digital twins The integration and fusion of the virtual
    model and IoT sensor data are core to the functioning of a digital twin. As indicated
    from the studies, digital twin data is diverse and is collected using different
    types of sensors resulting in heterogeneous data sets like image data, video data,
    positioning data, environmental data, mechanical data, etc. that have to be integrated
    with the BIM model. This data is obtained from disparate and heterogeneous systems
    like the BMS and Asset management system. These systems operate on different software
    platforms with different syntax and schematics. This increases the complexity
    of digital twin models creating integration and interoperability issues at both
    syntax and semantic levels. From the analysis of the studies, most of the studies
    did not provide the details pertaining to the structure of the digital twin data
    for the purpose of data integration. Only four studies provided details for the
    data architecture for integrating the various digital twin data. To integrate
    BIM and FM data, the IFC data of the AHU was mapped onto the relevant COBie and
    FM using an ontology-based strategy in GraphDB [47]. Moreover, a single Brick
    schema model describing the metadata for the AHU, its components and sensor data
    points was developed. Cheng, et al. [62] imported BIM data into COBie spreadsheets
    and then the COBie data was mapped onto the facility data in FM systems. The attribute
    names of COBie data were matched to the attribute names in the FM database table.
    Furthermore, a sensor data model was proposed and used as a basis to extend the
    the Ifcsensor entity to enable sensor entities and attributes to be visualised
    in a BIM model. An IfcObject matching table was used to describe the link between
    the BIM object Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) and corresponding item ID from
    different data sources like the BMS and sensor system [37,60]. These studies use
    semantic data modelling to enable data integration from various sources. The use
    of semantic models and ontologies [97,98] has been proposed for data integration
    and interoperability in digital twin models. Semantic modelling involves the use
    of semantic web-based methods to map data streams, active sensing data and proprietary
    relational data sets and combine them with user preferences to a dynamic structure
    of things [24]. On the other hand, ontologies provide a formal and explicit representation
    of domain concepts that can be shared [99]. Therefore, there is a need to investigate
    semantic data modelling of sensor data, BIM model data and data from other systems
    to aid in moving towards standardising digital twin data by enabling data integration
    and interoperability. The development of rich data models for various applications,
    data sets, different assets and processes is a ripe area of research. Through
    the use of web-based ontologies, the IFC schema, which is the standard format
    for interoperability within the built environment can be extended and linked to
    other domains. Semantic web technologies can help overcome the limitations of
    the IFC standard models by providing flexible methods of data integration across
    various domains and scales to facilitate interoperability among data and systems
    [100]. Therefore, the use of web-based semantic ontologies for digital twin data
    integration should be explored. 6.3. Data processing and visualisation of digital
    twin data Both simple and advanced data analysis techniques were used in the processing
    and analysis of data such as the comparison of measured values against target
    values/thresholds and machine learning respectively. The introduction of artificial
    intelligence techniques such as machine learning offers opportunities for analysing
    the heterogenous and voluminous data of the built environment. Artificial intelligence
    methods attempt to recreate the problem-solving and reasoning abilities of the
    human brain [101]. AI uses machine learning or deep learning models for reasoning
    about the real world [102]. From the analysis, machine learning was the most used
    AI technique in the studies. It involves the use of algorithms that learn from
    the data by automatically extracting patterns within a defined context [103].
    Thus, machine learning algorithms can be applied to a diverse range of functions
    to solve complex problems in the real world. The advent of digital twins in the
    construction industry has led to an increase in dynamic data which creates challenges
    in storing, and processing of this big data and situations of ‘garbage’ data.
    There is a need to explore the use of advanced technologies for storing and processing
    this smart big data as well as managing ‘garbage’ data in the digital twins. The
    use of AI techniques like machine learning and deep learning enables the automatic
    processing of large data sets into useful knowledge for various applications [104].
    Research should be conducted on developing AI models for processing big data to
    tackle various challenges in the industry. For example, expert systems for various
    functions in the different phases of a project lifecycle can be developed. Moreover,
    there is a need to consider realistic practical applications of these systems
    to improve the accuracy and intelligence levels of the applications. This will
    provide more advanced data models and richer data sets that are useful for decision-making
    in various project and asset management functions. The visualisation of the digital
    twin data involved the use of common 3D modelling software platforms and gaming
    environment platforms. There was also the use of more powerful visualisation technologies
    that include Virtual Reality [49,50] and Augmented Reality [64]. Virtual Reality
    (VR) can be defined as the simulation of 3D objects in a virtual world to enable
    real-time interactions in pseudo-natural immersion via sensorimotor channels [105]
    while Augmented Reality involves the use of an interface to overlay digital information
    onto a user''s view, which is often a camera image of the physical environment
    [106]. VR/AR technologies are capable of providing interactive and immersive experiences
    for users in various functions in the built environment [107]. This is achieved
    by the support of devices that can be stationary-based displays, head-based displays
    and hand-held displays. Within digital twin applications, the VR/AR technologies
    enable the user to visualise, engage and also control selected components in the
    physical environment as required. Therefore, future research on the use of VR/AR
    environments for digital twin applications is recommended. Another key aspect
    in the visualisation of digital twin data is the presentation of the data in meaningful
    ways to the users. From the analysis, most of the studies used 2D graphical methods
    to present the digital twin data to the users. However, this diminishes the use
    of a 3D virtual model and environment to reflect the three-dimensional world that
    humans exist in. It is therefore worth exploring alternative approaches to visualising
    temporal data in a BIM model and 3D environments. It is also the case that the
    IoT sensors for digital twins collect data on various parameters in the physical
    environment such as temperature, humidity, pressure, etc. These are abstract parameters
    that cannot be seen but can be measured. With the advanced technologies of digital
    twins, it could be possible to explore various methods of visualising such abstract
    parameters within a digital model. 7. Conclusions The concept of digital twins
    has the potential to improve performance and productivity in the construction
    industry through effective decision-making enabled by real-time condition monitoring,
    predictions, simulations and optimization of processes. The study conducts a systematic
    review of digital twin studies with demonstrative case studies or experimental
    setups to identify the current technologies used in the development of digital
    twins, the research gaps and future focus. The first contribution of the paper
    is the identification of current technologies that have been used in existing
    research literature in the five digital twin conceptual layers by [37] that include
    data acquisition, data transmission, digital modelling, data/model integration
    and services. This has provided a state of the art for the technologies in the
    development of digital twins in the existing research literature. The digital
    twins in the applications have been created using state-of-the-art and off-the-shelf
    technologies and tools that are developed independently and integrated to form
    digital twin platforms. The second contribution of the paper is the identification
    of the research gaps and potential areas for future research from a technological
    perspective. Future research is required on the technologies for data transmission
    in the application layers, interoperability and data integration and advanced
    data processing and data visualisation to generate high-performance digital twins
    with effective bi-directional data exchange capabilities, interoperable and semantic
    data/model integration, advanced data processing and enhanced visualisation and
    navigation by the users. The application of digital twins is still in its nascent
    stages within the construction industry. Most of the identified studies used small-scale
    experiments and case studies to demonstrate the application of digital twins.
    Mature practical applications from industry are missing in the research literature.
    This study was limited to the technologies of digital twins, but the successful
    implementation of digital technologies in practice requires both technological
    and organisational factors to work together. Thus, research on the organisational
    aspects of digital twin applications is recommended. This study is limited to
    the publications obtained from using the seven keywords that were used for searching
    for records in the ScienceDirect database and other additional databases that
    included Web of Science and Google Scholar. The search might have missed out on
    records that were very specific to certain aspects of the AEC industry and those
    that did not use similar keywords. It is therefore recommended to undertake the
    study in specific domains and activities of the construction industry using different
    search terms. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they

  description: The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has brought
    about tremendous possibilities, but at the same time, it has opened up new vulnerabilities
    and attack vectors that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability
    of connected systems. Developing a secure IoT ecosystem is a daunting challenge
    that requires a systematic and holistic approach to identify and mitigate potential
    security threats. Cybersecurity research considerations play a critical role in
    this regard, as they provide the foundation for designing and implementing security
    measures that can address emerging risks. To achieve a secure IoT ecosystem, scientists
    and engineers must first define rigorous security specifications that serve as
    the foundation for developing secure devices, chipsets, and networks. Developing
    such specifications requires an interdisciplinary approach that involves multiple
    stakeholders, including cybersecurity experts, network architects, system designers,
    and domain experts. The primary challenge in IoT security is ensuring the system
    can defend against both known and unknown attacks. To date, the IoT research community
    has identified several key security concerns related to the architecture of IoT
    systems. These concerns include issues related to connectivity, communication,
    and management protocols. This research paper provides an all-inclusive and lucid
    review of the current state of anomalies and security concepts related to the
    IoT. We classify and analyze prevalent security distresses regarding IoT’s layered
    architecture, including connectivity, communication, and management protocols.
    We establish the foundation of IoT security by examining the current attacks,
    threats, and cutting-edge solutions. Furthermore, we set security goals that will
    serve as the benchmark for assessing whether a solution satisfies the specific
    IoT use cases.

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT)
    technology has brought about tremendous possibilities, but at the same time, it
    has opened up new vulnerabilities and attack vectors that could compromise the
    confidentiality, integrity, and availability of connected systems. Developing
    a secure IoT ecosystem is a daunting challenge that requires a systematic and
    holistic approach to identify and mitigate potential security threats. Cybersecurity
    research considerations play a critical role in this regard, as they provide the
    foundation for designing and implementing security measures that can address emerging
    risks. To achieve a secure IoT ecosystem, scientists and engineers must first
    define rigorous security specifications that serve as the foundation for developing
    secure devices, chipsets, and networks. Developing such specifications requires
    an interdisciplinary approach that involves multiple stakeholders, including cybersecurity
    experts, network architects, system designers, and domain experts. The primary
    challenge in IoT security is ensuring the system can defend against both known
    and unknown attacks. To date, the IoT research community has identified several
    key security concerns related to the architecture of IoT systems. These concerns
    include issues related to connectivity, communication, and management protocols.
    This research paper provides an all-inclusive and lucid review of the current
    state of anomalies and security concepts related to the IoT. We classify and analyze
    prevalent security distresses regarding IoT’s layered architecture, including
    connectivity, communication, and management protocols. We establish the foundation
    of IoT security by examining the current attacks, threats, and cutting-edge solutions.
    Furthermore, we set security goals that will serve as the benchmark for assessing
    whether a solution satisfies the specific IoT use cases. Keywords: IoT security;
    data security; network security; anomaly detection and countermeasures 1. Introduction
    The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a critical technology in modern society,
    with significant implications for cybersecurity. IoT devices are ubiquitous, interconnected,
    and often lack essential security features, leaving them vulnerable to a range
    of cyber threats. Malicious actors can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain sensitive
    data, launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and even take control
    of critical infrastructure. A large-scale cyber-attack on IoT networks could have
    severe consequences, including disrupting essential services and causing widespread
    economic damage. The IoT is a complex network of interconnected devices and individuals
    collaborating to monitor and exchange information about their usage and environmental
    conditions. The system consists of smart devices equipped with embedded systems
    comprising CPUs, sensors, and connectivity hardware that collect, transmit, and
    respond to information obtained from their surroundings within the IoT ecosystem.
    These IoT devices communicate with an IoT gateway or another edge device to exchange
    sensor data with each other. The data is either transferred to the cloud for analysis
    or processed locally. Periodically, these devices exchange information and take
    appropriate actions based on that exchange. In most cases, IoT devices function
    autonomously without any human intervention. The IoT is a rapidly expanding field
    with unique challenges regarding device interoperability, data privacy, and security.
    IoT not only enables individuals to live and work more efficiently and gives them
    greater control over their lives. Businesses rely heavily on the IoT because it
    provides technological devices for automating enterprise environments. With IoT,
    organizations can obtain real-time insights into how various systems function,
    allowing them to optimize processes and reduce labor costs. Furthermore, IoT provides
    visibility into business transactions, reduces manufacturing and shipping costs,
    and enhances service efficiency. Intelligent IoT apps, also known as prefabricated
    SaaS systems, are equipped with machine learning techniques to analyze vast volumes
    of data collected from interconnected sensors, providing corporate users with
    actionable insights via interfaces. By monitoring KPIs (key performance indicators),
    MTBF (mean time between failure) rates, and other metrics in real-time, IoT dashboards
    and alerts can help detect irregularities and initiate automatic repairs or preventative
    actions. One of the biggest obstacles the IoT brings is ensuring its security.
    These devices gather sensitive data, such as what you say and do at home and the
    workplace. Users’ trust in the IoT hinges on its dependability, yet it has a dismal
    track record of securing data. Many connected systems fail to adequately safeguard
    users’ and device data by mismanaging it while it is stored and in transit. Even
    in well-established programs, software vulnerabilities are constantly being uncovered,
    yet many IoT devices cannot be updated, leaving them permanently vulnerable. Due
    to their intrinsic lack of protection, IoT devices such as routers and cameras
    are increasingly targeted by hackers who exploit them as part of massive, interconnected
    botnets. According to estimates from technology analyst firm IDC (International
    Data Corporation) [1], IoT devices will produce 79.4 zettabytes of data in the
    next five years. Some of this Internet of Things data will be “compact and anomalous”,
    as predicted by IDC. This means it will only consist of relatively short updates,
    such as those provided by sensors or smart meters. In addition, devices such as
    security cameras with built-in computer vision might produce massive amounts of
    data. According to IDC’s forecasts, the amount of data generated by Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices will skyrocket in the following years. The report claims
    that while video surveillance is the current leader in data production, other
    industries and medical applications will soon overtake it. Interconnected drones
    with built-in cameras were also projected to become an important data collection
    tool. Data from a wide variety of sensors, including audio, video, and specialized
    automotive sensor data, will be generated by autonomous vehicles in the near future.
    Conducting a thorough vulnerability investigation [2] is the first step in creating
    an IoT-enabled environment. This involves looking at the devices, protocols, and
    user/customer backends of the infrastructure to identify possible weak points.
    Risk management and assessment must be performed throughout the IoT implementation
    lifecycle, especially when the deployment is larger or spans more regions. Due
    to the many data formats and processing capabilities of IoT devices, there is
    no “one size fits all” cybersecurity solution that can protect any Internet of
    Things deployment. Figure 1 shows that most IoT solutions are reasonably priced
    and aimed toward the consumer market, with little thought given to issues such
    as security and privacy. Cybercriminals are eager to take advantage of such vulnerabilities
    by adding them to a botnet or exploiting them to spy on their owners. As a result,
    we must take measures to safeguard this technology. In addition, the urgency of
    this need is only going to rise as the number of available IoT devices continues
    to proliferate. Due to limited capacity and varied design, IoT devices are open
    to various security risks. Threats to wireless ad hoc networks increase when devices
    are deployed to uncontrolled and potentially dangerous environments. It is common
    in hetnets [3] to experience attacks such as sinkholes, blackholes, wormholes,
    sybils, denial-of-service (DoS), node capture, and node injection. Figure 1. IoT
    Security Considerations (Inspiration for Figure 1 was inherited from: Building
    trust in IoT devices with powerful IoT security solutions. (Telit-Cinterion).
    Thales Group. https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/iot/iot-security
    (accessed on 5 February 2023)). During our literature review, we were able to
    identify several key research gaps in securing the IoT, such as: There is a lack
    of comprehensive security solutions for IoT devices. The number of devices and
    the different applications that they are used for having resulted in a complex
    ecosystem that is hard to secure. This complexity is exacerbated by the limited
    computational resources of many IoT devices, which makes it difficult to implement
    advanced security solutions. There is a lack of protocol standardization in IoT
    device security. The lack of universal security measures makes it easier for attackers
    to exploit vulnerabilities, resulting in a higher risk of security breaches. Without
    a common taxonomy, it becomes difficult to ensure the security of an IoT ecosystem,
    which consists of several different types of devices, communication protocols,
    and applications. There is a need for research to identify new security risks
    that arise from the integration of IoT devices with other systems, such as layer-based
    services. The integration of IoT devices with diverse systems introduces new vulnerabilities,
    which need to be identified and addressed. There is a need for more research on
    access control driven anomalies and countermeasures related to IoT devices. The
    massive deployment of these devices has led to the collection of vast amounts
    of data, and it is essential to ensure that this data is protected from unauthorized
    access and misuse. To ensure the security of private information, it is necessary
    to safeguard the data collected by IoT devices, as depicted in Figure 2. Additionally,
    it is important to protect the communication between these devices to prevent
    unauthorized interception of data. In some cases, IoT settings involve physical
    entities exchanging data to provide users with relevant information. This highlights
    the criticality of securing these devices. The potential security threats associated
    with the Internet of Things can have severe consequences, including data breaches,
    loss of sensitive information, and compromised personal privacy. Thus, addressing
    the security concerns related to the IoT is vital to ensure its safe and efficient
    operation. Figure 2. Basic security taxonomy for the IoT. We acknowledge that
    IoT security vulnerabilities are vast & complex and covering all of them in a
    research paper is not always feasible. In this regard, we want to point out that
    the selection of security vulnerabilities discussed in our research paper is based
    on various factors, such as the research objectives, the scope of the study, the
    availability of data, and the relevance to the research question. We acknowledge
    that other security vulnerabilities related to the IoT exist, and are also important
    to address. However, the inclusion of all IoT security vulnerabilities in the
    paper would have been beyond the scope of the research, and it may have led to
    an overly broad and unfocused discussion. Therefore, we focused on specific security
    vulnerabilities that were most relevant to the research question and objectives
    while acknowledging that other vulnerabilities exist in the IoT ecosystem. In
    order to discern dissimilarities among the published literature, we have taken
    into account several factors, including the range of the literature; research
    methods employed; level of scrutiny (i.e., methodology, outcomes, and limitations);
    reliability of sources (such as academic journals, white papers, and industry
    publications); a preferred timeframe (from 2019 to February 2023); and a particular
    focus has been given to literature that highlights gaps in current research with
    pragmatic suggestions for enhancing cybersecurity within IoT systems. In this
    paper, the remaining content is structured as follows: In Section 2, the general
    design, components, and protocols for the Internet of Things are discussed. Section
    3 focuses on potential security concerns with the IoT. Section 4 introduces the
    unique aspects of IoT anomaly detection compared to IT security. Section 5 explains
    the classification of IoT Access Control. Section 6 presents our perspective on
    how artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can impact IoT security.
    Lastly, in Section 7, this review paper is concluded. 2. General Design, Components,
    and Protocols for the Internet of Things Even though there is no set template
    for IoT design, it often consists of three distinct but interconnected layers:
    observation, network, and application. However, CISCO, a digital communication
    corporation, took it a step farther and added a total of seven levels [4]. CISCO
    defined layers were (1) physical devices, (2) communication and processing, (3)
    data analysis and transformation, (4) data storage, (5) data aggregation and abstraction,
    (6) application, and (7) collaboration and business process. As per Figure 3,
    we have focused on the security vulnerabilities which concern observation, network,
    and application layers. A multi-layered protection method aims to ensure that
    every component of the IoT cybersecurity strategy has a backup to compensate for
    any weaknesses or shortcomings. Together, these layers strengthen enterprise defenses
    and lay the framework for an effective cybersecurity strategy for the Internet
    of Things (IoT). Furthermore, we have also examined the National Institute of
    Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework [5], which is based on
    primary functions, such as Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. Figure
    3. IoT risk taxonomy at the observation layer. We implemented a “Tuple Model”
    to create a threat scenario for IoT security. The model consisted of the attacker,
    the attack vector, the target, and/or the impact. The attacker element identified
    the entity or group responsible for the attack, while the attack vector element
    described the method or means used to execute the attack. The target element represented
    the specific IoT device or system under attack, while the impact element described
    the potential consequences or damage resulting from the attack. This Tuple Model
    provided a framework for capturing the diversity of threats and vulnerabilities
    in an IoT system and facilitated the development of a comprehensive threat model
    that accounted for all possible scenarios. Consequently, this model could be expanded
    to include additional elements to capture more complex threats, such as multi-stage
    attacks or those that involve multiple targets. 2.1. Observation Layer A variety
    of IoT sensors and other hardware components make up the observation layer, which
    is also in charge of data exchange and gathering. Sensors and other technologies
    detecting and relaying information are crucial to the Internet of Things. [6].
    A WSN uses a network of wirelessly connected, intelligent sensors to collect information
    about environmental conditions. Sensitive information is sent to a central hub
    or base station via a single or several relay stations. Figure 3 provides a comprehensive
    and systematic analysis of security threats at the observation layer of the IoT.
    The figure identifies various categories of potential security threats at this
    layer, including physical, device, and data security. By breaking down the potential
    threats into these categories, the figure offers a clear and organized overview
    of the risks that need to be addressed when securing the observation layer of
    the IoT. 2.2. Network Layer With the help of the observation layer’s input, the
    network layer stores or transmits the gathered data to the application layer for
    further processing. When it comes to the context of the Internet of Things, this
    layer is the most crucial, since it unifies the numerous forms of communication
    technology that make it possible for IoT devices to communicate with one another.
    Among the most popular of these communication methods are ZigBee [7], BLE (i.e.,
    piconet) [8,9], 6LoWPAB [10,11,12], LoRaWAN [13,14,15], and readable tags. The
    criteria for wireless technologies driven by use cases (i.e., applications) and
    the Internet of Things architecture are outlined in Table 1. This paper mainly
    focuses on IoT security, which can have overlapping concepts with classical wireless
    networks. While some of the content can be applied to both, there are differences
    between IoT devices and classical wireless network devices. IoT devices are often
    low capability, have limited power sources, generate large volumes of data, and
    can be left unattended for extended periods. Therefore, it is crucial to consider
    the unique characteristics of IoT devices when designing security measures. On
    the other hand, classical wireless networks and devices may have different requirements
    and capabilities. While some security principles may apply across both types of
    networks, the specific implementation and considerations can differ. Therefore,
    the paper may have emphasized the need to address IoT security threats explicitly
    that can be overlapping to the broader context of wireless networks. There are
    several similarities in the protocols and standards used in both IoT and classical
    wireless networks. For example, both use the IEEE 802.11 standard for wireless
    LANs, and both use the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
    for communication. Both also use security protocols such as Wi-Fi Protected Access
    (WPA) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) to protect data transmission. However,
    there are also some differences in the protocols and standards used in the two
    types of networks. For instance, IoT devices often use low-power, low-data-rate
    wireless technologies (i.e., explained in Table 1. Assessment of Wireless IoT
    Technologies) such as Zigbee or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), whereas classical
    wireless networks tend to use high data rate protocols such as long-term evolution
    (LTE) or WiMAX. Additionally, IoT devices often have limited processing power
    and memory, which affects the type of protocols and standards that can be used.
    Therefore, specialized protocols such as Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
    and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) are frequently used in IoT devices.
    Specific criteria were given attention for both local and remote scenarios, including
    Internet of Things gateways, wireless device connectivity, hardware connectors,
    and communication protocols. Table 1. Assessment of wireless IoT technologies.
    ‘x’ means not-available, and ‘✓’ means available. Figure 4 offers a comprehensive
    analysis of the security threats that are specific to the network layer of IoT.
    The figure is a useful tool for understanding and visualizing the complex security
    issues at this layer, including various network protocols, communication technologies,
    and architectures. The taxonomy is organized into several categories, such as
    network protocol vulnerabilities, network infrastructure vulnerabilities, and
    malicious network traffic, and provides a detailed breakdown of the different
    types of threats that can occur in each category. This systematic approach helps
    to identify potential vulnerabilities in the network layer of IoT, which can inform
    the development of effective security measures to mitigate these risks. Figure
    4. IoT risk taxonomy at the network layer. 2.3. Application Layer When it comes
    to interoperability between IoT devices and their communication networks, the
    application layer is the key. It mediates between the activities of an IoT device
    and the subsequent transfer of data to the network in a usable manner. Several
    considerations, including the type of device and the task it will carry out, determine
    the optimal protocol for every given Internet of Things application. Constraint
    Application Protocol (CoAP) [16,17,18] and Message Queueing Telemetry Transport
    (MQTT) [19,20,21] are the most often used application protocols. CoAP was developed
    to let low-power, low-resource devices connect to the Internet of Things via slow,
    unreliable networks. Its primary use is in M2M (machine-to-machine) systems, which
    facilitates communication between machines to carry out tasks such as metering
    and controlling HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems and
    smart lighting. Information transfer in CoAP occurs via UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
    CoAP uses the encryption and authentication features of UDP to keep data safe.
    CoAP employs Datagram TLS (Transport Layer Security) over UDP in the same way
    that HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) employs TLS over TCP (Transmission Control
    Protocol). RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) [22], AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
    [23,24,25], and other ciphers are all supported by DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer
    Security). MQTT was created as a minimalist publish/subscribe message system,
    ideally suited for establishing connections between remote devices with a low
    resource need and limited bandwidth. MQTT is an excellent option for wireless
    networks with variable latency due to periodic throughput restrictions or unstable
    connectivity. TLS security-enabled MQTT protocol can support bi-direction communication
    among millions of devices in a reliable, lightweight, and efficient manner [26,27,28].
    An investigation has revealed the following differences between MQTT and CoPA
    that should be considered while implementing IoT technologies: (a) MQTT is a TCP-based
    protocol, while CoAP is an HTTP-based protocol. CoAP can also use UDP for more
    efficient communication, making it a good fit for low-power, lossy networks. REST
    is an architectural style for building web services and is often used in conjunction
    with CoAP to provide a standardized interface for web-based applications to interact
    with IoT devices. (b) MQTT uses a topic-based approach for message routing, where
    messages are published to a topic and subscribers can subscribe to specific topics
    to receive messages. CoAP/REST uses URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) to identify
    resources, which can be manipulated using standard HTTP methods such as GET, PUT,
    POST, and DELETE. (c) MQTT provides three QoS levels, while CoAP/REST provides
    four. MQTT QoS levels range from 0 to 2, with 0 providing no guarantees and 2
    providing the highest level of reliability. CoAP/REST QoS levels range from 0
    to 3, with 0 providing no guarantees and 3 providing the highest level of reliability.
    (d) MQTT supports bidirectional communication between clients and servers, while
    CoAP/REST supports both unidirectional and bidirectional communication. (e) MQTT
    has basic security features, such as username and password authentication, but
    it lacks more advanced security features such as message encryption and authorization.
    On the other hand, CoAP/REST provides more comprehensive security features such
    as message integrity, confidentiality, and authentication using Datagram Transport
    Layer Security (DTLS). (f) MQTT has a larger maximum payload size than CoAP/REST,
    making it a better option for applications requiring large data transfer. CoAP/REST
    is designed for constrained environments and has a smaller maximum payload size.
    (g) MQTT provides higher reliability than CoAP/REST, particularly at higher QoS
    levels. MQTT QoS level 2 provides assured message delivery, while CoAP/REST only
    provides a best-effort approach. (h) MQTT is a standardized protocol that is widely
    used in the IoT industry. CoAP/REST, while also a standard protocol, is not as
    widely used in the IoT industry and is more commonly used in the machine-to-machine
    (M2M) communications domain. (i) MQTT has a lower overhead than CoAP/REST due
    to its simpler message format and smaller header size. This makes it a better
    option for applications that require low-latency communication and efficient use
    of network resources. Figure 5 serves as a comprehensive analysis of security
    risks and threats associated with the application layer of the Internet of Things
    architecture and is structured logically and systematically, thereby facilitating
    a more thorough understanding of the nature and complexity of these potential
    security issues. Figure 5. IoT risk taxonomy at the application layer. 3. Potential
    Security Issues with the Internet of Things Most Internet-enabled gadgets are
    not built with security in mind. There are, therefore, many inherent risks to
    the safety of the IoT, some of which can be catastrophic. IoT security has a paucity
    of defined standards and regulations compared to other technical solutions. What
    is more, most individuals are unaware that their IoT devices put them at risk.
    Some security challenges afflicting the IoT include a lack of transparency, insufficient
    security integration, vulnerabilities in open-source code, unpatched vulnerabilities,
    insecure APIs (application programming interfaces), and insufficient testing.
    Data, Network and Device Security Cybersecurity must be in place at every stage
    of the lifecycle of an IoT-interconnected environment to protect that infrastructure
    from unauthorized access, alteration, or loss. It is a plan of action that consider
    not only the technological safeties such as firewalls and virus protection but
    also the user protections such as proper authentication and access limitations
    and logical safeguards such as encryption and secure programming for applications.
    Table 2 provides a comprehensive overview of the security challenges in each layer
    and proposes suitable solutions to mitigate these risks. The critical analysis
    of research questions (i.e., attack, portrayal, and purpose) and the extensive
    review of related literature provides the research community with valuable insights
    and guidance in navigating the vast IoT security landscape. Table 2. Threats to
    the security of the Internet of Things. Thus, in context of Table 2, it is evident
    that the security flaws in the IoT may very well have devastating effects on businesses
    and individuals alike. Data theft, cyber-attacks, and the suspension of essential
    services are all possible results of a vulnerability being exploited. In addition
    to the risk of sanctions and legal action, security flaws can increase expenses
    for the companies employing the device. Additionally, hackers can use security
    flaws in IoT devices to access and change the data being transferred from these
    devices in the real world. Last, but not least, security flaws can be exploited
    to cause malfunctions or even total shutdowns of devices or networks. 4. What
    Distinguishes IoT Anomaly Detection from IT Security? The IoT infrastructure can
    vary widely depending on the specific use case and requirements. However, in general,
    a typical IoT infrastructure may include hardware, software, and network components
    such as: (a) Hardware: Microcontroller or microprocessor with low power consumption
    and wireless connectivity (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Zigbee); Sensors and actuators
    for data acquisition and control; Power source (e.g., battery, energy harvesting,
    and power adapter); Memory and storage for data and software; Security features
    (e.g., secure boot, encryption, and access control). (b) Network: Wireless communication
    protocols (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and LoRaWAN); Network topology (e.g.,
    star, mesh, and point-to-point); Gateway or edge device for data aggregation and
    processing; Cloud or server infrastructure for data storage and analysis; Security
    protocols (e.g., SSL/TLS, VPN, firewalls, and intrusion detection/prevention).
    (c) Software: Operating System (e.g., embedded Linux, FreeRTOS, and Zephyr); Middleware
    (e.g., MQTT, CoAP, and AMQP); Database (e.g., Apache Cassandra, MongoDB, and InfluxDB);
    Application Development Tools (applied) (e.g., software development kits (SDKs)
    and integrated development environments (IDEs). In consideration with benchmarking
    details of applied hardware, network and software specifications, when compared
    to standard IT security technologies such as firewalls, IDSs, and Data Security
    and Consequence Administration Procedure (DSCAP), the idea of anomaly discovery
    is very distinct both technologically and in terms of the fundamental monitoring
    strategy. As seen in Table 3, detecting anomalies requires looking within, as
    well as outside of, a network. Anomaly detection is an alternative method of security
    to the more conventional firewalls and intrusion detection systems. When deciding
    whether a certain action poses a risk, both rely on the latest security updates
    released by IT security service providers. As a direct consequence, current strategies
    for protection are continually falling behind potential attackers. As the so-called
    blacklists maintained by security entities are never updated until after an attack
    has already taken place. This kind of patching leaves networks vulnerable to intrusion,
    especially in the IoT/IIoT/IoMT industry, where updates are often delayed preventing
    disruption and failures. Table 3. Limits for detecting anomalies in data. Consequently,
    authenticating IoT devices is crucial to establishing confidence that the devices
    being linked are in fact what they claim to be. Therefore, effective access control
    can regulate who can access and utilize what resources and under what conditions.
    5. Classification of Internet of Things Access Control The term “access control”
    describes a class of security mechanisms that restrict users’ permission to access
    particular components of a networked computing and sensing environment. It is
    a fundamental part of any governance system designed to protect an organization’s
    or a municipality’s Internet of Things infrastructure from outside threats. Access
    control can be physical or logical, depending on the system’s needs being protected.
    An IoT-enabled access control system is a useful tool for ensuring the safety
    of buildings, classrooms, dormitories, and intangible technological assets such
    as servers and computer equipment. Logical access control is a method of controlling
    who may access what is on a network, including computers, servers, and data. Logical
    access control systems examine multiple identifiers such as passwords, PINs, biometric
    scans, cryptographic keys, etc. to verify and provide access to the appropriate
    individuals or entities. Today’s complex IoT landscapes, which include on-premises
    and cloud-based resources, make it difficult to manage an access control system.
    To function, access controls must first determine the identity of the requesting
    device or entity, verify that the requesting process or service is indeed who
    it claims to be, and then allow the requesting account or IP address the privileges
    and access rights corresponding to that identity. Easy-to-Use Reference File systems
    and procedures such as Access Protocol and Security Assertion Markup Language
    are only two examples of the kinds of things that do give access controls by verifying
    and approving users and organizations before providing them access to systems
    and operations. Conclusively, it is worth highlighting variety of access control
    systems available, and it is not uncommon for them to be used in tandem with one
    another as part of an enterprise’s identity and access management (IAM) framework.
    Applications can be installed locally, on the cloud, or in both scenarios. To
    varying degrees, it may prioritize either the internal or external access management
    of an IoT network’s user base. As highlighted in Table 4, in order to determine
    whether a user should be granted access, attribute-based access control (ABAC)
    looks at the user’s characteristics instead of their behavior. The fundamental
    benefit of ABAC is its ease of use, since the underlying technical permission
    settings can be masked behind user profiles, which can be modified by anyone possessing
    the appropriate rights and still ensure the user’s desired degree of access provided
    their attributes are true. Rouhani et al. [114] presented a method that offers
    a degree of transparency to the extent that those requesting access to a resource
    and the administrators of that asset may both advantage from using it. The technique
    that had been proposed presents a system architecture with an application that
    was predicated on Hyperledger Fabric. This technology achieves a high degree of
    effectiveness while maintaining a low level of computation complexity. The viability
    of the suggested approach was demonstrated through the examination of a use case
    involving separate digital libraries. Unfortunately, authors failed to address
    the coefficient of decentralization aspect of futuristic systems. When the Internet
    of Things infrastructure spans more than one point and a portion or all those
    spots run their own identity management, then the IoT infrastructure is said to
    have decentralized access permissions. Such an environment does not have a single,
    consistent policy and mechanism for controlling access to the network. If applied
    access control is not centralized, administration, management, and adherence will
    all be more difficult to manage, which is why it is so important to have logically
    centralized control. Table 4. Access control models and methods for the Internet
    of Things: an analysis. fully triumphed, partially triumphed, not triumphed. Li
    et al. [115] highlighted the ability of CP-WABE to safeguard information security
    on the Internet of Health Things (IoHT) as a crucial component of a highly appreciated
    security technique for attaining flawless access control. To tackle this limitation,
    a novel method of formulating access policies was devised that makes use of 0–1
    coding technology. The strategy’s proponents argue that it can be used to design
    a powerful and adaptable CP-WABE for the IoHT. In the projected method, contextual
    circumstances could enhance each rule’s preset building elements, known as strategy
    bits, which were connected with agents and other functional restrictions. The
    applied steps of reform were: (a) defining rules for adopters, hosts, applications,
    and other entities, as well as activities and resources, (b) forming strategies
    with reusable building blocks called “regulatory elements”, and (c) “governance
    modules”. Access control was tested and found equally effective in firewall, server,
    application, database, and data layer. Song et al. [116], introduced an innovative
    IoT management approach that leverages distributed ledger technology to aid organizations
    in setting up an effective supply chain. The design relies on a peer-to-peer fallback
    procedure, a private data segregation and communication approach, and a security
    token-based authentication and authorization system. The access control system
    was divided into two subsystems: the registrar and the inspection. The primary
    responsibility of the registrar’s role was to enroll data in accordance with a
    registration regulation that must be upheld by all businesses in the supply chain.
    Additionally, it is flexible enough to accommodate rescheduling or even outright
    cancellation. The inspection section monitors the subjects’ behavior and searches
    for signs of misconduct before rendering judgments and handing down penalties.
    Researchers were able to strengthen IoT access control and guarantee the safety
    of all permitted devices by keeping track of all important data and events in
    a distributed ledger. The loss of even a single node in a blockchain network might
    make reaching consensus unfeasible, leading to the eventual collapse of the network.
    The data of the peer with the problem might be lost if it does not commit immediately.
    By employing a backup peer, both the primary and backup peer may connect to the
    inspection server and start collecting real-time data. Without the requirement
    for a dedicated subchannel, sensitive information may be sent and stored utilizing
    the system’s built-in data segregation and communication modules. The projected
    method guaranteed the stability of the system by taking into consideration all
    aspects of network performance and scalability. Considering aforementioned justifications,
    an immutable, transmittable identifier of authority should be used in “capability-based
    access control”. The identification serves as both a link to and authorization
    to utilize a certain resource. To gain access to a feature, a device must go through
    a different channel than the entity itself. Public capabilities may be accessed
    by any device, whereas private ones can be used by only those who have been granted
    access. The IoT node can “borrow” the capability it needs to get a storage pointer
    if it has previously produced and obtained it. Consequently, the form that a capability
    can take upon acquisition is determined at the moment of its creation. Bouras
    et al. [117] presented IoT-CCAC, an IoT consortium-specific distributed capability-based
    access control framework. Since it has the best qualities of both blockchain and
    traditional libraries, a blockchain-based repository is used to achieve excellent
    efficiency. The authorization process confirms (a) the validity of the token,
    (b) the approval of access right, (c) the availability of the asset, and (d) the
    fulfillment of conditions. The IoT-CCAC methodology performed satisfactorily and
    is well suited for smart city and enterprise network use cases. By tracing the
    paths used by credentials, Li et al. [118] proposed “traceable capability-based
    access control (TCAC)” that makes it possible to revoke or modify access permissions.
    To facilitate the verification, denial, and modification of permissions, authors
    designed a novel competence token and established a temporal capability tree (TCT)
    that can produce privilege trends programmatically. Based on the results of the
    tests, TCAC is significantly quicker than both comparative methods, CapBAC [128,129]
    and xDBAuth [130], when it comes to confirming tokens and cancelling or updating
    them. A total of 73.3% of users/devices who were previously unavailable may now
    be located using TCAC’s assignment and random access features. This provides new
    insights into the relationships between permissions and delegation and opens up
    potential strategies for protecting IoT infrastructure throughout the use case
    environment. Fossen [119] advocated a capability-based, four-part approach. When
    interacting with a RESTful API, the web app must save and utilize the tokens granted
    to the user by the “authority-server (AS)”. The AS tracks and controls the tokens
    and functionality. The RESTful API’s filter component does the verification and
    then passes the feature on to the API’s main logic. Logic handles both database
    connectivity and information processing. In a total of nine steps, each part interacts
    with all the others. The filter and the logic were the two main components of
    the RESTful API’s design; the filter was responsible for receiving HTTP requests
    containing access tokens, validating those tokens, and retrieving the corresponding
    attributes before passing them on to the logic. After receiving a request from
    a user, the RESTful API logic runs the requested protocol function for which the
    authority has granted permission. The implemented experiment ensured granular
    control over which API calls were made while using the RESTful interface. The
    framework enabled the programmer to define the user interface options for the
    system. Coarse-grained access control was employed in the traditional library
    implementation, with access representing an entity rather than an attribute of
    content. Unfortunately, a few important design choices (such as, proof-of-concept
    (PoC), delete-all, update-all, read-all, etc. and policy sheets for ruleset API)
    were ignored during access control implementation that restricts supporting complex
    data models. One alternative is to implement “rule-based access control” (RBAC)
    [131]. Using RBAC, admins can grant or revoke privileges to devices based on their
    user profiles and the tasks they need to do. It is possible to categorize devices
    according to their responsibilities, since the amount of system access they need
    is often determined by the tasks they do inside a network. Roles that need access
    to the devices are then granted authorization to do so. If appropriate permissions
    are established for each task, access control will be easy to implement and maintain.
    The procedures of rule-based access control are as follows: the authorization
    rules are implemented throughout the whole access control system and are established
    by the security administrator. After the device has shown its legitimacy, its
    access is granted or denied depending on the comparison between the device’s permissions
    and the group policy. As a result of RBAC, the administrator can save time on
    procedural and ICT (information communication technology) support tasks, make
    the IoT system more secure and compliant, give each user and device only the permissions
    they need to do their job effectively, and free up extra throughput. Saha et al.
    [120] advocated distributed Decentralized Hybrid Access Control for smart contracts
    (DHACS) for the IIoT (industrial Internet of Things). The idea of DHACS was to
    provide a more accessible, dependable, and secure access control mechanism for
    IIoT. The approach depends on the useful properties of blockchain technology,
    particularly the supply of smart contracts that makes possible a decentralized
    heterogeneous access control mechanism. The DHACS consensus process integrated
    many models for access control into a single solution, including role-based models,
    rule-based models, and organizational models. With the current set of ongoing
    operations and their related access constraints in mind, the activity pooler and
    block maker churned out blocks. While DHACS was initially developed for use in
    a private blockchain, it can be simply converted to function with a public blockchain
    or consortium blockchain to accommodate geographically scattered dependencies.
    For blockchain-based permission to be deemed completely decentralized, several
    entities must take part in the process of specifying and evaluating security regulations.
    There are a few challenges with the DHACS, such as how can a decentralized and
    lightweight access control solution be offered for distributed and enhanced IoT
    settings, given that IoT devices have limited computing and storage capacity?
    How can we ensure proper authentication (federated, completely decentralized,
    etc.)? Can an established framework be used, or do many configurations need to
    be combined? What criteria must be met when picking a blockchain scheme (private
    or public)? Attempting to combine RBAC with blockchain technology presented its
    own set of difficulties [132]. The first concern is the incompatibility (lack
    of standardization) of blockchain applications in various contexts and sectors.
    The incompatibility between RBAC and blockchain technology can be addressed by
    designing smart contracts that incorporate RBAC policies. The smart contract can
    specify access control rules based on roles and permissions, and these rules can
    be enforced by the blockchain network. The RBAC policies can be defined by IoT
    network consortium that is deploying the blockchain network, and the smart contract
    can be programmed to ensure that only authorized entities can access the relevant
    resources. The second problem pertains to the amount of power consumed by the
    consensus mechanism that prevents wastage of resources. The process of reaching
    consensus can be energy-intensive, especially when using proof-of-work consensus
    algorithms. The third challenge relates to the latency that can be introduced
    by the additional bandwidth requirements of the blockchain network. Finally, implementing
    blockchain protocols in practical, nonindustrial environments presents a significant
    challenge. Ubiquitous security can be achieved in a specific IoT context by enforcing
    security regulations, closed-loop monitoring, simplifying governance, and implementing
    comprehensive defense. PerBAC (pervasive-based access control model) was based
    on a strategy presented by El Bouanani et al. [121] that was developed after extensive
    research was conducted on several well-known access controls. This strategy was
    being distinguished by its interpretation of the decision-making algorithm, its
    depiction of abstract entities with features as a core principle, and the collaboration
    aspects necessary to maintain the case under a wide range of network conditions.
    When this algorithm is paired with information gathered from IoT environments,
    it could help improve access control decisions based on dynamic rules and entities.
    The proposed comprehension of the features, the dynamic entities, and their exploitation
    through the “aco” protocol generates a unique access control model tailored for
    the IoT paradigm. Thus, as per aforementioned context, in order to establish a
    safe connection between a client device and a server across a network, the server
    must first broadcast an identity to the client device. The service can comply
    with the user’s request if the identification is entered when the user is physically
    close to the service. Pervasive secure access is distinguished by its ability
    to detect risk at each point of interconnection using a variety of techniques
    (such as spotting anomalies in client behavior or considering contextual clues
    such as location and device, etc.) and to request enhanced authentication from
    the client only when necessary. Yu et al. [125] proposed an Internet of Things
    (IoT) supply chain “secure data sharing scheme (SDSM)” that integrates blockchain
    technology with ciphertext-based entity encoding. This method can be used to set
    up tiered partnerships with different levels of access permissions. In addition,
    scholars proposed a metric based on the blockchain’s history ledger that could
    be used to rapidly establish the extent of relationships among users. To support
    partnership-based access controls, the approach combines participant-specific
    features into the ciphertext-based attribute cryptosystem. As a result, access
    permissions can be fine-tuned to a greater degree. It is expected that, by 2025,
    edge devices such as smartphones, wearables, connected automobiles, and so on
    would be responsible for creating 10% of all content and processing 45% of all
    data [133]. Fog computing is expected to replace artificial intelligence, Internet
    of Things application development, and fifth-generation wireless networks (5G)
    within the next five years. It is an extremely virtualized system that connects
    user devices to traditional cloud data centers for storage and processing power.
    Fog computing is characterized by its low latency, position tracking, edge location,
    extensibility, real-time data and cloud interface, and online interaction support.
    To prevent modifications to cache and increase its reliability, Wang et al. [123]
    proposed a new lightweight label-based access control system (LACS). In order
    to ensure security, LACS checks the legitimacy of the approved fog nodes. Specifically,
    the LACS might verify the fog nodes’ eligibility for access to the caching service
    by verifying the authenticity of the shareable files containing encoded label
    values. Increasing efficiency and minimizing risks were the driving forces for
    the creation of LACS. The proposed technique successfully removed the noise source
    (the malicious fog node), freeing up some additional space for data storage, network
    bandwidth, and computational resources. However, its execution time must be reduced
    to the lowest possible measurable value (in milliseconds). On top of that, it
    verifies that requests are coming from approved fog nodes before denying them.
    In fog-enhanced IoT systems, Zhang et al. [127] presented an outsourced access
    control scheme with hidden access structures (OAC-HAS). Three distinct benefits
    result from the OAC-HAS approach. In the first place, it presents a fog-cloud
    computing (FCC) setting that could be used for outsourcing. Then, it creates a
    method for external verification to ensure the integrity of data encryption activities
    carried out by fog nodes. Finally, it ensures confidentiality by sealing off access
    points to sensitive data. The suggested OAC-HAS method accomplishes a dynamic
    access policy, protects users’ privacy, and provides better precision in fog-enhanced
    IoT systems, as evidenced by the security evaluation and experimental outcomes.
    In order to share information with gateways, applications, servers, and cloud
    infrastructures, IoT devices require reliable connections to the aforementioned
    nodes. Communication between devices and the cloud must be continuous and two-way
    for there to be an IoT. Remember that a good proof-of-concept may fail when deployed
    globally; therefore, make connectivity a major priority early in your Internet
    of Things project to avoid problems later on. The majority of internet connections
    today originate from cellular devices. Since it leverages already-existent global
    networks, cellular IoT is an obvious choice for many applications. Since cellular
    networks are already present in virtually every region of the world, the IoT was
    able to leverage this preexisting infrastructure. Lee et al. [124] introduced
    a density-clustering based “base station (BS)” modulation solution for lowering
    the power requirements of IoT networks (DeCoNet). To determine the optimal number
    of BSs and their optimal locations while accounting for differences in user density,
    experts used features gathered via density clustering methods to design the narrowing
    perimeter used to change the status of BSs in complete cellular IoT networks.
    Researchers determined the boundaries of each cluster’s area by averaging the
    distance between the cluster’s farthest border users in DBSCAN with the average
    routing in OPTICS. System-wide security necessitates network level slicing, the
    protection of application-based functions both in distributed clouds and in edge
    computing interconnections. In mobile telecommunication networks, there are four
    main routing components: the radio access network, the core network, the transport
    network, and the linking channel. Different types of traffic—signaling, data,
    and management—are carried by different layers of the network architecture. Every
    “sector” in a network consists of these three components. With regards to cybersecurity,
    all three layers are open to various forms of attack. The three-dimensional world
    is vulnerable to several threats that are universal. The access control system
    of a mobile network is essential. If the security of the core network or the management
    systems is breached, it might put the entire mobile network’s services at danger.
    By applying suitable access control, reduction in data consumption and increased
    energy efficiency can be achieved. Sivaselvan et al. [126] argued that the software
    deployment of authentication protocols in IoT is riddled with security flaws,
    rendering the built-in authentication method useless. However, several of the
    security threats that are common on the Internet of Things can compromise the
    existing authentication methods for IoT that are not based on firmware. In addition,
    there are gaps in context-awareness, accessibility, compatibility, and cybersecurity
    in the state-of-the-art methods to access control for the Internet of Things.
    Due to these constraints, a reliable authentication and authorization solution
    was required to protect the ever-increasing number of IoT devices. As a result,
    Sivaselvan presented SUACC-IoT, a secure and trustworthy universal authentication
    and access management solution for the Internet of Things. Capabilities served
    as the foundation for the planned system, with each capacity acting as a token
    that granted authorized organizations access to the network. The capability token
    is utilized in the proposed system to manage and approve usage of scarce IoT resources.
    Simple cryptographic building blocks such as symmetric key encryption/decryption,
    message authentication codes, and cryptographic hashes are all that are required
    to operate the system. It was shown that SUACC-IoT is safe from the types of attacks
    often used in the IoT, including those that can be executed in probabilistic polynomial
    time. Conclusively, it is worth highlighting that multiple factors increase the
    difficulty of implementing authentication and authorization protocols in an IoT
    setting. That is because most devices are typically limited by their battery,
    memory, network speed, and computing power. The throughput of popular authentication
    protocols makes most conventional verification and permission approaches unfeasible
    to run on resource constrained IoT devices. Another issue is that devices are
    occasionally placed in locations where it would be challenging or impossible to
    implement physical security measures. In addition to this, there is an extremely
    diverse selection of hardware and software stacks that must be taken into consideration.
    As a result, in comparison to more conventional computer settings, we see widespread
    use of a wide variety of devices interacting via a wide variety of standards and
    protocols. 5.1. Cryptographic Paradigm in IoT To ensure that only authorized entities
    have access to data transmitted across IoT networks, cryptography can be used
    for authentication and encryption. When it comes to cryptography in the IoT, there
    are a few tried-and-true methods. Symmetric key encryption [134,135] is often
    used to secure confidential data because of its efficiency and speed. Another
    kind of encryption used in the IoT is public key encryption [136,137], which uses
    a pair of keys—a public one for encrypting and a private one for decrypting. Encrypting
    data with asymmetric keys takes more time, but the private key is never exposed,
    making this technique safer. Cryptography with elliptic curves [138,139], in addition
    to symmetric key algorithms, is used in the IoT. Digital signatures that can be
    used for authentication are generated using elliptic curve cryptography. Lastly,
    a process called hashing [140,141], in which the data is converted into a code
    of a set length, can be used to assure data integrity. This technique ensures
    that no data has been altered in transit. To confine the research boundary, we
    have identified the following lemmas: (a) An IoT device’s security measures must
    meet the standards set forth by the IoT device application. An “always-on” interoperability
    method is preferable to the periodic activation and deactivation of communication
    networks when an IoT system application has to transfer data often. Data from
    IoT devices should be gathered as efficiently as possible and compressed before
    being sent over the network. Coordinating several IoT Services delivered by a
    single communications module within a single IoT device application is essential
    for making efficient use of the network. To avoid seeming as though they are all
    functioning unison, application software operating on IoT devices should utilize
    a random pattern to request network connection. The data should be encrypted from
    edge to edge using the IoT system software. Before beginning any data transfer,
    the IoT device application must verify that it can communicate with the IoT platform.
    The level of security provided by the encryption technique should be commensurate
    with the IoT Service. (b) The IoT-based technology must follow all required communication
    specifications. The application running on the IoT device should not have to constantly
    reestablish the modem’s network connection. When an Internet of Things device
    framework does not require constant information exchange and therefore may function
    with some delay in its IoT Service. (c) IoT infrastructure should follow the throughput,
    latency, and yield-related parameters. The Internet of Things device application
    must include “temporal resynchronization” capability, both for local and distant
    connections. In order to conduct an accurate comparison of the various Internet
    of Things devices regarding communication technology and interoperability, there
    are a few essential factors that need to be taken into consideration. These crucial
    aspects include the type of protocol that is now being utilized, the spectrum
    of the connectivity, the throughput, the reaction time, the power efficiency,
    and the dependability. Zigbee [7], Wi-Fi [8], Bluetooth [9], LoRaWAN [14], and
    Z-wave [142] are just some of the popular choices accessible when it comes to
    protocols. There are also a lot of other possibilities available. It is essential
    to keep in mind that the kind of protocol and interface that is utilized will
    change depending on the particular application, as well as the devices that are
    being utilized. For instance, if two different devices need to communicate with
    one another across a considerable distance, then a wireless protocol such as LoRaWAN
    may be the ideal option. On the other hand, if two devices need to communicate
    with one another over a short distance and the amount of data being sent is minimal,
    then a wired protocol such as Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) may be the superior
    option. As a result, cryptography is applied in Internet of Things (IoT) deployments
    to safeguard the communication that occurs between the various devices. As a result,
    cryptography is applied in Internet of Things (IoT) deployments to safeguard the
    communication that occurs between the various devices. Examples of typical cryptographic
    approaches that are utilized in Internet of Things (IoT) communication include
    asymmetric-key algorithms such as Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and hash functions
    such as the Secure Hash Algorithm. Both algorithms are used to hash data. Another
    illustration of this would be symmetric-key algorithms such as the Advanced Encryption
    Standard (AES) (SHA). Additionally, cryptography can be used to safeguard the
    identities of devices on a network and to guarantee that data does not become
    corrupted or altered while it is being transmitted from one point to another.
    Figure 4 illustrates the organizational structure for the classification of cryptographic
    techniques used on the Internet of Things. There is a basic difference between
    symmetric and asymmetric encryption in that the former uses the same key for both
    encryption and decryption, while the latter uses two different keys—one public
    and one private. When compared to symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption
    is more secure but slower and less efficient, because the private key is not shared.
    5.1.1. Symmetric Ciphering Block Cipher Methods Using a symmetric block cipher,
    information is encrypted and decrypted in chunks of a fixed size. Combining it
    with an authentication mechanism that uses a secret key to encode and decode the
    data adds an extra layer of security, such as Hash-based Message Authentication
    Code (HMAC) [143] or Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC) [144]. Block
    ciphers can be used in many different modes of operation, allowing for the creation
    of novel encryption systems. In the IoT, block cipher methods provide strong encryption
    for secure data transmission and are well-suited for low-power devices due to
    their efficiency. However, these methods can be vulnerable to attacks if the encryption
    key is compromised or if there are implementation errors, and they may introduce
    processing delays, which can be problematic for real-time applications. Data Encryption
    Standard (DES) IoT networks frequently use the symmetric key encryption method
    known as Data Encryption Standard (DES) [145] to safeguard sensitive data in transit.
    It is a tried-and-true method of keeping sensitive data safe, and it is still
    widely employed today. When encrypting data, DES employs the Feistel network and
    a 56-bit key. Due to the rapid advancement of technology, DES is no longer encouraged
    for use in new applications because of its weak key size in comparison to more
    modern algorithms. A more secure alternative to the DES algorithm is Triple DES
    (3DES) [146]. When compared to the original DES algorithm, 3DES’s key benefit
    is the greater security it provides. Since it employs not just one but three 56-bit
    keys, 3DES is considerably harder to crack than DES, which only employs a single
    56-bit key. In addition, assaults such as related-key attacks are harder to pull
    off against 3DES. Last, but not least, 3DES is compatible with DES, making the
    transition from DES to 3DES a simple one. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Alternatively,
    there are three different key lengths available when using an Advanced Encryption
    Standard (AES) [147] to encrypt data: 128 bits, 192 bits, and 256 bits. An AES
    key used in an IoT network must be securely maintained and periodically updated
    to prevent unauthorized access. Computational complexity is the fundamental downside
    of AES. Compared to other symmetric encryption methods such as DES, it is a sluggish
    algorithm. Additionally, AES encryption necessitates extra memory, which might
    be an issue in embedded systems with constrained resources [148]. TwoFish An improved
    version of the TwoFish encryption algorithm was presented by Hsiao et al. [149],
    which used a systematic method of design in conjunction with a chaotic masking-based
    method of exchanging encrypted data. Data transmissions employing chaotic synchronization
    have recently been called into question owing to attacks by hackers who deny data
    across the public network. Therefore, the TwoFish encryption method was combined
    with a chaotic synchronization strategy to foil hacker attacks. By doing so, the
    encrypted communication is shielded in a more secure network for transferring
    information. During our assessment, we found that the enormous block size (i.e.,
    block size of 128 bits, which can support a key size of 256 bits) and complicated
    key scheduling of the TwoFish algorithm make it unsuitable for hardware implementation.
    On top of that, as compared to other block ciphers, the algorithm’s slowness makes
    it less acceptable for use in contexts that necessitate rapid processing. In addition,
    unlike more common algorithms such as AES. TwoFish is a highly secure encryption
    algorithm that uses a large block size and key size, which makes it resistant
    to brute force attacks. Due to the computationally intensive nature of this encryption
    algorithm, it may not be suitable for IoT devices with limited processing power
    and resources. Nevertheless, TwoFish has not been the subject of much cryptographic
    examination because of its low adoption rate. It is possible that this might lead
    to yet-undetected security flaws. Figure 6 presents a taxonomy of cryptographic
    methods applied in the IoT environment. This diagram systematically analyzes the
    security threats present in the IoT environment and the various cryptographic
    methods that can be employed to mitigate those risks. The taxonomy categorizes
    cryptographic methods into four primary groups: symmetric, asymmetric, ciphering
    protocols and hashing methods. Each group has several subcategories that describe
    the specific encryption methods that can be used in the IoT environment. Comprehensive
    details are furnished in subsequent sections. Figure 6. Taxonomy of cryptographic
    methods applied in the IoT environment. Stream Cipher Methods By using the exclusive-or
    (XOR) function, stream ciphers combine a stream of plaintext sequences with a
    stream of pseudorandom cryptographic hash sequences to encrypt data. If used properly,
    stream ciphers can provide a robust layer of security for a wide range of communications
    settings, including wireless networks, the Internet, and associated transactions
    [150]. In order to encrypt data, stream ciphers frequently use a keystream that
    is calculated from a secret key. Data bits or bytes are encrypted using the keystream,
    and then, the keystream is discarded. RC4 The RC4 stream cipher [151] is now among
    the most widely used encryption tools because of its efficiency and simplicity
    of implementation. This stream cipher operates in bytes and allows for a wide
    range of key sizes. Depending on the use case, it can employ either a 64-bit or
    128-bit key size. RC4 is a popular cipher; however, it has several security weaknesses
    that make it less secure than others, such as AES. Furthermore, a brute force
    attack against RC4 may be used to recreate the key if the attacker has enough
    time and the message digests. Given this, it is clear that alternative ciphers
    such as AES should be used wherever possible. 2. Salsa20 A 256-bit key payload
    encryption that does not preserve keystream blocks across transmissions is the
    specialty of the Salsa20 crypt family [152]. When set to counter mode, Salsa20
    functions as a stream cipher that uses a checksum function to encrypt and decrypt
    64-byte messages. This is why it is widely used in many encrypted contexts and
    considered safe. Salsa20′s limited 64-bit nonce input hampers its usefulness in
    many applications. As a result of putting an emphasis on encoding efficiency rather
    than security, Salsa20 can become susceptible to certain attacks (i.e., side-channel
    attacks such as timing attacks) [153]. It can also be difficult to discern if
    decoding was successful, as there is no “crib” or known value in the plaintext.
    The lack of message integrity in Salsa20 presents an additional security risk
    that may reduce trustworthiness. 3. ChaCha20-Poly1305 The ChaCha20 [154] stream
    cipher generates a legitimate, seemingly random stream of bits by combining the
    outcomes of three basic arithmetic operations: addition, rotation, and exclusive-or
    (XOR). To guarantee the authenticity of a communication, Poly1305 authenticators
    generate two tags, an authentication tag and a verification tag. The ChaCha20-Poly1305
    [155] method has a longer nonce intervals and was developed for collision-free
    random number generation. The ChaCha20-Poly1305 algorithm has certain problems
    because of its susceptibility to spoofing attacks. This means that a threat actor
    can create communications that seem to come from a wanted source while in reality
    they are falsified. The method is also susceptible to key reuse attacks, in which
    an adversary encrypts messages using a single nonce and decrypts them using a
    different key. Lastly, but not least, the method is vulnerable to collisions.
    As a result, an adversary who discovers two communications sharing the same authentication
    tag may be able to generate a third message using the same tag. 4. Grain 128a
    Grain 128a [156] is a 128-bit key cipher that has an initialization vector (IV)
    that is 96 bits long and an output stream that is 128 bits long. A linear shift
    register, a nonlinear shift register, and an output function are the fundamental
    building blocks of the Grain-128a. Grain-128a is a lightweight cryptographic algorithm
    suitable for resource-constrained IoT devices. As a result of its birthday paradox
    vulnerability [157], Grain-128a is an insecure system. This indicates that the
    cipher’s security could be breached if an adversary gained access to the pre-output
    stream and utilized it to find a distinguisher that could be used to divulge the
    key. Such an attack would impair the cipher’s ability to keep information private.
    As a result of its slow key setup time, Grain-128a is also unsuitable for applications
    that need speed. Since, Grain-128a has a maximum key size of 128 bits, which could
    be inadequate for certain applications. 5. A5 Family The most widely recognized
    use for the A5 family of symmetric stream ciphers is as the cryptographic protocols
    used in mobile broadband and subsequent technologies. The A5 algorithms [158]
    are developed with a primary emphasis on both efficiency and safety, and they
    are meant to run on inexpensive, commodity servers. GSM is susceptible to attacks
    due to several shortcomings, one of which being the relatively short key length
    utilized in A5. The design and implementation of the algorithms are both incorrect,
    and both can be exploited by attackers, even those with limited computer capability.
    The decryption process might take place in a timeframe that is exceptionally near
    to real time. (a) A5/1 A5/1 is utilized to construct a 114 input bits of output
    sequence for every spurt, and then that string is XORed with the 114 bits before
    the burst is modulated [159]. The initialization of A5/1 is accomplished by utilizing
    a 64-bit key in conjunction with a publicly available 22-bit subscript. The A5/1
    cipher has a number of benefits, some of which include its relatively high resilience
    to well-known attacks, as well as its relatively minimal overhead, which makes
    it acceptable for usage on low-power devices. In addition to this, the key size
    is rather manageable, which contributes to its overall ease of implementation.
    The A5/1 cipher is vulnerable to linear and differential cryptanalysis, and its
    unchanging key requires regular key changes to stay secure. In addition, because
    of its minimal computing overhead, it is susceptible to cyber-attacks using brute
    force. (b) A5/2 A weaker version A5/2 was proposed to offer a scalable solution
    for inter-GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) network communication,
    allowing for backwards compatibility with older GSM hardware [160]. A5/2′s benefits
    lie in its minimal complexity and its capability to offer robust encryption with
    a small key size. As an added bonus, it has a significant degree of protection
    against common plaintext vulnerabilities. However, A5/2 has several drawbacks,
    such as being vulnerable to statistical attacks and not being capable of providing
    reliable encryption with larger key lengths. The key used to encode a particular
    message can be determined by an intruder using a related key attack, which A5/2
    is vulnerable to. (c) A5/3 The Kasumi algorithm [161], created by Mitsubishi Electric,
    is a block cipher utilized in 3G and LTE (long-term evolution) cellular standards,
    and it forms the basis of the succeeding version A5/3 [158,162]. Security analysis
    has shown that A5/3, which employs a 128-bit key, is impervious to all currently
    known attacks. The encryption of A5/3 is more secure, it can withstand more known
    plaintext attacks, and it provides better performance in embedded applications.
    The intricacy of the system increases the effort required for both configuration
    and administration, which is a drawback. In addition, A5/3 is more computationally
    complex than A5/1, which makes it more power-hungry and, as a result, less appropriate
    for usage in portable electronic devices. 6. HC-128 Wireless communications, secure
    data storage, and secure access to content are just some of the many use cases
    for HC-128, which is built to withstand linear and differential cryptanalysis
    [163]. OpenSSL [164] and Botan [165] are two examples of cryptographic libraries
    that support it, and its specifications can be found in RFC 4503 [166]. The HC-128
    stream cipher is a great option because of its high level of security and reliable
    implementation. In addition to being extremely quick, it also requires relatively
    little memory. Key sizes can be anything from 64 bits up to 128 bits, providing
    an extra layer of protection. Unfortunately, the requirement for a reasonably
    large array of 4 kb is the most significant shortcoming of the HC-128 method.
    This can be problematic for use when memory is constrained. The method is novel
    and not as frequently used as other algorithms, therefore interoperability concerns
    across applications are possible. 7. Rabbit It is quite safe, since it uses 128-bit
    keys and a 64-bit initialization vector [167]. Compared to other popular encryption
    algorithms, Rabbit stands out due to its exceptional software efficiency, with
    a stated encryption/decryption throughput of 3.7 clock cycles per byte on a Core
    i7 CPU. It is effective in both software and hardware setups. Compared to other
    symmetric encryption techniques, Rabbit is more secure because it uses more complex
    functions for key formation and configuration transitions. These characteristics
    make it harder for an attacker to guess the cipher’s output. Furthermore, Rabbit
    is resistant to timing attacks since it encrypts each byte of data in the same
    amount of time. One limitation that Rabbit cipher may exhibit is that it uses
    a linear feedback shift register, which is not as secure as other applied algorithms
    [168]. Moreover, it has a limited key length of 128 bits, which makes it vulnerable
    to brute force attacks. 5.1.2. Asymmetric Ciphering Asymmetric Ciphering is used
    in the IoT for encryption and authentication. It offers scalability and flexibility
    for IoT applications, making it a great choice for secure communication. If there
    is a requirement for secure communication between two or more devices without
    the sharing of private keys, asymmetric encryption is the way to go. Its widespread
    use has led to its implementation in several practical contexts, including digital
    signatures and encrypted digital communication. Use cases for asymmetric encryption
    include remote access, file transmission, and the exchange of sensitive information.
    Furthermore, authentication and permission for safe access to networks and services
    are commonly provided using asymmetric encryption. Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA)
    Crypto Algorithm RSA is a public key encryption method used in encryption for
    IoT technologies [169]. The RSA method is widely utilized in IoT applications,
    including SSL/TLS certificates, data encryption, and secure communication because
    of its reputation as an efficient and safe algorithm. The RSA method depends on
    how challenging it is to factor a huge integer into its prime components. The
    method employs both a public and private key for encoding and decoding. During
    our analysis and investigation, we have found that if the communication entity
    loses the private key, it becomes irreparable and may lead to security compromise.
    Furthermore, an adversary can read all communications if it controls the private
    key. The size of the payload of an RSA-encrypted communication varies with the
    length of the message and the size of the RSA key. The typical payload size for
    a 2048-bit key is about 256 bytes. Although RSA supports encryption keys of any
    length, the most common sizes are 1024, 2048, and 4096 bits. Encryption is more
    robust when using bigger key sizes. The advantages of using RSA in IoT include
    strong security, widely accepted and implemented, and suitability for key management.
    However, its disadvantages include high computational requirements, slower processing
    speed, and vulnerability to certain attacks if not implemented correctly. Digital
    Signature Standards (DSS) In order to ensure that all data transmitted over the
    internet is secure and legitimate, IoT relies on the Digital Signature Standard
    (DSS) [170,171]. The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) defines methods
    for digital signature generation and verification. By using a specific DSS, information
    can be protected from modification during transmission. It also serves as an authentication
    mechanism for safe access to network-based resources. The major shortcoming of
    DSS is that there are many different digital signature standards and most of them
    are incompatible with each other, which complicates the sharing of data streams.
    Depending on the technique and the message length, the payload size of a DSS signature
    can range from very small to very large. The standard payload size is between
    40 and 50 bytes. DSS encryption keys are normally 1024 bits in length; however,
    this length can be increased for certain uses. For even more protection, IoT devices
    can make use of encryption keys that are 2048 bits in length or more. Elliptical
    Curve Cryptography (ECC) Public key encryption using elliptic curves (also known
    as Elliptic Curve Cryptography or ECC) allows for the generation of cryptographic
    keys that are lower in size, more secure, and more quickly generated than other
    methods [172]. As an alternative to the RSA cryptographic technique, ECC is widely
    utilized in applications and data storage. Due to its low power consumption, short
    key size, and efficiency in encryption and decryption, ECC is well suited for
    usage in IoT devices. ECC is utilized in digital signatures, encrypted file transfers,
    encrypted emails, and secure network access. The ECC security relies on the difficult-to-solve
    elliptic curve discrete logarithm challenge. The payload size of ECC is determined
    by the type of ECC algorithm that is being used in conjunction with the length
    of the encryption key. The payload of an encrypted message is proportional to
    the size of the encryption key. For instance, the payload size and required encryption
    key size for ECC NIST P-256 and ECC NIST P-384 are both 256 and 384 bits, respectively
    [173]. Regrettably, ECC necessitates more computing power and memory than alternative
    public key techniques. Moreover, compared to other public key methods, ECC is
    more susceptible to quantum computing attacks; hence, it is essential to use a
    key size that is high enough to offer the appropriate level of security. Thus,
    ECC offers strong security with smaller key sizes, making it ideal for resource
    constrained IoT devices. However, its implementation requires more computational
    power than traditional cryptography, which can impact performance and increase
    power consumption. NTRUEncrypt The lattice-based encryption system NTRUEncrypt
    [174] can be used to offer post-quantum security for IoT devices. Its lightweight
    architecture makes it ideal for protecting devices with limited resources, such
    as those seen in IoT (Internet of Things) implementations in the linked home,
    industrial, and automotive sectors. Since it makes effective use of resources,
    NTRUEncrypt is also an appealing solution for delivering post-quantum security
    to IoT devices. This makes it an interesting alternative. Depending on the message
    length and the NTRU key size, the NTRUEncrypt payload size will vary. The normal
    payload size for the APR2011_439 configuration [175] is roughly 54 bytes. Keys
    greater than 439 bits are supported by NTRUEncrypt, however this is the default
    length. There is a direct correlation between key size and encryption security;
    bigger keys are more robust. The primary drawback of NTRUEncrypt is the potential
    for higher storage and transmission costs due to the size of its public keys.
    The size of the key used determines how secure it is, and it can be computationally
    costly. 5.1.3. Ciphering Protocols IoT ciphering techniques are applied to encrypt
    data in transit to the cloud or between IoT devices. Verification and encoding
    are often used together in these systems. Cryptographic protocols such as IPSec,
    S/MIME, TLS, and SSH are used to secure data and communications over the internet.
    IPSec is a suite of protocols used for authentication and encryption of IP packets,
    while S/MIME is used for secure data transmission. TLS is the successor to SSL
    and is used to secure web traffic using HTTPS. Finally, SSH is a secure shell
    protocol used for secure remote logins and file transfers. Internet Protocol Security
    (IPSec) Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header (AH) are
    two instances of the suite of protocols known collectively as Internet Protocol
    Security (IPSec) [176]. The AH protocol protects the validity and integrity of
    the IP packet, whereas the ESP protocol protects privacy and secrecy. Due to the
    fact that one of the most important goals of the Internet of Things is to ensure
    the safety of data while it is being transmitted between various devices and the
    cloud, IPSec has become increasingly popular. IPv6, the Internet’s next-generation
    protocol, incorporates IPSec by default; nonetheless, IPSec is backwards compatible
    with IPv4. Additionally, IPSec is not just backwards compatible with protocols
    such as TCP/UDP but also with cryptosystems such as the RSA and Digital Signature
    Algorithm (DSA). Furthermore, it can send data across public networks safely,
    since it can tunnel past network address translation (NAT) and firewalls [177].
    Our analysis found that IPSec’s configuration and management can be challenging,
    making it one of the protocol’s key downsides. Moreover, IPSec requires two distinct
    protocols—the AH protocol and the ESP protocol—both of which can be challenging
    to maintain with and debug. In addition to that, IPSec is not equipped to deal
    with multicast traffic; thus, it could not work for your needs. Conversely, IPSec
    does not guarantee the confidentiality of transmitted data, since it does not
    provide end-to-end encryption. Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)
    The Internet of Things uses the encryption standard S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose
    Internet Mail Extensions) while transferring data across the network [178]. In
    order to perform its two main functions, S/MIME requires the use of digital certificates
    for verification and encryption. When it comes to protecting the data provided
    by Internet of Things devices, enterprises can rest easy knowing that S/MIME provides
    the highest degree of encryption available. Users may quickly and easily adopt
    this protocol to secure their Internet-connected devices, because S/MIME is compatible
    with Windows IoT. S/MIME’s include authentication, nonrepudiation, data integrity,
    and encryption. S/MIME requires a user to have an X.509 digital certificate with
    both a public key and a private key in order to function. Encryption is performed
    with the public key, whereas digital signatures are generated with the private
    key. A communication can only be secure if it is encrypted using the recipient’s
    public key before being sent. Digital signatures require the sender to sign the
    communication using their own private key. For verification, the recipient will
    utilize the sender’s public key. In addition, S/MIME supports secure file transfer
    protocols such as FTPS and SFTP, and it can also be used for secure data transmission
    utilizing Transport Layer Security (TLS) [179]. Lastly, S/MIME also serves to
    establish a secure connection between web servers. One of the limitations of S/MIME
    is that it is not always feasible to authenticate the sender’s identity, which
    might lead to security concerns with regard to the management of identities. Thus,
    S/MIME is a suitable choice for IoT devices that require secure communication
    with end-to-end encryption and digital signatures to protect sensitive data. Nonetheless,
    the need for exchanging public keys can pose difficulties in deploying it on a
    large scale. Moreover, the intricate and resource-intensive implementation of
    S/MIME can have an impact on the performance of devices with limited resources.
    Transport Layer Security (TLS) To protect sensitive information and guarantee
    message authenticity, integrity, and nonrepudiation, TLS is utilized. TLS enables
    authentication using digital certificates and supports several different encryption
    techniques [180]. TLS also reinforces a number of key exchange protocols, such
    as RSA and Diffie-Hellman, in order to enable clients and servers to engage in
    secure connection handshakes with one another. TLS 1.3 is the most recent version
    of the protocol, and it incorporates a few extra security measures [181]. These
    additional security features include forbidding Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4) negotiation,
    perfect forward secrecy (PFS), and required message-digest-5 algorithm (MD5) cryptographic
    hashes. The overhead that relates to the TLS protocol can be problematic for IoT
    servers that have a restricted amount of processing power and memory. This is
    one of the downsides of the TLS protocol. In addition, TLS has the potential to
    be susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks [182]. However, TLS can also
    increase the processing overhead and communication latency, which may be problematic
    in resource-constrained IoT devices with limited processing power and battery
    life. Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) IoT makes use of a network protocol known as
    the secure shell protocol (SSH) to provide safe access to a variety of resources
    and systems. SSH is utilized in the process of securing, configuring, managing,
    maintaining, and operating network routers, servers, and other components of core
    network [183]. Authentication, data encryption, and data integrity are all covered
    by SSH protocols. An SSH connection encrypts data and communication between two
    devices. Data is encrypted with a symmetric key algorithm while using SSH, such
    as with AES or DES. In addition to this, it authenticates the user by employing
    an asymmetric key method, such as RSA, to exchange keys with them. When authenticating
    communications, SSH is also capable of using a variety of hashing algorithms,
    such as SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) and MD5. In addition, the SSH protocol
    supports a variety of tunneling protocols, such as port forwarding and X11 forwarding,
    which enables users to safely tunnel network connections by using the SSH protocol.
    Since SSH does not provide authentication of the server, an IoT device could not
    be aware if a malicious server is being utilized, because SSH does not support
    authentication of the server. As SSH is not inherently compatible with a few operating
    systems (e.g., Tizen OS v4.0), it is possible that additional software may need
    to be installed in order to use it [184]. This is another one of SSH’s many downsides.
    In fact, SSH is known to make extensive use of a server’s resources, which might
    inhibit its overall performance. In addition, SSH calls for the use of an external
    authentication system and calls for the environment to be appropriately set up
    for security. 5.1.4. Hashing (Integrity) IoT apps employ hashing algorithms such
    as MD5 and SHA-1 to keep data safe. Hash methods are used to generate a fixed-length
    outcome from an input of arbitrary length. The hash has the potential to detect
    any modifications to the primary data, making the latter unchangeable and secure
    [185]. SHA-1 and SHA-2 are the two most common secure hashing algorithms. SHA-1
    is a relatively ambivalent algorithm that generates a 160-bit hash, while SHA-2
    is more secure and generates a 256-bit hash. The most up-to-date member of the
    family, SHA-3, generates a hash value of 512 bits [186]. The fundamental benefit
    of adopting hashing algorithms in Internet of Things applications is that they
    provide a safe method of authenticating data, ensuring that the data has not been
    tampered with and is originating from a trustworthy source [187]. Hashing algorithms
    are perfect for use in encryption, since they are quick to compute and produce
    a different hash for each input. SHA-1 SHA-1 creates a 160-bit hash, considerably
    boosting the security and integrity of stored data. In order to verify that information
    has not been tampered with in transit, the SHA-1 technique is used to generate
    a unique hash for each input. SHA-1 is widely used in IoT applications since it
    is fast and can generate a different hash for each input, and it is also significantly
    faster than its counterparts [188]. To verify that a message has not been tampered
    with, another technique called HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) is
    used, and it makes use of SHA-1. The primary drawback of SHA-1 is that it lacks
    security; as a result, it is now deemed obsolete and is no longer recommended
    for use in applications that need high levels of security. SHA-2 Numerous IoT
    implementations rely on the secure hashing technique SHA-2 for data transmission
    and storage. It is a hash function used in cryptography that generates an output
    of a predetermined length from the input. When compared to its predecessor, the
    Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1), SHA-2 offers increased security and resistance
    to common attack vectors [189]. To generate a fixed-length hash from an input
    message of arbitrary length, SHA-2 relies on the Merkle-Damgard technique. It
    is made up of four individual algorithms: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512
    [190]. The hashing algorithms SHA-224 and SHA-256 use 32-bit blocks, whereas SHA-384
    and SHA-512 employ 64-bit blocks. SHA-2′s key benefits are its security, speed,
    and reliability. The security provided by SHA-2 is far superior to its predecessor,
    SHA-1. In addition, it is quicker than SHA-1, which makes it applicable for a
    far wider variety of applications. As an added bonus, SHA-2 is secure, since it
    can withstand lengthier attacks [191]. The most significant disadvantage of SHA-2
    is its compatibility, since the length of the hash, which is 256 bits, may be
    excessively large for certain applications. SHA-3 Internet of Things applications
    use the cryptographically robust hashing algorithm SHA-3 to hash data securely.
    Using SHA-3′s hashes is a reliable way to ensure the safety and privacy of data
    with a 512-bit size [152]. SHA-3 is a reliable hashing algorithm, since it cannot
    be compromised by collision attacks [192], unlike SHA-1 and SHA-2. Furthermore,
    SHA-3 is superior to other algorithms in speed and its ability to generate a different
    hash for each input, making it a prime candidate for use in cryptography. The
    main problem of SHA-3 is compatibility concerns. Incompatibilities can occur between
    applications and Runtime environments that do not support SHA-3. The 512-bit hash
    length may also be excessive for some applications. MD5 IoT applications frequently
    use MD5 (message-digest-5), a cryptographic hash function, for purposes including
    data error checking, authentication, and digital signatures. It is designed to
    have minimal collisions and has a low computational cost [193]. Therefore, it
    can be implemented in systems that need a high level of safety. MD5′s key benefits
    in IoT applications are its efficiency, low collision rate [194], and strong security.
    It is very simple to use and incorporate into programs, because it is widely supported
    in most programming languages. The MD5 hashing algorithm is susceptible to collisions,
    which is the primary drawback of employing it in IoT applications. The likelihood
    of two distinct inputs yielding the same hash is minimal, yet it is nevertheless
    possible. This could lead to problems such as authentication bypass. BLAKE2 The
    BLAKE2 hash function is significantly quicker than Sha-256, while yet being at
    least as safe as the accepted standard, SHA-3. For the optimum efficiency on multiprocessor
    or parallel processing CPUs, BLAKE2 provides the eight-way parallel BLAKE2sp,
    as well as the four-way parallel BLAKE2bp. When it comes to the Internet of Things,
    BLAKE2 has the algorithms that are needed to meet network specifications. BLAKE2
    is at its best on 64-bit processors, where it can achieve throughputs of one gigabyte
    per second (3.08 cycles per byte) on an Intel Core i5-6600 [195]. The BLACK2 hash’s
    primary benefits are its high resilience to brute force attacks and its low memory
    requirements. In addition, the technique has modest computing requirements, making
    it suitable for use in low-power Internet of Things devices. The main disadvantage
    of the BLACK2 hash is that it is vulnerable to collision attacks [196]. RIPEMD-160
    Internet of Things (IoT) applications make use of a cryptographic hash function
    called RIPEMD-160, which has a bit length of 160. The RIPEMD-160 algorithm produces
    a one-of-a-kind, unforgeable hash for each input, which can be used to check the
    validity of the information [197]. It is immune to collision attacks, and RIPEMD-160
    is regarded more secure than its predecessor, RIPEMD-128. RIPEMD-160 is ideally
    suited for use in encryption, since it is quicker than many alternative algorithms,
    and it can provide a unique hash for each input. The fundamental flaw of the RIPEMD-160
    cryptographic hash algorithm is that its output is only 160 bits in size. This
    renders the system vulnerable to brute force attacks, since an attacker may try
    every possible value for the 160 bits until they discover one that produces the
    same result as the message being cracked. Whirlpool For the purposes of encryption
    and data integrity checking, Whirlpool generates a 512-bit hash. The Whirlpool
    algorithm creates a unique, immutable hash for each input, which can be used to
    determine whether data is legitimate. Since it is immune to collision attacks,
    Whirlpool is a more robust hashing algorithm than SHA-1, SHA-2, and RIPEMD-160
    [198]. Whirlpool’s primary drawback is that it needs more memory than other hashing
    algorithms to maintain and analyze the data. Furthermore, length extension attacks
    may be used against Whirlpool, allowing an attacker to take a known hash and append
    additional characters to it without altering the resultant hash. Tiger The Tiger
    cryptographic hash method was developed specifically for remote systems. Any message
    submitted to the algorithm will be converted into a 128-bit digest. Tiger can
    withstand brute force attacks while yet being incredibly lightweight and functional
    [199]. Tiger’s key benefit is that it uses minimal processing power, making it
    suitable for use in battery-operated Internet of Things gadgets. Tiger hashing
    is vulnerable to pseudo-near-collision attacks, which can be used to create two
    different inputs that produce the same hash. 6. Roadmap for Securing IoT Devices
    The exponential growth of IoT devices has rendered them vulnerable to cyber-attacks,
    necessitating the development of a roadmap to secure these devices through the
    formulation of guidelines and standards. Such a roadmap must consider the challenges
    inherent in securing IoT devices, including the diverse range of devices and communication
    protocols, resource limitations, and the need for Denial-of-Service (DoS) resistance.
    Additionally, it must consider end-to-end security, novel network architectures,
    bootstrapping of a security domain, and operational challenges. The security measures
    implemented must be able to handle the complexities associated with mobility and
    IP network dynamics, ensure cryptographic agility, and safeguard individual privacy.
    Furthermore, incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
    to enhance IoT security is critical. By leveraging AI and ML, entities can significantly
    improve their ability to safeguard sensitive data, forestall cyber-attacks, and
    minimize the risk of business disruption. Likewise, the quantum security rules
    related to IoT can have a significant impact on the security of IoT devices and
    networks. Quantum computing has the potential to break many of the cryptographic
    algorithms that are currently used to secure IoT devices and networks. This means
    that sensitive data, such as personal and operational information, can be at risk
    of being accessed by unauthorized parties. However, the development of quantum-resistant
    cryptographic algorithms can help mitigate these risks. These algorithms are designed
    to withstand attacks from both classical and quantum computers, making them a
    more secure option for IoT devices and networks. In addition, the implementation
    of quantum key distribution (QKD) can provide a higher level of security for data
    transmission between IoT devices. QKD is a method of encrypting data using quantum
    principles, which can make it impossible for a third party to intercept or access
    the data without being detected. In context of access control paradigm, one promising
    future direction is to incorporate contextual information into decisions. This
    means considering the node’s location, time of day, and other factors when determining
    whether to grant access to a resource. Another direction is to leverage the power
    of blockchain technology to implement decentralized access control mechanisms
    that can provide better security and privacy guarantees. Ultimately, access control
    policies need to be updated and refined continually as new threats and vulnerabilities
    emerge. 6.1. How Can Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) Change
    IoT Security? As technology advances, so do the threats to security posed by malicious
    actors. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are two technologies
    that can be used to protect IoT systems from cyber-attacks in the future. Fundamentally,
    AI can be used to analyze massive amounts of data quickly for potential anomalies
    or suspicious activities, which could indicate a breach in security protocols.
    By leveraging powerful algorithms, AI can detect patterns faster than humans ever
    could and alert network administrators when it finds something out of place before
    any damage is done. This type of proactive approach will help ensure that networks
    remain secure even if attackers try novel methods or techniques not seen before
    by traditional cybersecurity solutions, such as firewalls or antivirus software
    programs. Subsequently, machine learning offers another layer of protection against
    cyber-attacks because it allows computers to learn from past experiences without
    being explicitly programmed with rules on how they should react in certain situations.
    Machine learning models also allow for real time analysis meaning they are always
    up-to date on current threats while still being able to identify new ones as well;
    this helps reduce false positives caused by outdated threat signatures found within
    legacy systems, making them more reliable overall compared to other existing solutions
    out there today. Ultimately, both AI and machine learning offer scalability, which
    means these technologies will not require additional resources every time you
    need them due to their ability to self-adjust according to different parameters
    set forth beforehand. With all these advantages combined into one comprehensive
    package makes clear why many experts believe utilizing artificial intelligence
    and machine learning-based IoT security solutions will become standard going forward,
    protecting device relay data better than ever before. Adversarial attacks, in
    which an adversary deliberately manipulates data to deceive the system, are a
    serious problem for AI and ML, and some algorithms are difficult to read, leading
    to challenges in identifying the underlying cause of security breaches [200].
    Techniques such as explainable AI and adversarial training have been offered by
    researchers as ways to address these issues. Artificial intelligence and machine
    learning have their drawbacks, but they also have their benefits, such as the
    ability to process massive volumes of data and spot anomalous behavior in real
    time [201]. For this reason, including explainable AI and adversarial training
    can improve the trustworthiness and reliability of IoT systems by providing transparency
    and understanding of the AI models and their decision-making processes, as well
    as enhancing the resilience of these systems against potential cyber-attacks and
    adversarial behavior. This can ultimately lead to better performance and user
    experience and increased adoption and acceptance of IoT technologies. 6.2. Risk
    Factors The development of AI and ML-based IoT security is a double-edged sword.
    On the one hand, it offers many advantages in terms of increased efficiency and
    improved protection from cyber threats (i.e., as stated in an earlier section);
    on the other hand, there are potential risks associated with its use that must
    be carefully considered. In this section we have discussed three key areas where
    AI and machine learning can pose a significant risk to IoT security: privacy concerns,
    algorithmic bias, and data breaches. To begin, there are security and privacy
    concerns associated with IoT devices that use artificial intelligence. As these
    systems become increasingly sophisticated at recognizing patterns in user behavior
    or detecting anomalies in system usage data, they may inadvertently collect personal
    information without users’ knowledge or consent, potentially leading to serious
    violations of individual rights, such as the right to privacy under GDPR regulations.
    It is important for IoT network administrators to use these technologies to ensure
    that their policies protect against unauthorized collection while still allowing
    them access only to the necessary data needed for practical monitoring purposes.
    The second issue is the prevalence of acknowledged bias in AI technology employed
    by businesses, from parametric search engine results to facial recognition software
    used by law enforcement organizations worldwide. The incorrect detection of hostile
    behavior on an IoT network can lead to social injustice and false alarms if the
    algorithms employed to make those judgments are biased. Before implementing new
    algorithm-based solutions, businesses should do thorough testing, independent
    audits, and frequent reevaluation procedures. Furthermore, organizations should
    spend the time and effort to set up secure configurations across all connected
    devices. They should also ensure that the patching and updating process is carried
    out regularly to close any newly discovered vulnerabilities before they are exploited
    maliciously. Ultimately, while there are numerous benefits given by the deployment
    of AI and ML-driven Internet of Things security systems, there are also substantial
    concerns that must be considered, lest we face tragic results in the future if
    appropriate precautions are not taken right now. 6.3. Future Directions: Decisive
    Remarks We envision the following future directions of IoT security in the context
    of ML, AI, and pervasive computing: (a) Development of lightweight and efficient
    ML and AI models for IoT devices with limited resources while ensuring their security
    and privacy. (b) Exploration of new security models and protocols for securing
    communication and data exchange among heterogeneous IoT devices and networks.
    (c) Adoption of pervasive hardware-based security solutions such as trusted execution
    environments, secure boot, and secure storage to strengthen the security of IoT
    devices and prevent physical tampering and attacks. (d) Integration of adaptive
    and scalable blockchain technology to enable secure and transparent data sharing
    and management among IoT devices and stakeholders. (e) Design and development
    of new authentication (e.g., enabled with lightweight quantum encryption) and
    access control mechanisms (e.g., continuous authentication, context awareness,
    decentralization, and user-centric) to ensure the integrity and confidentiality
    of IoT data and prevent unauthorized access and usage. (f) Exploration of new
    models and frameworks for addressing privacy and ethical concerns in the collecting,
    processing, and sharing of IoT data, particularly in pervasive computing. 7. Conclusions
    and Our Recommendations The research indicates that, as IoT technology advances,
    the associated security risks also increase. The increasing frequency of cyber-attacks
    involving the exploiting of a typical IoT device to gain access and compromise
    the entire network has underscored the importance of IoT security. Ensuring the
    safety of networks that rely on IoT devices has become an essential priority.
    IoT security encompasses a diverse range of techniques, strategies, protocols,
    and actions that aim to minimize the growing vulnerabilities posed by IoT to modern
    businesses. To ensure that the IoT networks are protected from potential attacks,
    it is crucial that computer science/engineering experts, such as researchers,
    scientists, and academics, stay up to date with the latest IoT security solutions.
    This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the most critical security considerations
    related to the Internet of Things. We briefly review how literature suggests using
    IoT security on various tiers. Furthermore, we give a transient breakdown of the
    IoT threat vectors and mitigation strategies. We analyze the consequences of the
    attack and link them to the countermeasures that have been recommended. IoT-enabled
    enterprises ought to understand and develop comprehensive monitoring tools to
    quickly detect any unusual activities on their networks. These tools should utilize
    advanced detection tools by exploiting enabling technologies, such as machine
    learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, to analyze large datasets generated
    during normal network operations and alert administrators of deviations from the
    norm. By allowing organizations to respond quickly to security incidents and anticipate
    potential threats before they occur, layered-focused defense mechanisms can significantly
    minimize the downtime resulting from cyber-attacks. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    Location: Wuhan, China SECTION I. Introduction In the past decades, complex and
    diverse networks including Fieldbus, industrial Ethernet, and industrial wireless
    networks existed in industrial production sites. They are independent of each
    other and cannot communicate effectively with each other, leading to serious information
    silo problems and reducing industrial production efficiency. Since the introduction
    of Industry 4.0, information technology has gradually promoted industrial changes
    and intelligent manufacturing has been developing rapidly in the industrial field.
    The Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) enhances the intelligence of industrial
    production by realizing the intercommunication between production equipment, production
    environment, and other infrastructures, and further promotes the development of
    the intelligent manufacturing field. In order to solve the problem of inconsistent
    standards for industrial field data communication, the OPC Foundation of America
    has released a new industrial software interface specification, OPC Unified Architecture
    (OPC UA), after years of exploration. OPC UA is a service-oriented (SOA) architecture.
    It has cross-platform characteristics and extends the information modeling capabilities
    for complex data. It has been recognized and adopted by many industry organizations
    and vendors for its excellent performance. It is driving the development of the
    Industrial Internet of Things. Many scholars have studied OPC UA and have achieved
    some research results. In [1], the authors designed a technical architecture system
    for smart mines based on edge cloud collaborative computing architecture. The
    problems of information silos and low real-time are solved by using OPC UA technology
    and some data scheduling methods [1]. In [2], the authors designed a discrete
    manufacturing shop monitoring system based on OPC UA to solve the problem that
    the heterogeneity of manufacturing shop equipment causes the inability to obtain
    equipment and material status information in real-time. The system realizes the
    interconnection of shop floor networks [2]. In [3], a proposed OPC UA-based industrial
    production architecture is presented for the industrial automation domain. The
    architecture consists of OPC UA servers, services organized into different levels,
    and a constraint satisfaction problem layer. It is also applied in a real production
    environment [3]. In [4], a standalone OPC UA wrapper for industrial monitoring
    systems is proposed. It consists of a UA server and a conventional client, which
    communicate with each other through shared memory and semaphores. It can improve
    the throughput of the system and reduce the latency to some extent [4]. In [5],
    the authors apply OPC UA to in industrial wireless scenarios and design an OPC
    UA dormant agent mechanism. The dormancy of wireless field devices is realized
    and the data collection problem of dormant devices is solved [5]. In [6], the
    authors extend the interoperability of OPC UA and propose an interface compatible
    with OPC UA. And the mapping rules between PMML and OPC UA and OPC UA information
    model are designed. And this interface is verified in the prototype system [6].
    However, most of the above industrial systems use client/server architecture to
    build communication networks. It is inefficient in handling a huge amount of industrial
    data. This communication method cannot meet the high concurrent access demand
    of users. In this paper, we propose a publish/subscribe communication model based
    on OPC UA. We design the overall architecture of the OPC UA publish/subscribe
    model and adopt a message agent mechanism to realize distributed communication
    of the model. The model also has the functions of message modeling, address space
    construction, and publish/subscribe, which are compatible with the traditional
    OPC UA [7]. communication system based on the C/S model. Based on this, a multi-priority
    data scheduling algorithm is proposed and applied to the distributed communication
    model to assist the publish/subscribe mechanism to complete the real-time transmission
    of time-sensitive data. In this paper, the model is applied to a wireless sensor
    network. A better result is achieved. The proposed scheduling algorithm significantly
    improves the efficiency of real-time data transmission. SECTION II. Publish/subscribe
    Communication Model Based on OPC UA In this paper, we propose an OPC UA-based
    publish/subscribe communication model based on the traditional OPC UA communication
    architecture. The model adopts a message agent mechanism and implements a distributed
    message service mechanism using AMQP to meet the communication requirements of
    high throughput in industrial scenarios. AMQP features high reliability and high
    concurrency [8]. The integration of AMQP into OPC UA architecture can solve the
    reliable transmission of important industrial data. Meanwhile, the multi-priority
    data scheduling algorithm can improve the real-time performance of latency-sensitive
    data and reduce latency [9]. A. Distributed Messaging Service Mechanism The distributed
    messaging service mechanism can perform messaging asynchronously. The device data
    is pushed to the message queue of the messaging middleware. Then it is sent to
    different subscribers separately. We use Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)
    as the implementation of the distributed messaging service mechanism of the model
    proposed in this paper. Figure 1 shows the structure of the distributed message
    service mechanism. Figure 1. Distributed messaging service mechanism architecture.
    Show All The Distributed Messaging Service mechanism integrates three components,
    including Exchange, Message queue and Binding. Exchange: It is used to receive
    the data sent by the publisher. The data is sent to the specified message queue
    according to the set routing rules (usually message attributes or content). Message
    queue: It is used to store the data sent by Exchange. They are stored in the server''s
    memory or on disk. Distributed messaging service mechanism has multiple message
    queues, each of which is independent. The data stored in these message queues
    is forwarded to one or more consumers according to a specific rule and order.
    Binding: It defines the relationship between Exchange and Message queue. As an
    interface, it provides routing rules for different types of messages. The distributed
    messaging service mechanism has four standard exchange types that basically satisfy
    the routing types required for messaging, including Direct, Fanout, Headers, and
    Topic. Direct exchange: This exchange can precisely match the routing keyword
    and the binding keyword. According to the routing key carried by the message,
    the message is sent to exactly one or more queues bound to that routing key. Also,
    the direct exchange has a polling feature that enables multiple tasks to be sent
    to multiple subscribers in a round-robin fashion. Fanout exchange: It is a broadcast
    exchange that does not take into account the content of the routing keyword. The
    received data is sent to all the message queues bound to this exchange. Fanout
    exchange are generally used to handle the broadcast routing of messages. Headers
    exchange: This type of switch is bound to a message queue using an “attribute-value”
    key-value pair. Headers exchange can be considered as another manifestation of
    a directly connected exchange. However, it does not rely on the matching rules
    of the routing and binding keys. It matches based on the content of the headers
    attribute in the received data. This type of exchange is more flexible. Topic
    exchange: It follows fuzzy matching routing rules. In contrast to a Direct exchange,
    the Topic exchange can use wildcards to establish routing rules. When the routing
    keys and binding keys carried by the data satisfy a portion of the routing rules,
    they can be dropped into the corresponding message queue. This type of exchange
    has a wider range of applications. When multiple consumers or multiple applications
    need to receive messages selectively, the Topic exchange provides more convenient
    matching and delivery methods. The distributed message service mechanism proposed
    in this paper uses this type of exchange. In addition, the exchange type can be
    scaled according to communication needs, which is well adapted for many distributed
    scenarios. Message queue has different attributes, private or shared, durable
    or temporary, client-named or server-named, etc. By choosing different properties,
    we can implement queue entities such as a shared store-and- forward queue, a private
    reply queue, a private subscription queue. Meanwhile, this distributed message
    service mechanism includes exception catching mechanism, transaction mechanism,
    send confirmation mechanism, message persistence mechanism, etc. These methods
    work together to ensure the highly reliable transmission of messages. B. Overall
    Architecture of the Publish/Subscribe Model Based on OPC UA In this paper, we
    design the general architecture of the OPC UA-based publish/subscribe model by
    incorporating distributed message service mechanism. This architecture has two
    communication functions. First, it provides publish/subscribe to implement distributed
    communication in industrial networks. At the same time, it is also compatible
    with the traditional communication based on the C/S model. The publish/subscribe
    service includes an address space module, data assembly module, distributed service
    module, and subscriber module, while the C/S service includes a session configuration
    module, access security module, data coding, and decoding module, and data access
    module. And the two parts of the services share the OPC UA address space module.
    Figure 2 shows the overall architecture of the Publish/Subscribe Model Based on
    OPC UA. Figure 2. The overall architecture of the publish/subscribe model based
    on opc ua. Show All The address space module is an important component of OPC
    UA and includes the default address space and the device address space. The default
    address space consists of the OPC UA address space and the basic components of
    the information model. The device address space contains the details of the actual
    device, which depends on the OPC UA information model. A node management sub-module
    is contained in the address space management module. This module enables effective
    management of the nodes. It can implement functions such as adding, deleting,
    and modifying nodes. Therefore, the address space module can perform the functions
    of managing the node collection and querying the node collection. Figure 3 shows
    the organization of address space nodes in the actual scene. From this figure,
    you can see their connection relationships. The next level of the root node connects
    the Object, Type, and View nodes. The object node contains a real server node
    (Server). The Server node consists of three devices. The type node defines the
    type of the device (device Type). Each device node in the address space references
    a type node [10]–[11]. Figure 3. The actual organization of address space nodes.
    Show All The data assembly module implements the data assembly function and accomplishes
    the task of creating network messages. A publisher is an entity that sends a network
    message to the message middleware, which represents a certain information source,
    such as a servo motor, PLC, sensor node, etc. First, the Data Assembly module
    gets the device data from each node in the address space. Also, it sets the parameters
    of the DataSet to be published, such as DataSetClassID, DataSet metadata, etc.
    Then the complete DataSet is generated. DataSet messages are created based on
    the generated DataSet. In practice, the DataSetWriter gets the DataSet and creates
    the DataSetMessage, which is binary encoded by OPC UA. Therefore, these created
    DataSetMessages follow the UA binary encoding rules. Next, the model assembles
    the DataSetMessage from the same Writer Group into a NetworkMessage. At this point,
    the Data Assembly module has completed the combination of NetworkMessage. Finally,
    the data assembly module creates a distributed service module to send these data
    to the subscribers. Figure 4 shows the flow of the Data Assembly module to create
    a NetworkMessage. Figure 4. Networkmessage creation process. Show All The distributed
    service module consists of four sub-modules: Exchange, Message Queue, Queue Management,
    and Message Scheduler. They are the core of Publish/Subscribe. After receiving
    NetworkMessage, this module initializes the Distributed Messaging Service mechanism,
    then creates the channels, exchangers, and message queues needed to transmit data,
    and sets binding keywords. The Distributed Messaging Service mechanism uses a
    Topic-type exchanger. The mechanism follows the rule of fuzzy matching. The subscriber
    module is used to receive messages pushed by publishers. The subscribers can subscribe
    to the topics of interest through the subscriber module and then receive the corresponding
    messages. The subscriber establishes a connection with the distributed service
    module by creating a channel. It establishes a connection with the specified message
    queue based on the routing keyword to receive NetworkMessage. Finally, the subscriber
    analyzes the NetworkMessage and decodes it to help the subscriber side parse the
    data. Figure 5 shows the flow of NetworkMessage decomposition by the subscriber
    module. Figure 5. Networkmessage decomposition process. Show All In the C/S service
    part, the session configuration module can complete the configuration and connection
    between the OPC UA client and server. The access security module implements functions
    such as message encryption and decryption. The data encoding and decoding module
    is used to encode and decrypt messages during transmission. The data access module
    realizes the interaction between client and server address space node attributes.
    C. Multi-Priority Data Scheduling Algorithm To improve the transmission efficiency
    of the underlying real-time data of the Publish/Subscribe Model Based on OPC UA,
    this paper proposes a multi-priority data scheduling algorithm. The algorithm
    classifies various kinds of data in the model data collection module according
    to their types. Then the various types of data are pushed to the upper layer according
    to different priorities [12]. We divide industrial equipment data into four types
    of communication data: alarm information, status information, image information,
    and video information, which are defined as four priority levels. Alarm information
    has the highest priority as it requires the highest real-time performance. Status
    information is the second priority. Image information is the third priority. Video
    information is the lowest priority. In addition, we create four priority queues
    for caching the underlying data (queu e 1 ,queu e 2 ,queu e 3 , queu e 4 ) . They
    are one real-time queue and three non-real-time queues. The real-time data queue
    is used to store the industrial real-time data defined by the system, such as
    the alarm type information. The non-real-time data queue is used to store the
    industrial non-real-time data defined by the system. There are n stations in the
    network and their data streams are denoted as f 1 , f 2 , f 3 … f n . It is assumed
    that each data stream is sent with a certain period. The data frame length is
    fixed and it is denoted by F S i . Equations (1) and (2) calculate the transmission
    period T i and the model scheduling period T l for each data stream. It should
    be noted that V i represents the transmission speed of each data stream. T i =F
    S i / V i T l =LCM( T 1 , T 2 , T 3 … T n ) (1) (2) View Source During the scheduling
    period T l , there is a total transmission window for sending data, which is denoted
    by W . There is also the actual transmission window allocated for each queue,
    which is denoted by w i . Equation (3) calculates the total transmission window
    W , and illustrates the relationship between W and w i . V represents the data
    transmission speed of the model. The model obtains the size of cached data in
    four queues, including buf f 1 ,buf f 2 ,buf f 3 , and buf f 4 , according to
    the priority order of data. At the same time, it calculates the allocated transfer
    window size w i for each queue in this scheduling cycle and performs the allocation
    operation. ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ W= T l ∗V ∑ i=1 n w i ≤W (3) View Source If buf f 1 ≥W , the
    algorithm allocates all the transmission window lengths to queu e 1 in this cycle,
    and this scheduling task ends. If buf f 1 <W , the algorithm will allocate sufficient
    transmission window lengths to queu e 1 . Equation (4) calculates the transmission
    window length w 1 of queu e 1 and the remaining window length r 1 . { w 1 =buf
    f 1 r 1 =W− w 1 (4) View Source When r 1 >0 and buf f 2 ≥ r 1 , the algorithm
    allocates all the remaining window lengths to queu e 2 , and the scheduling task
    is finished. If r 1 >0 and buf f 2 < r 1 , the transmission window length w 2
    and the remaining window length r 2 allocated to queu e 2 are calculated by Equation
    (5). { w 2 =buf f 2 r 2 = r 1 − w 2 (5) View Source When r 2 >0 and buf f 3 ≥
    r 2 , the algorithm allocates all the remaining window lengths to queu e 3 , and
    the scheduling task is finished. If r 2 >0 and buf f 3 < r 2 , we can calculate
    the transmission window length w 3 and the remaining window length r 3 allocated
    to queu e 3 by equation (6). { w 3 =buf f 3 r 3 = r 2 − w 3 (6) View Source When
    r 3 >0 , the algorithm allocates all the remaining window lengths to queu e 4
    ,  w 4 =buf f 3 , and this scheduling ends. We consider that queu e 4 may fail
    to allocate time slots for a long time in the dynamic preemptive scheduling strategy.
    This situation can cause starvation of the queue. In addition, too much data cache
    can lead to queue overload. In this paper, we set two threshold values to dynamically
    control the transmission window allocation process of queu e 4 . We set the queue
    threshold value δ and the queue stability value μ . When buf f 4 exceeds the threshold
    value δ , the model triggers the preemption operation. This operation interrupts
    the allocation tasks of other queues and executes the tasks of queu e 4 immediately.
    The operation stops until the load of queu e 4 is not greater than the stable
    value μ . Then the model starts to continue the normal scheduling tasks. SECTION
    III. Experimental Result We build a communication environment for the publish/subscribe
    communication model based on OPC UA, and complete the initial development of the
    model. And the model is applied in combination with a wireless sensor network.
    Meanwhile, in order to verify that Modbus devices can access this model smoothly,
    this paper uses Modbus Slave to emulate slave devices and uses Modbus TCP/IP protocol
    to transmit real-time data. We establish a sensor network that can collect temperature,
    humidity, and vibration by deploying 6 embedded sensor devices. One of the embedded
    devices is the coordinator. The other 5 embedded devices are data acquisition
    nodes. Figure 6 shows each node of the wireless sensor network. In addition, we
    also simulated 3 Modbus slave devices. Each slave device contains 10 dynamically
    changeable state values. Figure 7 shows the 3 slave devices simulated by Modbus
    Slave. Figure 6. Each node in a wireless sensor network. Show All Figure 7. Modbus
    slave emulates 3 slave devices. Show All We model all devices with their information
    and map them into the OPC UA address space. The address space is divided into
    three layers. The first layer is the general mapping layer of the model, which
    contains a node named “OPC UA Server ,′′ . The second layer is the network type
    classification layer, which contains two nodes named “Modbus Network Devices”
    and “Wireless Sensor Networks” respectively. The third layer contains the specific
    devices and sensor nodes for each type of network. This layer describes the properties
    of each node. Each sensor node in the address space contains a data value, a node
    type attribute, and a node description attribute. Each Modbus device contains
    a data value and a node description attribute. This management method enables
    the unified management of industrial devices and ensures reliable communication
    in the network. Figure 8 shows the address space of OPC UA in a practical application.
    The top part of the figure shows the access address of the OPC UA server, which
    is “opc.tcp://192.168.93.40:4840”. The left side of the diagram shows the information
    of each node. The right side of the diagram shows the details of the node properties
    and the data values of the subscribed nodes respectively. This experiment not
    only completes the construction of the OPC UA server, but also implements the
    distributed message service mechanism of the model through the message broker.
    The model is equipped with OPC UA-based publish/subscribe function. In this paper,
    an AMQP message agent is built based on RabbitMQ, and the OPC UA server completes
    the task of creating messages and sends them to the message agent of the model.
    The message agent creates queues and exchangers and sends them to subscribers.
    We push real-time data from each node in the address space to the message agent
    separately on top of the OPC UA server, and set the routing keywords for each
    node''s data separately. Figure 9 shows the routing keywords for publish/subscribe.
    We also define two consumers as subscription clients. The routing keys of these
    two subscription clients are “wsn.#” and “modbus.#”, which subscribe to all nodes
    in the wireless sensor network and all nodes in the Modbus network, respectively.
    Figure 10 shows the data received by the subscriber with the routing key “wsn.#”.
    Figure 11 shows the data received by the subscriber with the routing key “modbus.#”.
    Figure 8. The address space of opc ua in practical applications. Show All Figure

    receives data with the routing key “wsn.#”. Show All Figure 11. The subscriber
    receives data with the routing key “modbus.#”. Show All Figure 12 and Figure 13
    illustrate the communication connections and throughput of the model''s publisher-subscriber
    system, respectively. In Figure 12, the two names with IP address “192.168.93.132”
    are the connections of subscribers, and the name of IP address “192.168.93.40”
    is the connection of publishers. Figure 13 shows the real-time throughput of publishers
    and subscribers. Figure 12. Communication connectivity of the model. Show All
    Figure 13. Real-time throughput of the model. Show All From the figure, we can
    see that the overall throughput of the system is continuously increasing, and
    the throughput curve of the publisher is increasing earlier than that of the subscriber.
    Because the publisher side is turned on earlier than the two subscribers. However,
    as time grows, the throughput of publishers and subscribers are equal. Overall,
    the model designed in this paper enables distributed communication and satisfies
    OPC UA publish/subscribe requirements. Compared with the traditional OPC UA C/S
    model communication architecture, this model can improve the throughput and reduce
    the transmission delay. SECTION IV. Conclusions Aiming at the problem that the
    C/S communication model of OPC UA is inefficient in handling massive industrial
    data and cannot meet the high concurrency demand of the system, this paper proposes
    a publish/subscribe communication model based on OPC UA. We design the overall
    architecture of the OPC UA publish/subscribe model and adopt AMQP to implement
    distributed message service mechanism. A multi -priority data scheduling algorithm
    is proposed and applied to the distributed communication model to assist the publish/subscribe
    mechanism to complete the real-time transmission of time-sensitive data. In addition,
    this model is compatible with the C/S communication model of OPC UA and has the
    functions of message modeling, address space construction, and publish/subscribe.
    We build a real communication environment and apply the model to the wireless
    sensor networks. And achieve a better transmission effect. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Yekaterinburg, Russia SECTION I. Introduction
    The Internet of Things is the concept of a network of objects (so called “things”)
    equipped with technologies to interact with each other or with the external environment.
    Gradually, IoT technology is becoming a part of people''s daily lives. The Internet
    of Things is used in production, in the management of the transport system and
    public services, in medicine and health care, in agriculture, and for monitoring
    the environment [1], [2]. Smart devices have the ability to capture indicators,
    analyze data and transmit them via the Internet [3]. There are many solutions,
    both commercial and amateur, that implement the concept of the Internet of Things,
    but they have significant disadvantages in integration and scaling. Closed commercial
    solutions for smart home are aimed at providing paid services and are not integrated
    with open systems. Amateur designs solve a limited range of tasks and do not have
    scalability. The most striking example of an open system of the Internet of things
    is the public monitoring service (narodmon.ru). This system allows collecting
    data from user devices based on microcontrollers and minicomputers with a wide
    range of connected sensors, and also provides feedback for controlling actuators.
    An obvious disadvantage of the public monitoring service is low resiliency. The
    service is a centralized system with limited functionality and weak protection
    from external influences. The purpose of this article is the description of the
    architecture of the Internet of Things systems, which has a set of advantages,
    focused on the future implementation, operation of complex information and communication
    systems. As an example, the results of testing two systems of the Internet of
    Things in a service-oriented architecture are presented: the automatic room ventilation
    system and intersection counting system. SECTION II. Internet of Things Devices
    Possibilities Currently the capabilities of electronic sensors have not only reached
    the level of human perception, but in many ways surpassed them. For example, a
    person is not able to determine the level of radiation, atmospheric pressure or
    the presence in the air of dangerous impurities. In addition, the electronic device
    may function continuously and in hard-to-reach places. The Internet of Things
    devices are not only the sense organs of information systems, but also “obedient”
    executive units and mechanisms. Simple electronic circuits, coupled with complex
    mechanisms, allow solving various problems of the automatic control. The sensors
    and actuators themselves are not functional. A computer or microcontrollers with
    software always control end devices of the IoT. Compatibility of the controller
    with other controllers and information systems is determined by data transfer
    protocols and does not impose restrictions on the manufacturer or hardware architecture.
    The components of the Internet of Things system in addition to sensors, actuators
    and controllers also include network interaction modules. In addition to the wired
    interface protocols (RS-232, I2C, SPI, Ethernet, RS-485, USB), wireless standards
    have been greatly developed: Bluetooth, WiFi, GSM, LTE, LoRa [4]. In contrast
    to specialized automatic control systems, the Internet of Things devices are based
    on open digital standards and protocols, which allow implementing an arbitrary
    technical solution from ready-made components. SECTION III. Application Levels
    of the IoT Systems For many people the Internet of Things has become a hobby,
    that embodies both the simplest tasks of automation and interesting innovative
    ideas. This is a household level of application, which, as a rule, does not extend
    beyond the territory of an apartment or a summer cottage. There are various civil
    systems that solve the tasks of specialized and municipal organizations. For example,
    it is lighting control, urban transport, traffic lights, metering devices, etc.
    In contrast to the household level, such systems are based on industrial solutions,
    solve public tasks and may be integrated with others systems. The next level of
    application is industrial. Manufacturers are beginning to use the IoT technology
    and data analysis in their activities in order to maintain their competitiveness
    [5]. This layer uses Internet of Things technology to reduce costs, collect and
    analyze data, build forecasts and increase security. Each of these levels, as
    a rule, has one common feature: the original architecture for specific purposes.
    Scaling and combining such systems is difficult. SECTION IV. Architecture of a
    Scalable Failure Resistant System It is proposed to revise the approach to the
    construction of IoT systems in such a way that any solution can be implemented
    on a modular principle, which allows providing the following: compatibility; fault-tolerance;
    scalability. Traditionally, IoT systems are implemented in the client-server architecture
    (Fig. 1). The boundary element of the system is a microcontroller (MC) with a
    set of sensors (S) and actuators (A). The microcontroller sends and receives data
    from the web service via the Internet. The development of the system inevitably
    complicates the software of the microcontroller, because it is necessary to implement
    all network levels and algorithms of fault handling. Fig. 1. IOT system in client-server
    architecture Show All The use of the client-server architecture in IoT systems
    leads to the following disadvantages: the lack of asynchronous interface; no buffering;
    static routing; high modernization costs; the presence of hard links and dependencies;
    limited set of communication technologies; the complexity of the software on the
    client side. These disadvantages are omitted when using the service-oriented architecture
    (SOA) described in [6]. Its key technological element is the enterprise service
    bus (ESB). The block diagram of the IoT system built in the ESB architecture is
    shown in Fig. 2. The software of the microcontroller implements only: reading
    sensor indications; executing control commands; data exchange in synchronous mode
    with the adapter via a fixed protocol. The adapter is an intermediate link which
    interacts with microcontrollers via a low-level protocol based on geographical
    distance and technical capabilities of communication. The tasks of the adapter
    include a message buffering, transformation to the data bus format and sending
    it to the message queue server. The adapter has the ability to switch to an alternative
    data channel. Its functions include monitoring the status of connected nodes and
    signaling the status of the system. The software of the adapter is configured
    depending on the functional purpose of the subsystem entrusted to it and can be
    reconfigured without making changes to other parts of the system. The service-oriented
    architecture releases the end nodes from communication tasks because this function
    is assigned to the adapter. In Fig. 2 the pointer (1) indicates the low-level
    protocol data channel, (2) – the primary communication channel with the data encryption
    system, (3) – the backup communication channel. The data bus provides storage,
    dispatching and message transformation. This ensures integration with various
    systems, including external ones. One can dynamically configure routes and connect
    additional nodes without modifying the IoT system components. There are open-source
    software tools and libraries that implement data bus functionality. At the industrial
    level, it is advisable to use a commercial solution such as IBM WebSphere ESB,
    Oracle Enterprise Service Bus, SAP Process Integration, etc. The capabilities
    of the products such as Rabbit MQ, Apache Camel, JBoss ESB and others are sufficient
    enough to be used in civilian and household IoT systems. Fig. 2. Block diagram
    of a scalable IoT system Show All SECTION V. Development of Automatic Room Ventilation
    System The purpose of the development is the creation of a prototype of the automated
    system for monitoring indoor air quality. The task of the system is to measure
    the concentration of carbon dioxide and control the ventilation system. Two functional
    models were considered for the investigation. In the first variant, the functions
    of the microcontroller and the adapter are combined; the second variant is implemented
    in accordance with the architecture presented in Fig. 2. In the first variant:
    the microcontroller STM32F03 allows the exchange with the message broker using
    the MQTT protocol [7]. This allows transmitting telemetry data and receiving control
    commands. However, for changing the routing, protocol and operation algorithms,
    physical access to the microcontroller is required, which is a significant disadvantage.
    A modular approach to implementing IoT allows “freeze” a low-level data exchange
    protocol and implement a gateway to a message broker through a microcomputer.
    In this case, it provides the ability to buffer messages, update software, change
    protocols and algorithms without direct access to the end devices. The control
    system subscribes to messages published on the broker and allows customizing the
    response command messages for the actuators. For example, the user has set up
    a condition in which, with an excess of carbon dioxide in the room, all ventilation
    systems are activated. To perform this task, a “fan on” command is formed, which
    is transmitted to the adapter, and then to the microcontrollers that control the
    ventilation system. When there are several systems in a room, they can be controlled
    by one common command or by individually using the device name. As a result of
    the investigation, it is established that the service-oriented architecture has
    advantages which allow scaling the system by changing the settings of the control
    elements. SECTION VI. Development of a Intersection Counting System There is a
    need to consider the number of people in intersections in a certain space. For
    example, there are visitors counting systems accounting customers in the shop,
    classroom utilization at schools or universities and tracking the traffic of passengers
    in public transport. The device should perform several functions: Fix the movement
    in two directions; Count the current number of objects; Record counter value and
    current time; Transfer data to an external system for analysis and further storage.
    To implement such device, used the infrared obstacle sensors and a data transmission
    module connected to the microcontroller. The infrared obstacle sensors and a data
    transmission module connected to the microcontroller are used for the implementation
    of the device. The infrared led is used to determine the fact of crossing the
    control zone. It constantly emits a narrow beam of light in a straight direction.
    When this beam is reflected from the obstacle and hits the photodiode, a signal
    appears at the sensor output. The prototype uses two sensors in order to distinguish
    the direction of the movement. The microcontroller counts the number of intersections
    as follows: increases the counter by 1 when fixing the passage in one direction
    and reduces by 1 when fixing the passage to the other. Using the LoRa radio module,
    data is transmitted wirelessly to the server (base station). A typical IoT scheme,
    which is presented in Fig. 3, ends at this stage. The disadvantage of this scheme
    is the isolation and autonomy of the system. Alternatively to an average server,
    the adapter as a usual client-server which differs nothing from microcontroller
    should be used. The modular approach allows telemetry data to be translated into
    scalable systems and to merge nodes into global systems. Fig. 3. The scheme of
    interaction of system components in client-server architecture Show All Fig. 4
    shows a diagram of the interaction between the components of the two described
    systems in a service-oriented architecture. This structure has unlimited expansion.

    Show All The work was performed on the basis of the Samsung Academy using laboratory
    equipment: a microcontroller STM32F03, a microcomputer Samsung Artik 710 and LoRa
    modem. SECTION VII. Conclusion The analysis of the Internet of things systems
    is obtained. The shortcomings and problem areas of client-server architecture
    are identified. A modular architecture is proposed to provide scalability, flexibility,
    compatibility, resiliency and security at any level of IoT application. The development
    of two systems in the service-oriented architecture has been completed: the automatic
    room ventilation system and intersection counting system. The advantages of using
    a service-oriented architecture in IoT follow from the approbation of the systems.

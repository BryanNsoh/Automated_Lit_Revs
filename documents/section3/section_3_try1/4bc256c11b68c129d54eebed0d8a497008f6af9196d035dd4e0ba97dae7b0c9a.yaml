  description: The agricultural sector plays an important role in contributing significantly
    to the gross domestic product (GDP) growth in developing countries. On the other
    hand, agriculture is widely affected by major factors such as environmental changes,
    natural disasters, pesticide control, and soil and irrigation-related issues,
    which reduce crop yield. The convergence of Industry 4.0 and agriculture offers
    an opportunity to move into the next generation of Agriculture 4.0. The internet
    of things (IoT), remote sensing, machine learning, deep learning, big data, cloud
    computing, thermal imaging, end-user apps and unmanned aerial vehicles offer a
    full-stack solution. IoT provides the ubiquitous connectivity of smart devices
    to the internet to collect, process and analyse a large amount of agriculture
    field data more quickly and synthesize them to make smart decisions using various
    machine learning and deep learning algorithms. This study reviews the challenges
    and major issues in the IoT agriculture domain and explores its emergence with
    new technologies. It covers the existing literature and illustrates how IoT applicationbased
    precision agriculture solutions have contributed. A case study on weed detection
    for smart agriculture using the YOLOv5 model is presented, achieving high accuracy.
    Finally, various IoT agriculture use cases are discussed, along with current research
    issues and possible solutions for future IoT-based agriculture advancement.

    FIWARE 1. Introduction In municipalities, public green spaces represent a key
    component of the urban system whose primary function is to offer embellishment,
    leisure, and well-being spaces to citizens. These urban green spaces also provide
    increased infiltration that reduces flood runoff (Benedict & McMahon, 2002; Qi
    et al., 2023) and reduced air temperature that increases comfort during heatwaves
    (Augusto et al., 2020; Rocha et al., 2022). The role of urban green spaces in
    reducing heat and enhancing infiltration becomes increasingly important (Oral
    et al., 2020; Probst et al., 2022) as climate change increases the frequency of
    occurrence of extreme heatwaves and rainfall events (IPCC, 2022a, 2022b). Therefore,
    public green spaces in cities, trendily referred to as parts of nature-based solutions
    (NBSs), are a constitutive part of greening initiatives in current and future
    EU cities’ urban planning (Castellar et al., 2022; Dicks, 2015; Dorst et al.,
    2019). Key aspects of managing these municipal green spaces are maintenance and
    water consumption (Nouri et al., 2019). For example, in EU Mediterranean cities,
    water consumption represents on average 1 m3/m2 per year for turf grass (±20%;
    Domene & Saurí, 2006; Morote-Seguido & Hernandez-Hernandez, 2016). In a water
    scarcity-driven context, management towards efficient use of the water resource
    is stressed by the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 6.4, SDG
    6.B; UNDP, 2017), and the EU is pushing to make the water efficiency dimension
    a high priority for the member states (European Commission, 2019). Therefore,
    strategies are being implemented to mitigate water consumption in public green
    spaces, such as the selection of species more resistant to water stress or the
    reuse of treated wastewater (Castellar et al., 2022; Qtaishat et al., 2022; Santana
    et al., 2019). Another obvious way to improve green spaces’ water consumption
    efficiency is through irrigation optimisation. In the optimisation of the irrigation
    of these green spaces, hydroinformatics is a key supporting field, having a transversal
    role in integrating water sciences (i.e. hydrological, hydraulic and environmental),
    data sciences (statistics; stochastic, data-driven analytics), computer science
    and information and communication technologies (ICT), and society (Holz et al.,
    2014). In this regard, the implementation of the smart city and smart water concepts,
    supported by the hydroinformatics field, is growing in terms of numbers and types
    of applications in the water sector (Gourbesville, 2016; Gourbesville & Ma, 2022:
    Monzon, 2015). However, practical applications in urban irrigation are not yet
    broadly implemented (Aldegheishem et al., 2022; Monteiro et al., 2021). Moreover,
    when implemented, no hydroinformatics-based urban irrigation optimisation solutions
    with a highly transversal data assimilation level were found [e.g. no applications
    have been found integrating weather forecast data assimilation outside of the
    agricultural irrigation sector (Alves et al., 2023)]. The aim of the present paper
    is to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of dynamic optimisation of irrigation
    plan implementation for urban public green spaces, based on an interoperable hydroinformatics
    approach. The goal is to illustrate the potential of this type of solution for
    efficient water resource use and the ease of implementation of this market-ready
    method and technology, to facilitate its implementation at municipal levels. Here,
    a simple but holistic irrigation optimisation strategy has been carried out at
    the level of parcels set in a French Mediterranean coastal city, relying on four
    key components: smart sensors, water balance model, optimisation algorithm, and
    weather forecast data integration. The novelty lies in the ease and readiness
    of implementation which should pave the way to further encompass these types of
    hydroinformatics-based solutions at the municipal level. Firstly, the overall
    concept is presented: the method, the test case characteristics in a semi-arid
    Mediterranean city, and the tested set-up. Secondly, we present the results at
    the parcel scale of the solution capabilities in terms of implementation, the
    outcomes in terms of water savings, and added value for irrigation optimisation
    strategies and planning. Lastly, added values and limits are discussed and put
    into perspective. 2. Methodology 2.1. Concept design The goal of the concept is
    to provide an optimal irrigation plan for the upcoming week. This plan is to be
    determined using the architecture and technology components illustrated in Figure
    1. The concept relies on the standard and open-source technology framework FIWARE
    ( 2020). This allows not only the replicability of the solution but also, due
    to its structure based on standard generic enablers (Alves et al., 2023), the
    ease of its implementation in other platforms with broader purposes thanks to
    the interoperability properties of the FIWARE framework [e.g. smart water platform,
    municipality-scale hypervisor or extending a digital twin (Lewis et al., 2023)].
    Figure 1. Key layers, components and protocols of the developed system. Display
    full size The system is composed of two main sources of data: (i) capacitance
    sensors, able to measure soil volumetric moisture; and (ii) an Application Programming
    Interface (API) service providing real-time precipitation and evapotranspiration
    estimates with forecasts of precipitation and evapotranspiration for the upcoming
    14 days. Data are managed by the Stellio Context Information Broker, which is
    a platform that allows connection and information sharing between all types of
    use cases. The main asset of the Context Information Broker is the Next Generation
    Service Interfaces Linked Data (NGSI-LD) Context Information Management API, which
    allows easy retrieval of the data with powerful temporal or geospatial queries.
    It also includes a set of components that satisfy the NGSI-LD specification and
    are compatible with the FIWARE ecosystem to increase interoperability. FIWARE
    Draco, which is an open-source data flow manager based on Apache Nifi, is used
    to process incoming data and perform data validation. Two processes (described
    in section 2.3.3) then use those data: A soil water balance model that uses the
    last soil moisture measurement and the forecasted meteorological data for the
    next n days to provide a forecast of soil moisture for the next n days. An optimisation
    algorithm that uses those forecasted soil moisture values to provide an optimal
    irrigation plan for the next n days. 2.2. Study area The test case is a mid-sized
    French Mediterranean city (30,000 inhabitants) located on the French Riviera which
    sees its population triple during the summer season when both water resources
    and vegetation are under the peak stress. The method is tested on 24 parcels of
    public green spaces, ranging from 50 m2 to 300 m2 and representing a total area
    of about 3000 m2. Two different irrigation systems are in place: (i) drip irrigation
    (on six parcels), and (ii) sprinkler irrigation (on 18 parcels). Each parcel is
    controlled by an auto-valve, which allows the provisioning of different irrigation
    plans for each sector if needed. The original standard irrigation scheme implemented
    by the municipality is the following: for the drip irrigation sectors: 1 m3 distributed
    in 90 min, every Monday and Thursday (during the night); for the sprinkler irrigation
    sectors: 3 m3 distributed in four time slots of 5 min (spread over 3 h), every
    Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (during the night). Over these parcels, the yearly
    water consumption is approximately 7000 m3 with this original standard irrigation
    scheme. 2.3. Data sources 2.3.1. Smart sensors and measurement strategy Three
    parameters of interest are measured: (i) soil humidity, (ii) soil temperature,
    and (iii) quantity of water used for irrigation. The soil volumetric humidity
    (in m3/m3) and the soil temperature are measured at a depth of 0.15 m by an electrical
    capacitance sensor (Sensecap VWC sensor) known to be reliable for continuous measurements
    (Singh et al., 2018). Multiplying the soil volumetric humidity by the depth of
    the soil allows the estimation of the water content (in mm). To measure the quantity
    of water used for irrigation, a pulse counter device is used to measure the flow
    on the main valve (i.e. the flow for all sectors). Soil humidity and soil temperature
    are measured at three different locations chosen to be representative of the possible
    range of conditions of the green spaces in the study case: a full sun-exposed
    grass-covered parcel, a parcel with mixed shadow/sunny exposure covered by grass,
    and a bushy parcel (Figure 2). Each of the 24 parcels is linked to the soil moisture
    measurements of one of the three above-mentioned monitored zones depending on
    its sun exposure/vegetation cover type. Figure 2. Schematic overview of the instrumented
    public green space. Display full size Measurement data are sent hourly for the
    sensecap sensors, and each second for the flowmeter via a Long Range Wide Area
    Network (LoRaWAN) radio communication protocol which provides a low-power wide-area
    network (Aldegheishem et al., 2022). The data are available in hourly time steps,
    and the Stellio Context Broker API makes it very easy to obtain any type of temporal
    aggregation instantaneously to be used later. In this case, the irrigation optimisation
    algorithm presented below operates on a daily time step. Measurement campaigns
    were performed over the course of 7 months, divided into two periods: a 1 month
    (mid-May to mid-June) dry period; a 4 month (mid-September to mid-December) dry–wet
    transition period. The period between mid-June and mid-September is not used since
    the irrigation in the area was shut down at a regional scale due to a severe drought
    leading to governmental irrigation restrictions. 2.3.2. Weather forecast provider
    The reference evapotranspiration and rainfall intensity nowcast and the 7 day
    forecast datasets are provided by an external API service. The data are received
    and processed using FIWARE Draco. This weather forecast service provides real-time
    measurement and forecasted values for many different types of weather data (Zebiri,
    2020). A comparison between forecasted and observed values was performed (Figure
    3) to assess the quality of the provided forecast, and the root mean square error
    metric (RMSE) was calculated to quantify the accuracy. Forecasted values are available
    for 14 days with daily updates. Here, the next 7 days forecast window is used.
    For evapotranspiration, the forecasted estimated values 7 days in advance are
    very close to the observed ones; the RMSE is 0.6 mm, which translates correct
    accuracy. However, for precipitation, the occurrence of events higher than a 2
    mm.day−1 threshold is properly captured but the intensity of the precipitation
    is not reliable, as illustrated in Figure 3. The error on the high-intensity episode
    leads to a worse global accuracy and a higher RMSE of 4.1 mm. Figure 3. Difference
    between observed and forecasted daily values for precipitation and evapotranspiration
    data. Display full size 2.4. Mass balance and optimisation algorithms The two
    principal components of the irrigation planning computation method are: a mass
    balance model, which allows prediction of the soil humidity based on measurements
    and forecasts; an optimisation function that adjusts the irrigation quantity for
    a design period (here, 1 week) based on the mass balance model. The objective
    of the optimisation model is to determine the lowest water quantity that can be
    delivered, while still maintaining the soil moisture at a sufficient level (i.e.
    minimising the risk for the plant). The mass balance model is based on water input
    and output over a soil volume. It is a simple yet still widely used model in the
    irrigation area (Pereira et al., 2020; Sammis et al., 2012). The mass conservation
    equation can be written as follows: Δ SWC = P + I − ET − SR − DP + CR (1) where
    SWC is the soil water content, P is the rainfall precipitation, I is the applied
    irrigation, ET is the evapotranspiration, SR is the surface runoff, DP represents
    the deep percolation and CR is the capillary rise. The balance is estimated with
    a daily time step which yields: Δ SWC t = SWC t − SWC t − 1 (2) where t is equal
    to the current day. Equation (1) then becomes: SWC t = SWC t − 1 + P t + I t −
    ET t − SR t − DP t + CR t (3) where t + 1 corresponds to the following day and
    where – except for SWC(t), which is measured in real time – all the values are
    forecasted. Indeed, as a reminder, ET(t) and P(t) are provided for a sliding window
    of 1–2 weeks, whereas I(t) is the value to optimise and SWC(t) is the output of
    the model. Surface runoff, deep percolation and capillary rise were calculated
    from the other components using the methods given by Villalobos and Fereres (
    2016). Eventually, as all values are predicted for n days, replacing predicted
    SWC(t) with predicted SWC(t), irrigation planning can be foreseen up to t + n
    days. If one can predict the SWC with this model, one can establish a parsimonious
    irrigation optimisation strategy to balance the irrigation volume with the required
    SWC conditions. To do so, the developed algorithm is based on three SWC thresholds,
    as follows: Comfort threshold: Above this specified SWC value, the plants are
    in optimal irrigation condition. Saturated threshold: Above this specified SWC,
    the plant receives too much water, leading to water overconsumption and potentially
    improper phytosanitary conditions. Critical threshold: below this specified SWC
    value, the plant does not have access to sufficient water resources to secure
    proper maintenance and development. The threshold values are specified by the
    user depending on the specific plants’ requirements and on the user’s local experience
    with plants’ requirements for the specific parcels. The thresholds are defined
    as follows: θ PWP + 1 − AD θ FC − θ PWP (4) where θ PWP is the soil volumetric
    moisture at the permanent wilting point, θ FC is the soil volumetric moisture
    at field capacity, and AD is the allowable depletion. It allows the description
    of threshold values independent from the soil volumetric moisture limit values
    defined previously. For example, a value of AD of 0.2 means that the threshold
    is equal to 80% of the soil capacity. Here, the selected AD values were 0.2, 0
    and 0.4 for the comfort, saturated and critical thresholds, respectively, which
    are standard values for turf grass (Villalobos & Fereres, 2016). The optimisation
    algorithm functions as follows: depending on the authorised/scheduled period where
    irrigation is authorised (here, days), the algorithm cuts the planning into sub-periods,
    starting with an authorised irrigation day. Then, for each sub-period, the algorithm
    uses an initial prediction of the model and increments during the allowed period
    the release of a fully open 1 min irrigation discharge until the critical threshold
    is exceeded for all the days of the period. Then, it iteratively increases the
    irrigation discharge/period until the comfort threshold is exceeded, as long as
    the saturation threshold is not exceeded for any of the days of the given period.
    The considered hierarchy regarding the thresholds can thus be summarised as follows:
    The critical threshold is the one that must be reached absolutely every day. Next,
    the saturation threshold should not be exceeded unless it means being below the
    critical threshold on any day. Finally, the comfort threshold must be exceeded
    unless this would imply that certain days are above the saturation threshold.
    The optimisation algorithm also takes into consideration the existing irrigation
    schedule constraints which might depend on various external factors such as strategic
    choice by municipality operators to cope with water cost, water resource-specific
    availability (e.g. for water reuse during a certain specific time slot constraint,
    etc.), operators’ availability, conflict of usage of the public space, etc. 3.
    Results The outcome of the irrigation planning dynamic optimisation method on
    different inter-seasonal conditions is here assessed. The results are considered
    successful when: in implementing the irrigation plan, the predicted and measured
    soil moisture are in good adequation, as close as possible to the defined comfort
    zone; water saving is observed compared to the original irrigation plan; vegetation
    does not suffer any water-induced stress in the parcels. The results are presented
    in two parts: (i) during the 1 month dry period, used as a reference, for a sprinkler
    irrigation sector; then (ii) during the 4 month dry–wet transition period, for
    a drip irrigation sector. 3.1. Dry period, sprinkler irrigation sector The irrigation
    programme recommended by the algorithm and the resulting predicted soil volumetric
    moisture are presented in Figures 4 and 5. Figure 4. Recommended irrigation, measured
    irrigation and precipitation during the 1 month dry test period for a sprinkler
    irrigation sector. Display full size Figure 5. Resulting predictions of soil moisture
    compared to measurements from the sensor during the 1 month dry test period for
    a sprinkler irrigation sector. Display full size Figure 4 is representative of
    a 1 month dry period as precipitation was very scarce (15.7 mm cumulated over
    the month; no event exceeds 4 mm). In the absence of precipitation, using mostly
    the soil moisture targeted value, the algorithm still manages to significantly
    reduce the quantity of water used for irrigation, from 37.6 m3 to 24.1 m3 over
    that period. This represents a 35% saving on the water resource. Indeed, Figure
    5 shows that reducing the irrigation has a very limited impact on the predicted
    soil volumetric moisture, which stays very high during the entirety of the period
    (the permanent wilting point for this sector is 0.12 m3/m3). The RMSE between
    forecasted and measured soil moisture is 3.4%, indicating a satisfying reliability
    of the water balance model. Thus, using the algorithm in this test dry period
    allows the improvement of irrigation efficiency. It also led to figuring out that
    here, 35% of the volume of water was lost due to deep percolation and surface
    runoff (Figure 6). Figure 6. Water balance model components comparing measured
    (top) and recommended (bottom) irrigation during the 1 month dry period. Display
    full size 3.2. Wet period, drip irrigation sector For this period, the irrigation
    programme recommended by the algorithm and the resulting predicted soil volumetric
    moisture are presented in Figures 7 and 8, respectively. Over the 4 month period,
    the first 2 months (September–October) still had an elevated temperature and vegetation
    with high physiological activity, favouring evapotranspiration, and a few significant
    rainfall events: two events with more than 10 mm per 24 h each (Figure 7). Over
    that period, the recommended irrigation planning allowed water savings mostly
    in October. The algorithm used the forecasted rainfall events to reduce the irrigation
    volume 7 days in advance, while allowing the maintenance of soil moisture around
    the comfort zone (Figure 8). For this sector, RMSE between forecasted and measured
    soil moisture is 5.6%. It should be noted that for the month of September, which
    corresponds to the tail end of the dry season, the recommended irrigation did
    not differ from the standard irrigation scheme as the soil moisture was far below
    the critical threshold. Thus, even though a rainfall event was forecasted, no
    irrigation cut has been planned until the soil moisture critical threshold is
    surpassed. Figure 7. Recommended irrigation, measured irrigation and precipitation
    during the 4 month dry-to-wet period transition for the drip irrigation sector.
    Display full size Figure 8. Resulting prediction of soil moisture compared to
    measurements from the sensor during the 4 month dry-to-wet period transition for
    the drip irrigation sector. Display full size The second 2 month sub-period (November–December)
    had a relatively lower temperature, with declining vegetal physiological activity
    and with rainfall events becoming more regular (Figure 7). The irrigation was
    then cut in response to the predicted rainfall, while maintaining an optimal soil
    moisture level (comfort zone). Over the 4 month period, for these sectors, the
    recommended irrigation volume has been reduced from 19.95 m3 to 6.5 m3. This represents
    a 67% water saving for these two parcels. However, this important saving percentage
    will be moderated as the initial irrigation programme has not been modified, and
    it is likely that under normal operation procedure, the municipality would have
    reduced the irrigation frequency starting from November. 4. Conclusion and perspectives
    The benefits of technical implementation of public green space optimised irrigation
    planning relying on hydroinformatics components are here demonstrated. Smart sensors,
    water balance models, optimisation algorithms, and weather forecasts are combined,
    and the operational capability of the system is displayed. Irrigation plan optimisation
    led to a 35% water saving during the dry season and more than 60% water saving
    during the dry–wet season transition period. The open-source standard technology
    and approach used here can be included in the municipality hypervisor without
    any key technical challenge to fit with an orchestrated implementation of the
    smart city/smart water concept. Indeed, relying on the FIWARE framework, the developed
    hydroinformatics-based method uses common and popular smart-city/software conventions,
    rendering the proposed work maintainable and interoperable from the perspective
    of software engineering. Limitations are those depending on the quality of the
    entry data (measured and forecasted). Also using a small number of sensors with
    respect to the number of parcels means that the irrigation of non-instrumented
    parcels is driven by the soil moisture feedback of a different parcel. This can
    induce some undetected drift and requires particular on-field attention. The implications
    of scaling such an application to an entire city would therefore require particular
    attention, especially in the instrumentation and drift control strategies. Other
    types of sensors could be tested for this application, such as tensiometers, which
    are used for irrigation scheduling (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2004) but are less compatible
    with the presented water balance model. The optimisation can be further improved
    to upgrade to a multivariate problem such as crop growth status requirements,
    water restriction or water reuse programming constraints, etc., in the irrigation
    planning optimisation. 5. List of hardware and software Table Download CSVDisplay

    The latest United Nations Climate Action Fast Facts highlights the alarming increase
    in greenhouse gas concentrations, reaching historical highs and projected to rise
    further [1]. In response to this challenge, the emergence of the Internet of Things
    (IoT)-enabled precision agriculture (PA) has gained prominence. IoT technologies
    allow for precise control and efficient resource utilization, providing viable
    solutions to reduce agriculture''s impact on climate change and pave the way toward
    agricultural sustainability. In the context of agricultural improvement, smart
    farming (SF), also known as PA, has evolved from relying solely on human knowledge
    and experience to incorporating science, technology, and domain-related data.
    Stein et al. (1997) [2] and Rossel et al. (1998) [3] were among the early proponents
    of SF-related ideas. Continuous improvements in tools, software, and hardware
    technologies are crucial for advancing agriculture. In recent years, there has
    been increasing interest in integrating artificial intelligence (AI), the IoT,
    information and communication technologies (ICT), and wireless sensor networks
    (WSNs) into agriculture. These innovative technologies are being explored for
    their potential to facilitate the transition from conventional farming to precision
    agriculture. Conventional farming practices, previously reliant on manual labor
    and machinery, have undergone a digital and intelligent transformation. Taking
    a comprehensive perspective of the research domain, SF encompasses a wide range
    of topics, both horizontally and vertically, to propel advancements in the field
    and push boundaries. These research endeavors encompass a broad spectrum, including
    data analysis and its applications [4], intelligent control farming systems [5],
    effective farming management techniques [6], IoT-enabled farming solutions [7],
    agricultural supply chain optimization [8], ICT in agriculture [9], and numerous
    others. The research and applications in SF adhere to the basic agricultural IoT
    architecture. Fig. 1 illustrates various agricultural applications, including
    monitoring, precision irrigation, fertilization, and prediction services facilitated
    by a fundamental three-layer IoT conceptual framework. The perception layer includes
    agricultural sensing devices, actuators, and controllers for data collection and
    automation control. The network layer encompasses wireless communication technologies
    and data transmission protocols for interaction. The application layer involves
    data storage, computation, and data-driven applications and services for higher-level
    intelligence. IoT-based smart agriculture integrates knowledge and technologies
    from various disciplines, such as incorporating automated control, predictive
    modelling, and device communication and interaction in precision irrigation. Therefore,
    IoT smart agriculture requires combining expertise and technologies from different
    fields to enhance agricultural practices and achieve more efficient and sustainable
    outcomes. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    The interdisciplinary nature of IoT-based SF presents challenges in reviewing
    research across different thematic domains. As a result, review studies in this
    field predominantly approach the topic from the perspective of IoT architecture.
    These investigations summarize the diverse hardware and software technologies
    based on the layered structure and demonstrate their integration through case
    studies, showcasing how these technologies enable the development of SF applications
    and services. Other review studies on this domain with a narrow view focus on
    specific applications or technologies, as summarized in Table 1. Few reviews have
    classified the entire SF research domain and examined the research work within
    each corresponding subfield, which is important to identify the research gaps,
    drive innovation, and promote interdisciplinary collaboration. Table 1. Review

    revolutionized traditional empirical and manual-intensive agricultural practices.
    To this end, this review employs rigorous scientific mapping methodologies to
    attain a comprehensive understanding of the diverse facets of SF research domain.
    It highlights gaps and significant challenges, including energy efficiency, network
    performance, and security concerns, by integrating insights from perception, communication,
    big data, security, and blockchain technologies in IoT-driven agriculture. These
    obstacles hinder the feasible implementation of SF in large-scale agricultural
    settings. This review amalgamates highly cited and citation explosion research
    insights to outline prospective research directions. These include establishing
    energy models, constructing simulation frameworks, developing anomaly detection
    models, and incorporating software-defined networking (SDN) as promising avenues
    for addressing the current research gaps. The primary contribution of this review
    can be summarized as follows. • Conducting the scientific mapping method to position
    the IoT smart farming research domain. • Clustering the diverse subfields, studying
    highly cited and significant studies, and analyzing citation surge. • Examining
    the current state of IoT smart farming, addressing challenges, and exploring potential
    research directions. The rest of this review is organized as follows: Section
    2 introduces the IoT farming system application scenario, the limitations of existing
    reviews in this area, and the scientific mapping review method and tools. Section

    review. 2. Background Integrating IoT and big data concepts into traditional agriculture
    has led to significant advancements in research, providing abundant opportunities
    and challenges. Numerous studies have explored the theoretical foundations, technologies,
    tools, and frameworks, offering a roadmap for the progress and development of
    IoT-based agriculture practices. Maroli et al. [31] point out that smart farming
    has accumulated substantial research findings. However, conducting a comprehensive
    review of research across different subfields in this application-oriented interdisciplinary
    field poses a significant challenge. The fragmented nature of the research field
    exacerbates these issues, resulting in duplicated studies, as seen in the works
    of Cabarcas et al. [32] and Mageshkumar et al. [33]. A smart agriculture system
    that supports various agricultural applications and services, as depicted in Fig.
    3, exemplifies its interdisciplinary nature. The physical layer consists of numerous

    networks and ICT technologies. The edge layer involves data processing, real-time
    monitoring, decision-making, and control, incorporating various decision systems
    and predictive algorithms. The cloud layer encompasses abundant storage and computing

    system conceptual framework. Review studies have increasingly directed their attention
    towards these topics, aiming to provide an overview of the current research, identify
    gaps, and highlight potential directions for future exploration and investigation.
    Table 1 presents a curated collection of studies from SF review journals, organized
    according to their respective topics and types. However, some reviews tend to
    focus narrowly on specific topics, such as agricultural big data applications
    [11,12] or smart decision and management systems [16,17]. Others center around
    agricultural IoT architectures, offering detailed summaries of technologies and
    devices organized within a layered structure. These reviews fail to consider the
    thematic clustering patterns of research and the corresponding work conducted
    within these clusters in smart farming, disregarding the breadth of the research
    field. Scientific review analysis and critique emphasize the importance of utilizing
    the scientific method as the fundamental approach for examining textual evidence.
    Content analysis and bibliometric techniques have been acknowledged as established
    scientific sub-disciplines and are pivotal in evaluating research [34]. These
    methodologies encompass quantitative analyses of bibliometric data, including
    research networks based on key terms and reference citations. Garfield introduced
    bibliometrics in 1964, indicating that the methodology was not completely novel.
    However, it is worth noting that bibliometrics has gained significant popularity
    in recent years. As shown in Fig. 4, a noticeable upward trend can be observed
    when searching for bibliometric-based review work on the Web of Science (WoS).
    Bibliometrics has gained popularity due to advancements in AI and algorithm optimization,
    leading to the development of various tools such as VOSviewer, HistCite, CiteSpace,
    BibExcel, and Python. These tools facilitate quantitative analysis of bibliographic
    data, enabling people to evaluate research impact and identify trends. As a result,
    bibliometrics has become a widely accepted approach for conducting a review. Download

    Long-term trends in the usage of bibliometrics in review studies. 3. Research
    methodology There has been a substantial amount of published research in many
    fields of study, especially in some interdisciplinary disciplines, making it increasingly
    difficult to acquire the domain of knowledge over time. The knowledge domain denotes
    the accumulated information or knowledge associated with a particular research
    field. We intend to implement the knowledge domain mapping technique to gain a
    more in-depth and precise understanding of a specific research field. According
    to RM Shiffrin''s definition, knowledge domain mapping is a term used to describe
    a developed interdisciplinary science that aims to draw, mine, analyze, and classify
    processes. As the author also suggested in the paper [35], knowledge domain mapping
    seeks to comprehend disciplinary profiles, assess scientific frontiers, predict
    disruptive events, innovations, and research changes, and identify knowledge vectors.
    3.1. Theoretical basis The three fundamental networks are the co-occurrence network
    of keywords, the co-citation network, and the composite network of keywords and
    abstract. They are visually presented and are used to classify study areas and
    identify research road maps and trends over time. Examining co-occurrences generate
    a network of associations between words, highlighting their semantic similarities
    across different text segments, enabling readers to view the research domain from
    a more holistic perspective. Further explanation is needed for some crucial concepts.
    Betweenness centrality identifies significant nodes that can potentially drive
    paradigm shifts, such as nodes 16 and 10, highlighted in red Fig. 5. Various centrality
    metrics, also known as centrality indices or rankings, have been developed to
    evaluate the importance of nodes within a network [36]. The importance of a node
    is not solely determined by the number of its neighboring nodes but also by the
    significance of those nodes. Keyword burst and citation burst refer to sudden
    increases in the frequency of specific keywords or citations within a defined
    time. They assist in identifying the research roadmap and emerging research focus
    within the current research domain. Download : Download high-res image (250KB)

    Paper selection The literature review begins by locating research on IoT smart
    farming to provide a broader perspective and answer the questions posed earlier.
    The data for this review, focusing on the topic of ((\"smart farming\" OR \"precision
    agriculture\" OR \"smart agriculture\") AND (\"IoT\" OR \"Internet of Things\")),
    was obtained from the Web of Science (WoS) database. Specifically, we utilized
    the WOS core data set, searching for relevant work in June 2023. Referring to
    the search criteria process outlined in Fig. 6, a total of 1532 documents from
    the year 2010 to the year 2023 are valid for this research. The keyword network
    analysis relies on the keywords extracted from the topic search, including titles
    and abstracts. Further narrowing down to extract critical keywords, those terms
    with a higher occurrence rate will be the candidates for building the network.
    Then, 378 words that appeared more than 15 times in the research were chosen for
    this review study. Highly cited work and important research nodes are identified
    based on their citation counts and significance within the citation network. Analyzing
    citation bursts provides insights into the research interests and future research
    directions during specific periods. Download : Download high-res image (403KB)

    The review utilizes cluster analysis to identify subfields within research topics
    where the threshold selection for topic keywords could bias the clustering. A
    higher threshold excludes minor topics, while a lower threshold includes irrelevant
    ones, introducing subjectivity and potential errors. Furthermore, theme identification
    involves subjective judgment, leading to diverse categorizations based on key
    terms. This variability may bias study selection and interpretation in the analysis.
    In order to mitigate these limitations, forthcoming reviews could involve increased
    collaboration with domain experts to guide the selection of studies based on clustering
    themes. Additionally, the utilization of advanced language models can aid in the
    research selection process, reducing subjectivity and enhancing the overall objectivity
    and accuracy of the review. 4. Research themes visualization in smart farming
    Fig. 7 indicates the co-occurrence network of key terms, revealing three distinct
    research streams (clusters). The highly silhouetted and modular network indicates
    that the clustering results are apparent. Based on what is suggested by the keywords
    in each cluster, the three main research areas are \"crop-related issues\" (cluster
    A, red), \"network-related issues\" (cluster B, blue), and \"application- and
    security-related issues\" (cluster C, green). These clusters, which are not independent,
    are connected via the central research node, thus forming a complete picture of
    the IoT-based innovative agriculture research area. It highlights the interdisciplinary
    character of IoT-agriculture innovation research. Download : Download high-res

    topic or research field. Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10 indicate that the key thematic
    terms within an individual cluster belong to corresponding subfields in Fig. 7.

    and provides a broad overview of the entire research field from a horizontal and
    vertical perspective. Download : Download high-res image (379KB) Download : Download

    applications and security research. 4.1. Agricultural perception and optimization
    Crop and plant-related research issues are discussed as the first subfield, as
    referenced in Fig. 8. These topics cover crop and surrounding environmental parameters
    (\"temperature\" was the most frequent theme word at 13 %, \"water management\"
    at 11 %, and \"irrigation\" at 9 %). Hence, the primary objective of this study
    was to examine the key themes associated with each research group. Earlier work
    in this field focused on gathering crop-related parameters and using statistical
    and mathematical models to simulate plant responses to environmental changes rather
    than optimizing crop growth for improved yield and quality [37]. Regression analysis,
    as demonstrated by the studies of Sellam et al. [38] and Poudel et al. [39], plays
    a significant role in establishing correlations between multiple variables and
    exploring the factors that influence crop yield. However, it is important to note
    that these early research endeavors cannot be classified as smart systems since
    they did not rely on the sensed parameters for making early judgments and decisions.
    4.1.1. Monitoring system One of the main hubs linking in-cluster and outside of-cluster
    research subjects is the “monitoring system”, as depicted in Fig. 7. Monitoring
    systems are representative applications aimed at enhancing the overall efficacy
    of agriculture. These systems are utilized to monitor and collect agricultural
    and environmental parameters, which can be leveraged to train intelligent models
    for making farming predictions. Table 2 examines monitoring systems in IoT-SF
    and elaborates on their merits and limitations. Table 2. Monitoring system research.
    Research Primitives Merits and Limitations [40] • CC3200 single chip • Temperature,
    humidity, image sensors • Wi-Fi, GPRS • Serve as a basis for further research.
    • No specific methods for implementing. Accuracy and reliability of the system
    are unknown. [41] • Arduino board • Temperature, soil sensors • Wi-Fi, gateway
    • ThingSpeak platform • Threshold-based self-control algorithm • Cut down on the
    need for constant monitoring and manual intervention. • Restricted to areas without
    Wi-Fi connection. Manually updating systems to suit dynamic scenarios take time
    and expertise. [42] • UAVs, on-ground sensors • Flying trajectories design • In-suit
    data processing (consensus and symbolic aggregate approximation) • Less load and
    latency of monitoring-enabled tasks by integrating UAVs with on-ground WSNs. •
    Real-world implementation is needed to evaluate energy consumption and packet
    drop rates. [43] • Cooperating energy harvesting into agricultural sensors to
    execute monitoring tasks • Increase the lifespan of energy restricted IoT farming
    devices. • The efficiency and overall system performance are unknown. [44] • Sigfox
    LPWAN networks • ANN for temperature prediction • Sigfox-based IoT monitoring
    system for scalability. Tested in the commercial greenhouse for better practical
    generalization. • Poor performance in rural areas without network coverage. Subscription
    of Sigfox may limit use. The crop monitoring platform discussed in the work by
    Prathibha et al. [40] served as a foundational framework for future research.
    This platform enables system networking and incorporates two types of nodes designed
    to detect temperature and humidity data and capture images of crop growth. However,
    it should be noted that the system did not specify methods for implementation
    and go through systematic evaluation. A more advanced work, as presented in the
    study by Mondal and Rehena [41], focused on developing a monitoring system capable
    of real-time data transmission and analysis. The threshold-based self-control
    algorithm is proposed to reduce the need for manual intervention. Nonetheless,
    it would suffer from inadequate Wi-Fi coverage. Popescu et al. [42] introduced
    unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted monitoring solutions in response to the
    growing need for enhanced efficiency. The research further suggests optimizing
    the route planning of flying nodes to facilitate on-site data processing, mitigating
    network load and associated delays in agricultural tasks driven by monitoring.
    However, it is imperative to thoroughly assess the energy consumption of the constrained
    devices involved and the packet loss rate associated with the collaborative transmission
    of agricultural sensing data. As Elahi et al. [45] mentioned, ensuring power efficiency
    was crucial for IoT devices to enhance the effectiveness and prolong the operational
    duration of IoT-enabled systems. The research by Sadowski et al. [43] presented
    an agricultural monitoring system incorporating energy harvesting techniques.
    The primary objective was to prolong the system''s lifespan and offer insights
    for selecting appropriate wireless technologies. The study exclusively concentrated
    on assessing the energy consumption of different wireless technologies, lacking
    a holistic perspective on the system''s practical performance. Carlos et al. [44]
    presented a monitoring system based on LPWAN networks (Sigfox), aiming to enhance
    the scalability of monitoring systems in real scenarios, considering the properties
    of an extensive range of agricultural settings. The utilization of the system
    is somewhat restricted due to the need for extensive network coverage and the
    imposition of a subscription fee, which limits its usage. 4.1.2. Precision irrigation
    Other topic terms under this research cluster Fig. 8 are “irrigation” and “water
    management,” which are about water utilization. Water scarcity significantly threatens
    agricultural productivity and quality, impacting human survival and societal progress.
    The increasing demand for fresh water, primarily consumed by agriculture, exacerbates
    these challenges. Table 3 reviews the precision irrigation-related research and
    its benefits and gaps. Table 3. Precision irrigation research. Research Primitives
    Merits and Limitations [46] • Sensors and MCU • Wireless modules • Cloud-based
    server • ML-based data processing irrigation prediction algorithm • Fully autonomous
    irrigation using an insightful algorithm that considers sensor data and weather
    forecast criteria. • The proposed method relies on wireless communication, which
    can be disrupted in bigger crop fields without thorough investigation. [47] •
    Sensors and controllers • SWAMP platform integrating fog nodes, cloud, and smart
    algorithms • Hands-on guidance to build IoT-enabled irrigation system. • IoT Devices
    should be placed and evaluated efficiently to reduce energy consumption and investment
    costs, which is unknown. [48] • Sensors and pump motor • MCU and Arduino IDE •
    MQTT protocol • Computation of crop water requirement (Penman Method) • Develop
    a crop water requirement algorithm. Provide a solution for excessive irrigation.
    • Small-scale testing is not representative. Fixed thresholds are incompatible
    with agricultural systems'' dynamic nature. [49] • LSTM-based predictor • Irrigation
    scheduler • Irrigation planner • Considering the historical and current information
    to make irrigation prediction. • Without validation in real farming systems. Dynamism
    of agricultural systems could affect the accuracy of proposed method. [50] • LoRa
    nodes • Cloud platform and user interface • LSTM data fusion model to predict
    water demand • Energy efficient. Combine multiple data sources (data fusion) to
    make irrigation prediction. • Uncertain system performance for agricultural scenarios
    with multiple sensing nodes across a large physical layer. [51] • ZigBee nodes
    (sensors and actuators) • Edge and cloud server • SMPHA prediction algorithm •
    Updating the prediction algorithms to meet the dynamic changes. Offload the real-time
    tasks to the edge to minimize the latency and increase the system''s scalability.
    • The system performance including energy consumption, packets loss, response
    time are unknown. Goap et al. [46] proposed a smart irrigation management system
    adopting machine learning and open-source technologies. Despite leveraging IoT
    capabilities for efficient monitoring and control of irrigation processes, it
    is crucial to acknowledge that discrepancies may arise between the evaluation
    results obtained from small-scale pilot tests and their applicability to real-world
    scenarios. Additionally, the ability of machine learning to handle high-dimensional
    data is limited. The \"SWAMP\" solution, as outlined in Kamienski et al. [47],
    offered practical support for developing an IoT-enabled irrigation system. Nevertheless,
    it is essential to note that the impact of device placement and evaluation on
    energy consumption and investment costs remains uncertain. Further research is
    required to ascertain the implications of these factors on the system''s performance
    and overall feasibility. The research conducted by Rajaram et al. [48] focused
    on monitoring and analyzing data related to crop and environmental conditions
    to identify the optimal configuration for an automatic irrigation system using
    predefined thresholds. However, it is worth noting that the system was tested
    on a small scale, and the use of fixed controlling thresholds may prone inefficient
    when confronted with dynamic scenarios. Kashyap et al. [49] developed DLiSA, an
    intelligent irrigation system for precision agriculture that integrates deep learning
    neural networks and machine learning techniques, utilizing the Internet of Things
    (IoT) capabilities. The system aims to make irrigation predictions by considering
    both historical and current information. It should be emphasized that the proposed
    method has not been validated in real farming systems. The dynamic and ever-changing
    nature of agricultural environments introduces complexities that may influence
    the accuracy and reliability of the prediction model. Gong et al. [50] introduced
    an energy-efficient irrigation system that employs data fusion and long short-term
    memory (LSTM) techniques to integrate diverse data sources and enhance the precision
    of irrigation predictions. Nevertheless, the system''s performance and efficacy
    in agricultural environments with multiple distributed sensing nodes are still
    uncertain. The complexity and heterogeneity of these settings may impact the overall
    performance and efficiency of the system. Premkumar et al. [51] proposed an edge-based
    irrigation system that revolutionizes the decision-making process for watering
    schedules. The system dynamically adjusts its prediction algorithms to adapt to
    changing conditions, ensuring accurate and timely irrigation. It minimizes latency
    and improves scalability by offloading real-time tasks to the edge. It is important
    to note that the system''s energy usage, packet loss, and reaction time have not
    been determined and require further investigation. Rigorous evaluation and testing
    are necessary to assess the system''s efficiency and effectiveness in real-world
    applications. 4.1.3. IoT data-driven farming prediction In recent years, agriculture
    has shifted from a conventional approach to a data-driven mode powered by IoT
    technologies. This shift has led to agricultural and environmental data accumulation
    through intelligent monitoring and other innovative techniques. Thematic terms
    such as \"dataset\", \"data acquisition\", and \"real-time data\", depicted in
    Fig. 8, have emerged as prominent research areas in this domain, garnering a fair
    share of research interest. These nodes have advanced and interconnected research
    of \"forecasting\", \"machine learning models\", \"decision systems\", and other
    related topics in the agricultural domain. Table 4 provides an overview of forecasting
    studies in agriculture, highlighting their contributions and limitations. Table
    4. Data-driven smart farming prediction research. Research Primitives Merits and
    Limitations [52] • IoT devices for collecting farming data • Regression and classification
    models • SMOTE for augmenting data • SMOTE data augmentation improves frost detection.
    Thermodynamic information is validated to be useful for frost prediction. • The
    prediction model is evaluated using historical static data without in-site testing.
    Combining hardware, software algorithms, and analyzing performance as a whole
    to improve adaptability is lacking. [53] • Empirical mode decomposition (EMD)
    method • GRU sub-predictors • Capable of capturing nonlinear relationships among
    the heterogeneous sensing data. • The model should be integrated into IoT farming
    systems to evaluate its accuracy under real-life dynamic environment. [54] • Empirical
    mode decomposition (EMD) method • GRU sub-predictors • Capture the nonlinear and
    non-stationary patterns among the sensing data in an adaptive manner. • Models
    are evaluated using single historical data, so generalizability is not clear.
    [55] • LSTM crop yield prediction model • Genotype and weather parameters • Temporal
    attention and crop growing time-windows capture the time-series local dependency
    of farming data. • Local weather variations are not captured since weather conditions
    vary greatly over small distances. Diedrichs et al. [52] developed a prediction
    system for frost prevention in agriculture that considers thermodynamic conditions
    instead of relying solely on temperature and limited sensing data. Synthetic Minority
    Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) data augmentation improved frost detection. Still,
    with the intricate web of relationships and diverse components in the data, accurate
    prediction of future trends remains a complex task. In-site testing and evaluating
    of the overall system''s performance are needed for improved generalization and
    real-world applicability. The research [53,54] explored data decomposition into
    distinctive feature-based components inputted into a gated recurrent unit (GRU)
    network for prediction tasks. They proposed employing the Seasonal and Trend decomposition
    using Loess (STL) and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) techniques respectively
    to capture the relationships within nonlinear and heterogeneous data. The adaptive
    nature of EMD enables it to effectively capture non-stationary patterns, offering
    advantages over STL. Both models are evaluated using single historical data, which
    raises issues regarding their generalizability. They need more testing to prove
    their efficacy in dynamic agricultural environments. Shook et al. [55] proposed
    an LSTM-based crop yield prediction model with a temporal attention mechanism,
    incorporating time-series local dependencies and focusing on crucial time steps
    in farming data. This approach enhances prediction accuracy by considering the
    temporal characteristics of the data. During the prognosis phase, the model inadequately
    accounts for localized weather variations, which is a crucial factor. Even within
    relatively small geographical areas, weather conditions exhibit a high degree
    of variability. 4.2. Network layer research in agricultural IoT Another research
    cluster focuses on network-related aspects of smart farming, particularly wireless
    sensor-related topics. This cluster explores subjects like wireless sensor networks
    (wsn), communication, performance, gateway, lora, iot network, scalability, and
    utilization, as shown in Fig. 9. Wang et al. [56] introduced a GPRS-based system
    for collecting agricultural data over long distances. Nevertheless, this approach
    faced drawbacks such as high traffic costs, infrastructure investment, and reduced
    effectiveness in rural areas. Wireless sensor networks emerged as essential components
    in IoT SF, enabling bidirectional data exchange. It facilitates more efficient
    data acquisition and communication in agriculture. Table 5 summarizes the work
    conducted under these thematic topics, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses.
    Table 5. Network layer research in smart farming. Research Primitives Merits and
    Limitations [57] • Low power mesh networking • Bayesian Inference Approach (BIA)
    • Belief Propagation algorithm • Save energy and reduce the network load through
    constructing data to cut down on the amount of data that needs to be sent through
    the WSNs. The mesh networking is suitable for larger and dense monitoring scenarios.
    • Nonlinear correlations require more complicated construction models. Consider
    packet loss due to the system dynamism. [58] • IEEE 802.15.4-based communication
    • UAV and ground sensors • Introduce UAVs as flying relay nodes to assist transmit
    sensing data to the endpoint. The deployment of sensors in PA is highlighted.
    • Further work in terms of UAVs standard workflows and incorporating on-ground
    data transmission are needed. [59] • Plant backscatter sensor node • RF front-end
    for communication • Low-complexity Morse code communication • Lower power consumption
    and less complexity to implement. • Generalizability is not tested for the proposed
    system. Not support high data rates and spectral efficiency. [60] • LoRa radio
    module • Backscatter communication algorithm for long range and low-power communication
    • LoRa backscatter prototype with lower energy consumption is adopted to overcome
    the limitation of communication range • Communication overhead and latency in
    large-field settings. Point-to-point communication fails to adapt dense monitoring
    scenarios [61] • BIC-Hex architecture • Cross-layer-based hybrid particle Swarm
    wild horse optimizer (PSWHO) • Stable routing technique (CL-HPWSR) • Cross layer
    cluster head selection relief the common energy-hole problems. A robust routing
    protocol to minimize the overhead, latency, and PDR. • Without real-world testing.
    Lack adaptability to system topology changes and equipment breakdowns. Computational
    complexity and scalability are further concerns. Communication is essential in
    resource-constrained agricultural devices. Razafimandimby et al. [57] proposed
    to adopt the Bayesian Inference Approach (BIA) deployed at the edge gateway aims
    to save energy and reduce network load by constructing data to minimize the amount
    of data transmitted within WSNs. This approach works well in an agricultural environment
    with densely monitored mesh networks. Notably, the dynamic nature of the system
    may lead to packet loss, thus affecting reconstruction results, and novel data
    construction models are needed to capture the complex nonlinear relationships
    presented in heterogeneous agricultural data. Bacco et al. [58] suggested that
    PA in rural areas can benefit from using low-cost and easy-deploy aerial vehicles
    for transmitting sensing data and sending control commands. UAVs offer the potential
    to overcome drawbacks such as energy consumption, overload, and long-range transmission
    constraints in large crop fields. Nonetheless, there are currently no standardized
    workflows and processes for UAV-assisted applications. Further work is needed
    to reduce packet loss and incorporate on-ground data transmission. Daskalakis
    et al. [59] introduced the innovative use of cost-effective Morse code wireless
    technology in an IoT farming system. It aimed at lowering power consumption as
    well as the complexity of the implementation process. However, it is important
    to note that the generalizability of the proposed system has yet to be tested,
    and Morse code, while energy-efficient, does not support high data rates due to
    its low-bandwidth modulation. Konate et al. [60] further proposed a LoRa backscatter
    prototype that facilitates long-range communication with decreased energy consumption.
    In large-field dense monitoring environments, point-to-point communication may
    fail due to communication overhead, latency, and the dynamic nature of the systems.
    Kumar et al. [61] developed a communication solution that addresses energy efficiency
    and quality of service (QoS). It consists of a cross-layer cluster head selection
    mechanism to mitigate common energy-hole issues and a robust routing protocol
    to reduce overhead and latency and ensure a high packet delivery rate (PDR). Noting
    that the proposed solution did not undergo real-world testing raises concerns
    regarding its adaptability to changes in system topology and equipment failures.
    Furthermore, potential obstacles include the computational complexity and scalability
    of the solution. In an experimental investigation by Feng et al. [62], ZigBee
    emerged as a favorable choice for monitoring agriculture facilities due to its
    efficient time and energy requirements. NB-IoT and LoRa were identified as superior
    choices due to their extended coverage range to support large-scale farming. Singh
    et al. [63] and Klaina et al. [64] also suggested that LoRa is suitable for long-range
    transmissions over time and frequency-selective channels. It is worth noting that
    LoRa and NB-IoT require higher infrastructure investment compared to ZigBee. Despite
    having a shorter communication distance, ZigBee offers advantages in transmission
    rate and equipment input. Moreover, it supports mesh network topology, allowing
    for dense monitoring and broader coverage. 4.3. Applications and security research
    in smart farming The rapid advancement of agricultural technologies and the widespread
    adoption of automated monitoring and control systems have paved the way for the
    extensive implementation of agricultural IoT initiatives. Subject terms and their
    corresponding research shares offer valuable insights into the emergence of a
    distinct research cluster in SF, as illustrated in Fig. 10. This cluster encompasses
    various topics, including security (14 %), industry (13 %), computing (9 %), and
    blockchain (8 %). It explores a wide range of technologies and solutions. Notably,
    there is a growing emphasis on developing smart farming applications that harness
    the power of big data and artificial intelligence. Additionally, significant attention
    has been directed towards addressing security concerns within the agricultural
    sector, particularly concerning safeguarding the integrity and privacy of agricultural
    data. Moreover, noteworthy research has been conducted on industry blockchain
    and supply chain topics within this subfield. Collectively, these research areas
    aim to develop comprehensive solutions for real-world scenarios. 4.3.1. Computational
    architecture for smart agriculture The first group of research covered research
    topics related to \"computing\", \"iot devices\" and \"solutions\". The proliferation
    of IoT devices in support of IoT-based farming solutions has led to a substantial
    surge in data volume. This data growth necessitates efficient data storage and
    robust computing resources to effectively handle and process the influx of agricultural
    data [65,66]. Cloud computing and storage offer an optimal platform for a diverse
    range of applications within the agricultural sector, facilitating the realization
    of agricultural big data solutions. Table 6 compares related works in agricultural
    computing. Table 6. Agricultural computing architecture and big data. Research

    consumption, but lack consideration of equipment deployment and real-world system
    performance Big data [71] • IoT data (Apple experimental demonstration station,
    China) • Granulation techniques • GA-SVM predictor • Employ dimension reduction
    techniques to mine valuable information from agricultural big data, thus reducing
    computation costs of IoT farming systems. • The lack of evaluation in a real-world
    cyber-physical farming environment restricts the generalizability of the proposed
    work. [72] • Physical layer IoT devices • XMPP platform • Moving average, 3D cluster
    algorithms • Integrate 3D agricultural big data analysis with empirical rules
    to optimize crop selection and decision-making. • Given the limited scale of testing,
    integrating data to reduce computational costs in densely monitored scenarios
    pose a challenge for big data analysis. [73] • Five-layer IoT agricultural structure
    • K-means big data mining algorithm • Propose a reference framework for agricultural
    IoT big data to provide efficient communication and extract information from agricultural
    data. • Sophisticated algorithms needed for high-dimensional agricultural big
    data analysis. Evaluation and optimization under specific agricultural applications
    are essential. In their study, Khattab et al. [67] introduced a cloud-based IoT
    framework for smart farming. This framework enables the collection and transmission
    of farming data to a cloud-based back-end for processing and analysis. They present
    a conceptual cloud server with the necessary components for implementing this
    framework. The proposed work has limited preliminary results, and the prototype
    necessitates augmented real-time decision-making capabilities to meet the demands
    of large-scale farming scenarios. Integrating fog and edge technologies into cloud
    computing is beneficial in reducing latency and minimizing data loss during transmission.
    Hsu et al. [68] leveraged a decentralized IoT platform that utilizes uniform IoT
    device standards for seamless and rapid deployment, aiming to bring processing
    capabilities closer to end-users and improve efficiency and performance. Ensuring
    the resolution of security concerns and evaluating compatibility with existing
    systems are significant in implementing such solutions. In the agricultural domain,
    a timely response to time-sensitive situations is crucial. The existing fixed
    IoT computing infrastructure may not be able to fulfil low latency requirements,
    extensive coverage, and flexible communication for efficient farming decision-making.
    To overcome these limitations, Uddin et al. [69] proposed utilizing flying nodes
    to enable a flexible computation and communication scheme. Nevertheless, the study
    needs a comprehensive discussion of the computation and energy capacity and a
    design for payload balancing during flying trajectories. According to Yousefpour
    et al. [74], edge and fog computing offered cost-effective and high-quality solutions
    for managing large data volumes while ensuring privacy preservation and timely
    data handling. In their research, Alharbi et al. [70] presented a hybrid computing
    framework that integrates edge, fog, and cloud-based technologies. They quantified
    the energy consumption of IoT devices and provided reference data for future implementations.
    Although mathematical models are developed to optimize computational requirements
    and energy consumption, the study should further consider equipment deployment
    and real-world system performance. 4.3.2. IoT agricultural big data applications
    Strategies and products related to big data, including applications or tools that
    leverage data to assist farmers in making informed decisions and improving their
    farming activities, fall into the second group of research topics within the agricultural
    application layer, as illustrated in Fig. 10. IoT gadgets and frameworks in agriculture
    have collected a lot of crop and environmental data, surpassing typical farming
    practices. According to Alfred et al. [75], the successful adoption of SF depends
    on the effective integration of big data analytics and IoT technologies. Moreover,
    the study by Lassoued et al. [76] emphasizes the transformative impact of agriculture,
    where the management, sharing, and utilization of agricultural big data contribute
    to more precise and informed decision-making processes in the agricultural sector.
    Table 6 reviews related works in agricultural big data. Extracting valuable information
    from large volumes of high-dimensional big data while minimizing computational
    costs is a significant challenge in improving agricultural decision-making. Ruan
    et al. [71] proposed a granular approach (GA-SVM) that breaks down big data in
    farming systems into smaller granules, effectively addressing dimensionality issues
    encountered by conventional mining algorithms. The absence of an assessment within
    an authentic cyber-physical farming environment restricts the applicability of
    the proposed approach to broader contexts. Furthermore, the challenge of making
    fast and on-site decision-making in the context of big data analysis requires
    further investigation. The study conducted by Tseng et al. [72] centered on applying
    3D big data analysis via an intelligent platform to gain insights into environmental
    farming factors. The research aims to optimize crop selection and decision-making
    processes by integrating 3D analysis with empirical rules. The limited testing
    scale and the challenge of integrating data to reduce computational costs in densely
    monitored scenarios pose challenges for big data analysis. Li et al. [73] proposed
    a reference layered framework for agricultural IoT big data analysis. The framework
    aims to facilitate efficient communication and extract valuable information from
    agricultural data. Specifically, the study focuses on modelling crop growth curves
    using an enhanced K-means algorithm that incorporates the selection of ideal data.
    This approach improves data processing efficiency and enables real-time data transfer.
    It emphasizes the need for sophisticated algorithms to handle the complexities
    of high-dimensional agricultural big data analysis. Furthermore, evaluating and
    optimizing these algorithms within specific agricultural applications are crucial
    for successful implementation. 4.3.3. Interoperability and security of IoT smart
    farming Fig. 7 cluster C comprises research topics such as security (14 %), interoperability
    (4 %), and privacy (3 %), which represent a considerable percentage of work in
    the field of IoT-enabled smart agriculture, as illustrated in Fig. 10. However,
    the achievement of interoperability, practicality, and security remains challenges
    in this domain due to the integration of diverse platforms and the generation
    of heterogeneous data. Developing practical solutions in these aspects is crucial
    for the successful implementation and widespread adoption of IoT technologies
    in the agricultural sector. Table 7 compares related works in interoperability
    and security. Table 7. Interoperability and security in smart farming. Research
    Primitives Merits and Limitations [77] • Information Management Adapter (IMA)
    • NGSIv2 data model • Introducing \"Data Interoperability Zone\" and \"Information
    Management Adapter\" for enhanced interaction among smart farming systems. • The
    NGSIv2 data model is limited by several data types. [78] • Data model • Standard
    interface and protocol • A standardized and open platform facilitates seamless
    data sharing among diverse devices and stakeholders. • The potential privacy and
    security implications associated with data sharing is not adequately addressed.
    [79] • Cross layer threat landscape is categorized. • Serve as a reference guide
    for farmers and developers, offering insights on implementing effective and secure
    approaches in IoT-based agricultural systems. • Insufficient provision of comprehensive
    solutions to address the associated security challenges. [80] • IEC 62443 security
    standard • THREATGET • Optimizing security measures by assessing the effectiveness
    of key security attributes to maximize the impact on security. • The energy and
    computational limitations of agricultural IoT devices pose challenges for compatibility
    with traditional security approaches. Kalatzis et al. [77] proposed the concept
    of a \"Data Interoperability Zone\" and an \"Information Management Adapter\"
    to facilitate improved interaction among smart farming systems to enhance data
    interoperability. The proposed study identifies limitations in the NGSIv2 data
    model, particularly in handling various data types, which could affect the overall
    interoperability of the system. Lopez et al. [78] designed and implemented an
    interoperable platform for SF that integrates heterogeneous sources of information
    using standard interfaces and protocols. This platform enables seamless data sharing
    among different devices and stakeholders in the agricultural ecosystem. Nevertheless,
    an exhaustive investigation should be conducted into the possible privacy and
    security ramifications of data sharing, aspects of utmost importance in IoT-enabled
    farming scenarios. Interoperability in smart farming systems introduces security
    concerns related to information interaction and farming operations, particularly
    in large-scale intelligent agricultural systems. Integrating diverse and heterogeneous
    devices within cyber-physical systems poses various security risks. The studies
    by Gupta et al. [81] and Vangala et al. [82] emphasized the importance of addressing
    cybersecurity concerns in the agricultural sector. Kariri et al. [79] conducted
    a comprehensive investigation of the threat landscape in IoT agriculture systems.
    It provides a valuable resource for developers, offering insights into developing
    and implementing effective and secure approaches in IoT-based agriculture. However,
    the study fails to provide comprehensive solutions to address the security challenges
    inherent in these systems. Shaaban et al. [80] conducted research to improve security
    measures within the IoT agriculture sector. They introduce a novel algorithm that
    assesses the effectiveness of principal security attributes, aiming to maximize
    the impact on security and mitigate potential threats. The energy and computational
    constraints of agricultural IoT devices pose a compatibility challenge regarding
    traditional security approaches. It is crucial to address these limitations in
    future research to ensure the effective implementation of secure IoT farming systems.
    4.3.4. Blockchain in agriculture The last group of thematic research topics encompasses
    the domains of industry and blockchain Fig. 10, accounting for 13 % and 8 % of
    the primary research share, respectively. Notable terms associated with this group
    include supply chain, privacy, and smart contracts. The agricultural sector is
    undergoing a profound transformation fueled by the integration of IoT technology
    to address the multifaceted challenges posed by Industry 4.0 [83]. Table 8 lists
    related works in the agricultural blockchain. Table 8. Blockchain-based solutions
    for smart farming. Research Primitives Merits and Limitations [84] • Trusted Trade
    Blockchain Network Cloud Platform (TTBNCP) • Two types of blockchain nodes (full
    functionalities, simplified verification) • Trustworthy verification and tamper-proof
    mechanisms are implemented to facilitate the integration of various stakeholders.
    • Insufficient computing resources at the edge or fog level hinder real-time task
    processing. [85] • Ethereum platform • Software framework for sharing among the
    IoT devices • No reliance on intermediaries and third-party services, resulting
    in cost savings, improved efficiency, and reduced trust issues. • High requirements
    for network stability. Limited computational resources hinder the deployment of
    large-scale agricultural applications. [86] • Agricultural network attacks prevention
    scheme • Private blockchain environment (dark web technology) • Mitigate DDoS
    attacks by implementing identity authentication mechanisms and ensuring secure
    data transmission. • The transparency and immutability of private blockchains
    are limited as they are controlled by a specific group of entities. [87] • Four
    layers distributed data sharing system (smart agriculture, smart contract, remote
    users, Interplanetary File System (IPFS)) • Propose a distributed data storage
    solution that enhances flexibility and scalability, while providing resilience
    against DoS attacks. • In densely monitored agricultural environments, novel data
    processing schemes are required to handle large volumes of redundant data. [88]
    • IoT devices at field level • Blockchain backbone • Smart contract • Implementing
    algorithms • Proposed a complete blockchain system framework to establish trust
    among stakeholders in pre-harvest and post-harvest stages of agriculture, incorporating
    implementation mechanisms. • Physical layer device malfunctions or anomalies could
    negatively impact the performance of the proposed system. Blockchain technology
    has revolutionized trust by facilitating transparent data sharing across networks
    [89]. In the agricultural domain, the availability of shared resources plays a
    crucial role in fostering sustainable farming practices. Ensuring food safety
    is a growing concern encompassing the production process, from planting to harvesting,
    processing, and distribution. Lin et al. [84] introduced a conceptual SF blockchain
    framework. It includes a trusted cloud platform that serves as the core component,
    facilitating the integration of various stakeholders through trustworthy verification
    and tamper-proof mechanisms. The limited computing resources at the edge or fog
    level impeded the real-time task processing capabilities. Grecuccio et al. [85]
    introduced a novel approach combining blockchain and IoT technologies to create
    trusted systems for tracking and monitoring food quality. Their proposed solution
    utilizes the Ethereum platform and a software framework for sharing among IoT
    devices. This innovative solution eliminates the need for intermediaries and third-party
    services by leveraging a decentralized blockchain framework, resulting in cost
    savings, improved efficiency, and reduced trust issues. Nevertheless, the proposed
    architecture demands high network stability, and the dynamic and volatile nature
    of farming systems with various IoT devices may impede the effectiveness of this
    framework. The limited computational resources at the edge also hinder the system''s
    scalability. Wu et al. [86] suggested an agricultural network attacks prevention
    scheme that includes authentication mechanisms, secure data transmission, and
    a private blockchain environment using dark web technology. Their approach effectively
    mitigates distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and addresses privacy and
    security risks in agricultural systems. Nonetheless, the utilization of private
    blockchains imposes constraints on transparency and immutability, given their
    governance by a select group of entities. A scalable data-sharing system for large-scale
    distributed IoT farming was proposed by Rahman et al. [87]. It separates data
    management and storage, using smart contract built on the blockchain to govern
    data-sharing permissions among stakeholders. The Interplanetary File System (IPFS)
    stores the physical farm data. This work enhances flexibility, scalability, and
    resilience against DoS attacks in SF systems. The central objective should be
    advancing proficient data processing and storage solutions to maximize system
    performance. It will significantly enhance the system''s scalability, maximizing
    its benefits in highly monitored agricultural settings. Pranto et al. [88] devised
    a holistic blockchain system framework to foster trust among stakeholders in agriculture''s
    pre-harvest and post-harvest phases. The framework leverages IoT devices to collect
    ground data, while smart contracts facilitate automatic and trustworthy interactions
    between different entities. It is crucial to consider that the performance of
    the proposed system may be affected by physical layer device malfunctions or anomalies.
    Hence, stakeholders must proactively address these concerns and ensure the system
    operates reliably and efficiently. 5. Top 10 cited research in smart farming Fig.

    and influential research in IoT SF. Each color in the figure corresponds to a
    distinct research topic. Examining primary literature and associated citations

    network architecture classification and communication standards. Expanding upon
    this groundwork, the subsequent investigation centers on energy-efficient strategies
    and energy-harvesting methodologies, accompanied by a comprehensive examination
    of wireless communication protocols. These two studies are pivotal in establishing
    the fundamental framework for on-site monitoring in IoT-driven smart agriculture.

    a significant volume of data. The second group of studies, highlighted in light
    blue Fig. 11, explores the applications of agricultural big data. Table 10 summarizes
    their novel insights and limitations. Table 10. Agricultural big data and networking
    architecture. Research Insight Limitations Future Directions Big data [92] A customized

    of the overall technical components and flowchart of implementing big data in
    agriculture. Networking [94] A hybrid network model is invented for larger network
    coverage in rural areas. A testbed-based case study is conducted to evaluate a
    set of networking performance. The network model proposed may not be suitable
    for dense monitoring scenarios, as the arrangement of physical layer IoT devices
    is insufficient. • Cooperating with flying fog nodes to enhance the agricultural
    IoT networking scalability • Approaches for securing IoT farming network are necessary.
    Wolfert et al. [92] proposed a three-layer conceptual framework for implementing
    IoT-enabled agricultural big data applications, leading to improved decision-making
    and efficiency across the industry. However, further exploration is needed to
    investigate specific agricultural big data applications concerning emerging hardware
    and software technologies. Elijah et al. [93] presented a theoretical basis for
    agricultural IoT system architecture and related technologies, covering essential
    IoT hardware and software components, storage, agricultural IoT applications,
    and a high-level analysis of agricultural big data. These two studies provide
    theoretical and framework guidance for achieving IoT-based agricultural big data.
    Additional research is needed to develop a coherent flowchart to successfully
    implement big data in the agriculture sector, with particular attention to data
    flow management, heterogeneous data integration, and security issues. Compared
    to the first group of studies, the subsequent group of research expands the scope
    and presents a more comprehensive framework to offer enhanced services. The third
    group of research, highlighted in orange Fig. 11, is dedicated to exploring IoT
    architecture and its associated aspects. Table 11 overviews of the top-cited studies
    conducted within this research theme. Table 11. Agricultural IoT architecture.
    Research Insight Limitations Future Directions [95] Present an overview of the
    fundamental three-layer framework in IoT, along with the technologies and applications
    implemented in the field of agriculture. Emphasize the security and interoperability
    challenges associated with IoT smart farming. Numerous IoT agricultural applications
    are presented, but the specific novel contributions of each work are not extensively
    discussed. • Full stack Standards for implementing IoT in agriculture • Devices
    deployment optimization for better performance of proposed farming systems • Large-scale
    empirical prototyping or simulation model for evaluation • Across-layer security
    and privacy concerns • Interoperability among heterogeneous agents [96] Develop
    a conceptual framework to facilitate rapid prototyping of IoT solutions in agriculture,
    empowering the implementation of innovative activities. The framework primarily
    focuses on a specific use case and may have limited generalization. The comprehensive
    analysis of security concerns is beyond the scope of this study. [97] A hybrid
    network model has been invented for larger network coverage in rural areas. A
    testbed-based case study is conducted to evaluate a set of networking performance.
    System performance, intelligent hardware deployment was not evaluated in the case

    of the interconnections between these proposed technologies, applications, and
    challenges. [99] Examine IoT communication technologies and their applications
    in agriculture. Identify a set of open issues and focus on evaluating the benefits
    of integrating IoT with traditional farming practices. Insufficient emphasis on
    IoT smart agriculture infrastructure, limited analysis and categorization of relevant
    research and applications. Tzounis et al. [95] examined the technical components
    employed in each layer of the three-layer IoT architecture. The study explicitly
    highlights the platform, hardware, sensing devices, and challenges to security
    and interoperability. Popovic et al. [96] conducted a case study on designing
    a private IoT platform. The study emphasizes platform architecture and the integration
    of components and technologies within the overall structure. It offers valuable
    perspectives into the key considerations and strategies for architecting an IoT
    platform for PA. Ray et al. [97] proposed a six-layer full-stack IoT conceptual
    farming framework. It investigates IoT technologies in agriculture, including
    hardware and software components, and presents real-world case studies such as
    intelligent irrigation and monitoring. This analysis provides valuable insights
    into the diverse range of IoT technologies used in agriculture and their practical
    implementation. Ayaz et al. [98] encompassed various agricultural IoT components
    and communication methods for agricultural applications. It discusses mainstream
    hardware, software technologies, and mobile applications while also providing
    an overview of UAV applications in agriculture. Khanna et al. [99] explored the
    utilization of IoT communication technologies in agriculture, with a particular
    focus on assessing the advantages of integrating IoT into conventional farming
    methods. The last highly cited study, highlighted in red Fig. 11, focuses on network
    architecture in rural farming areas. The proposed hybrid network architecture
    [94] combines WiLD and 6LoWPANs to extend network coverage in rural areas, as
    summarized in Table 10. This architecture is designed to support information collection
    and transmission in large-scale agricultural scenarios, and it has gained significant
    attention due to its relevance to real-world network requirements. However, it
    is worth emphasizing that the suggested network model may not be suitable for
    dense monitoring scenarios due to limitations in the arrangement of physical layer
    IoT devices. These investigations illuminate the transformative capacity of the
    IoT in the agricultural domain. They serve as foundational research, providing
    valuable insights and guidance for practical implementations, prototype designs,
    and related investigations in IoT SF. However, it is important to acknowledge
    that these studies primarily focus on fundamental aspects and may not cover topics
    such as IoT standards for agriculture, evaluation of large-scale scenarios, optimization
    of agricultural system performance, and security concerns. Future research should
    address these concerns to further advance the implementation of IoT in agricultural
    domain. 6. High-impact research in smart farming citation network Citation networks
    consist of citation nodes and their connected edges, and for network analysis,
    betweenness centrality is a crucial metric for determining the significance or
    influence of research nodes. Intermediary bridges facilitate communication between
    two network nodes that are not adjacent. According to Freeman (1979), the formation
    of the entire network requires intermediate members. Therefore, betweenness centrality
    is a metric for a set of indispensable citation nodes in the citation network
    that is interconnected and function as intermediaries for the entire domain (if
    a member is located on multiple shortest paths of other members, then that member
    is a core member and has greater betweenness centrality). In the citation network,
    if a research node attains a centrality score greater than 0.1 when we calculate
    it using the Eigenvector-based betweenness centrality algorithm, as shown in Fig.
    12, it represents its importance within the citation network. The five most significant
    nodes of mediation in the citation network are labelled from highest to lowest
    score as follows: [97] (0.2), [100] (0.18), [101] (0.17), [102] (0.14), and [92]
    (0.11). The centrality of a study in the citation network depends on its importance
    and the relevance of connected research. Influential citations within the broader
    research field directly impact the node''s centrality score. Evaluating a research''s
    influence and centrality involves considering its interconnectedness. Table 12
    overviews of five influential studies with high centrality scores and presents
    a comparative analysis of their strengths and weaknesses. Download : Download

    The integration, management, and security measures associated with the integration
    of heterogeneous agricultural big data and relevant big data applications are
    beyond the scope of this study. Ray et al. [97] summarized the IoT conceptual
    framework, functional model, and application architecture in agriculture. It analyzes
    the IoT characteristics relevant to agriculture-specific applications and presents
    commonly used IoT technologies. However, the study overlooks scalability, security,
    and system performance issues in large-scale scenarios, focusing primarily on
    providing an overview of IoT farming applications with the necessary devices and
    wireless technologies. The research conducted by Harun et al. [100], Roopaei et
    al. [101], and Krishnan et al. [102] specifically pertained to traditional applications
    such as automatic irrigation systems. Their studies examine various aspects, including
    threshold warning-driven irrigation techniques, irrigation systems hosted on cloud
    platforms, and fuzzy logic-based irrigation control. Harun et al. [100] introduced
    an infrastructure for an automatic irrigation system, where sensors transmit automation
    commands guided by predefined thresholds, providing a foundational example of
    IoT SF applications. However, it is crucial to note that the prototype framework
    lacks a systematic evaluation to ensure its generalizability. Roopaei et al. [101]
    proposed a fog-based processing and cloud-based data synchronization architecture
    to address real-time processing and storage challenges. They also explored the
    integration of thermal imaging to optimize traditional ground sensor-based irrigation
    models. The work requires evaluation in dense monitoring scenarios, including
    energy efficiency, security, and networking considerations. Krishnan et al. [102]
    utilized a logical inference system to analyze data from various sensors and determine
    appropriate automatic irrigation actions. It provides a comprehensive standard
    flowchart for an irrigation system and conducted a case study to validate its
    effectiveness. It lacks a comprehensive analysis of the proposed system''s impact
    on crop yield and scalability in dense monitoring scenarios. The study conducted
    by Wolfert et al. [92] provided an overview of agricultural big data applications,
    challenges, and prospects. It offers valuable insights into the benefits of SF
    big data applications, assisting stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding
    implementing big data technologies. However, it is important to note that the
    study needs to explore the integration, management, and security measures associated
    with heterogeneous agricultural big data and applications, as these aspects fall
    beyond the scope of the study. 7. Mapping research trajectories in smart farming
    In the dynamic process of scientific research, specific scientific studies often
    undergo a citation burst, wherein they experience a sudden and substantial increase
    in citations. These citation bursts signify the rapid surge in attention and interest
    devoted to a particular research domain or topic at a given time. Table 13 lists
    the top 18 research with strong citation bursts, but the subsequent discussions
    will be limited to the studies with the strongest burst among those that simultaneously
    began to burst. In addition, we will discuss the most recent burst research that
    reveals the current research trend. Table 13. Citation burst in smart farming

    2.67 The earliest citation boom in IoT precision agriculture research occurred
    between 2016 and 2019. Notably, studies by Gubbi et al. [103] and Al-Fuqaha et
    al. [106] comprehensively studied the fundamental concepts and enabling technologies
    of the Internet of Things (IoT), covering aspects such as architecture, devices,
    and protocols. These studies play a significant role in shaping the understanding
    and propelling the development of IoT in agricultural scenarios. While IoT technology
    has been around since 1994 (credited to Kevin Ashton, one of the founders of MIT''s
    Auto-ID Center, who coined the term Internet of Things), its adoption in the agricultural
    sector gained significant attention only about a decade ago. The citation burst
    in 2016 signifies a growing interest in utilizing IoT technology in the traditional
    agricultural industry to address agricultural challenges and enhance farming practices.
    Ojha et al. [90] experienced a significant citation burst between 2017 and 2020,
    indicating its considerable impact. The study primarily centers on wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs) of smart farming systems. WSNs serve as the grounded infrastructure
    for data collection and communication, playing a crucial role in implementing
    IoT-based solutions. The citation burst indicates the research focus on nearfield
    agriculture-specific WSNs. It highlights the objective of designing a customized
    network architecture with suitable hardware and software technologies to meet
    the specific application requirements. Starting from 2017, the citation count
    of automated irrigation system by Gutierrez et al. [104] has shown a notable increase.
    The surge in this research topic highlights the shift of research focus towards
    the application as the theoretical frameworks, conceptual models, and technologies
    continue to evolve in agriculture sector. A notable focus of applied research,
    particularly in irrigation systems integrating monitoring and automated control,
    revolves around evaluating and refining theories, frameworks, and technologies
    through practical applications. The primary objective is to ensure their effectiveness
    in addressing agricultural challenges and enhancing agricultural practices. By
    incorporating real-world agricultural scenarios, stakeholders aim to validate
    and optimize these elements, achieving practical and impactful outcomes. As illustrated
    in Table 13, a cluster of research citations indicates a rising trend, highlighting
    the growing significance of the associated research topics. In the dynamic landscape
    of IoT smart agriculture, related applications and research efforts extend beyond
    the usability of technologies and architectures. It encompasses higher-order requirements
    such as efficient IoT farming system management, privacy and security considerations
    in agricultural systems, and system performance optimization. Saiz-Rubio & Rovira-Maz
    [105] offered a management loop that includes crop data acquisition, variable
    rate control, automation, agricultural big data, and decision-making. The citation
    burst in this area reflects the growing importance and popularity of research
    on managing and leveraging agricultural data and data-driven applications in the
    context of the expanding adoption and scale of smart farming. These studies offer
    crucial assurance for enhancing agricultural productivity and quality in a sustainable
    manner. The studies by Ferrag et al. [107] and Yang et al. [114] demonstrated
    a notable citation burst, which specifically survey authentication, confidentiality,
    non-repudiation, integrity, and access control aspects to provide valuable insights
    into the latest security and privacy hazard. Employing computing and energy-constrained
    devices pose challenges for traditional network methods like encryption and security
    authentication. The unique characteristics of the IoT farming systems, including
    dense monitoring requirements and a heterogeneous landscape, necessitate specialized
    security approaches to address compatibility issues. It indicates the increasing
    focus on security and privacy issues and the need for effective solutions. Liu
    et al. [113] and Torky et al. [115] have witnessed a citation burst, primarily
    focusing exploring blockchain technology to address security and privacy concerns
    in agriculture resulting from adopting IoT technologies and achieving interoperability.
    As smart agriculture continues to gain momentum, the advancement of agricultural
    big data heavily relies on facilitating data sharing and integration. Ensuring
    the security and privacy of data during the sharing process for stakeholders becomes
    increasingly crucial. The surge in citations signifies the growing research emphasis
    on utilizing blockchain technology in conjunction with the widespread implementation
    of IoT in agriculture. The research by Kim et al. [109] on UAVs in agriculture
    has experienced a surge in citations. It explores the application of UAVs for
    tasks like automated spraying, monitoring, and terrain mapping, introducing specialized
    UAV devices and communication methods for agricultural use. The increasing number
    of citations on this topic reflects the growing interest in using UAVs. This interest
    stems from the fact that UAVs can provide mobility and act as gateways or relay
    nodes, thereby enhancing data transmission and processing based on the traffic
    conditions of ground sensors. Overcoming the limitations of energy-constrained
    agricultural sensors, UAVs improve the system''s overall performance. 8. Discussion
    and future research directions 8.1. Discussion In the preceding sections, we critically
    investigate the interdisciplinary research domain of SF, exploring research subfield
    clustering, influential high citation studies, critical research in the citation
    network, and trends revealed by citation burst analysis. The extensive investigation
    of relevant research conducted under diverse thematic domains reveals an accumulation
    of research outcomes encompassing system conceptual models, network frameworks,
    automation control, computing architectures, security methods, and predictive
    decision-making applications. The complexities and specificities of the agricultural
    domain, such as large cultivated areas, harsh natural conditions, limited infrastructure
    in remote regions, energy and computation constraints, and the need for dense
    monitoring, have posed challenges in the widespread implementation of IoT SF prototypes
    in large real-life farming scenarios. Many of the studies reviewed in this work
    center on conceptual model development and small-scale prototype testing. However,
    these studies prioritize utilizing existing technologies to achieve agricultural
    intelligence, often overlooking efficacy, applicability, and scalability considerations.
    The unique characteristics of the agriculture sector call for tailored and innovative
    solutions to effectively address the diverse requirements and concerns and ensure
    its successful integration into real-world agricultural practices to achieve sustainability
    with minimal inputs and optimal outputs. Energy consumption: Wireless sensors
    and routing nodes form the near-field communication architecture, which collects
    and transmits agricultural parameters to facilitate data-driven agricultural activities.
    However, it is crucial to address the issue of battery-powered IoT devices, as
    their depletion can lead to system anomalies or paralysis, warranting further
    attention. The energy-efficient strategies in smart farming encompass energy harvesting
    [43], but weather conditions and device investment limit their effectiveness.
    Additionally, using low-power communication technologies [50,59] can lead to low
    data rates affecting real-time agricultural decision-making. Data reduction methods
    [57] are employed but may not be suitable for intensive monitoring scenarios.
    Moreover, routing protocols to alleviate energy holes [61] necessitate continuous
    computation and transformation of transmission paths based on nodes’ energy level,
    introducing challenges related to computational resources, energy consumption,
    and delays. Agricultural system network performance: Network performance metrics
    such as latency, data transmission hop count, and packet delivery rate are crucial
    in achieving real-timecontrol, precise decision-making, and network security.
    However, these network performance parameters are often overlooked due to the
    focus of IoT smart farming research on applications and the integration of existing
    technologies to achieve agricultural intelligence. Only a limited number of studies
    have explored the optimization of agricultural system latency by reducing network
    load by using flying nodes [42,58].Recent research citation burst [109] indicates
    a growing interest in investigating flying nodes as an effective method to optimize
    energy consumption and reduce latency. Some studies have proposed incorporating
    edge computing nodes to handle time-sensitive tasks [51]. Notably, there remains
    a need for further research that specifically emphasizes monitoring and enhancing
    parameters like data transmission hop count and packet delivery rate. In large-scale
    smart farming scenarios, the end-to-end data transmission hop count significantly
    impacts system security and data quality. The dynamic nature of the WSNs in smart
    farming leads to data losses that directly affect the effectiveness of data-driven
    agricultural applications. Security concerns: The IoT farming system consists
    of many energy and computation-constrained wireless devices, making traditional
    mature network and system security measures unsuitable for direct implementation
    in agricultural applications. The increasing citations indicate an increasing
    awareness of agricultural system security concerns. However, a substantial research
    gap remains, with only a few studies addressing security concerns. Shaaban et
    al. [80] proposed a range of traditional encryption algorithms, communication
    protocols, and access control methods; however, these face limitations due to
    device energy and computation constraints. Lin et al. [84] and Pranto et al. [88]
    introduced blockchain-based technologies to enhance the security of agricultural
    data. The growing number of related citations [107,114] indicate increasing concerns
    in addressing privacy and data security in agricultural systems. Nevertheless,
    blockchain technology mainly focuses on application-level data security and privacy,
    leaving notable research gaps in addressing network security issues in near-field
    WSNs of farming systems, such as data injection and tampering. 8.2. Future research
    directions Our extensive review of research in IoT smart farming shows that unresolved
    issues and challenges require further attention from the research communities.
    The promising directions are introduced. • Various energy-constrained devices,
    such as sensors and routing nodes, perform tasks related to sensing and interaction.
    Developing energy models for these devices can assist in assessing and optimizing
    the energy consumption of relevant IoT agricultural applications. • The simulation
    framework of agricultural systems integrates virtual agents representing relevant
    agricultural IoT devices, along with their configurations, such as field size,
    number of devices, and locations. Additionally, it encompasses the interaction
    mechanism among these devices. This framework enables the rapid prototyping of
    agricultural system conceptual models, including node deployment and communication
    setup, allowing for evaluating and optimizing network performance in simulated
    real-world scenarios. • Developing anomaly detection algorithms helps mitigate
    the risk of data tampering and injection caused by the energy and computational
    limitations of underlying network devices in IoT agricultural systems. As these
    devices might not support complex security measures, anomaly detection becomes
    essential in identifying and addressing potential data integrity issues. • SDN
    optimizes overall network performance by enhancing resource management and scheduling.
    It enables dynamic resource allocation, efficient traffic control, and adaptability
    to changing demands, improving smart farming system efficiency and effectiveness.
    9. Conclusion The increasing attention to adopting IoT technology to address challenges
    related to the overconsumption of non-renewable resources and climate change is
    crucial in promoting sustainable agricultural development. Through an extensive
    review of research in the field of IoT smart farming, the study classifies research
    into different thematic categories, explores highly cited foundational literature,
    examines critical nodes in citation networks, and analyses citation burst trends
    in relevant research topics. The primary goals of this review are to provide stakeholders
    and policymakers with a comprehensive understanding of the field, identify key
    research directions within each theme, and gain valuable insights from analyzing
    foundational literature and significant research nodes. Through the examination,
    the study aims to unveil the evolution of research interests and offer crucial
    theoretical and practical guidance for advancing the field further. Finally, based
    on an investigation of existing research, this review highlights several pending
    issues in energy consumption, network performance of agricultural systems, and
    security, and possible future research directions, including energy models of
    farming systems, simulation architectures, anomaly detection algorithms, and SDN.
    The review adopts cluster analysis to identify subfields within research topics.
    However, the threshold selection for topic keywords could introduce bias and errors.
    Subjective judgment in theme identification may lead to diverse categorizations
    and potential study selection bias. Future reviews adopting a similar approach
    could collaborate with more feedback from domain experts and use advanced language
    models to address these limitations for more objective and accurate results. Credit

  description: Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often struggle to optimize
    their production processes and products due to limited resources and lack of expertise
    in technological solutions. To address this issue, this research work presents
    a multi-purpose platform that can be used by SMEs as easy-to use support tool
    to run what-if analyses to optimize their products and production processes design.
    The platform fulfills the requirements of interoperability, accessibility, and
    usability and is built upon a layered infrastructure, consisting of specific modules
    within its Decision-Making Layer, Data Exchange Layer, and User Management Layer.
    The platform integrates several software, including Plant Simulation, Autodesk
    Inventor Nastran, and Autodesk Inventor Nesting, to simulate production processes,
    to run finite element analysis, and to optimize raw material utilization. The
    interoperability and data exchange are ensured through the adoption of FIWARE,
    an open-source framework for IoT platforms, which enables the harmonized representation
    of data formats and semantics among different applications and software within
    the platform. The User Management Layer allows SMEs to easily interact with the
    platform, making it an easy-to-use tool even for those with limited IT competencies.
    A case study conducted by an SME in the furniture sector demonstrated the platform's
    effectiveness in achieving optimal design and production of a new bookcase, resulting
    in increased efficiency, reduced costs, and improved profitability. The modular
    structure of the platform enables potential future integration of additional modules,
    such as quality control, supply chain management, etc., further enhancing its
    capabilities and potential benefits for SMEs. The proposed multi-purpose platform
    represents a valuable tool for SMEs to optimize their production processes and
    products and to overcome the limitations due to their limited resources and expertise
    in technological solutions.

    TwinDecision-Making 1. Introduction The industry 4.0 (I4.0) paradigm is changing
    business practices, through the spread of new concepts and technologies such as
    the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), cyber-physical systems, big data, digital
    twins, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (Boyes et al., 2018; Wang et al.,
    2022). Nowadays, companies need to effectively and efficiently exploit the opportunities
    offered by all these innovations to be competitive on a global basis. In this
    context, the manufacturing industry is continually characterized by new challenging
    issues such as maintaining a high quality and level of customization of the product,
    while ensuring limited costs (Adamczyk et al., 2020). Basically, in recent years
    there has been a shift away from standardized and mass manufacturing to production
    more oriented to individual customer needs. This has made planning and executing
    business practices very complex and challenging. The ongoing digital transformation
    is completely redefining the way of designing, producing and distributing products
    towards more sustainable and resilient manufacturing systems and supply chains
    (Rajesh, 2021, Ambrogio et al., 2022). One of the main consequences of the advent
    of I4.0 technologies concerns the significant growth of data generated, not only
    in terms of volume, but also and above all in terms of variety. A large number
    of systems and therefore actors are today connected to each other to exchange
    data and information (e.g., suppliers, customers, other stakeholders, etc.). For
    this exchange to be successful, it is necessary to guarantee adequate levels of
    interoperability, considering that each system has its own rules and communication
    protocols. The term interoperability indicates “the ability of two or more systems
    components to exchange information or to and use the information that has been
    exchanged” (Chapurlat and Daclin, 2012). The lack of coherence from a semantic
    and/or syntactic point of view can make collaboration, communication and decision-making
    very difficult during the entire product life cycle (Ameri et al., 2022). Common
    examples of Semantic Interoperability Conflicts (SICs) are (Melluso et al., 2022):
    different interpretations of the same domain (e.g., two or more different acronyms
    for the same concept, same term to represent concepts with different meaning),
    different attributes to represent the same concept in different sources, different
    representations in terms of scale or precision value for refer to the same concept
    (Chen et al., 2008, Jirkovský et al., 2016, Orgun et al., 2008). In this challenging
    context, FIWARE represents one of the most promising frameworks. It is an open-source
    solution, which provides users with various tools such as standard Application
    Programming Interfaces (APIs), enablers (generic and specific), data models, aimed
    at the effective and efficient building of smart applications in several domains
    such as Industry 4.0, Smart Cities, Agri-Food, Energy (FIWARE, 2023). FIWARE is
    able to offer various functions, according to the user''s needs, such as management
    of context information, translation of multiple communication protocols into a
    single basic protocol, support in the design and development of smart ecosystems
    (Alves et al., 2023). To date, significant efforts have been made in using FIWARE
    to support smart farming (López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Zamora-Izquierdo et al.,
    2019). Interesting applications are present in various other areas such as smart
    cities (Araujo et al., 2019), education (Zaharov et al., 2018), energy (Terroso-Saenz
    et al., 2019), healthcare (Fazio et al., 2015), supply chain management (Muñuzuri
    et al., 2020). However, today it represents a promising tool to enable and support
    the Digital Twin paradigm. Indeed, the use of FIWARE is crucial especially in
    the twinning process, which involves the physical and virtual world (Conde et
    al., 2022): any change of the physical entity is captured through an IoT sensor
    and translated into an update in the virtual world; correspondingly, each update
    on the virtual entity is translated into an update of the state of the physical
    entity by means of an IoT actuator. In this context, the IoT Agents offered by
    FIWARE can work as a bridge between the different protocols used in the real environment
    (different standards could be present, considering the multitude of sensors existing
    today) and the virtual environment. Although there is today a very high interest
    around FIWARE, there is still much to do: the contributions are all very recent
    and efforts are needed for this solution to become mature and recognized. Currently
    a query on Scopus, generically using “FIWARE” (field: “Article title, Abstract,
    Keywords) generates less than 300 results. Among these documents, none explicitly
    and specifically focuses on the needs of the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).
    In accordance with the EU recommendation 2003/361, SMEs are firms with a turnover
    of less than 50 million euros and fewer than 250 employees. In the scientific
    literature, many I4.0-driven solutions have been recently designed to support
    business operations (Zutshi and Grilo, 2019, Mourtzis, 2020, Sahal et al., 2020,
    Kabugo et al., 2020, Longo et al., 2022, Christou et al., 2022, Tolio et al.,
    2023), but only a few have been thought to meet the specific needs of SMEs. Liu
    et al. (2022) designed and implemented DIGICOR, an I4.0 platform to dynamically
    support collaborations between SMEs along supply chains. Among the services offered,
    support in production planning and control, and in logistics. Collaboration issues
    were also addressed by Cotrino et al. (2021), who designed and developed Industry
    4.0 HUB, a web-based platform aimed at transferring knowledge to SMEs in a cooperative
    manner. Kumari et al. (2015) proposed a self-adaptive and multi-agent system to
    help SMEs in the decision-making process, with a focus on outsourcing related
    decisions. Integrating the new I4.0 tools into SMEs is extremely challenging for
    numerous reasons, as reported by Orzes et al. (2020), who detected five main types
    of obstacles: (i) the vast majority of SMEs have significant constraints from
    a financial point of view, which limit their ability to invest in innovative technologies,
    whose expected benefits may not be clearly known; (ii) the limited level of advanced
    knowledge and technical skills can discourage the adoption of very complex and/or
    still little-known I4.0 technologies; (iii) another reason for the limited diffusion
    of the I4.0 paradigm in SMEs concerns the lack of adequate IT infrastructures
    in terms of connectivity (Mourtzis et al., 2021) and platforms/architectures capable
    of ensuring interoperability and compatibility between systems (Müller et al.,
    2018); (iv) moreover, many SMEs rely on not very well skilled managers, who are
    quite conservative and unwilling to introduce risky innovations; (v) the processes
    of integration and consequent implementation of new technologies within already
    existing SMEs can be very complex, in the absence of adequate management and experience
    in managing changes in business models (Sjödin et al., 2018). 2. Research gaps
    and our contribution With the aim of identifying the main current research gaps,
    the most relevant and recent I4.0 platforms currently existing in the literature
    were analyzed and classified in Table 1, based on 5 fundamental dimensions: •
    focus on interoperability: the feature is considered present if it is explicitly
    explained how to guarantee interoperability; the absence of the feature in Table
    1 does not necessarily imply that the platform is non-interoperable, but rather
    that this topic is not the focus of the paper, therefore it is not very well explained.
    • modularity: the feature is considered present if the platform has a modular
    structure; • focus on SMEs: the feature is considered present if the platform
    has characteristics that meet the specific needs of SMEs; • integration with commercial
    software: the feature is considered present if integration with one or more commercial
    software is explicitly mentioned. • Real case study: the feature is considered
    present if the platform is validated through one or more case studies. Table 1.

    Summarizing, there is a need for solutions that can support the transition of
    SMEs towards the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies. This need is urgent because
    they need to remain competitive in a constantly changing landscape (Masood and
    Sonntag, 2020). From the analysis of the scientific literature, some relevant
    research gaps clearly emerge: • currently, there is a shortage of ready-to-use
    I4.0 solutions for SMEs, which are often unable to implement this novel paradigm
    effectively and efficiently, due to significant financial, technical, social,
    and cultural constraints (Orzes et al., 2019); • despite the recent proliferation
    of I4.0-driven solutions, there is still little focus on interoperability issues.
    This makes their lifecycle and reusability extremely limited, as they cannot interface
    properly with additional internal or external business modules. According to Ameri
    et al. (2022), one of the keys to the successful implementation of Industry 4.0
    paradigm is the ability to effectively and efficiently collect, process, analyze,
    communicate and store data; • FIWARE is an extremely promising solution, but significant
    research efforts are still needed for it to reach full maturity and be recognized
    on a large-scale. Furthermore, despite its countless benefits, it is currently
    not known to SMEs; • there is a need for general I4.0 platforms/architectures,
    which encompass multiple functionalities, with the aim of limiting the number
    of interfaces and facilitating data exchange. To overcome the research gaps highlighted
    above, this paper proposes an I4.0 multi-purpose platform, aimed at supporting
    SMEs in the transition towards the new paradigms of the fourth industrial revolution.
    The platform aims to increase the adoption of the new Industry 4.0 concepts in
    the SMEs, through its high usability, to the point that even users with poor IT
    knowledge can use it effectively and efficiently, through a web-based interface.
    Furthermore, the proposal is based on the use of FIWARE to face the current challenges
    related to interoperability. Despite of the numerous theoretical solutions present
    in the literature, the platform is tested and validated with promising practical
    results on a real-life case study, which refers to the furniture sector. The rest
    of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 concerns the materials and methods,
    therefore the proposed I4.0 multi-purpose platform is presented and described.
    In Section 3, concerning the calculation, the real-life case study is described,
    the results of which are reported in Section 4. Conclusions are in Section 5.
    3. Materials and methods The proposed research work has been devoted to develop
    a multi-purpose platform that can be used by SMEs as support tool in order to
    optimize the design of production processes and products. The starting point of
    the research activities has been the definition of a reference methodological
    approach that outlines the roadmap for the design of the conceptual architecture
    being used to develop a concrete technological platform. The proposed platform,
    based on a layered infrastructure, combines different modules and it fulfils the
    requirements of interoperability, accessibility and usability. The modules can
    easily communicate each other by exchanging input (design parameters) and output
    (KPIs) data; the syntactic and semantic interoperability makes the platform usable
    by different companies adopting also different internal procedures and standards.
    The platform is also easy to use and does not require specific technical competences.
    In this section, the authors present a detailed description of the research work
    material and methods. In particular, section 2.1 presents the methodological reference
    approach whose technological translation results in the proposed multi-purpose
    platform being described in section 2.2. 3.1. Reference methodological approach
    The reference methodological approach can be conceptualized in the following steps:
    ‐ STEP1: PROCESS AND PRODUCT MAPPING This step aims at assessing the current status
    of SMEs production process and product design features. Production flow and layout,
    equipment and tools, machinery type, machine and workers number, workers characteristics,
    work methods and operations, products dimensions and weight, materials, sub-components
    number and quantity can be considered as information and data which may be used
    to define an “AS IS” status. It is important to remark that the selection of the
    information and data to be collected changes based on the reference context being
    considered. ‐ STEP2: PROCESS AND PRODUCT DIGITALIZATION Based on the data and
    information collected during the STEP1, next step is to proceed with the digitalization
    of SMEs production processes and products. The idea is to create digital mirrors
    of the real systems (processes and products) which can be used for optimization
    purposes. Software and tools being used for the digitalization are mentioned in
    section 2.2.1. ‐ STEP3: KEY PERFOMANCE INDICATORS (KPIs) DEFINITION The reference
    methodological approach proceeds by the definition of the KPIs which SMEs would
    like to monitor and optimize. Among the others, flow time, machine and workers
    utilization rate may be examples of KPIs characterizing the production processes,
    while, for instance, product physical characteristics such as materials deformations
    levels or sub-components number that can be produced by using the same raw materials
    quantity can be noted as KPI examples for product design optimization. KPIs definition
    can definitely vary according to the reference context and company’s targets.
    The full list of the defined KPIs for the developed platform is reported in Appendix
    (please refer to Table A1). ‐ STEP4: DESIGN PARAMETERS DEFINITION At this stage
    the proposed approach requires an analysis for detecting the main design parameters
    that could have an impact to the production processes and product KPIs. Workers
    number and efficiency or production batch sizes may be good examples of design
    parameters related to the production processes, while dimensions and material
    types can be listed as design parameters for products design optimization. As
    for the KPIs definition, the selection of the design parameters is definitely
    specific to the reference context. The complete list of the proposed design parameters
    within the platform is reported in Appendix (please refer to Table A1). ‐ STEP5:
    DECISION MAKING PROCESS The decision-making process is the core of the proposed
    reference methodological approach and it enables a set of what-if analyses to
    improve and optimize the KPI based on the variation of the design parameters values.
    The conceptual architecture of the approach results in a sort of cycle of continuous
    performance improvement carried out by SMEs, in a digital way, by means of the
    proposed platform: at first step, the current state of the production process
    and product is assessed in terms of the selected KPIs (STEP 5.1 in Fig. 1), then
    alternative manufacturing process and product configurations are generated by
    changing the values of design parameters (STEP 5.2 in Fig. 1) and, finally, the
    impact of those configurations to the selected KPIs is evaluated (STEP 5.3 in
    Fig. 1). The cycle can be repeated till the KPIs are optimized. ‐ STEP6: RESULTS

    full-size image Fig. 1. Reference methodological approach. The implementation
    in the physical systems of the design parameters values leading to the KPIs optimization
    of the production processes and products completes the proposed approach. The
    aforementioned approach is depicted in Fig. 1. 3.2. The multi-purpose platform
    The technological translation of the conceptual architecture (discussed in section
    2.1) results in the development of the multi-purpose platform. End users can easily
    access the platform through a Web Application (Web App), thus beginning a what-if
    analysis process devoted to improve and optimize the product and/or production
    process KPIs. Basically, SMEs can select, in the Web App, specific product and/or
    production process design parameters, change their values and ask the multi-purpose
    platform for the quantitative evaluation of the effects of those design parameters
    to the selected KPIs. Design parameters values are distributed along the platform
    infrastructure to the modules. The platform modules that receive those data, implement
    the design parameters values in their application and run the simulations. The
    simulation runs provide as output updated KPIs values which are sent back from
    modules to the end users through the Web App. The end users can assess the KPIs
    values and decide whether to keep the design parameters values (which have been
    given from SMEs as input to the platform to get the update KPIs values) or to
    start a further optimization run. The platform is based on a layered infrastructure
    whose preliminary view is depicted in Fig. 2. The infrastructure is characterized
    by three layers: the Decision-Making Layer (DML), the Data Exchange Layer (DEL)
    and the User Management Layer (UML). Looking at Fig. 2 from a top-down perspective,
    DML consists of the Simulation based Digital Twin (SDT) module, the Finite Element
    Analysis module (FEA) and the Nesting module (NES), DEL leverages on the open
    standards-based cloud FIWARE and UML consists of the Starter Kit module. It''s
    important to note that the platform has been intentionally designed to be modular.
    Consequently, within the DML, the potential exists for the incorporation of additional
    modules in the future, based on the evolving requirements and demands of manufacturing
    systems. Examples of such modules include those for quality control and supply
    chain management. Nevertheless, it''s important to highlight that in the current
    stage of platform development, specific software for these modules, along with
    the corresponding design parameters and KPIs, have not yet been selected. These
    decisions will be made as part of future research, as outlined in the conclusion.

    the platform''s adaptability and potential for modularity. Download : Download

    and multi-purpose platform infrastructure. Furthermore, system latency, which
    refers to the time it takes to respond to a user''s request, and the level of
    end users’ expertise required to provide necessary input, can be also quantified.
    The transmission times between UML and DEL (and vice versa), as well as between
    DEL and DML (and vice versa), are in the order of milliseconds. Concerning the
    processing times of each module within the DML, these are typically in the order
    of seconds. Among these modules, the SDT module is the most critical in terms
    of processing time, as it depends on the complexity and duration of the production
    process. However, in order to minimize this processing time, the authors have
    configured the SDT module to operate at maximum simulation speed by utilizing
    a feature called ''Start fast forward simulation,'' which is provided by the software
    employed for its development (see Section 2.2.1). Consequently, the overall time
    from when an end user clicks the button to send process/product design parameters
    values to when they receive a response from the platform falls within the range
    of seconds. As for the end user experience required to use the platform, the level
    of IT knowledge needed is basic. No specific or deep IT expertise is necessary,
    and the interaction is similar to using a standard web page online. However, end
    users are expected to possess expertise in their respective domains of work. They
    should be knowledgeable about manufacturing system production processes and products
    in order to select and configure the design parameters correctly. Additionally,
    an understanding of manufacturing system KPIs is essential to make informed decisions.
    Following, in sections 2.2.1, 2.2.2 and 2.2.3, the layers description is presented,
    while section 2.4 lists and shortly present the software and hardware used for
    the development and the implementation of the platform. 3.2.1. Decision-Making
    Layer (DML) The DML enables to run products and production processes simulations
    in order to evaluate the quantitative effects of selected design parameters on
    several KPIs. Basically, each module within this layer, receives design parameters
    values as input, run either products or production processes simulations and provides
    KPIs values as output, thus enabling end users to carry out a set of what-if analyses
    devoted to the products and production processes optimization. The DML consists
    of the following 3 modules: ‐ SDT module: this module recreates the simulation
    model of the real SMEs’ production processes with the aim of carrying out the
    quantitative evaluation of the effects of the design parameters on the production
    processes KPIs. Plant Simulation from TECNOMATIX is the software that has been
    integrated within the platform in order to develop the simulation models. Further
    information on Plant Simulation software can be found at https://www.dex.siemens.com/plm/tecnomatix/plant-simulation;
    ‐ FEA module: this module aims at running finite element analysis (FEA) in order
    to either properly design new products from a structural point of view or to improve
    the structural design of existing ones. Autodesk Inventor Nastran is the software
    that has been integrated within the platform to conduct FEA studies. Further information
    on Autodesk Inventor Nastran can be found at https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor-nastran/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription;
    ‐ NES module: this module has been developed to conduct nesting studies in order
    to optimize efficiency in terms of flat raw material yield in the manufacturing
    process of a product. Basically, SMEs can assess different products design in
    terms of product dimensions with the aim at optimizing the raw material utilization
    rate. Based on the data received in input, the module generates a series of suggested
    nest aiming at reducing raw material wastes and therefore costs. Autodesk Inventor
    Nesting is the software that has been integrated within the platform in order
    to carry out the nesting studies. Further information on Autodesk Inventor Nesting
    can be found at https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor-nesting/. 3.2.2. Data
    Exchange Layer (DEL) One of the main research issues to be tackled by the authors
    is that applications and software behind each platform module are neither syntactically
    nor semantically interoperable and therefore not able to communicate as well as
    to exchange data each other. In order to proper address and solve this issue the
    multi-purpose platform leverages on FIWARE (further information on FIWARE can
    be found out at https://www.fiware.org/), an open-source framework for IoT platforms
    whose aim is to build sustainable ecosystems for smart solution development that,
    through the joint use of standard components and architectures, enables interoperable
    data exchange among the platform modules as well as between the platform and the
    outside world (i.e., SMEs). The interoperable data exchange is guaranteed by the
    adoption of data models, which define the harmonized representation of data formats
    and semantics being used by applications and software within the platform. A data
    model can be defined as a list of data that need to be processed by each platform
    module. For each platform module, two data models have been defined: the first
    one to manage the data in input to the module (i.e., design parameters) and the
    second one to manage the data in output from the module (i.e., KPIs). A data model
    consists of a list of attribute and types; an attribute identifies either the
    design parameters or the KPI that can be processed by a module, while the type
    represents a classification of type of data (i.e., int, double, Boolean, etc.)
    that an attribute can hold and that can be easily interpreted by a computer system.
    Table 2 offers an overview of the number of design parameters and KPIs for each
    DML module, while the data models details including descriptions, attributes and
    types is reported in Table A1, in the Appendix. Table 2. Number of design parameters
    and KPIs. DML Design parameters # (input data #) KPIs # (output data #) SDT Module
    8 7 FEA Module 7 4 NES Module 15 4 Following the data exchange flow within the
    platform is detailed. The data flow management involves the use of FIWARE''s Orion
    Context Broker (CB) component. The CB has the following functionalities: (1) receive
    data from the modules, (2) store the received data, and (3) send the data to the
    modules. Basically, the CB component can be seen as a message dispatcher through
    which the different platform modules can communicate each other. Each module can
    send data to the CB through the Sender software application (the sending operation
    is named publish) and, at the same time, receive data from the CB through the
    Receiver software application (the receiving operation is named subscribe). The
    aforementioned software applications are implemented within the Middleware component
    located within the modules. Each module can send data to the CB and receive from
    the CB the data for which a subscription has been done. Moreover, it has to be
    pointed out that the CB can receive and send data only in NGSIV2 format, while
    each module processes data in its own format that may differ from the NGSIV2 format.
    Therefore, to ensure the data exchange interoperability among the modules, a NGSIV2
    JSON Parser software application has been integrated within each module. This
    application has the task of transferring data from the module specific format
    into the NGSIV2 format and vice versa. In the case where a module sends data to
    the CB, the NGSIV2 JSON Parser application transfers the data from the module-specific
    format to the NGSIV2 format, thus making it readable to the CB. Conversely if
    it is the CB that needs to send data to a module, the NGSIV2 JSON Parser application
    transfers the data from the NGSIV2 format to the module-specific format, thus
    making it readable to the module. As an example, Fig. 3 depicts, on the left side,
    a data NGSIV2 format for a publish operation from the Web App to FIWARE (related
    to the input data to be sent to the FEA module) and, on a right side, a data NGSIV2
    format for a publish operation from the FEA module to FIWARE (related to the output
    data to be sent to the Web App). Download : Download high-res image (284KB) Download

    operations. 3.2.3. User Management Layer (UML) This layer results in the development
    of a starter kit module, whose main goal is to allow SMEs to easily interact with
    the platform. The starter kit module consists of a Web App and a set of API. The
    Web App allows the SMEs to submit and receive data, while the API set supports
    the data exchange flow with the platform. As far as the Web App development is
    concerned, the authors efforts have been similarly addressed to both Web App Back-End
    and Front-End design and implementation. The Back-End rules basically all the
    functionalities (e.g., end users’ profile creation, log-in/log-out process, etc.)
    offered by the platform and it includes as well the server on which the Web App
    runs and the database with its related tables for managing the data and which
    are uploaded to the platform. The Front-End consists of ad-hoc and easy to use
    graphic users’ interfaces (GUI), whose detailed description is reported in section
    3.2. As far as the set of API is considered, it consists of a set of methods whose
    implementation has been necessary in order to establish the connection between
    the Web App Back-End and FIWARE, thus allowing the operative transfer of data
    from SMEs to the platform modules and vice versa. Fig. 4 depicts a high-level
    architecture of the data flow between SMEs and the multipurpose platform. Download

    Data flow high-level architecture. 3.2.4. Software and hardware infrastructure
    This section aims at consolidating and briefly presenting the list of hardware
    and software components that were used for the development of the platform. While
    some of these elements are already individually introduced and discussed within
    various sections of this research work, it is definitely beneficial to offer a
    short summary here, thus providing the readers with quick and easy access to this
    information. For the hardware setup, the platform employs three distinct servers.
    One server is dedicated to hosting the Web App, while another serves as the infrastructure
    for FIWARE. The third server is tasked with supporting all three DML modules,
    which include the SDT module, FEA module, and NES module. For the development
    of the Web App, the authors have employed Laravel, a robust web application framework
    (further details about Laravel can be found at https://laravel.com). Among the
    technologies of this framework, MySQL has been used to deploy the Web App database,
    Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) as scripting language to implement the processes
    logics behind the Web App (Back-End) and HTML Visualization together with Bootstrap
    and jQuery to develop Web App graphics (Front-End). Moving forward, each DML module
    has been developed using specialized software. The SDT module leverages Plant
    Simulation from Tecnomatix, the FEA module is built upon Autodesk Inventor Nastran
    and finally the NES module utilizes Autodesk Inventor Nesting (see section 2.2.1).
    The interoperable data exchange between the DML modules and the Web App is facilitated
    by the use of FIWARE, an open-source framework tailored for IoT platforms (see
    section 2.2.2). Finally, to ensure the data flow, the platform employs specific
    communication protocols: HTTP is used for data transmission from the Web App to
    FIWARE and from the DML modules to FIWARE, while MQTT is implemented for data
    exchange from FIWARE to the Web App, as well as from FIWARE to the DML modules,
    as illustrated in Fig. 2. 4. Calculation This section presents an application
    of the multi-purpose platform conducted by a SME, located in Calabria (Italy)
    and operating in the furniture sector. The objective of this case study is to
    showcase the validity and potentiality of the developed platform, by presenting
    its application for the optimization of a new bookcase design and the optimization
    of its production line. Through this case study, the authors aim at demonstrating
    how the use of a multi-purpose platform can help SMEs to achieve their business
    objectives, by enabling them to develop and manufacture products more efficiently
    and effectively. The following sub-sections detail the use of a platform to optimize
    the design and the manufacturing process of the bookcase through the application
    of the platform modules. Section 3.1 presents the reference context, including
    a description of the bookcase, its manufacturing process as well as the objectives
    intended to be achieved by using the platform. Sections 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 describe
    respectively the application of specific modules to achieve these objectives.
    Section 3.2 outlines the use of the of the SDT module being used to define the
    manufacturing process design guidelines. In section 3.3, the FEA module is used
    to perform finite element analysis for structural design purposes. Lastly, section
    3.4 details the application of the NES module to identify the most efficient arrangement
    of the bookcase sub-components (shelves) on a raw material sheet in order to minimize
    waste and reduce costs. 4.1. Reference context This section presents the design
    and the technical features of the bookcase, the production steps to manufacture
    it and the objectives that the SME aims at achieving by using the multi-purpose
    platform. Bookcase design and technical features The product in question is a
    new bookcase that is currently being developed by the SME. The design and technical
    features of the bookcase have already been established, with the exception of
    the thickness of the shelves. The bookcase consists of five oak shelves, four
    feet, and eleven aluminum tubes. The shelves have been designed with different
    shapes and dimensions to optimize weight distribution and enhance the overall
    structural dynamics of the bookcase. Fig. 5 depicts on the right side the CAD
    model and on the left side the dimensions of each of its main components. Download

    Bookcase CAD model and sub-components main dimensions. The shelves are positioned
    at a distance of 350 mm from each other, with the central shelf measuring 700
    mm in length (L) and 400 mm in depth (D). The other two sets of shelves measure
    800 mm (L) x 400 mm (D) and 900 mm (L) x 400 mm (D), respectively. To ensure stability,
    each foot of the bookcase is secured to the structure through the use of standard
    wood screws and five brackets per foot. The bookcase''s design is not yet finalized,
    as the thickness of the shelves remains to be determined by using the FEA module.
    Bookcase production process The production steps for the manufacturing of the
    bookcase have been previously identified by the SME, and an initial configuration
    of the plant resources has been already established. However, it is still necessary
    to finalize, optimize and validate the configuration of plant resources (i.e.,
    number of workers, number of machines, etc.), which will be achieved by utilizing
    the SDT module. The following macro-operations have been identified. • Macro-operation
    1A: oak panel manufacture; • Macro-operation 2A: aluminum tubes manufacture and
    assembly; • Macro-operation 3A: components packaging before delivery to final
    customers; A brief description of each macro-operation is reported below. • Macro-operation
    1A consists of the following production steps: 1) Step 1A.1: shelves cut based
    on the designed dimensions starting from a raw material oak panel whose dimensions
    are 2 m (L) x 2 m (D). The SME currently plans to use a horizontal band saw to
    properly cut and dimension the shelves; 2) Step 1A.2: shelves planning to reach
    the shelves thickness (to be still finalized), starting from a raw material oak
    panel thickness of 25 mm. A planer machine is foreseen to perform this operation;
    3) Step 1A.3: shelves sanding to prepare them for the next drilling operation.
    The SME plans to use a double belt sander to carry out this production step; 4)
    Step 1A.4: shelves drilling in order to make the holes necessary for the future
    assembly. One drilling machine is foreseen to perform this operation; 5) Step
    1A.5: shelves painting and drying; oak aesthetical characteristics are preserved
    by using wood stain instead of varnish. In terms of plant resources, SME plans
    to use one panting and drying machine. • Macro-operation 2A consists of the following
    production steps: 1) Step 2A.1: aluminum tubes cut based on the designed dimensions
    starting from raw material tubes 6 m in length. A circular saw is planned to be
    used to perform this operation; 2) Step 2A.2: aluminum tubes bending operation
    in order to reach the X shape as shown in Fig. 5. A roller bender is currently
    planned to be used to perform this operation and a bending angle of 10° has to
    be set to avoid a possible bookcase structure future collapse; 3) Step 2A.3: aluminum
    brackets welding to the tubes. Those brackets represent the supports where the
    final customers place the shelves and fix them to the bookcase structure by using
    standard wood screws. An automated welding machine is currently planned to be
    used to perform this operation; 4) Step 2A.4: aluminum tubes painting and drying
    by using primers and paints suitable for aluminum processing. One painting and
    drying cabin is currently foreseen to perform this production step; 5) Step 2A.5:
    assembly of the welded fit in aluminum by inserting two tube tops. • Macro-operation
    3A consists of the following production steps: 1) Step 3A.1: preparation of packaging
    set 1 which includes the 5 oak shelves and the wood screws to fix them to the
    bookcase aluminum structure and decorative aluminum tubes; 2) Step 3A.2: preparation
    of packaging set 2 which includes the bookcase feet (4 pieces) and the pivot being
    used for positioning the decorative aluminum tubes between the shelves as shown
    in Fig. 5. Packaging set 1 and packaging set 2 are sent to the customers which
    have to complete by their own the final Bookcase assembly. Case study objectives
    The SME has set clear objectives that it aims to achieve by using the multi-purpose
    platform. The objectives are as follows: 1) The SME aims at using the SDT module
    to either confirm or optimize the production lines design in terms of currently
    planned resources, such as the number of operators and machines to be used. The
    objective is to ensure that the production process is optimized for maximum efficiency
    and productivity. By using the SDT module, the SME can model and simulate the
    production process, analyze the factors that impact its efficiency, and identify
    areas where improvements can be made. This will help the SME to make data-driven
    decisions about the number of operators and machines required for each stage of
    the process, and to optimize the production process for maximum efficiency and
    profitability; 2) The SME aims at using the FEA module to conduct finite element
    analysis to properly design the bookcase from a structural point of view. This
    includes defining the bookcase shelves'' thickness based on the maximum load it
    can hold and other parameters given as input by the SME. The objective is to ensure
    that the bookcase is structurally sound and can hold the intended load. By using
    the FEA module, the SME can accurately simulate and analyze the bookcase''s structural
    behavior under various loading conditions and optimize its design accordingly;
    3) The SME aims at using the NES module to define a nesting study that optimizes
    the production of a number of shelves full set from a single oak panel. The objective
    is to minimize material waste and optimize the production process to increase
    efficiency, reduce costs as well as to ensure the highest quality of the final
    product. 4.2. Web application – User interface This section goes into the details
    of the Web-App being used by the end users to access and interact with the platform.
    The Web App is composed of a Front-End and a Back-End, which work together seamlessly
    to provide end users with a user-friendly and powerful platform. The Back-End
    of the web application has been developed to manage the platform''s functionalities;
    among the others the main ones are described below: • The Back-End allows that
    different types of end users (administrators and non-administrators) can configure
    and use the platform functionalities. To this end, the authors have defined the
    permissions and roles for different type of end users (i.e., manager, operator,
    product design engineer, FEA product engineer, etc.) by implementing authentication
    and authorization processes, and enforcing security policies to protect the application
    and its data; • The Back-End ensures the management of users by administrators
    (such as creating, modifying, or deleting users). This includes implementation
    of user validation and verification processes and enforcing password policies;
    • The Back-End ensures user registration, authentication and authorization processes.
    The user registration requires mandatory field such as name, surname, role (i.e.,
    manager, operator, product design engineer, FEA product engineer, etc.) and password
    (with a minimum of 8 characters, including letters and numbers). Moreover, the
    OAuth protocol (Hardt, 2012) has been implemented to secure end users’ login and
    logout; • The Back-End provides differentiated access to the platform''s functionalities
    and modules based on the user''s role and permissions. This has been reached by
    implementing role-based access control, defining user groups and permissions,
    and enforcing restrictions on sensitive operations and data. For instance, the
    manager user group is granted to access to all platform modules, whereas the FEA
    product engineer is granted to access only the FEA module; • The Back-End ensures
    the management of the personal area where end users can modify their information.
    User interface components have been implemented for managing user profiles, enforcing
    data validation and verification, and logging all user activities related to profile
    management. As far as the Web App Front-End development is concerned, an ad-hoc
    and easy-to-use graphic user interfaces (GUI) has been developed. In Fig. 6, the
    login page is displayed. Here, the end users have the option to enter username
    and password and by clicking the “LOGIN” button, they can gain access to the platform.
    Additionally, this page offers the “Forgot your password” button, which allows
    end users to initiate a password recovery process. End users will receive an email
    containing a link to reset their password. Fig. 7 depicts a form for creating
    new user accounts by the administrator. The form contains several fields for inputting
    user information, including a dropdown menu for selecting the user''s role within
    the SME. The available roles may vary depending on the SME, but typical options
    include administrator, manager, operator, product design engineer, FEA product
    engineer, etc. Once the user''s role has been selected, the administrator can
    input the user''s personal details, such as their name, surname and email address,
    and define a unique username and password for the new account. The form also includes
    validation checks to ensure that the username and password meet the organization''s
    security requirements. Upon submission of the form, the web application creates
    a new user account and adds it to the SME''s user database. The administrator
    can then view and manage the user accounts, including editing or deleting them
    as needed. Basically, the web application provides a convenient and efficient
    way for administrators to create and manage user accounts within the SME, helping
    to ensure that the right people have the right level of access to the platform
    modules and therefore to the SME''s resources and information. Download : Download

    3 calculates the maximum number of clicks needed to perform a what-if analysis
    related to the optimizations of either the production process (SDT module) or
    the product (FEA and NES modules). For each module, the following considerations
    are made regarding the number of clicks: 1) # Clicks required to select the module
    main page 2) # Clicks to access the module input section 3) # Clicks needed to
    select the design parameters 4) # Clicks for selecting the desired KPIs for analysis
    5) # Clicks to send the data to the platform 6) # Clicks to access the module

    important to note that these calculations represent the maximum number of clicks
    required, assuming the end user wishes to input all design parameters and analyze
    all available KPIs. For the NES module, no clicks are considered for KPI selection,
    as a nesting study requires evaluation of all KPIs, implemented within the platform,
    to be effective. Please be aware that these calculations do not include clicks
    for registering and logging into the platform or for entering values for the design
    parameters (essentially, the process of digitizing values). 5. Results This section
    summarizes the most noteworthy results as outcome of the use of the multi-purpose
    platform. In particular, section 4.1 presents the main results achieved by using
    the SDT module, while section 4.2 and section 4.3 report respectively the outcomes
    of the FEA and NES modules. 5.1. SDT Module: Production process design The SDT
    module deals with recreating the real production processes of the SME, through
    appropriate simulation models, with the aim of providing quantitative evaluations
    about the effects that different input parameters have on well-defined KPIs. In
    this context, Plant Simulation, a TECNOMATIX solution, has been integrated within
    the platform. As highlighted in the previous sections of the paper, the SME of
    the case study has already identified the production phases for the realization
    of the new product, however it is crucial to find the most suitable configuration.
    In this context, simulation represents a very powerful tool because it enables
    the execution of “offline” tests, where it is possible to eventually make errors
    without impacting the real system. Only after having verified, through appropriate
    what-if analyses, the goodness of each solution, it is possible to proceed with
    the actual implementation on the real system. The construction of the simulation
    model, which represents the real production system, is out of the scope of this
    paper. In fact, the SDT Module has the only purpose of guiding a user, even one
    who is inexperienced from the point of view of digital technologies, in choosing
    the most suitable input parameters to achieve specific KPIs. However, to improve
    the reader''s understanding, it is relevant to say that the entire production
    process has been divided into 3 simulation frames: manufacturing, assembly, packaging.
    As it is possible to see in the next figures, the Web App provides a very simple
    and intuitive interface. Fig. 8 illustrates the end user''s selection of inputs
    necessary to conduct a what-if analysis. The page presents a list of all available
    design parameters on the left side, and on the right side, it lists the desired
    output criteria for the analysis. Regarding input parameters, end users can select
    each one by simply checking the box next to the design parameter and subsequently
    assigning the desired values. As for output selection, end users on this page
    can choose only the specific outputs for which they want to run the analysis.
    Once the input information has been provided, end users can initiate the analysis
    by clicking the “SEND” button. Plant Simulation begins processing, and within
    few seconds, the results are returned to the end user in an intuitive and usable
    way, as shown in Fig. 9. In the Web App''s SDT module outputs page, the list of
    outputs is presented. This page specifically showcases the values of all the outputs
    that were previously selected on the input page. However, for outputs that were
    not selected, no values are displayed, and they appear in a light grey color to
    make them less prominent and easily distinguishable. Download : Download high-res

    simulation scenarios, the SME was able to identify the best configuration of input
    parameters, aimed at maximizing productivity and profitability. It is out of the
    scope of the paper to list the results of all simulation scenarios, which supported
    the SME in this decision-making. However, for the convenience of the reader some
    insights are listed below. Through the SDT Module, the SME discovered that the
    number of machines is the input factor with the most significant impact on flow
    time, especially in the manufacturing workplace which is less manual than assembly
    and packaging ones. This analysis was important in determining the number of duplicate
    machines to be placed in parallel. The number of workers to be employed for the
    manufacturing of the new product and their level of specialization (i.e., worker''s
    efficiency) were identified through a cost-benefit analysis: costs, i.e., salary
    to be paid to each of them; benefits, i.e., reduction of the flow time and increase
    in the production capacity of the plant due to the use of each additional human
    resource. Many other input parameters were determined through a careful analysis
    of the above-mentioned simulation scenarios. 5.2. FEA Module: Structural design
    optimization of the bookcase shelves This section provides a detailed description
    of the FEA Module application in order to determine the optimized thickness of
    bookcase shelves. The SME has set two key requirements for the bookcase shelves:
    uniform thickness across all shelves and a maximum deformation of 0.5 mm for each
    shelf when loaded. Uniform thickness across all shelves ensures aesthetically
    consistent among the shelves. The maximum deformation of 0.5 mm when loaded is
    a critical factor in ensuring that the shelves do not sag or bend beyond an acceptable
    limit, which could result in damage to the books or the overall structure of the
    bookcase. In order to ensure structural integrity, the SME decided to determine
    the thickness of the shelves on the worst-case scenario, defined the longest shelf,
    which is expected to experience the greatest stress and deformation under load.
    To use this module, the SME has entered relevant data through the web application,
    which has been then used as input from the FEA module. Once the analysis has been
    completed, the FEA module provided back the SME with specific KPIs such as maximum
    deformation and contour displacement, whose values determined whether further
    evaluation was required. The SME inputted data on the longest shelf (900 mm) cad
    model, max load (270 N), analysis type (linear static), material (oak), load type
    (distributed), load direction (normal to surface), and shelf degrees of freedom
    (none). The KPIs selected for calculation were the max deformation value and contour
    displacement. Upon running the analysis with a shelf thickness of 10 mm (value
    as per CAD model dimensions), the FEA module displayed a deformation level higher
    than the 0.5 mm requirement. Therefore, the analysis was repeated with a shelf
    thickness of 20 mm (through an updated of the Cad model), while all other parameters
    remained unchanged. The analysis resulted in a maximum deformation of 0.415 mm,
    which is below the specified deformation limit. In conclusion, the first run of
    the analysis did not meet the SME''s requirements, however, the second run with
    a shelf thickness of 20 mm resulted in a deformation value which satisfied the
    requirements. Based on these results, the SME could make an informed decision
    on the appropriate thickness of the bookcase shelves. Fig. 10, Fig. 11 display
    the Web App pages containing the input data and output results, respectively,
    for the final configuration of the shelf with a thickness of 20 mm, which was
    the result of the second attempt carried out by the SME. From the FEA module inputs
    page, end users have the capability to enter values for all design parameters,
    along with the option to upload the CAD model of the product to be analyzed. This
    page provides a “BROWSER” button that allows end users to select the CAD file
    from their saved location. After selecting the file, end users can initiate the
    upload process by clicking the “UPLOAD” button. Additionally, end users can choose
    the desired outputs (KPIs) for the analysis from the list of the ones implemented
    within the module. When it comes to the FEA module outputs page, the end users
    can view the list of KPIs implemented within the module. However, it''s important
    to note that results from the analysis are available for visualization only for
    those KPIs that were selected during the input process. Download : Download high-res

    nesting study This section provides a detailed description of the NES Module application,
    which is used by the SME to optimize the cut of a number of shelves from a single
    oak panel. The SME has set two key requirements: maximizing the number of full
    set of shelves that can be cut from a single oak panel and minimizing waste. The
    NES module has been designed to meet these requirements by providing a nesting
    study that determines the most efficient way to cut the shelves from the oak panel,
    minimizing the amount of waste generated. As done for the FEA module application,
    the SME has entered the relevant data through the web application. The input data
    includes the dimensions of the oak panel raw material, which is 2 m in length
    and 2 m in depth and the type of material, which is oak. Moreover, the SME has
    also provided the CAD model of each shelf type to be cut, which in this case consists
    of 2 sub-components of dimensions 900 mm x 400 mm, 1 sub-component of dimensions
    700 mm x 400 mm, and 2 sub-components of dimensions 800 mm x 400 mm. The minimum
    number for each sub-component to be cut is also specified (two pieces each for
    shelves 900 mm and 800 mm in length and one pieces for the shelf 700 mm in length)
    as well as the minimum distance between subcomponents (0 mm in X and Y directions)
    and the cutting methodology (band sawing). The left, right, bottom and upper trim
    lines, which define the area to be trimmed, are set to zero in order to use the
    full surface of the raw material panel. Once the input data is entered through
    the web application, the NES module analyses the data and provides a 2D visualization
    of the nesting study as output. The output shows the optimized placement of the
    sub-components on the oak panel, with each sub-component represented by a rectangular
    shape. In addition, the NES module has also provided the SME with specific KPIs,
    such as the total number of sub-components that can be cut and the raw material
    panel utilization rate (in %). Fig. 12 and Fig. 13 display the web application
    page containing the input data for the NES module, while Fig. 14 and Fig. 15 show
    the output of the NES module, which is the number pieces to be cut for each component,
    the raw material utilization rate and the 2D visualization of the nesting study.
    During the input process, end users can provide input data, including CAD files
    related to the components for which nesting analysis needs to be performed. End
    users have the option to upload CAD files using the “BROWSER” and “UPLOAD” buttons.
    Additionally, they can choose to add more components by clicking the “ADD COMPONENT
    +” button, which creates a new input section for uploading another CAD file. Download

    as components quantity, raw material utilization rate, and visualization of the
    nesting study. Display buttons within the page enable end users to visualize the
    analysis results. 6. Conclusions Based on the research activities carried out,
    this study has developed a multi-purpose platform that can be used by SMEs as
    an easy-to-use support tool to run what-if analysis in order to optimize the design
    of production processes and products. The proposed platform, based on a layered
    infrastructure, combines different modules and fulfils the requirements of interoperability,
    accessibility, and usability. The platform''s layered structure was described,
    along with its Decision-Making Layer, Data Exchange Layer, and User Management
    Layer, each consisting of specific modules. The authors successfully integrated
    Plant Simulation, Autodesk Inventor Nastran, and Autodesk Inventor Nesting software
    into the platform, allowing SMEs to simulate production processes, to run finite
    element analysis, and to optimize raw material utilization. The interoperability
    and data exchange were ensured through the adoption of FIWARE, an open-source
    framework for IoT platforms, which enabled the harmonized representation of data
    formats and semantics among different applications and software within the platform.
    The research work concludes also with an application of the multi-purpose platform
    conducted by a SME, located in Calabria (Italy) and operating in the furniture
    sector. The SME in question set clear objectives to achieve optimal design and
    production of a new bookcase, with the aim of minimizing material waste, increasing
    efficiency, and maximizing profitability. The SDT module was used to model and
    simulate the production process, identifying areas where improvements could be
    made and optimizing the process for maximum efficiency and productivity. Additionally,
    the SME utilized the platform''s FEA module to conduct structural analysis of
    the bookcase design, ensuring that the bookcase shelves'' thickness was optimized
    to withstand the intended load. Finally, the NES module was utilized to optimize
    the production of shelves from a single oak panel, resulting in reduced material
    waste and increased efficiency. This case study highlights the value of utilizing
    a multi-purpose platform as an accessible and user-friendly tool to support SMEs
    in taking data-driven decisions that improve their products and production processes
    design, resulting in increased efficiency, reduced costs, and improved profitability.
    In addition to the platform''s current capabilities, the modular structure of
    the platform enables the easy integration of new modules, providing further potential
    benefits for SMEs. For example, the platform could be expanded to include quality
    control and supply chain management modules, allowing SMEs to streamline their
    production processes even further and increase their competitiveness in the market.
    It''s important to note that these activities will require further research efforts;
    specifically, the selection of the software for integration within the platform
    along with the identification of the modules design parameters and KPIs needs
    to be further investigated. Another possible future development concerns the integration
    of mathematical and statistical tools (e.g., Minitab (Alin, 2010)) within the
    SDT module, with the aim of directly providing the user with easily interpretable
    graphs and improving decision-making. Furthermore, as additional potential area
    of improvement, it''s worth noting that although, theoretically, the direct and
    automatic DML inter-module (SDT/FEA/NES) data exchange is feasible, thanks to
    the integration of FIWARE, this feature has not yet been implemented. Therefore,
    to further enhance the platform capabilities, additional research efforts are
    definitely needed towards enabling direct and automatic data exchange among the
    modules. CRediT authorship contribution statement Antonio Cimino: Conceptualization,

  description: Creating and managing riparian buffer zones (RBZs) is regarded as a
    global best-practice management strategy for maintaining and improving waterway
    health. Agricultural land often utilises RBZs as highly productive pasture, exposing
    waterways to increased inputs of nutrients, pollutants, and sediment, in addition
    to reducing carbon sequestration and habitat for native flora and fauna. This
    project developed a novel approach to the application of multisystem ecological
    and economic quantification models to the property-scale, at low cost and high
    speed. We developed a state-of-the-art dynamic geospatial interface to communicate
    these outputs when switching from pasture to revegetated riparian zone via planned
    restoration efforts. The tool was developed using the regional conditions of a
    south-east Australian catchment as a case study but is designed to be adaptable
    around globally using equivalent model inputs. Ecological and economic outcomes
    were determined using existing methods, including an agricultural land suitability
    analysis to quantify primary production, an estimation of carbon sequestration
    using historic vegetation datasets and GIS software analysis to determine spatial
    costings of revegetation and fencing. Economic outcomes are presented in raw values
    of pasture produced and carbon sequestered, and fencing and revegetation costs
    can be easily altered for enhanced usability and interoperability. This tool can
    provide property-specific data for almost 16,000 properties in a catchment area
    of over 130,000 km2 and 19,600 km of river length. Our results indicated that
    current financial incentives for revegetation rarely cover the cost of giving
    up pasture, but these costs may be compensated by social and ecological outcomes
    achieved over time. This method provides a novel way of informing alternative
    management approaches, such as incremental revegetation plans and the selective
    harvesting of timber from RBZ. The model provides an innovative framework for
    improved RBZ management and can be used to inform property-specific responses
    and guide discussion among stakeholders.

    • A shiny application was built to quantify ecological & economic outputs for
    riparian rehabilitation works. • Property-specific economic and ecological analyses
    were conducted for ∼16,000 properties at low financial and labour cost. • Providing
    analyses at the property-scale helps to inform emergent riparian management strategies.
    • Methods for quantifying the potential biodiversity gains from increasing riparian
    buffer width are still in their infancy. Abstract Creating and managing riparian

    modellingDecision-making tool 1. Introduction The impacts of climate change, human
    population and economic growth apply increasing pressure on scarce freshwater
    resources (Heinke et al., 2019), affecting global efforts to meet sustainable
    development goals (UN., 2016). In particular, the sustainable development goal
    “to ensure availability and sustainable management of water”, is becoming increasingly
    difficult to meet due to the altered ecological functioning of waterways across
    the globe (Thompson et al., 2021). Key to the long-term sustainability of freshwater
    resources is the protection, restoration and expansion of riparian buffer zones
    (RBZs) which are viewed as a global, best-practice management strategy given the
    variety of services that they provide (Singh et al., 2021). RBZs are integral
    parts of existing ecological and anthropocentric systems that provide many ecosystem
    services and influence nutrient pathways (Gene et al., 2019; Hansen et al., 2015;
    Phogat et al., 2019). RBZs facilitate and regulate the provision of energy across
    a catchment (Singh et al., 2021) and create a buffer that can prevent the runoff
    of excess sedimentation, pollutants and nutrients into a waterway (Cordeiro et
    al., 2020; Li et al., 2018; Phogat et al., 2019). This buffering capacity of RBZs
    can reduce the impact of anthropogenic land uses, such as intensive agriculture
    (Booth et al., 2021; Grudzinski et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2013) and urbanisation
    (Sarker et al., 2008) on water quality. The shade created by riparian canopy also
    serves to regulate in-stream temperatures (Albertson et al., 2018) and has significant
    influence over in-stream plant and algal growth (Alberts et al., 2018). RBZs can
    mitigate the impact of localised and downstream flooding by reducing surface runoff
    and providing space for water retention (Kurki-Fox et al., 2022). A recent review
    of erosion studies found that forested RBZ were able to significantly reduce stream
    bank erosion and soil loss (George et al., 2019). The variability of river morphology
    and hydrological regimes, in addition to the provision of woody debris in-stream
    and standing deadwood from within the riparian zone itself, leads to the provision
    of many in-stream habitat niches for aquatic biota (Rideout et al., 2021), with
    freshwater ecoregions accounting for over 30 % of vertebrate species despite their
    limited spatial extent (Tickner et al., 2020). Proximity to fluvial and groundwater
    systems typically results in elevated moisture levels within RBZs and excellent
    growing conditions for a variety of vegetation types. The resultant increased
    growth of woody biomass (Pérez-Corona et al., 2021) equates to elevated levels
    of sequestered carbon (Maraseni and Mitchell, 2016; Matzek et al., 2018; Pérez-Corona
    et al., 2021). These growing conditions also make riparian zones highly valuable
    from an economic perspective, where they produce significantly more dry pasture
    matter than surrounding pastureland (Aarons et al., 2013). Convincing landowners
    to ‘fence off’ and relinquish the highly productive riparian zone for ecological
    restoration can be a significant challenge for natural resource management (NRM)
    practitioners as the removal of existing pasture may impact the financial viability
    of the farming business (Fielding et al., 2005). Typically, governing bodies that
    provide funding for RBZ restoration mandate or recommend a fixed width of RBZ
    that applies to large administrative areas (e.g., catchments or states). These
    standardised recommendations may not adequately account for local landscape conditions,
    river sinuosity, topography, land use and existing management practices (Hansen
    et al., 2015). Additionally, actions to improve the long-term sustainability of
    local waterways should be based on an understanding of catchment-scale drivers
    that can lead to negative impact on those catchments (Zaimes, 2020). Whilst a
    fixed-width strategy is relatively simple, it is often argued that it imposes
    excessive cost on landowners and businesses without achieving the desired environmental
    effect (Tiwari et al., 2016). Technologies for quantifying the environmental impact
    of RBZs have been developed that typically utilise complex and data-intensive
    tools, such as LIDAR (Johansen et al., 2010; Tiwari et al., 2016). However these
    tools may not always be appropriate within limited-resource contexts, where individual,
    organisational and institutional stakeholders are constrained by practical limitations
    of time, finance and availability of labour (Hajkowicz, 2007). Also, many of these
    tools are limited to single-functions, for example LOOC-C, which focuses on carbon
    sequestration of revegetation projects (CSIRO, 2020) and BirdCast, which models
    bird occupancy in revegetated woodlands (Hingee et al., 2022), or alternatively
    are limited to region-scale analysis, such as InVEST, which is multifunctional,
    but is not designed for use with individual landowners (Sharp et al., 2014). These
    limitations in currently available models can delay or reduce uptake of riparian
    revegetation at the property-scale. We aim to fill this gap in knowledge and to
    provide a low-cost, rapid analysis of potential ecological and economic outcomes
    that may arise from implementing or adjusting fixed-width RBZs. We were able to
    provide this property-specific analysis by tailoring region-scale datasets to
    localised spatial extents as determined by RBZ width, our key variable. This enables
    us to provide specific information on economic and ecological outputs at the property
    scale. By working at this scale, the tool is able to be more specific to local
    contexts and therefore better facilitate discussion between NRM practitioners
    and landowners, as well as encourage independent revegetation projects. A dynamic
    geospatial tool, referred to hereafter as the Riparian Buffer Zone Quantification
    Model (RQM), has been developed using recent innovations in open-source spatial
    technology to model the change in ecological and economic outputs that occur with
    incremental changes in riparian buffer widths. This tool provides both visual
    and aggregated statistical data, which has been shown to improve decision-making
    in previous water and land management fields (Kourgialas et al., 2022; Nguyen
    et al., 2020). We provide economic outcomes as both raw production values (pasture
    produced and carbon sequestered) and as financial costs (fencing and revegetation)
    in order to cover a broad range of financial and non-financial economic outcomes,
    though the raw production values are able to be easily converted into dollar values
    using current valuations. Significant effort has been made to include as many
    relevant outcomes as possible, but some outcomes, such as the long-term effects
    of grazing on bank erosion, the value of shade for livestock survival and the
    cooling effect of shade on streams, were outside of the scope of this project.
    The implementation of these outcomes could add significant value to future iterations
    of the RQM. 2. Methods The RQM is a tool that can be used by property owners,
    NRM agencies, and the general public to illustrate the changes to economic and
    environmental outcomes as a result of varying the width of RBZs. The framework
    for this tool provides property-specific analysis at the catchment scale and should
    serve as a valuable decision facilitation tool to guide future discussions among
    various stakeholders that are planning riparian revegetation works. It should
    be noted that the selected indices serve as a preliminary set that were chosen
    on the basis of available literature and data, the feasibility of quantifying
    those impacts remotely and at scale, and the desirability of those impacts being
    quantified as identified through discussion with key stakeholders. Additional
    refinements, indices and measures can be readily incorporated into the RQM as
    new knowledge is acquired and following feedback from users. We prioritised the
    use of existing quantification methods and publicly available data that are already
    understood by management stakeholders as our key aim was to enable greater cooperation
    across government environmental departments, NRM managers and landowners, improve
    synergies, and build on existing knowledge and methods. The estimated economic
    outputs include dry pasture matter production under historic and future climate
    scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), and both fencing and revegetation costs. By modelling
    two future climate scenarios, we attempted to ensure that the model outputs are
    robust as growing conditions alter over the coming few decades. The estimated
    ecological outputs include carbon sequestration potential and likely improvements
    to a subset of water quality variables (sediment, bacterial loads [E. coli], total
    phosphate and total nitrate). The RQM also includes other useful outputs requested
    by stakeholders, including habitat distribution models (HDM) for 17 rare or threatened
    animal species, and links to revegetation species lists, based on the local Ecological
    Vegetation Classes (EVC1750) which can help to guide decisions regarding the plant
    species that should be planted in an area of planned riparian revegetation. We
    anticipate that the tool will also be widely applicable for use outside of the
    case study in south-east Australia. The parameters are easily interchangeable
    with others that may have more relevance in other catchments in Australia or overseas.
    In this Methods section, we first introduce the study area used for this iteration
    of the RQM. Next, we detail the methods that form the basis of the RQM framework,
    including how data were collected and processed, and then how outputs are communicated
    via a web-based application. We then explain the methods for calculating each
    output starting with economic outputs, then ecological outputs and additional
    functionality. Finally, we detail the method of testing the model via a case-study
    analysis of 100 randomly selected properties. A visual summary of the RQM can
    be seen in Fig. 1. All data collected were clipped to the Corangamite catchment
    boundary, were projected at EPSG:7899 and raster data were resampled to the coarsest
    resolution among the datasets of 20 m2. By working at this resolution, we were
    able to provide an adequate degree of detail for property-scale analyses at higher
    upfront computational cost. Download : Download high-res image (606KB) Download

    outputs are quantified using the input methods (see 2.5 Economic outcome methods,
    2.6 Environmental outcome methods, 2.7 Additional application functionality) used
    through the study area (see insert map and methods section 2.2) which then produces
    a site map of the selected property with visual indicators for the watercourse
    and proposed buffer zone. Property-specific outputs are then displayed below the
    site map (see Fig. 3). 2.1. Study area As a test case, this model was calibrated
    to the conditions of the Corangamite region in Victoria, Australia. The region
    is in south-east Australia and contains four river basins, the Moorabool, Barwon,
    Lake Corangamite and the Otway Coast, and is home to over 400,000 people. It covers
    roughly 1.3 million ha of land, including 175 km of coastline (CCMA, 2020). The
    landscape is diverse, including the Otway ranges and coast in the south, the volcanic
    grassy plains in the centre and the uplands in the north. Lake Corangamite and
    the Western District Lakes are both Ramsar-listed wetlands, and Lake Corangamite
    is the largest natural lake in Victoria. The region is expected to be moderately
    affected by climate change, with long-term projections indicating a reduction
    in rainfall and an increase in temperature (DELWP, 2019). Mixed farming and grazing
    are the dominant land uses in the catchment, including 21 % for beef and dairy
    production. The region is home to the Wadawurrung and Eastern Maar Traditional
    Owners (CCMA, 2021). 2.2. Riparian quantification model framework The RQM operates
    via a dynamic geospatial user interface. This was purpose-built in the R programming
    language (R Core Team, 2021) with the shiny package (Chang et al., 2021) in order
    to enable rapid use by the various stakeholders involved in river management.
    By engaging with stakeholders and responding to their needs as end-users of the
    RQM, outputs were able to align closely with their priorities so as to assist
    to improve decision outcomes and prevent maladaptation (Ara et al., 2021). For
    example, correspondence with landowners revealed that changes in pasture quantity
    in terms of tonnes of dry matter per hectare may provide useful information at
    the regional scale but, for primary producers, the conversion to dry sheep equivalent
    was a more effective way of communicating costs. In speaking with catchment management
    representatives, they described the provision of informed vegetation lists would
    be likely to increase effective riparian revegetation. The model displays a visual
    representation of the site alongside the statistical outputs, for managers to
    be better able to visualise what various RBZ widths may look like in the context
    of the area of interest and identify any site-specific problems. In order to encourage
    holistic and emergent decision-making, both economic and ecological outputs are
    displayed simultaneously, enabling more even consideration of both factors. 2.3.
    RQM data processing methods We acquired the watercourse, property spatial data
    and address aspatial information from the Department of Environment, Land, Water
    and Planning (DELWP) via the Victorian open data catalogue (Data Vic, 2022). These
    data were joined using the unique feature identifier numbers. We then intersected
    the joined property with the watercourse file, plus a 50-m buffer zone, in order
    to identify all relevant properties. This became a searchable database within
    the RQM in the form of an address search bar. Buffer zone vectors were created
    for each possible combination of potential buffer zone and river widths (Appendix
    I) and were intersected with the property database. For each buffer vector, we
    calculated the length of the outline to enable us to calculate the cost of fencing
    the proposed RBZ, the area of the proposed RBZ, and attached the pre-processed
    outputs calculated via the methods outlined below. For the purpose of the analyses,
    buffer zones are assumed to be either 100 % established revegetation or 100 %
    productive pasture. In reality, not all of the land may be 100 % viable for either
    pasture or vegetation depending on local conditions (for example rocky outcrops).
    2.4. RQM functionality The RQM (Fig. 2) can provide location-specific data for
    15,906 listed properties within the case-study catchment. The search box function
    enables users to quickly find relevant properties and slider bar indicators allow
    for alternative revegetation scenarios to be run sequentially (see label ‘a’ Fig.
    2) to indicate the locations of the river and proposed RBZ. A large visual display
    of the selected property (see label ‘b’ Fig. 2) displays the relevant boundaries
    and superimposes a green buffer representing the RBZ and blue river shape of the
    user-selected widths. Users are able to select between three climate scenarios
    and 17 endangered species HDMs via dropdown selection boxes (see label ‘c’ Fig.
    2). Estimated fencing and revegetation costs (see label ‘d’ Fig. 2) are calculated
    using either default or user-input cost of fencing/m and revegetation/ha if preferred
    (see label ‘e’ Fig. 2) and local vegetation lists are able to be accessed from
    the provided links (see label ‘f’ Fig. 2). Indications of potential water quality
    benefits are determined by the selected width of the RBZ (see label ‘g’ Fig. 2).
    Core property outputs are provided as the total area of the property and the area
    of the proposed buffer zone, both in hectares (see label ‘h’ Fig. 2), as are the
    HDM value for the selected species and potential carbon sequestered value (see
    label ‘i’ Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (826KB) Download : Download

    and the proposed buffer based on the user-inputs in ‘a’ ‘i’ are the outputs from
    the HDM and carbon sequestration analysis Note: The property address and local
    identifiers have been redacted. 2.5. Economic outcome methods 2.5.1. Dry pasture
    matter We modelled the socioeconomic impact of altering RBZ width by estimating
    DM production via an Agricultural Land Suitability Analysis (ALSA) of the most
    commonly sown pasture species in the region, perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne)
    (CCMA, 2013). ALSAs are an assessment tool to estimate suitability based on crop
    growth factors such as temperature, rainfall, soil properties, slope, altitude
    and aspect (Akpoti et al., 2019). Temperature and rainfall data were acquired
    from DELWP using the Victoria''s Future Climate Tool (DELWP, 2019). Three sets
    of climate data were required for the analysis, a historical dataset, collected
    from the past climate baseline (1986–2005), and two future projections being used
    via the Projected Climate: Values layer. The two future projections were based
    on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5, where annual greenhouse gas
    emissions peak and then start to decline in 2040, and RCP8.5, where annual greenhouse
    gas emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st Century (Vuuren et al., 2011).
    These models are often referred to as the adaptation pathway and the business-as-usual
    pathway, respectively (Vuuren et al., 2011). We collected maximum, minimum, and
    average temperatures and precipitation data. Soil data were acquired from the
    Geoscience Australia open catalogue (Geoscience Australia, 2022). A 10-m resolution
    digital elevation model was acquired from the Victorian open data catalogue (Data
    Vic, 2022). From this dataset, we were able to build aspect and slope rasters
    using the raster package in R programming language (Hijmans, 2022). The ALSA was
    constructed in the R programming language using the raster, rgdal, sp., sf and
    tidyverse packages. We used a published ALSA (Mrazova et al., 2017), weighing
    each element in accordance with a species-specific hierarchy tree (see Appendix
    II). After discussion with the authors of Mrazova et al. (2017), two alterations
    were made to the hierarchy tree. First, data regarding the coarse fragments in
    the soil were unable to be obtained and were therefore excluded. This was deemed
    to be appropriate as that fraction only accounted for 5 % of the water-holding
    capacity of the soil analysis. Second, the relative value of <500 mm of annual
    rainfall was changed from ‘not suitable’ to ‘lowest suitability’ to reflect the
    reality in the region more closely. Using this method, three catchment-wide raster
    datasets were created that demonstrate the viability of perennial ryegrass growth
    based on the regional growing conditions, and how these vary across climate scenarios
    at the regional scale. The resultant data were then used to calculate site-specific
    pasture yield estimates by multiplying the mean pasture growth rate from within
    each buffer vector by the area of the proposed RBZ. This value is provided as
    a tonne of dry matter per hectare per year (tDM/ha) quantity. A dry sheep equivalent
    (DSE) is also calculated, which is a standardised measure used by livestock managers
    to convert between livestock types. One DSE is equal to the feed required to sustain
    one dry 50-kg merino sheep and eight DSE is equal to one dry 500-kg cow (McLaren,
    1997). 2.5.2. Estimated cost of fencing and revegetation The cost of fencing is
    calculated within the model by multiplying the edge length of the proposed RBZ
    by the cost per meter of fencing. The cost per meter of fencing can be altered
    by the user but has a default value of $19/m. This default was informed by recent
    contracted fencing work in the Corangamite region by Barwon Water (as of 28/08/2022).
    The cost of revegetation is calculated by multiplying the area of the proposed
    RBZ by the revegetation cost value, which is also able to be altered by the user.
    The revegetation cost default has been informed by correspondence with both the
    Corangamite Catchment Management Authority and Barwon Water who advised the revegetation
    cost (including propagation, spot spray, guards and planting) of $4.50 per plant,
    and a planting density of 2000/ha. This resulted in a default revegetation cost
    of $9000/ha. Both values can be altered by users as costs can vary greatly depending
    on a variety of factors, including location accessibility, type of fencing or
    access to materials. 2.6. Environmental outcome methods 2.6.1. Carbon sequestration
    In order to calculate spatially explicit carbon sequestration rates, we assigned
    carbon sequestration rates to vegetation classes in the EVC1750 vector dataset
    (Data Vic, 2022; DSE, 2007), which was then rasterised by the sequestration rate
    at a resolution of 20 m2. This enabled the mean value to be extracted from the
    cells within each buffer zone which was then multiplied by the area of each buffer
    resulting in an estimated total carbon sequestration value. In this way, we were
    better able to account for spatial variation of sequestration rates as buffer
    widths change. The sequestration rates were informed by the DELWP Bushbank program
    ranking (DELWP, 2022b) which was initially provided a ranking of 1 to 5, where
    1 indicated low potential and 5 indicated high potential for carbon sequestration.
    Through correspondence with DELWP representatives (06/16/2022), we acquired estimated
    carbon sequestration rates in tonnes of carbon per hectare stored in above-ground
    biomass and over a period of 100 years (Appendix III). In order to enhance stakeholder
    communication, the resultant carbon sequestration value is converted into the
    distance in kilometres that a medium sized, petrol-fuelled car would have to travel
    to emit that amount of carbon (Hill et al., 2021). This method is somewhat limited
    in that it measures sequestration statically through time, whereas true growth
    dynamics indicate that earlier stages of growth typically involve higher rates
    of biomass growth, and therefore more carbon sequestration (Paul and Roxburgh,
    2020). 2.6.2. Water health We identified generic RBZ width benchmarks derived
    from the available literature in order to provide an estimate of changing impacts
    on water quality. This was achieved by adapting a simple stepwise framework (Lind
    et al., 2019), in conjunction with the RQM, whereby a text output advises which
    water health benchmarks are met with either a ‘good’ or a ‘poor’ response, depending
    on the buffer width selected. The selected water health variables are sediment
    filtration (3 m minimum; Lind et al., 2019), E. coli management (10 m minimum;
    Grudzinski et al., 2020), total nitrogen and phosphorous management (29 m minimum;
    Hansen et al., 2015) and stream temperature regulation (46 m minimum; Hansen et
    al., 2015). The values for the management of nitrogen and phosphorous provided
    by Hansen et al. (2015) were favored over alternatives such as recommended by
    Lind et al. (2019) as the former is specific to south-east Australian conditions
    and accounts for a medium land-use intensity. In addition, the estimates are more
    conservative, which better accounts for the degree of uncertainty around riparian
    width under the precautionary principle (Dovers and Hussey, 2013). 2.7. Additional
    application functionality 2.7.1. Endangered species habitat distribution We initially
    aimed to quantify the potential changes in RBZ width to induce local increases
    to biodiversity, however the current understanding of how ecological values change
    with increased riparian vegetation is severely limited. The likelihood of biodiversity
    loss is high with the destruction of riparian vegetation (Petsch et al., 2021),
    but the ability to predict how long it will take for biodiversity to recover following
    revegetation is far less certain, as is how that recovery will be affected by
    riparian planting widths. We therefore provided spatially informed HDM, provided
    by the Arthur Rylah Institute and acquired from NatureKit 2.0 (DELWP, 2021), in
    order to give an indication of whether a particular species range might be able
    to expand its range into one area relative to another (Sinclair et al., 2010).
    Seventeen vulnerable and endangered species were selected based on their occurrence
    within the Corangamite catchment and the social value of these species to stakeholders.
    These included mammal, reptile, amphibian, and avian species and included a broad
    variety of the region''s taxa (Appendix IV). A property-specific species HDM value
    was identified by intersecting a 5-m buffer of the watercourse with the property
    boundary database and then calculating the mean HDM value from within that buffer.
    This returns a value ranging from 1 to 100, where a value of 100 indicates a high
    likelihood that a particular species currently inhabits or is likely to expand
    their range into a region and a value of 1 indicates a low likelihood that colonisation
    or expansion may occur. The 5-m buffer was selected to ensure that the habitat
    value was specific to riparian conditions. When run through the RQM, if multiple
    values are returned (for example, in the cases of multiple watercourses on the
    same property), the highest value is returned. This method is limited to providing
    analysis on the selected endangered species because of the HDMs available and
    should not be interpreted as the value of localised biodiversity. 2.7.2. Revegetation
    lists Lists of species targeted for revegetation, depending on location, were
    requested by local NRM representatives in order to encourage and inform independent
    revegetation projects within the catchment. Users are directed to NatureKit 2.0
    (DELWP, 2021) in order to determine local EVC1750 class, and a DELWP website (DELWP,
    2022a) that recommends specific planting lists for each vegetation class. The
    implementation of this feature guides future revegetation efforts and is important
    for successful biodiversity improvements by helping to avoid maladaptation and
    providing better biodiversity results more generally. 2.8. Case study analysis
    method To ensure that our model was correctly calculating basic spatial measures
    such as area and fencing length, we tested the model using 100 randomly sampled
    properties within the region with a set standard river width of 6 m and buffer
    width increment from 1 to 50 m. This sample was checked for accuracy and was used
    to generate a snapshot of how the region''s properties responded to changes to
    the key variable (buffer width) in terms of total buffer area (and therefore revegetation
    costs, carbon sequestration and pasture yields) and fencing length (and therefore
    estimated fencing costs). We also tested our hypotheses that both buffer width
    and watercourse complexity, specifically sinuous watercourses and the presence
    of branching drainage and seasonal streams, would have a large effect on the total
    area of a buffer zone. We expected areal rate of change to decay exponentially
    as width increased. To test our hypothesis regarding watercourse sinuosity, we
    created an index to quantify relative watercourse complexity at the individual
    property scale with consideration to the presence of branched or drainage channels
    and multiple watercourses. We modified the classic sinuosity index, where total
    length of watercourse is divided by straight line distance from upstream to downstream
    (Boulton et al., 2014) using the following equation to give an indication of how
    complex a watercourse on a particular property was in relation to watercourses
    on other properties: (1) An equation to describe the relative ‘complexity’ of
    a multi-branch watercourse, as determined by the total length of the watercourse
    and the longest distance between points. Here, the modified sinuosity index (k)
    is equal to l, which indicates the total length of the watercourse on a particular
    property (calculated from the watercourse dataset, data.vic), divided by d, which
    is the longest distance between any two points where the watercourse intersects
    with that property boundary. For example, a k score of 2 would indicate that the
    total length of all the watercourse(s) is double the length of the longest distance
    between any two points where the watercourse crosses the property boundary. Thus,
    a low score identifies a ‘simple’ watercourse, typically indicating little branching,
    a single watercourse line and high levels of channelisation, whereas a high score
    identifies a more ‘complex’ watercourse, typified by high levels of branching,
    potentially multiple watercourses and/or a highly sinuous channel. To test the
    model, we used 100 randomly selected properties. We excluded properties <5 ha
    in total area (removed to reduce the chance of including suburban properties)
    and properties with rivers that originated and terminated within the property
    or only had one point of intersection with the property boundary. This produces
    a with k value of 0, which does not meaningfully describe the watercourse. These
    properties were therefore removed and replaced with another randomly sampled property.
    2.9. Method limitations The main limitations of this model are typical of many
    spatial modelling efforts, namely feature and categorisation accuracy, and spatial
    heterogeneity. As previously mentioned, this model is limited in the outcomes
    that were able to be addressed and there were many outcomes that were discussed
    for implementation. However, computational and resource constraints meant that
    they were not included in this iteration of the RQM. A more detailed analysis
    of limitations can be found in Appendix V. 3. Results 3.1. RQM results Across
    the catchment, the mean values of pasture productivity (RCP8.5) and carbon sequestration
    at a 20-m buffer width returned an average of 4.3 tonnes/ha/year and 118.8 tC/ha
    over 100 years respectively. To put this in perspective, a value of 4.3 tonnes/ha/year
    can support 7.8 DSE, just a little less than one 500-kg cow per year (8 DSE =
    1 × 500-kg dry cow). Recent market prices for feeder cattle between 400 and 520
    kg are approximately $1800 AUD/head (as of 20/09/2022 www.mla.com.au/prices-markets/cattlephysicalreport/).
    This puts the mean value of the pasture dry matter per hectare across the catchment
    at just under $1800 AUD per year. In comparison, and assuming that the carbon
    sequestered could translate to Australian Carbon Credit Units (where 1 unit =
    1 tonne carbon dioxide equivalent) at the current price of $30.30 AUD/t (as of
    19/09/2022 www.renewableenergyhub.com.au/market-prices/), the value of sequestered
    carbon would be approximately $3600 AUD. This indicates that, at its current price,
    the value of Australian Carbon Credit Units would only cover two years of lost
    income from beef production. In addition, it would cover less than half the cost
    of revegetation at the default value of $9000 AUD/ha. In order to cover the cost
    of lost production for 5 years, the value of Australian Carbon Credit Units would
    have to exceed $76 AUD, more than two and a half times the current rate. Individual
    properties vary in their pasture yield rates, which can be identified using the
    RQM. For example, one property has an estimated yield of 6.3 tonnes/ha/year under
    RCP8.5 climate conditions which would cover the cost of production for just under
    3 years (Fig. 3), whilst a property with low pasture productivity but high carbon
    sequestration rates would be sufficient to cover the cost of production for almost
    5 years. Download : Download high-res image (442KB) Download : Download full-size

    an area of 36.55 ha, sufficient to carry 419 dry sheep equivalents (DSE) or 52
    head of cattle (419/8). If these are converted to a dollar value using the current
    market price ($1800/ cattle), a yearly value of $93,600 results. Compare this
    to the value of the carbon stored (6981 tC multiplied by the market value of Australian
    carbon credits; $30 AUD), is approximately$210,000 AUD. At the current market
    value of Australian Carbon Credit Units, they would cover <3 years of lost production.
    This land covers approximately 15 % of the property, which can be useful information
    for hitting environmental targets. It is important to note that there are many
    other ecosystem and economic outcomes that are provided with riparian restoration
    for which providing values is more difficult. These are not costed in these analyses
    and so this only represents a part of a cost-benefit analysis. The RQM also identifies
    opportunities for environmental protection. In the property show in Fig. 3, the
    20-m buffer covers 37 ha or 15 % of the total property area, not including the
    area of river that would also be protected. This enables decision-makers to make
    informed decisions about whether they wish to meet targets for environmental protection
    on individual properties. 3.2. Case study results 3.2.1. River system analyses
    From within the property sample, there was a large range of total river lengths.
    The mean river length was 4100 m, and the median was 1100 m with mean value of
    the total river length was likely reflecting the larger properties with extensive
    river systems. The three longest river systems had a property area of: 1) 2740
    ha, a length (l: Eq. (1)) of 49,000 m, and a maximum distance (d: Eq. (1)) between
    points that intersected with the property boundary of 10,000 m (see Fig. 4a);
    2) a property area of 200 ha, and l of 34,000 m and a d of 7600 m (see Fig. 4b);
    and 3) a property area of 60 ha, an l of 22,000 m and a d of 7700 m (see Fig.
    4c). Download : Download high-res image (513KB) Download : Download full-size

    and a d of 7700 m. Note: Not to scale across panels, identifying features have
    been redacted. 3.2.2. Impact of buffer width & k value on buffer area and fencing
    length We tested the accuracy of the model by analysing the response of buffer
    width to area, fence length and the rate of change of these two outputs. As expected,
    buffer area responded with linear growth in total buffer area (Fig. 5a) and exponential
    decay of buffer area rate of change (Fig. 5b). Buffer width had very little impact
    on the total length of fencing (Fig. 5c). The fencing rate of change (Fig. 5d)
    also reflected this. Interestingly, there were cases of negative growth at higher
    buffer widths. Investigation of the individual properties for which that occur
    suggests that this is due to buffers overlapping each other at higher widths and
    with more sinuous rivers. Download : Download high-res image (572KB) Download

    regression line is shown in red. Total area and fencing responded linearly to
    buffer width, whereas % rate of change for both decreased relative to buffer width
    (n = 100). Both total buffer area (Fig. 6a) and fencing length (Fig. 6c) showed
    similar relationships to property-scale watercourse complexity (k ratio). The
    relationship between buffer area or fencing length and k was relative constant
    for watercourses with a k value of <2.5. Beyond that level of watercourse complexity,
    there was a positive relationship, with greater areas and fencing lengths associated
    with higher k values. The k value had no apparent impact on the buffer area rate
    of change (Fig. 6b), however fencing rate of change (Fig. 6d) was noticeably more
    variable at lower k values. In more general terms, 84 % of the sample had a k
    value of <2.5, indicating that most of the properties were relatively channelised.

    pasture and carbon sequestration yields An analysis of pasture yield within the
    sample of 100 properties revealed a declining trend in the potential for growth
    of perennial ryegrass from the historical baseline to both the RCP4.5 and, the
    RCP8.5 climate scenarios, although all scenarios showed substantial variation
    around the mean (Fig. 7a). Both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 were marginally less productive
    than the historical baseline. The distribution of carbon sequestration was negatively
    skewed and shows a wide distribution across the sampled properties (Fig. 7b).

    range. 4. Discussion 4.1. Current and future applications of RQM Evidence suggests
    that GIS and simulation models can enhance the decision-making process in environmental
    contexts (Maron and Cockfield, 2008; Reid et al., 2022), but models used in decision-making
    can fail to account for the needs of end users and can either work at too large
    a scale to adequately inform emergent revegetation projects (Langhans et al.,
    2022) or require expensive data procurement in order to work effectively (Michez
    et al., 2017). Support tools such as the RQM, which combines innovations in spatial
    analysis with accessible data, can greatly enhance riparian management decision-making
    outcomes by predicting both the economic costs and benefits of environmental works
    (Fielding et al., 2005), thus providing information that meets the priorities
    of multiple stakeholders. Knowledge of both financial costs and the potential
    benefits of riparian restoration for ecosystem services are important for both
    landowners and NRM practitioners (Rhodes et al., 2002), with individuals sometimes
    prioritising one aspect over another. The provision of data that are tailored
    to individual properties, as is provided by the RQM, is particularly effective
    in this respect, as providing the implications of participation (or not) for individuals
    has been shown to increase riparian revegetation uptake (Pradhananga and Davenport,
    2019). The integration of the ALSA and the calculation of the costs of fencing
    and revegetation means that the economic costs of RBZs have been calculated with
    a degree of confidence across the full range of the catchment''s spatial conditions.
    In addition, the RQM identifies the relative yield of properties within the catchment
    for both pasture production and carbon sequestration, which may be further enhanced
    by future iterations of large-scale forest carbon accounting. Both measures have
    been converted into more meaningful units which enhance stakeholder communication
    and clearly indicate the change in outcome of different management decisions.
    Outside of quantifying area of potential habitat, the RQM currently does not have
    an effective method for measuring the quality of new habitat, or how that habitat
    may respond over time. The HDM output, introduced in lieu of an alternative biodiversity
    output, does go some way to assists users to consider non-economic outcomes. The
    water quality implications of buffer width are provided in a simplified, binary
    form which indicates a set of steps or goals towards achieving ecologically functioning
    RBZs at the catchment scale. These binary outputs do not consider local geomorphic
    conditions or dynamic nutrient load but provide a framework for achieving riparian
    width goals and can serve as useful benchmarks for users. 4.2. RQM comparisons
    to other models The RQM framework has advantages over similar models. The RQM
    works at the property scale, meaning that users can model property-specific revegetation
    scenarios. This is in contrast to many mapping tools, such as the open-source
    ecosystem mapping software InVEST (Sharp et al., 2014). InVEST, or the Integrated
    Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs model, is used to map, quantify
    and value ecosystem services over large spatial extents (Langhans et al., 2022).
    InVEST uses land-use and land-cover maps as well as climate data to create a regional
    heat map to indicate priority zones, particularly for targeted mitigation of nutrient
    runoff (Anjinho et al., 2022), which enables managers to visualise where to prioritise
    resources at the regional scale. This encourages management decisions to be made
    at that larger scale, resulting in a top-down management style, with large amounts
    of data being redundant for most property-scale managers. In contrast, the RQM
    starts at a smaller spatial unit by providing property-specific data that can
    be used to inform actionable revegetation projects at that scale. This encourages
    a bottom-up response, whereby property-scale managers are able to make better-informed
    decision with data that is tailored to their specific context (Pradhananga and
    Davenport, 2019). Another model that performs some of the functionality of the
    RQM is LOOC-C (CSIRO, 2020), which is a scenario builder that enables users to
    project the outcomes of revegetation for carbon sequestration on agricultural
    properties. The approach used by this model requires users to find the relevant
    spatial extent and manually draw their proposed revegetation project. Using this
    tool to emulate the proposed buffers created by the RQM would take a considerable
    amount of time, which negatively impacts usability. LOOC-C is specifically designed
    for carbon abatement projects, with indications of how revegetation may enhance
    some ecological benefits (Stitzlein and Mooij, 2019) and is able to be much more
    specific in terms of sequestration response to previous land use and condition.
    When compared to the RQM however, LOOC-C lacks a detailed analysis of the economic
    costs of revegetation, both in terms of lost production and project costs. This
    factor is common to many models, in that their design orientation around specific
    quantification elements (i.e. carbon abatement in the LOOC-C example) limits them
    to be more detailed in their assessment but reduces use-cases to single-function
    analyses. BirdCast, a model which estimates avian occurrence from revegetation
    works, is another example of this practice (Hingee et al., 2022). Like the RQM,
    this model functions across a large spatial area on the eastern interior of Australia,
    enabling broad use across the continent, however it is unable to identify potential
    synergies that may encourage stakeholders to undertake revegetation projects outside
    of increasing bird distribution. The RQM is multifunctional; it can be used as
    a carbon sequestration predictor that simultaneously informs users on the economic
    impact, or it can be used in a revegetation cost analysis that also directs to
    relevant planting lists, among other uses. As previously stated, the model is
    unable to quantify all relevant outcomes. It is worth pointing out the weaknesses
    inherent in this framework, namely that as it works off a series of region-scale
    measures subsequently downscaled into individual properties, the model has the
    potential to result in misleading generalisations in some cases. This is particularly
    the case for large properties with significant internal variation in outputs,
    as the model simply provides the mean or highest value over the whole property,
    whereas the reality would be more variable. The use of the outputs directly in
    consultation with landholders and NRM practitioners would tend to reduce this
    risk, as they will be familiar with the local context and can disregard any anomalous
    outcomes. Additionally, these limitations are common to the three other models
    presented here. 4.3. RQM''s contribution towards novel riparian revegetation approaches
    Due to the multifunctional design of the RQM, new ways of approaching riparian
    management may become apparent. For example, in correspondence with local stakeholders,
    we were informed that most institutional revegetation funding is predicated on
    a commitment to a riparian width of at least 20 m. However, the available literature
    indicates that there are significant ecosystem goals that can be achieved with
    a buffer width of <20 m in particular cases, such as reduction in sedimentation
    and bacterial inputs (Lind et al., 2019) and bank stability, both of which are
    greatly improved by fencing in general (Grudzinski et al., 2020). Additionally,
    the RQM demonstrates that significant carbon sequestration gains can also be made
    in buffers <20 m. Carbon sequestration is dependent on the growth of biomass,
    and evidence has shown that woody vegetation experiences higher levels of growth
    (and therefore faster carbon sequestration) when planted in strips as opposed
    to blocks (Keryn et al., 2022) due to reduced competition for resources such as
    light and water. When considered alongside the growth dynamics of woody vegetation,
    where much of the total carbon is sequestered in the first 10–15 years of plant
    growth (Paul and Roxburgh, 2020), an incremental revegetation plan may be a viable
    option. An incremental revegetation plan would involve an initial commitment to
    a 10-m buffer width for the first 10 years, and an additional commitment to a
    20-m width afterwards. This would take advantage of the strip effect and enable
    rapid growth of woody vegetation in two stages. This would also add some diversity
    to the degree of maturity of riparian vegetation, adding complexity to the system.
    For NRM practitioners, this may enable landholders for whom a 20-m width comes
    at too great a financial cost to enter the conversation, which may lead to further
    environmental gains in the future. Scientific analysis of a sequential approach
    to riparian revegetation appears to be lacking (McCallum et al., 2018), but there
    is evidence that a staggered planting approach may improve plant diversity by
    reducing the dominance of overstorey species and enabling the growth of substorey
    species (Schneemann and McElhinny, 2012). The downside to this approach is that
    there may be additional labour costs associated with fencing and planting, and
    that water quality gains may occur at a slower rate if land-use intensity is high.
    This may be mitigated by the staggered revegetation costs over two planting periods
    10 years apart and low-cost temporary fencing which may be a viable option in
    some cases. Furthermore, depending on the land-use intensity and stock management
    practices on a particular watercourse, a narrower RBZ may be able to mitigate
    inputs from a diffuse nutrient load. This may be a preferable approach for zero-sum
    game landholders, who may not be willing participants otherwise. The RQM framework
    is able to rapidly assess the ecological/economic costs and benefits at each stage
    to test of the staggered revegetation approach to test for viability and desirability
    between all stakeholders. An alternative riparian management structure could allow
    for landowner to selectively harvest the timber resources in revegetated RBZs
    in order to mitigate the cost of lost production whilst still retaining some ecological
    functioning. This strategy is adapted from ‘retention forestry’, which focuses
    on multifunctional forest systems that aim to preserve important ecosystem and
    biodiversity structures, whilst still allowing for the selective harvesting of
    timber (Gustafsson et al., 2012). This presents an opportunity for well-regulated
    mixed-use RBZs to provide a sustainable source of timber and encourage more sustainable
    building practices whilst contributing to resilient regional economies. The RQM
    can assist users in identifying properties with high timber growth potential by
    using the carbon sequestration value divided by the total area as a proxy for
    growth rate. This strategy could help to enhance regional timber supply, the demand
    for which is expected to increase as the global construction industry attempts
    to reduce industrial carbon emissions (Atiq et al., 2022). Similar strategies
    have been employed in various parts of the world such as in Northern Europe (Gustafsson
    et al., 2020), North America (Kenefic et al., 2021) and in Australia (Scott et
    al., 2019). In the study area, the Otway Agroforestry Network has been putting
    this concept into practice since 1993 (Otway Agroforestry Network, 2018). This
    strategy may be able to augment economic outcomes for RBZs but, based on the RQM
    results, is unlikely to overcome lost production completely. A selective harvesting
    strategy has been shown to have mixed environmental outcomes with positive outcomes
    including the creation of microhabitats within forest systems (Gustafsson et al.,
    2020), but also resulting in less large wood input into streams (Reid and Hassan,
    2020), reduced thermal mitigation downstream (Arismendi and Groom, 2019) and reduction
    of riparian plant communities (Oldén et al., 2019). As the harvest time for timber
    is relatively long this may be a desirable middle-ground option for landowners
    and NRM practitioners to create good short-medium term ecological outcomes and
    a supplementary long-term economic outcome and can be reasonably well evaluated
    using RQM carbon sequestration outputs as a proxy for biomass growth. 4.4. Implications
    for riparian policy The RQM attempts to provide a balanced assessment of costs
    and benefits of RBZs. There is a tendency for decision-making support tools to
    be based on single or closely grouped values that address the priorities of particular
    stakeholders, whether that be economic productivity or any single ecological function,
    whilst the priorities of other stakeholders (including the environment) may be
    overlooked. This makes it difficult for decision-makers to respond to the dynamic
    challenges and complexities of riparian management in a way that enhances the
    exceptional productive capacity of RBZs from both economic and ecological perspectives.
    This is not to understate the value in those tools, but rather to suggest that
    over-reliance on a tool that only considers one element may lead to unbalanced
    decisions. In order to overcome this, the RQM could help to inform an accreditation
    system that rewards agricultural landowners for positive management which may
    provide an incentive framework for holistic riparian management. Accreditation
    schemes exist already, most notably for the organic food industry, which typically
    involves a national third-party regulator that awards certification on a product
    based on organic agricultural practices (Murphy et al., 2022). These schemes have
    had some success in setting standards at the national scale for food production
    expectations at a regulatory level (Fouilleux and Loconto, 2017), and have been
    shown to positively impact purchase intention from a consumer standpoint (Watanabe
    et al., 2021). Additionally, some reports have found that managers have experienced
    a good return on investment when switching from conventional to organic agricultural
    practices due to the markup on organic goods and excessive cost of inputs (e.g.
    fertilisers, pesticides) (Kleemann et al., 2014). On the other hand, there is
    also research that indicates that regulation of this kind can be difficult to
    enforce, particularly across national standards and borders (Chenglin, 2011).
    Depending on the mechanism used, an accreditation system for riparian management
    may be able to be built into existing organic or carbon neutrality accreditation
    schemes. Based on RQM assessment of the costs involved in revegetating from pasture,
    this strategy may be less likely to encourage landowners to revegetate from pasture
    (as the potential benefits are unlikely to cover revegetation costs) but may work
    well to protect existing RBZs where vegetation already exists (and therefore revegetation
    costs are irrelevant). In this context, the RQM could serve as a decision support
    tool to determine the viability of being able to meet accreditor regulation. A
    complementary framework could be developed based on existing market-based carbon
    credit systems. Presently, the results of the RQM indicate that the ability of
    a carbon unit system to cover the cost of lost production is limited. Indeed,
    such an outcome may not be desirable as it would have implications for food security,
    particularly on high pasture yield properties. Carbon farming does however present
    an opportunity for landholders to diversify their income streams in the face of
    challenging climactic conditions whilst contributing to greater erosion control,
    the improvement of regional landscape aesthetics, water quality and biodiversity
    (Lin et al., 2013). This framework could be adapted into a system that values
    not only the carbon stored from revegetation works but also the other ecosystem
    and productive services which may help to improve regional resilience, particularly
    in low-productivity years. Research has shown that increasing vegetation may provide
    regional benefits, such as enhanced vegetation-rainfall feedback loops (Notaro,
    2018) and the prevention of soil erosion, therefore maintaining long-term fertility
    (Smith et al., 2021). One area of riparian vegetation that might have high value
    from an economic standpoint is the potential to mitigate local (on-farm) and downstream
    flooding. Floods have caused significant damage around the globe, with a South
    Asia-based study estimating the damages of 634 flood events from 1950 to 2020
    to be at $125 billion USD (Amarnath et al., 2021). In response to these financial
    risks, agricultural and flood insurance have become increasingly widespread at
    the global scale (Kalfin et al., 2022). Research suggests that riparian vegetation
    can reduce on-farm water runoff, and thus mitigate the impact of local flooding
    (Nicholson et al., 2012) and constructed wetlands are well established as water
    retardation and retention strategies that can mitigate flooding downstream (Kurki-Fox
    et al., 2022). Quantifying these effects at the property and catchment scale may
    enable the flood mitigation effect of RBZs to be valued in terms of damages prevented,
    which could be built into a multifunctional riparian incentive scheme, paid for
    by a combination of selective harvesting of timber, the sale of carbon credits
    to carbon emitting businesses and flood mitigation services to downstream properties,
    towns and cities via a reduction in insurance premiums. In addition, the quality
    of these strategies could be assessed on their ability to provide other ecosystem
    services via the accreditation system described in this study. These regional
    benefits present a potential model for a more multifunctional market-based incentive
    system. Additionally, there is also potential for the RQM to be used to inform
    more traditional decision-making tools, such as for multi-criteria decision analyses,
    whereby RQM outputs may help to determine values of various criterion. 4.5. Case
    study discussion The response of buffer area to waterway complexity and buffer
    width means that planning of areal costs for riparian revegetation projects are
    likely to be in proportion to those measures. The impact of buffer width on fencing
    rate of change is relatively small, indicating that funding allocated for fencing
    may not change very much regardless of the buffer width. This may have implications
    for decision-makers in cases where the limiting factor is fencing cost, but other
    costs can be mitigated by other means. The impact of k value on total fencing
    also reflects this, with the low variation within properties. A high k value appears
    to be a poor indicator of potential fencing costs in general terms. The high prevalence
    of low k values also indicates that river channelization may be an issue in this
    catchment, though more investigation is likely to be needed in order to determine
    this, given that it may also arise naturally due to the headwater nature of the
    streams in the sample. Pasture dry matter analyses indicated that there is likely
    to be a drop in relative productivity in the event of both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios
    when compared to historic climate conditions. This drop in relative productivity
    has been noted in other nearby regions (Mrazova et al., 2017) and can be broadly
    attributed to reductions in rainfall and increase in temperature expected in the
    region (DELWP, 2019). At the global scale, many regions are expected to experience
    reductions in productivity and may therefore require further adaptation strategies
    (Filho et al., 2022). The RQM allows decision-makers to identify whether a particular
    property is likely to experience these drops in productivity and plan accordingly,
    which can assist in securing long-term adaptation to new climate norms. 5. Conclusion
    In summary, the use of a malleable geospatial quantification framework, like the
    one detailed here, enables the rapid analysis of the multifunctional potential
    of RBZs for large spatial extents with a fair degree of certainty. Through dialogue
    with stakeholders, we were able to identify the outputs that were most important
    to them and which we were able to quantify at scale. Currently, aspects of the
    analysis regarding economic outcomes (changes to pasture production and costs
    associated with fencing and revegetation) and potential for carbon sequestration
    are more firmly backed by data. In contrast, impact of width on water quality
    and biodiversity potential is more highly influenced by site-specific factors
    such as land-use intensity and nearby existing source populations and so is harder
    to quantify in the context of the RQM. We expect these outputs to be improved
    in future model iterations. The RQM is competitive with other quantification tools
    such as inVEST, LOOC-C and BirdCast, and achieves novelty by providing multisystem
    outputs at the property-scale, at low cost and high speed; a use-case that is
    frequently neglected. This enables property managers to initiate independent,
    but informed revegetation projects, which may help to alleviate pressure from
    NRM practitioners, induce novel adaptation strategies and improve ecological functioning
    of waterways. Incremental revegetation plans, selective harvesting of timber,
    riparian accreditation schemes and carbon/flood mitigation market incentive structures
    may emerge as viable strategies that are able to be informed by the RQM (among
    others) and promote greater commitments to revegetation by utilising RBZ multifunctionality.

    destruction of riparian vegetation (Petsch et al., 2021), but the ability to predict
    how long it will take for biodiversity to recover following revegetation is far
    less certain, as is how that recovery will be affected by riparian planting widths.
    Improvements to biodiversity will also depend on distance to the nearest source
    for colonising flora and fauna as well as their ability to inhabit the area. NatureKit
    2.0 is a region-scale dataset that has been used to inform past state-level biodiversity
    planning (DELWP, 2021) however, in personal correspondence with the DELWP representatives,
    we were advised that it was not appropriate to be in the manner we planned as
    the data had not been updated (29/05/2022). We therefore provided spatially informed
    HDM, provided by the Arthur Rylah Institute and acquired from NatureKit 2.0 (DELWP,
    2021), in order to give an indication of whether a particular species range might
    be able to expand its range into one area relative to another (Sinclair et al.,
    2010). These values have application in biodiversity corridor design, habitat
    conservation projects and habitat range prediction (Liu et al., 2013). This is
    distinct to calculating an inherent habitat value, which we were unable to attempt.

    Appendix V Model limitations This model works in absolutes, meaning that it defines
    an area as 100 % viable for pasture or revegetation growth, which is rarely the
    case due to various impediments, such as in rocky outcrops. This means that all
    results should be interpreted in their local context, taking into account these
    spatial variations. As with all spatial analysis, this project is limited by the
    accuracy of data acquired. A notable example is the watercourse vector. Inaccuracy
    and inadequate labelling make it difficult to be sure if some watercourses are
    minor waterways versus ephemeral drainage lines, despite removing the small number
    of labelled drains. Ultimately, we chose not to manually remove potential ephemeral
    drain-lines as research shows that they can contribute significantly to downstream
    water quality (Hughes and Quinn, 2014) and they may be more vulnerable to a changing
    climate than perennial streams (Dairy et al., 2014). Additionally, the inclusion
    of minor streams and ephemeral drains may encourage bottom-up emergent solutions
    and a greater accumulated impact on catchment water health. Another source of
    inaccuracy was identified upon qualitatively comparing the modelled watercourse
    vector to recent satellite imagery. Several examples of the RQM failed to accurately
    follow the channel indicated via satellite imagery, therefore the precision of
    RQM outputs should be interpreted with caution. As all buffers and therefore area
    and fencing calculations are derived from the watercourse vector, this has flow
    on effects, the scale of which depend on the significance of the variance from
    the actual river morphology and the overall size of the study area in question.
    As this model is a proof of concept that uses the best publicly available data,
    we decided it was representative of how accurately we could quantify these measures
    under these restrictions. The method of calculation of fencing length is the total
    length of the outside of the buffer zone, which includes some instances where
    fencing either already exists or is inappropriate, such as at property boundaries.
    In addition, the suggested cost per meter of fencing does not include existing
    fencing or the removal of existing fencing. This has been mitigated by enabling
    the user to alter the cost of fencing per meter manually. Additionally, by using
    the raster value of the ALSA, carbon sequestration and HDM to create a mean for
    each value within each buffer zone, the RQM loses some specificity when used on
    larger study areas with more spatial variability. Whilst this is unlikely to be
    an issue in smaller spatial extents, it should be considered when applying analysis
    over large geographical areas. In more general terms, it is worth noting that
    the application of methods built for region-wide analysis is not able to assess
    the impact of property-specific variables. For example, we use ALSA to quantify
    potential economic output, however this method is best used for quantification
    at the regional scale (Akpoti et al., 2019) and does not measure the impact of
    stocking strategies or fertilisation. The use of these models was deemed to be
    appropriate given that it is still able to provide quantify relative productivity
    and given the use of the model as a support tool as one part of the decision-making
    process. There were also limitations regarding what additional functionality we
    were able to add. For example, landowners were interested in modelling how revegetation
    may provide capital gains in land value. One property manager estimated that the
    riparian strip revegetation project (<5-m plus fencing) on his stream had added
    over $100,000 AUD in value. Whilst this information is very difficult to verify,
    modelling how riparian aesthetics may improve property valuation may provide significant
    value in future studies. Appendix VI. Supplementary data Download : Download zip

  description: As the world becomes increasingly urbanized, the development of smart
    cities and the deployment of IoT applications will play an essential role in addressing
    urban challenges and shaping sustainable and resilient urban environments. However,
    there are also challenges to overcome, including privacy and security concerns,
    and interoperability issues. Addressing these challenges requires collaboration
    between governments, industry stakeholders, and citizens to ensure the responsible
    and equitable implementation of IoT technologies in smart cities. The IoT offers
    a vast array of possibilities for smart city applications, enabling the integration
    of various devices, sensors, and networks to collect and analyze data in real
    time. These applications span across different sectors, including transportation,
    energy management, waste management, public safety, healthcare, and more. By leveraging
    IoT technologies, cities can optimize their infrastructure, enhance resource allocation,
    and improve the quality of life for their citizens. In this paper, eight smart
    city global models have been proposed to guide the development and implementation
    of IoT applications in smart cities. These models provide frameworks and standards
    for city planners and stakeholders to design and deploy IoT solutions effectively.
    We provide a detailed evaluation of these models based on nine smart city evaluation
    metrics. The challenges to implement smart cities have been mentioned, and recommendations
    have been stated to overcome these challenges.

    As the world becomes increasingly urbanized, the development of smart cities and
    the deployment of IoT applications will play an essential role in addressing urban
    challenges and shaping sustainable and resilient urban environments. However,
    there are also challenges to overcome, including privacy and security concerns,
    and interoperability issues. Addressing these challenges requires collaboration
    between governments, industry stakeholders, and citizens to ensure the responsible
    and equitable implementation of IoT technologies in smart cities. The IoT offers
    a vast array of possibilities for smart city applications, enabling the integration
    of various devices, sensors, and networks to collect and analyze data in real
    time. These applications span across different sectors, including transportation,
    energy management, waste management, public safety, healthcare, and more. By leveraging
    IoT technologies, cities can optimize their infrastructure, enhance resource allocation,
    and improve the quality of life for their citizens. In this paper, eight smart
    city global models have been proposed to guide the development and implementation
    of IoT applications in smart cities. These models provide frameworks and standards
    for city planners and stakeholders to design and deploy IoT solutions effectively.
    We provide a detailed evaluation of these models based on nine smart city evaluation
    metrics. The challenges to implement smart cities have been mentioned, and recommendations
    have been stated to overcome these challenges. Keywords: smart cities; IoT; ICT;
    urbanization; sensors; development; LTE; 5G 1. Introduction Emerging Internet
    of Things (IoT) applications and services, including smart health, smart grid,
    smart water, smart cities, and intelligent transportation systems (ITS), are set
    to transform and disrupt the way we live and work. IoT is currently enabling billions
    of smart devices and sensors which are communicated and remotely operated via
    the Internet. Currently, the number of IoT connected devices is greater than 15
    billion devices. By 2030, it is expected that the IoT will incorporate more than
    29 billion smart devices, which represents three times of that in 2020 [1]. According
    to the International Data Corporation (IDC), the IoT spending forecast will rapidly
    grow from $726 billion in 2019 to $1.1 trillion in 2023. According to IoT Analytics’
    global IoT enterprise spending dashboard, the IoT enterprise market size is forecasted
    to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.4% to $483 billion from
    2022 until 2027 [2]. The IoT is denoted as machine-to-machine (M2M) communication;
    therefore, a staggering number of “things” will require ubiquitous connectivity
    [3]. These connected devices can range from household appliances and smart home
    devices to industrial equipment, vehicles, and even entire cities [4]. IoT devices
    are typically equipped with sensors that can collect data on their environment,
    such as temperature, humidity, and motion detection, as well as data on their
    own operation, such as power usage and performance [5]. This data is then transmitted
    to other devices or systems over the Internet, where it can be analyzed and used
    to inform decisions and actions. There is an emerging consensus that cellular-based
    legacy fourth generation (4G) long-term evolution (LTE) and emerging 5G are the
    key technology candidates that can provide the required global IoT connectivity
    to such a staggering number of “things”. The 5G cellular system will be distinct
    from previous generations. Basically, the fundamental merits will not be combinations
    of old and new radio access technologies (RAT); 5G will also enable new-use cases
    and mobile communication requirements beyond 4G cellular networks. It will be
    a combination of 4G cellular standards and technologies, as well as new disruptive
    technologies such as mmWave and spectrum sharing. 5G will be propelled by whole
    new services and demand [6]. By 2030, it is projected that there will be billions
    of interconnected things with data rates of several Gbps, allowing for a personalized
    user experience with minimal latency and great reliability [3]. Cellular-based
    machine-to-machine (M2M) communications are one of the key IoT enabling technologies
    with huge market potential for cellular service providers deploying LTE networks.
    Massive IoT (MIoT) refers to the tens of billions of M2M devices, objects, and
    machines that require ubiquitous connectivity [3]. According to the global standards
    body 3GPP, a massive scale means deploying at least 1 million devices per square
    kilometer [3]. IoT applications span a wide range of use cases ranging from mission-critical
    applications with strict latency and reliability requirements (e.g., driverless
    vehicles) to those that require support of massive number of connected M2M devices
    with relaxed latency and reliability requirements (e.g., smart meters) [3]. The
    prior cellular generations were essentially designed to meet the needs of human-
    type communications (HTC) (e.g., voice, video, and data). However, in order to
    accelerate industry digitalization, 5G networks are projected to enhance industrial
    communications, as well. As a result, new industry stakeholders will be able to
    use novel services and networking capabilities. 5G technology is projected to
    provide connection and communication needs in vertical industries (e.g., automotive,
    healthcare, manufacturing, entertainment, and so on) in a cost-effective manner
    [7]. According to the United Nations (UN) the world population has reached 8.0
    billion in 2022, which is more than three times that in 1950. The world population
    is projected to reach 8.5 billion in 2030, and to further increase to 9.7 billion
    in 2050 and 10.7 billion in 2100 [8]. In 1950, approximately 70% of the world
    population were residing in rural areas. The turning point occurred in 2007; for
    the first time in history, the global urban population exceeded the global rural
    population. In 2018, 55% of world population (i.e., 4.2 billion) resided in urban
    areas. This percentage is expected to reach 60% in 2030. In 2050, more than two-thirds
    (68%) of global population are projected to reside in urban areas, which is the
    reverse of that in the mid-twentieth century [9]. Due to the projected increased
    demand for urbanization [9], it is expected that the demand for smart cities and
    their applications and services will increase accordingly. According to Allied
    Market Research, the global smart cities market size was valued at $648.4 B and
    is expected to reach $6.0 T in 2030, growing at a CAGR of 25.2% from 2021–2030
    [10]. Consequently, the number of smart cities which contribute to enhancing the
    inhabitants’ quality of life (QoL) will increase. According to a study produced
    by the smart city observatory, part of the IMD world competitive center (WCC),
    the number of smart cities has increased from 118 cities in 2021 to 141 cities
    in 2023 [11]. Adoption of IoT communication technologies such as low-power wide-area
    networks (LPWAN), for instance, LTE for machines (LTE-M), narrow band IoT (NB-IoT),
    cellular networks such as 4G/LTE and 5G are required for the realization of smart
    city concepts [3]. According to Global Suppliers Mobile Association (GSA), around
    70 countries had 5G networks as of June 2022. 5G is partially deployed in approximately
    15 countries [12]. 6G, the next generation mobile network, promises exponentially
    faster data speeds and lower latency than 5G [13]. As a result, the deployment
    of these connectivity technologies is a critical factor in the maturation of smart
    city projects. Such technologies also pose the groundwork for the IoT, a vast
    network of smart devices that collaborate to collect and analyze data and perform
    actions, making smart cities a reality [14]. The selection criteria of the model
    cities in the paper are based on the preliminary revision of studies, reports,
    and electronic websites that display the smart cities around the world. The interdependence
    on authentic studies from official administrations to obtain the information related
    to the smart cities’ models were selected from Africa [15], Asia [16], and Europe
    [17], for instance, European Parliament studies, International Telecommunications
    Union (ITU) studies, and official websites which provide details of smart cities.
    The selected smart cities must achieve the following standards: The recurrence
    of the city’s appearance in more than one comprehensive study to analyze smart
    city projects. The availability of an official website or a special report for
    the city containing smart projects that have been implemented or are being implemented
    in the city. The same project within the smart city must have more than one source
    in the absence of an official website or report for the city. Cities should be
    as representative as possible of most geographical areas and different cultural
    and economic characteristics. Considering that the experiments under study include
    models for both directions of smart cities, existing cities that have already
    been developed to transform into smart cities, and new cities that already exist
    from first, second and third generation cities. 2. Smart City Smart cities are
    urban areas that leverage technology and data to improve the quality of life for
    their citizens, increase efficiency and sustainability, and enhance economic development.
    These cities use interconnected technologies to collect and analyze data in real
    time, allowing them to make informed decisions and optimize resource use. Smart
    cities rely on a variety of technologies, such as sensors, IoT devices, artificial
    intelligence (AI), and machine learning, to collect data and automate processes
    as depicted in Figure 1. This data can then be used to improve city services,
    such as transportation, energy, waste management, and public safety [18]. Figure
    1. Smart City Applications. Smart Transportation: utilize IoT sensors to collect
    data on traffic flow, parking, and public transportation, optimizing routes and
    reducing congestion. Ultimately, this data could also be used to improve safety
    by detecting and alerting drivers of potential accidents [19]. Smart Energy: deploy
    IoT sensors to monitor and optimize energy usage in buildings and public spaces,
    reducing waste and carbon emissions [20,21]. Smart Waste Management: utilize IoT
    sensors to monitor waste levels in trash cans and dumpsters, optimizing garbage
    collection routes and reducing costs [22]. Predictive analytics: use machine learning
    algorithms to predict the amount of waste generated in different areas and schedule
    waste collection accordingly [23]. Recycling robots: deploy robots to sort and
    separate recyclable materials from general waste [24]. Smart bins: install smart
    bins that use sensors to detect when they are full and send alerts to waste collection
    teams [25]. Waste-to-energy systems: convert waste into energy through incineration,
    gasification, or anaerobic digestion [25]. Public Safety: use IoT sensors to monitor
    crime and traffic violations, as well as detecting natural disasters and emergencies,
    enabling faster response times and better disaster management [26]. Smart Water
    Management: use IoT sensors to monitor and optimize water usage in buildings and
    public spaces, reducing waste and conserving resources [27]. Smart water systems
    can be used by water utilities, businesses, and homeowners to monitor and control
    water usage. Overall, smart water systems offer a number of benefits that can
    help to conserve water, save money, and improve water management. Smart Health:
    use of connected devices and sensors to monitor and manage various aspects of
    health. These devices can collect and transmit data to healthcare providers, caregivers,
    or the individuals themselves, allowing for better tracking and management of
    health conditions and improving overall health outcomes [28]. Smart Government:
    use of technology and data to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and quality
    of government services and operations. It involves the integration of information
    and communication technologies (ICT) into government processes and services, with
    the aim of enhancing transparency, citizen engagement, and overall governance
    [29,30]. Smart Buildings: use of advanced technologies and systems to enhance
    their functionality, efficiency, and sustainability. These buildings are equipped
    with a wide range of sensors, control systems, and other IoT devices that enable
    them to collect and analyze data about their environment and occupants in real
    time [31]. Smart Manufacturing: utilize advanced technologies such as the IoT,
    big data analytics, AI, robotics, and automation to optimize the manufacturing
    process. It aims to create a more efficient and flexible manufacturing system
    that can adapt to changing market demands, reduce costs, and improve product quality
    [32]. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV): a type of aircraft that is operated remotely
    without a human pilot on board. UAVs can be either controlled by a human operator
    on the ground or can be programmed to operate autonomously. They are commonly
    used for military, commercial, scientific, and recreational purposes and have
    become increasingly popular in recent years due to advances in technology and
    lower costs [33]. Robotics: robotics and the Internet of Things (IoT) play a crucial
    role in shaping smart city applications by integrating physical devices and intelligent
    systems with the city’s infrastructure [34]. These technologies enable the development
    of innovative solutions to improve efficiency, sustainability, and the overall
    quality of life for citizens. These are just a few examples of how robotics and
    IoT technologies are transforming urban environments into smarter, more sustainable,
    and efficient cities [34,35]. As technology continues to advance, we can expect
    even more innovative applications to emerge, improving the way we live and interact
    with our surroundings. To implement smart cities, governments and businesses must
    work together to develop and deploy IoT technologies, as well as ensure the security,
    privacy, and interoperability of the systems [36]. Smart cities require investment
    in infrastructure and innovation, and they can create significant benefits for
    citizens, businesses, and the environment. Overall, the goal of smart cities is
    to create more livable, sustainable, and efficient urban environments for their
    citizens, while also reducing the environmental impact of cities and promoting
    economic growth [37]. 2.1. Smart Transportation As the number of vehicles increases,
    the transportation and logistics services represent a promising market for M2M
    communications. According to Statista, revenue in the passenger car market is
    expected to reach $1029B in 2023. The revenue in the passenger car market is expected
    to show an annual growth rate of +1.74%, resulting in a projected market volume
    of $2067 B in 2027 [38]. These emerging vehicles will be equipped with IoT sensors
    and actuators [3]. In addition, roads and transported goods are equipped with
    devices that enable the transportation and freight corporations to seamlessly
    track the vehicles and the goods by updating the status of delivery to the customers
    [39]. 2.1.1. Logistic Services The supply chain can work efficiently by enabling
    M2M sensors to track goods and vehicles in real time. M2M logistic services enable
    total surveillance on the status of raw materials, products, storage, transportation,
    and after-sell services by monitoring temperature, humidity, and light. If the
    status has a problem (i.e., an emergency event), the M2M sensor will transmit
    an alerting message to the M2M server to take the proper decision via the core
    network [40]. In addition, the M2M logistic services can also track the inventory
    in the warehouses by enabling the stakeholders to monitor the market dynamics
    and take the appropriate decision regarding either to launch sale or to refill.
    The aforementioned policies will help to reduce the occupied spaces in the warehouses,
    reducing the waiting times for the customers and consequently gaining the customers’
    satisfaction [41]. These services can help companies improve efficiency, reduce
    costs, and increase safety by providing real-time visibility and data-driven insights.
    The logistic transportation IoT services include: Asset Tracking Deploy IoT sensors
    to track the location and condition of cargo, containers, and other assets in
    real time. This can help companies optimize logistics and reduce the risk of theft
    or loss [42]. 2. Condition Monitoring Utilize sensors to monitor the condition
    of goods during transportation, including temperature, humidity, and other environmental
    factors. This can help companies ensure the quality and safety of their products
    [43]. 3. Predictive Maintenance IoT sensors can be used to monitor the condition
    of vehicles and equipment in real time and predict when maintenance is needed.
    This can help companies reduce downtime and extend the life of their assets [44,45].
    Overall, logistic transportation IoT services can provide companies with a range
    of benefits, including improved efficiency, reduced costs, increased safety, and
    enhanced customer satisfaction. 2.1.2. Electric Vehicles The intelligent transportation
    systems (ITS) depend on the M2M communications accompanied by the roads, which
    are equipped with IoT sensors and actuators which contribute to regulating the
    traffic flow, vehicle navigation and/or safety [46]. If the vehicle operator is
    sleeping, the sensors will alert the operator to avoid accidents. In addition,
    the M2M sensors equipped in the roads will guide the operators to the closest
    charging station, as it has all information of the vehicle including the battery
    charging level [47]. IoT sensors installed in the road and high definition (HD)
    cameras [14] equipped in the traffic lights are integrated together to regulate
    and control the vehicles’ traffic flow in the street [48]. Furthermore, in case
    of an accident, the M2M sensors installed in the roads and vehicles will detect
    the location of the accident which enables the governmental agencies to act immediately.
    Electric vehicles (EVs) are a rapidly growing industry that is helping to reduce
    carbon emissions and improve air quality [49]. With the rise of the IoT, there
    are numerous IoT applications that can be used to enhance the capabilities of
    electric vehicles as illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2. Electric Vehicle M2M Applications.
    Remote monitoring: Monitor the health and status of electric vehicle components,
    such as batteries, motors, and charging systems using IoT sensors. This information
    can be transmitted to a central server for analysis, allowing vehicle owners to
    receive alerts if there are any issues with their vehicle [50]. 2. Smart charging:
    Optimize the charging of electric vehicles, ensuring that they are charged at
    the most efficient times and using the most cost-effective energy sources. This
    can help to reduce the strain on the power grid and reduce the cost of charging
    for vehicle owners [51,52]. 3. Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) communication: Enable V2G
    communication, allowing electric vehicles to communicate with the power grid and
    provide energy back to the grid when it is needed. This can help to balance the
    load on the grid and reduce the need for additional power generation [53,54].
    4. Predictive maintenance: Analyze data from electric vehicles to predict when
    maintenance is needed, allowing vehicle owners to schedule maintenance before
    issues arise. This can help to reduce downtime and extend the life of vehicle
    components [55]. 5. Driver behavior monitoring: Deploy IoT sensors to monitor
    driver behavior, including acceleration, braking, and speed. This can help promote
    safer driving practices and optimize energy consumption. Ultimately, IoT applications
    can greatly enhance the capabilities of electric vehicles, improving their efficiency,
    reliability, and cost-effectiveness [56]. 2.1.3. Smart Parking Smart parking is
    the use of technology to improve the efficiency of parking management. This can
    include various tools and services, such as sensors, mobile apps, and real-time
    data analysis, to help drivers find parking spaces quickly and easily. Some of
    the benefits of smart parking services include reduced congestion, increased revenue
    for parking operators, and improved customer experience for drivers. For example,
    smart parking services are the use of sensors that detect whether a parking spot
    is occupied or not. This information can then be transmitted to a central database,
    which can be accessed by drivers through a mobile app. This allows drivers to
    find available parking spots in real time, reducing the amount of time spent searching
    for a spot and ultimately reducing congestion on the roads. These days, driving
    and parking a car in urban cities is challenging. For instance, the number of
    vehicles entering Manhattan (only the business district) in 2017 exceed 700 k
    per day [57,58]. Finding parking for these cars is becoming more difficult if
    the number of parking spots across New York City (NYC) is only between 3.4 M to
    4.4 M. To overcome this problem, M2M sensors placed on roads will promptly guide
    the vehicle operators to the unoccupied spots on the street. This service will
    save energy (fuel) and money and will enable the government to monitor the occupancy
    level of available parking spots [59]. Smart vehicle counting Within 2010 to 2050,
    the population of the urban cities will increase from 3.6 billion to 6.3 billion
    inhabitants with 80% increasing rate [60]. By 2035, the population of the US will
    exceed 370M [61], and the world population will approximately 8.8B inhabitants.
    On average, the number of vehicles running on the roads will reach 2B by 2035
    [39,62]. According to a report by Allied Market Research, the global smart vehicle
    market is expected to reach $2.2 trillion by 2030, growing at a compound annual
    growth rate (CAGR) of 40.1% from 2021 to 2030 [63]. This absolutely will pose
    a serious challenge to manage the traffic control, intelligent transportation,
    and city management. In order to tackle this problem, employing the M2M sensors
    to collect data which provide accurate vehicle detection and measuring and controlling
    the traffic flow [64]. 2. Passenger services One of the utmost passenger services
    is the e-ticketing system [65]. Ticketing systems of traditional transportation
    systems are manual, and some of them may be semi-automatic and/or automatic systems
    used to collect fares. The near field communication (NFC)-based ticketing system
    will be utilized as the M2M node at the gates or exits in the airport terminals,
    or train stations scan the passenger identity using NFC-enabled user equipment
    (UE) [66]. The NFC-enabled UE is scanned at the M2M node; the M2M will send its
    code to the M2M server through the core network. Based on the tariff table, the
    traveled distance, and the class of the ticket (e.g., economy, business, and first
    class) the fare will be withdrawn from the passenger’s bank account or credit
    card. Mobile ticketing raises customer satisfaction along with the ticketing system’s
    effectiveness. 3. Fleet management Nowadays, numerous cargo ships are voyaging
    through the open oceans. These containers’ delivery services may be affected for
    many reasons, including piracy, physical damage, and delivery delay. To address
    this problem, M2M communications can be used in fleet management by developing
    a superior management system to deliver freight promptly between different regions
    [67]. Tracking of vehicles and cargos is enabled by installing M2M sensors that
    collect locations, delivery status, and climate data, which are used to reduce
    accidents and improve the fuel consumption efficiency, hence increasing the fleet
    management effectiveness [68]. 2.2. Smart Energy IoT services are a suite of technology-based
    solutions designed to optimize the production, distribution, and consumption of
    energy [21,69]. These services use sensors, data analytics, and machine learning
    to collect and analyze data on energy usage patterns and enable the automation
    and control of energy systems. 2.2.1. Smart Gri A modern electricity grid that
    leverages IoT technologies to optimize energy distribution, consumption, and management.
    Smart grid solutions can help reduce energy consumption, increase efficiency,
    and minimize environmental impact [69,70]. 2.2.2. Demand Response Demand response
    is a change in the power consumption of an electric utility customer to better
    match the demand for power with the supply [71]. Demand response can be used to
    reduce peak demand, which can help to avoid blackouts and brownouts. IoT sensors
    can be deployed to manage energy demand by adjusting energy usage during peak
    demand times. This can help reduce the need for costly power generation and distribution
    infrastructure [3,69]. 2.2.3. Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) Managed distributed
    energy resources (DERs), such as solar panels and wind turbines, enabled energy
    providers to optimize energy distribution utilizing IoT sensors. [21,69]. DERs
    are becoming increasingly important as the electricity grid becomes more decentralized.
    As more and more people generate their own electricity, DERs will play a key role
    in ensuring the reliability and resilience of the grid [71]. 2.2.4. Grid Monitoring
    IoT sensors can be deployed to simultaneous monitor grid performance, enabling
    utilities to respond quickly to any problems or outages. This can help reduce
    downtime and improve reliability [69,72]. 2.2.5. Power Quality Monitoring The
    quality of electricity being distributed can be monitored, enabling utilities
    to identify and resolve any issues that may affect power quality using IoT sensors
    [72]. A combination of IoT devices, data analytics, and communication technologies
    are required to implement smart energy solutions. However, the potential benefits
    include reduced energy consumption, which improves efficiency, and environmental
    impact, which has a significant impact on both individuals and communities [3,69].
    2.2.6. Smart Lighting Smart lighting employs IoT sensors to adjust lighting levels
    based on occupancy and daylight levels. This can help reduce energy consumption
    and save costs while still providing adequate lighting. Another M2M application
    was implemented in smart homes, smart offices, smart cities, and streets [4,14].
    Smart lighting systems impact energy savings in the cities around the world. Currently,
    55% of the world population is residing in urban cities. As the growth accelerates
    rapidly, 68% of the population are predicted to live in urban cities by 2050 globally.
    By 2030, there are 43 megacities with more than 10 million residents predicted
    [73]. These statistics pose challenges to city management and smart buildings
    in terms of energy utilization efficiency. As smart cities tend to be green, the
    sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions must be reduced [14]. Electricity is
    one of GHG emission sources which represents 27% of the total US GHG emission
    in 2018 [74]. The dominant electricity source of GHG emissions is the residential
    and commercial section, which represents 32% [74]. Reducing GHG emissions can
    be accomplished by reducing electricity usage and peak demand by increasing the
    utilization efficiency in residential and commercial buildings. Based on the report
    published by the World Council on City Data (WCCD) in 2017, GHG emissions were
    reduced by 63% in the city of Los Angeles due to switching to light emitting diode
    (LED) lighting [14]. By 2025, the global call of switching lighting systems to
    100% smart LED lighting will contribute to the reduction of the lighting share
    of the global energy consumption from 15% to 8% [75,76]. 2.2.7. Energy Storage
    The use of energy storage solutions such as batteries and capacitors can be optimized
    [69]. This can help reduce energy waste and provide a more reliable source of
    energy in areas with unreliable energy supply. Implementing smart energy solutions
    requires a combination of IoT devices, data analytics, and communication technologies
    [3]. However, the potential benefits of smart energy, including reduced energy
    consumption, increased efficiency, and minimized environmental impact, can have
    a significant impact on both individuals and communities [77]. 2.3. Smart Waste
    Management IoT applications leverage the power of the Internet of Things (IoT)
    to enhance waste management systems, making them more efficient, cost-effective,
    and environmentally friendly [78]. These applications utilize various IoT technologies
    to monitor, collect, analyze, and manage waste in real time [79]. Overall, smart
    waste management IoT applications offer a holistic approach to handling waste,
    promoting sustainability, reducing operational costs, and contributing to a cleaner
    environment. As IoT technology continues to evolve, these applications are likely
    to become even more advanced and widespread. 2.3.1. Smart Waste Bins IoT-enabled
    waste bins are equipped with sensors that can detect the fill level of the bin.
    These sensors can use ultrasonic, infrared, or weight-based technologies to measure
    the waste level. When the bin reaches a certain threshold, it sends an alert to
    waste collection teams, optimizing the collection process by reducing unnecessary
    trips and preventing overflow [80]. 2.3.2. Route Optimization IoT devices on waste
    collection vehicles enable real-time tracking of their location and status. These
    devices can use GPS technology to find the most efficient routes for waste collection,
    considering factors such as real-time traffic conditions and the fill levels of
    individual waste bins. Optimized routes reduce fuel consumption, emissions, and
    operational costs [81]. 2.3.3. Environmental Monitoring IoT sensors can be deployed
    in landfills to monitor environmental conditions such as methane emissions, temperature,
    and air quality. Real-time monitoring helps in early detection of potential issues
    and allows for timely mitigation actions, ensuring compliance with environmental
    regulations [82]. 2.3.4. Recycling Management IoT applications can facilitate
    the separation and sorting of recyclable materials. Smart recycling bins equipped
    with sensors can help users identify the correct recycling category for their
    waste items, promoting proper recycling practices [83]. 2.3.5. Public Awareness
    and Education Smart waste management IoT applications can also be used to raise
    public awareness about waste management and encourage responsible waste disposal
    behaviors. Interactive displays on waste bins or smartphone apps can provide information
    about recycling guidelines, waste reduction tips, and the environmental impact
    of different waste disposal methods [84]. 2.3.6. Data Analytics IoT-generated
    data from waste bins, collection vehicles, and landfill sensors can be analyzed
    to identify patterns and trends in waste generation, collection efficiency, and
    recycling rates. This data-driven approach allows municipalities and waste management
    companies to optimize their operations further and make informed decisions [85].
    2.3.7. Remote Monitoring and Maintenance IoT devices enable remote monitoring
    of waste management infrastructure, such as waste compactors and incinerators.
    This allows for proactive maintenance and reduces downtime, ensuring that waste
    management systems operate efficiently [86]. 2.4. Public Safety The goal of public
    safety is to create a safe and secure environment for all. This includes protecting
    people from crime, fire, and other hazards. Public safety also includes ensuring
    that people have access to emergency services when they need them. There are many
    different organizations that play a role in public safety. These include law enforcement
    agencies, fire departments, emergency medical services (EMS), and disaster response
    agencies [87]. These organizations work together to prevent crime, respond to
    emergencies, and protect the public from harm. Public safety IoT applications
    use connected devices and sensors to enhance public safety and security [88].
    Some public safety IoT applications follow. 2.4.1. Traffic Management Monitoring

    can improve response times for emergency services [88]. Traffic management applications
    are essential tools used to ensure the safety of road users and pedestrians, as
    well as to improve the efficiency of traffic flow. Here are some examples of traffic
    management and public safety applications: Intelligent Traffic Systems (ITS) ITS
    are systems that use advanced technologies such as sensors, cameras, and communication
    networks to monitor and manage traffic on roads [89]. These systems provide real-time
    information to drivers about traffic conditions, road closures, accidents, and
    other incidents, enabling them to make informed decisions about their routes and
    travel times. 2. Automated Traffic Enforcement (ATE) Systems use cameras and sensors
    to automatically detect and enforce traffic violations such as speeding, red-light
    running, and illegal parking [90]. These systems are often used to improve public
    safety by reducing the number of accidents caused by irresponsible driving. 3.
    Emergency Vehicle Prevention (EVP) EVP systems are used to provide emergency vehicles,
    such as ambulances and fire trucks, with high priority access to intersections.
    These systems use transmitters on emergency vehicles to communicate with traffic
    signals [76], allowing them to change to green lights and clear the way for the
    emergency vehicle. 4. Pedestrian Detection Systems (PDS) PDS systems use sensors
    and cameras to detect pedestrians in crosswalks and alert drivers to their presence
    [91]. These systems are especially useful in areas with high pedestrian traffic,
    such as urban centers and school zones. 5. Variable Message Signs (VMS) VMS are
    electronic signs that display real-time information about traffic conditions,
    road closures, and other relevant information to drivers. These signs are used
    to provide drivers with up-to-date information that can help them make immediate
    decisions about their routes and travel times [92]. In general, these traffic
    management and public safety applications are essential tools for ensuring the
    safety of road users and improving the efficiency of traffic flow. 2.4.2. Emergency
    Response Emergency response applications automatically detect emergencies such
    as fires, gas leaks, or natural disasters and send alerts to emergency responders
    or the public. They are software tools designed to help emergency responders quickly
    and efficiently respond to emergencies, manage incidents, and communicate with
    each other during a crisis [93]. These applications can help emergency responders
    coordinate resources, share information, and make better decisions in real time.
    The emergency response public safety applications comprising: Dispatch Systems
    These systems allow dispatchers to receive emergency calls, quickly identify the
    location and nature of the emergency, and dispatch the appropriate resources to
    the scene [94]. These systems also provide real-time communication tools that
    enable responders to communicate with each other and share critical information.
    2. Incident Management Systems These systems help emergency responders manage
    incidents by providing a centralized platform for sharing information, tracking
    resources, and coordinating response efforts [95]. They can also provide in situ
    awareness tools that allow responders to monitor the status of the incident in
    real time. 3. Mapping and GIS Applications These applications use geographic information
    system (GIS) technology to provide responders with detailed maps and location
    data that can help them navigate to the scene of an emergency, identify hazards
    and resources, and plan response strategies [96]. 4. Emergency Mobile Apps These
    apps provide emergency responders with onsite access to critical information and
    communication tools [97]. They can also provide real-time updates on incident
    status, resource availability, and other important information. 5. Social Media
    Monitoring Tools These tools enable emergency responders to monitor social media
    platforms for information about emergencies, identify trends and patterns in user-generated
    content, and quickly respond to emerging threats or issues [98]. Eventually, emergency
    response public safety applications will help emergency responders work more efficiently
    and effectively, which can ultimately save lives and reduce the impact of disasters
    and emergencies. 2.4.3. Public Health Monitoring Public health monitoring devices
    monitor air quality, detect pathogens, and track the spread of diseases, which
    can help prevent outbreaks and protect public health. These devices are essentially
    used to protect and improve the health and safety of individuals and communities
    [99]. The public health monitoring applications involve: Disease Surveillance
    Public health officials use disease surveillance systems to monitor the incidence
    and prevalence of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, influenza, and tuberculosis
    [100]. These systems allow health officials to detect outbreaks early, track disease
    spread, and develop targeted interventions to prevent the further spread of disease.
    2. Emergency Management Emergency management systems are used to coordinate responses
    to natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and other emergencies [101]. These systems
    provide real-time information about the location and severity of incidents, as
    well as resources available to respond to them. 3. Environmental Monitoring Environmental
    monitoring systems are employed to detect and respond to environmental hazards,
    such as air pollution, water contamination, and hazardous waste [102]. These systems
    allow officials to identify potential health risks and take measures to protect
    the public from harm. 4. Food Safety Food safety systems are deployed to monitor
    food production, processing, and distribution to prevent foodborne illnesses.
    These systems track outbreaks of foodborne illness and identify the sources of
    contamination, allowing officials to take action to prevent future outbreaks [103].
    5. Public Health Communication Public health officials use communication systems
    to disseminate information about health risks, promote healthy behaviors, and
    encourage the public to take action to protect their health [104]. These systems
    use various channels, such as social media, traditional media, and public service
    announcements, to reach a broad audience and provide information that is timely
    and relevant. Ultimately, public health monitoring and public safety applications
    are essential tools that help protect and improve the health and safety of individuals
    and communities. 2.4.4. Infrastructure Monitoring Infrastructure monitoring is
    an important aspect to ensure public safety. By monitoring infrastructure, such
    as bridges, roads, buildings, tunnels, pipelines, and other critical facilities,
    potential safety hazards can be detected early, and appropriate action can be
    taken to prevent accidents and minimize damage [105]. Every government must monitor
    and maintain a broad range of infrastructure, including bridges, tunnels, dams,
    parks, roads, cables, and pipes. IoT devices are utilized to efficiently monitor
    the public infrastructure equipped with sensors and RFID tags [106]; this contributes
    to a reduction of diurnal maintenance and inspection costs by utilizing the transportation
    traffic-rerouting strategies, for instance, management of parking facilities.
    Bridge safety monitoring Infrastructure monitoring systems can monitor bridges
    for structural damage, wear and tear, and other factors that can affect their
    safety [107]. This can help prevent accidents and ensure that bridges are safe
    for public use. 2. Building safety monitoring Infrastructure monitoring systems
    can also be used to monitor buildings for safety hazards such as gas leaks, fires,
    or structural damage [108]. This can help prevent accidents and ensure that buildings
    are safe for occupancy. 3. Road safety monitoring Infrastructure monitoring systems
    can monitor roads for potential hazards such as potholes, cracks, and other damage
    that can cause accidents. By detecting these hazards early, appropriate action
    can be taken to prevent accidents and ensure that roads are safe for public use
    [109]. 4. Natural disaster monitoring Infrastructure monitoring systems can also
    be used to monitor natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods.
    By detecting these events early, appropriate action can be taken to minimize damage
    and ensure public safety. In general, infrastructure monitoring plays an important
    role in ensuring public safety [110]. By detecting potential safety hazards early
    and taking appropriate action, infrastructure monitoring systems can help prevent
    accidents, minimize damage, and ensure that critical infrastructure is safe for
    public use. 5. Asset tracking Deploying IoT devices to track high-value assets
    such as vehicles, equipment, and cargo can help prevent theft and improve supply
    chain management [111]. Asset tracking has numerous public safety applications,
    comprising the following applications: 2.4.5. Tracking Emergency Response Vehicles
    Asset tracking can be used to monitor the location of emergency response vehicles
    such as ambulances, police cars, and fire trucks [112]. This can help dispatchers
    to send the nearest available vehicle to an emergency situation and enhance response
    times. Tracking Valuable Equipment Monitoring valuable equipment, such as firearms,
    radios, and body cameras [113], can help ensure that these items are always accounted
    for and not lost or stolen. The best way to track valuable equipment will depend
    on the specific needs of the organization. If accuracy is critical, then GPS tracking
    is the best option. If affordability is important, then RFID tracking or barcode
    scanning may be better options. 2. Tracking Prisoners Monitoring the location
    of prisoners who are on parole or probation can help ensure that they are complying
    with the terms of their release and not engaging in any criminal activity [114].
    3. Tracking Stolen Vehicles Monitoring the location of stolen vehicles can help
    law enforcement to quickly recover the stolen vehicle and apprehend the thief
    [115]. The best way to track a stolen vehicle will depend on the specific circumstances
    of the theft. If a vehicle has a built-in GPS tracker, it will be utilized to
    track the vehicle’s location. If the vehicle does not have a built-in GPS tracker,
    a GPS tracker can be purchased and installed in the vehicle. 4. Tracking Evidence
    Asset tracking can be used to monitor the location of evidence in criminal investigations.
    This can help ensure that the evidence is properly secured and not tampered with
    [116]. Ultimately, asset tracking can help public safety officials to better monitor
    and manage their resources, leading to improved response times, reduced losses,
    and better outcomes for the communities they serve. Ultimately, public safety
    IoT applications can help reduce crime, improve emergency response times, and
    enhance public safety and security. 2.5. Smart Water Management Nowadays, the
    demand for water continues rapidly as the population grows significantly. Since
    the last century, global water consumption is more than twice the rate of world
    population increase. The water usage is predicted to escalate 50% from 2007 to
    2025 in the emerging countries and 18% in the developed countries [117]. By 2025,
    two-thirds of the world’s population may face water shortages. A variety of enterprises
    depend on water for manufacturing and management. Absolutely, a large percentage
    of the wasted water due to the aging and leakage of the pipelines, for instance,
    according to the world bank, the annual global value of water produced and lost
    by utilities is close to $14 billion [118]. To overcome this problem, smart cities
    must be capable of monitoring the water supply to ensure the delivery of adequate
    water supply to the residential and commercial buildings (i.e., water saving systems).
    The smart cities are equipped-M2M sensors which could be used to remotely control
    and report any leakage in the pipelines. M2M sensors measure the flow of the water
    inside the pipes regularly, if an emergency triggered, the sensor transmits an
    alarming message to the M2M server to take the proper decision if the water leakage
    is beyond a normal range. 2.6. Smart Health Deploying technology, data analytics,
    and other advanced techniques to improve healthcare outcomes and make healthcare
    delivery more efficient, effective, and accessible. Smart health applications
    include wearable devices, remote monitoring tools, telemedicine platforms, electronic
    health records (EHRs), and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Remote Patient
    Monitoring, Telemedicine, Medication Management, Remote Surgery [119], and Asset
    Tracking [120]. The smart health care applications may be categorized into four
    major types: 2.6.1. Tracking and Monitoring Tracking is the function used to identify
    the moving patient (i.e., knowing the current position of the tracked person)
    [121]. For example, the tracking of the patients diagnosed with The Novel Corona
    Virus (COVID 19) pandemic and consequently those patients are subject to self-isolation
    [122]. For the government authorities to ensure that those patients are in self-isolating
    orders, they must be tracked using IoT sensors. In addition, to track the number
    of people interacting with the patient to contain the virus spreading. Regarding
    the monitoring, IoT smart health application allows the remote monitoring of the
    high-risk patients by attaching sensors [122]. These sensors send an alarm to
    the control center if the high-risk patient (who is vulnerable to fatal consequences
    due to critical conditions) has dangerous circumstances [123]. For example, if
    an elderly person falls or a diabetic person has hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
    2.6.2. Authentication and Identification Authentication and identification in
    smart health are needed in multiple forms. Accurate patient identification is
    crucial and critical to avoid the assignment of wrong medication in terms of (dosage,
    time, frequency, route, and procedure). Authentication is an important security
    issue, especially with devices attached to the human body, for instance, the pacemaker,
    which is a small device placed underneath the skin in the chest to regulate the
    heartbeats [124]. If a hacker has the ability to intervene in the operation of
    the pacemaker by increasing or decreasing the heart rate, it will result in a
    life-threatening issue. In addition, the real-time medical data record, privacy,
    and maintenance must be authenticated to avoid the leakage of the patient data
    and to ensure the patient’s privacy protection [125]. 2.6.3. Data Collection Automatic
    data collection is required to reduce the processing and treatment time required
    to implement a medical treatment plan. If a medical device is attached to human
    body to measure the blood glucose for a diabetic patient, if the blood glucose
    in high, so sensor has to send the data automatically to the patient’s physician
    (in the control center) to order the medication promptly. After that, physician
    sends the order back to the attached device to inject the enough insulin to consume
    the excessive glucose in the blood stream [126]. The previous situation is vital
    and represents instantaneous data collection and decision making. The energy consumption
    may be reported once at a time. The M2M applications may be delivered or reported
    in many ways: Periodic reporting On demand reporting Scheduled reporting Event-driven
    reporting 2.7. Smart Government Smart government utilizes technology and data
    to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of government services, improve citizen
    engagement, and promote transparency and accountability. This approach involves
    the integration of various technologies, such as big data, artificial intelligence,
    the IoT, and blockchain, to create a more responsive and proactive government
    that delivers better outcomes for citizens. Smart government initiatives can encompass
    a range of areas, including public safety, transportation, healthcare, education,
    and environmental sustainability [78]. For instance, governments can use big data
    and AI to analyze crime patterns and predict criminal activity, improve traffic
    flow and reduce congestion through the use of smart transportation systems, or
    use IoT sensors to monitor air and water quality in real time. Smart government
    can also promote citizen engagement and participation through the use of digital
    platforms and tools that enable citizens to access government services and information,
    provide feedback, and participate in decision-making processes. This can lead
    to a more transparent and accountable government that is more responsive to the
    needs of its citizens. Overall, smart government initiatives have the potential
    to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government services, enhance citizen
    engagement and participation, and promote transparency and accountability in government
    [127]. 2.8. Smart Building We are living in an environment surrounded by many
    electric and electronic appliances, for instance, television sets, microwaves,
    refrigerators, dishwashing machines, air conditioners, etc. To remotely control
    and monitor these devices, IoT sensors and actuators will be installed to efficiently
    utilize the energy consumed by these appliances. Heating and cooling might be
    adjusted using the IoT sensor depending on the current meteorological conditions
    to sustain the desired temperature [128]. The lighting may be adjusted based on
    the number of people occupying the room utilizing the motion sensor. The street
    lighting may be adjusted by utilizing the light sensors to save energy consumption.
    The motion outside the property will be detected using motion sensors which can
    be utilized to detect any burglary activity [128]. The electric appliances could
    be automatically switched off in case of inactivity mode (i.e., idle mode) to
    reduce energy consumption especially in the prime time. At the prime time, IoT
    sensors will contribute to the money saving due to the high price of the electricity
    during this time. On the other hand, the price at other times will be much cheaper
    than the price the prime time [129]. On the consumer side, the customers may sell
    the electricity during the rush hour and buy it or consume it during the non-rush
    hour time.2.9. Smart Manufacturing Smart manufacturing is the integration of advanced
    technologies, such as the IoT, AI, machine learning, robotics, and big data, into
    industrial processes to optimize efficiency, productivity, and flexibility [130].

    and enhance product quality [132]. 2.8.1. Predictive Maintenance Predictive maintenance
    (PdM) is a maintenance strategy that uses data analysis to predict when equipment
    is likely to fail. This allows maintenance to be scheduled proactively before
    a failure occurs. PdM can be a valuable tool for smart manufacturing, as it can
    help to improve uptime, reduce costs, and increase reliability. Employing sensors
    and AI are used to predict when equipment will fail and contribute to preventing
    costly downtime [133]. 2.8.2. Digital Twins Creating virtual models of physical
    assets helps optimize performance and reduce maintenance costs [134]. Overall,
    smart industry represents a major shift in the way businesses approach industrial
    production and has the potential to transform entire industries. 2.8.3. Industrial
    Internet of Things (IIoT) Connecting machines, sensors, and devices throughout
    the manufacturing process to collect and share data in real time enables better
    monitoring, predictive maintenance, and process optimization [135]. 2.8.4. Big
    Data Analytics Big data analytics is a powerful tool that can be used to improve
    a variety of processes in smart manufacturing. It is still important to have a
    good understanding of the manufacturing process and to use big data analytics
    in conjunction with other tools and techniques. Utilizing large volumes of data
    collected from various manufacturing processes helps gain insights, identify patterns,
    and make data-driven decisions [136]. 2.9. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) UAV is
    a type of aircraft that is operated remotely without a human pilot on board. UAVs
    can be either controlled by a human operator on the ground or can be programmed
    to operate autonomously. They are commonly used for military, commercial, scientific,
    and recreational purposes and have become increasingly popular in recent years
    due to advances in technology and lower costs. UAVs equipped with IoT sensors
    can collect and transmit data in real time, enabling a variety of use cases across
    multiple industries [137]. 2.9.1. Agriculture UAVs equipped with sensors can be

    accuracy, efficiency, and safety. 5. Irrigation Management: UAVs can be used to
    monitor the effectiveness of irrigation systems. They can capture images of fields
    before and after irrigation, which can be used to determine the optimal amount
    of water to apply [144]. By using these systems, it will help to conserve water
    resources, which can be used in parallel with the smart water systems. Using such
    systems will contribute to high-quality crops. 2.9.2. Disaster Response UAVs equipped
    with sensors can be used to assess damage and locate survivors in disaster zones,
    providing valuable information to first responders and enabling them to respond
    more effectively [145]. UAVs have become a valuable tool for disaster response
    and management due to their ability to quickly gather data, assess damage, deliver
    supplies to hard-to-reach areas, and deliver aid to those in need. Search and
    Rescue: UAVs equipped with thermal imaging cameras and other sensors can help
    search and rescue teams locate survivors in disaster zones, even in low-light
    or low-visibility conditions such as after a hurricane [146]. By determining the
    survivors’ locations, it will give the exact information to the first responder
    teams who provide nutrition and medication resources. 2. Disaster Mapping and
    Assessment: UAVs equipped with high-resolution cameras and LiDAR sensors can quickly
    and accurately map disaster areas, helping authorities assess the extent of damage
    and plan response efforts [147]. Additionally, UAVs can be used to create detailed

    conditions. These maps can help authorities prioritize response efforts and allocate
    resources more efficiently [148]. 3. Delivery of Aid and Supplies: UAVs could
    be utilized to deliver emergency supplies to inaccessible areas, such as medical
    supplies, food, and water [148,149]. UAVs are used to deliver aid to people in
    need. They offer a number of advantages over traditional methods, such as land
    vehicles and helicopters. 4. Communication Support: UAVs can be equipped with
    cellular repeaters and other communication devices to provide temporary connectivity
    in disaster zones where communication infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed
    [150]. 2.9.3. Infrastructure Inspection UAVs equipped with sensors can be used
    to inspect infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and power lines, identifying
    potential problems and enabling maintenance teams to respond quickly [151]. UAVs
    have a wide range of applications in infrastructure inspection [152] due to their
    ability to provide high-resolution imagery and data and ability to access hard-to-reach
    areas safely and efficiently [151]. Eventually, the use of UAVs in infrastructure
    inspection will allow for more effective and accurate maintenance and repair decisions.
    Bridge inspections: UAVs can fly underneath and alongside bridges to capture high-resolution
    images and video of their structural components, such as joints, beams, and cables.
    This helps identify any damage or wear and tear and helps prioritize repairs at
    certain and specific points of damage at bridges [153,154]. 2. Power line inspections:
    UAVs can fly along power lines to inspect them for damage or vegetation growth
    that could cause power outages. The UAVs can capture high-resolution images and
    video of the power lines and also use thermal imaging to detect hotspots and potential
    faults [155]. However, there are also some challenges associated with using UAVs
    to inspect power lines: government regulations, technology, reliability, and cost.
    3. Wind turbine inspections: UAVs can fly close to wind turbines to inspect their
    blades and towers for damage. This helps identify any wear and tear, erosion,
    or cracks, which could cause potential malfunctions, resulting in multiple problems
    in the distribution networks [156]. 4. Roof inspections: UAVs can inspect roofs
    for damage, such as missing shingles, cracks, or leaks. They can also capture
    images of the roof’s overall condition and identify potential areas of weakness
    [157]. The problems resulting from roof damage are time sensitive and require
    quick decision making. For an effective decision, a big data-based AI algorithm
    may be utilized to provide these decisions. 2.9.4. Delivery Services UAVs equipped

    areas. This can provide faster and more efficient delivery services, especially
    in areas with limited transportation infrastructure [158]. Delivery services are
    increasingly turning to UAVs as methods of delivering goods quickly and efficiently.
    Overall, UAVs have the potential to revolutionize the delivery industry by providing
    a faster, more efficient, and cost-effective means of delivering goods. However,
    the technology is still relatively new and there are many regulatory and technical
    challenges that need to be addressed before UAVs can be widely used for delivery
    services [159]. Implementing UAV IoT applications requires a combination of technologies,
    such as sensors, communication systems, and data analytics. However, the potential
    benefits of UAV IoT applications, including improved efficiency, reduced costs,
    and increased safety, can have a significant impact on multiple industries. Last-mile
    delivery: UAVs can be used to deliver packages to customers’ doorsteps [160] or
    other inaccessible locations in the last mile of the delivery process, reducing
    the time and cost of delivery [161]. UAVs offer a number of advantages over traditional

    Monitoring Robots equipped with sensors can monitor air and water quality, noise
    levels, and other environmental factors to provide real-time data for pollution
    control [171]. Environmental monitoring robotics is a rapidly growing field. As
    technology continues to develop, robots will become increasingly capable of collecting
    data and monitoring the environment in ways that were not possible before. This
    data can be used to improve our understanding of the environment and to develop
    better ways to protect it. 2.10.5. Agriculture and Urban Farming In smart cities,
    rooftop gardens and vertical farms are becoming more popular. Robots can be used
    to automate planting, watering, and harvesting, ensuring sustainable and efficient
    food production. Robots can monitor crops and soil conditions. The sensors can
    measure factors such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and nutrient levels,
    which can be used to optimize crop growth and reduce water and fertilizer usage
    [172]. 2.10.6. Healthcare Assistance Robotics can assist in healthcare applications,
    such as delivering medications and supplies in hospitals or supporting elderly
    and disabled citizens with daily tasks in smart homes. Robotics IoT applications
    in healthcare include robotic assistants for surgery, patient monitoring, and
    medication management. These robots can be equipped with sensors to monitor vital
    signs and provide real-time feedback to healthcare professionals [173]. 2.10.7.
    Disaster Response In the event of natural disasters or emergencies, robots can
    be deployed for search and rescue operations, providing critical assistance to
    first responders, and minimizing human risk [174]. Despite the challenges, disaster
    response robotics is a promising field with the potential to save lives and improve
    the efficiency of disaster response. As technology continues to develop, robots
    are likely to play an increasingly important role in disaster response. 2.10.8.
    Education and Entertainment Robots can be used in educational settings, offering
    interactive learning experiences. Additionally, they can be utilized in public
    spaces for entertainment purposes, like interactive art installations or robot-guided
    tours [175]. Educational and entertainment robots are becoming increasingly popular.
    They offer a fun and interactive way to learn about STEM concepts and to experience
    the latest in robotics technology. 2.10.9. Tourism In smart cities, robots can
    act as tour guides, providing information about landmarks, historical sites, and
    tourist attractions [176]. Robotics is still a relatively new technology in the
    tourism industry, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way that tourists
    interact with destinations. Robots can provide a more personalized and engaging
    experience for tourists, and they can also help to reduce costs for businesses.
    2.10.10. Smart Home Assistants Domestic robots can help residents in their homes
    by performing household routines, managing appliances, and providing reminders
    and assistance to the elderly and disabled [177].The benefits of using smart home
    assistants and robotics in the home may comprise the following: convenience, security,
    and entertainment. However, there are also some potential drawbacks to using smart
    home assistants and robotics in the home: privacy, security, and cost. 3. Smart
    City Communication Systems Due to the massive volume of sensors and their data,
    robust connectivity technology is a prerequisite for success coverage and reliability
    across the entire city is the key to launching any successful smart city [3,88].
    Because cabling a massive number of sensors and smart IoT devices is cost prohibitive,
    wireless technology is the key and sole viable solution to the deployment of IoT
    networks across the city [88]. There is an emerging consensus that current fourth
    generation (4G) long term evolution (LTE) and current 5G are the key technological
    candidates that can provide the required global IoT connectivity to such a staggering
    number of “things” in a city [3,5,12]. Cellular-based machine-to-machine (M2M)
    communications is one of the key IoT-enabling technologies with huge market potential
    for cellular service providers deploying LTE networks [178]. 4G and/or 5G cellular
    technologies can support a wide range of current and future smart city applications
    and services including video surveillance for public safety, intersection safety
    analytics (pedestrian safety), traffic management, traffic light controls, digital
    signage systems, EV charging, public Wi-Fi and much more [3,5,12,179]. Smart city
    IoT applications span a wide range-of-use cases ranging from mission-critical
    applications (e.g., traffic control, emergency response, video surveillance, and
    connected vehicles), which require ultra-reliability and ultra-low latency, to
    those that require support of a massive number of connected M2M devices with relaxed
    latency and reliability requirements (e.g., smart meters) [3,14]. There are numerous
    current competing solutions that can support network connectivity for such a wide
    range of IoT applications [3]. These solutions span a wide range-of-use cases
    ranging from relatively low cost and easily deployable solutions for basic services
    to the most expensive, high-performance systems suitable for the most demanding
    requirements [14]. Most massive scale deployment of IoT applications, however,
    requires low-cost devices that communicate infrequently, with a low data rate
    and low energy consumption so that they can deliver an extremely long ten-year
    battery life as well as good coverage [3]. This is where low-power wide area networks
    (LPWAN) technology is needed. LTE-M (LTE for machines) and narrowband IoT (NB-IoT)
    are the first cellular-based LPWAN technologies standard supporting massive IoT
    applications [180]. These simpler and lower cost cellular LPWA technologies support
    longer battery life (up to 10 years) and better coverage (for IoT devices underground
    and deep inside buildings) compared to traditional M2M-IoT cellular connectivity
    options. Though LPWAN technologies have clear advantages over traditional IoT
    cellular connectivity options, they are only suited to meet very basic data requirements
    for IoT applications with limited/modest data needs and relaxed latency (in the
    order of few seconds) [3,181]. They are ideally suited for IoT applications, which
    require just extended coverage, but reliability, latency, and availability might
    be more or less important [181] as shown in Table 1. Table 1. Summary of Communication
    technologies support in the Smart City. 3.1. Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs)
    LPWAN technologies are a group of wireless technologies that are designed to provide
    long-range, low-power connectivity for IoT devices. LPWAN technologies are ideal
    for applications where battery life [3] is critical, such as smart metering, asset
    tracking, and environmental monitoring. Here are some of the most popular LPWAN
    technologies: 3.1.1. LORAWAN LORAWAN (long range WAN) is a widely adopted LPWAN
    technology that enables long-range communication at low data rates [182]. It operates
    in unlicensed frequency bands, making it available for public use without the
    need for expensive licenses. 3.1.2. NB-IoT (Narrowband IoT) NB-IoT is a cellular
    LPWAN technology standardized by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).
    It operates within existing cellular networks, providing deep coverage and compatibility
    with cellular infrastructure [3]. 3.1.3. LTE-M (Long Term Evolution for Machines)
    LTE-M is another 3GPP standardized LPWAN technology designed to operate within
    the LTE network infrastructure. It offers higher data rates compared to NB-IoT
    and is suitable for applications that require more bandwidth [3,183]. LPWANs are
    commonly used in various IoT applications, such as smart city solutions, industrial
    monitoring, agriculture, environmental monitoring, asset tracking, and more. Their
    low power consumption allows IoT devices to operate on battery power for several
    years, reducing maintenance efforts and overall costs [3,184]. 3.2. Fourth Generation
    (4G) 4G LTE stands for fourth generation long term evolution. It is the fourth
    generation of cellular network technology, succeeding 3G and preceding 5G [3,185].
    4G LTE networks offer significantly faster data speeds than 3G networks, with
    theoretical download speeds of up to 100 Mbps and upload speeds of up to 50 Mbps
    [186]. In practice, actual speeds will vary depending on a number of factors,
    including the carrier, the device, and the location. 4G LTE is the most widely
    deployed 4G technology in the world. It is supported by all major carriers in
    the United States, as well as many carriers in other countries. 4G LTE is also
    the technology used by most smartphones and tablets [3,187]. Here are some of
    the 4G LTE features: 3.2.1. Faster Data Speeds 4G LTE offers significantly faster
    data speeds than 3G networks. This means that you can download files, stream videos,
    and browse the web much faster [3,7]. 3.2.2. Improved Reliability 4G LTE networks
    are more reliable than 3G networks. This means that you are less likely to experience
    dropped calls or slow data speeds [7,12]. 3.2.3. Increased Capacity 4G LTE networks
    have a higher capacity than 3G networks. This means that they can support more
    devices and more data traffic [3,12,14]. 3.2.4. Use Cases of 4G LTE Video streaming:
    4G LTE is well-suited for video streaming, as it can deliver high-quality video
    without buffering. This makes it possible to watch movies and TV shows on mobile
    devices without any problems [3,148]. VoLTE (Voice over LTE): VoLTE is a technology
    that allows users to make and receive calls over a 4G LTE network. This provides
    better voice quality and lower latency than traditional cellular networks [3].
    Mobile gaming: 4G LTE is ideal for mobile gaming, as it can provide the fast data
    speeds and low latency that are required for smooth gameplay [185]. IoT (Internet
    of Things): 4G LTE is used to connect a wide variety of IoT devices, such as smart
    home devices, wearables, and industrial sensors. This allows these devices to
    communicate with each other and with the cloud [25]. 3.3. Fifth Generation (5G)
    5G is the fifth generation of cellular network technology. It is designed to offer
    significantly faster speeds, lower latency, and greater capacity than previous
    generations of cellular networks. 5G is still in its early stages of development,
    but it is expected to be widely deployed in the coming years [13,115,188]. As
    5G networks become more widespread, we can expect to see a wide range of new and
    innovative applications and services that will change the way we live and work.
    Here are some of the benefits of 5G: 3.3.1. Faster Speeds 5G can offer download
    speeds up to 10 Gbps, which is 100 times faster than 4G. This will allow users
    to download large files in seconds, stream high-definition videos without buffering,
    and play online games with minimal lag [13]. 3.3.2. Lower Latency 5G has a latency
    of just a few milliseconds, which is much lower than 4G [189]. This means that
    5G is ideal for applications that require real-time communication, such as self-driving
    cars and remote surgery [3,190]. 3.3.3. Greater Capacity 5G can support a much
    greater number of devices than 4G. This indicates that 5G networks will be able
    to handle the increasing number of connected devices that are being used today
    in multiple applications and services [3]. 5G cellular system will support the
    following services enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communications
    (mMTC), and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). eMBB will enable
    the following applications: hotspot wide-area coverage with high capacity, enhanced
    connectivity, and high mobility. In the hotspot scenario (e.g., soccer game),
    serving a massive number of users requires low mobility and high traffic capacity.
    For the bus scenario, high mobility and a lower capacity than the hotspot are
    needed. mMTC is distinguished by a plethora of devices which transmit low volume
    data with less sensitivity to delay. URLLC has rigorous requirements for high
    throughput and low latency (e.g., remote medical surgery and driverless vehicles)
    [3,13], as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. 5G Services. URLLC services in 5G are
    fundamentally considered as IoT applications that must gather short packets (few
    bytes) from small sensors or robots with an uplink over the air latency of less
    than 1 ms. High reliability is described by the third generation partnership project
    (3GPP) for such IoT services as reaching a percentage of properly delivered packets
    within the application time limit constraints of 99.999 percent, depending on
    the application [188]. The phenomenal insurrection of the original internet of
    things (IoT) as a driver of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. On the other
    hand, internet of everything (IoE) refers to a larger idea of connectivity in
    which network communication serves as the IoT’s foundation. Wireless applications,
    such as fully autonomous cars, flying vehicles, drones, wireless brain computer
    interface (WBCI), and enhanced extended reality (XR) apps, will be part of the
    Internet of Everything. Augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and virtual
    reality (VR) are all examples of XR applications (VR) [188]. These new applications
    will have highly strict quality of service (QoS) requirements (for example, reliability
    and latency) and will blur the borders between 5G URLLC and eMBB services [13].
    Despite the fact that 5G may be able to meet the QoS requirements of basic XR
    services or autonomous robotics, it will be unable to meet the QoS requirements
    of higher data rates (e.g., greater than 100 Gbps) for ultimate VR class of service
    (CoS) latency (e.g., 1 ms for wireless brain computer interface) and high reliability
    (near zero packet loss ratio (PLR) at low latency and extreme high reliability)
    [191]. There is no need to design a distinct sixth generation (6G) cellular technology
    to address the challenges of developing IoE applications. Traditionally, The architecture
    is tailored to the requirements of highly reliable, low latency, and high data
    rate services. 6G will be the outcome of classic communication technology developments
    (such as high data rates and massive antennas) combined with existing services
    and technological advancements such as new wireless devices (e.g., body implants,
    and XR equipment, etc.). The path to 6G must be able to overcome some of the 5G
    restrictions revealed in primary systems [188], as illustrated in Figure 4. Figure
    4. 5G Limitations. 3.4. Sixth Generation The sixth generation (6G) of wireless
    communication refers to the next generation of mobile network technology that
    will follow the current 5G technology. 6G is expected to bring significant improvements
    in terms of data transfer rates, latency, reliability, and efficiency, as well
    as support for new applications and use cases. Some of the key features and capabilities
    that are expected to be part of 6G include the terahertz (THz) frequency band;
    6G is expected to operate in the THz frequency band, which could enable much higher
    data transfer rates than the current 5G technology. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
    integration: 6G is expected to leverage AI to enhance network management, optimize
    network resources, and provide better user experiences [13]. Quantum communications:
    6G could use quantum communication technologies to provide highly secure communication
    channels that are immune to eavesdropping. Ubiquitous connectivity: 6G is expected
    to enable seamless connectivity across a wide range of devices, including wearables,
    vehicles, drones, and smart home appliances. Holographic communication: 6G could
    enable holographic communication, allowing users to interact with virtual objects
    and environments in real-time. Enhanced mobile edge computing: 6G is expected
    to support the processing of data at the network edge, enabling low-latency, high-bandwidth
    applications such as virtual reality and augmented reality [13]. While 6G technology
    is still in the early stages of development, research is already underway to explore
    and develop some of these capabilities. It is expected to be commercially available
    sometime in the 2030s [192]. 4. Examples of Smart Cities There are many smart
    cities around the world [193] that are implementing advanced technologies to improve
    the Quality of lives of their citizens, increase sustainability, and enhance the
    efficiency of city. To develop smart cities, there are There are open-ended three
    phases defined as Smart City 1.0, Smart City 2.0, and Smart City 3.0 [194], and
    Smart City 4.0 [195] inspired by economics. 4.1. Smart City 1.0 Smart city 1.0
    sets the foundation for the development of smarter and more sustainable cities.
    However, there is still much work to be done in terms of addressing the challenges
    facing urban areas, such as inequality, environmental degradation, and social
    exclusion. As such, the focus of smart city development has shifted towards more
    holistic and inclusive approaches in recent years. Smart city 1.0 refers to intelligent
    cities in the earliest phase of creation [196]. The utilization of modern technologies
    is initiated by ICT companies [197]. These companies implement various solutions
    regardless of whether they are essential for the cities or not. 4.2. Smart City
    2.0 Smart city 2.0 refers to the second phase of smart city development, which
    is characterized by a more holistic and citizen-centric approach. This phase emphasizes
    the use of technology to enhance quality of life, promote sustainability, and
    foster social inclusion in urban areas. In this phase, the development of smart
    cities with a predominant role for public administration. The use of modern technologies
    is initiated by local authorities, and the introduction of new solutions which
    is aimed at improving the citizens’ quality of life [198]. During Smart City 2.0,
    cities are focusing on creating more collaborative models of governance, which
    involve citizens and stakeholders in decision-making processes. This includes
    the use of digital platforms and social media to engage with citizens, as well
    as the establishment of innovation labs and spaces [199]. 4.3. Smart City 3.0
    Smart city 3.0 is the third phase of smart city development, which is characterized
    by a focus on innovation, resilience, and adaptability in the face of emerging
    challenges and opportunities. During Smart City 3.0, cities are leveraging emerging
    technologies, such as blockchain, the IoT, and autonomous systems, to create more
    resilient and adaptive urban environments [200]. This includes the use of smart
    infrastructure systems, such as self-healing power grids and automated water management
    systems, to enhance the reliability and resilience of critical urban services.
    Another key feature of Smart City 3.0 is the use of innovation ecosystems and
    digital innovation hubs to foster innovation and entrepreneurship in urban areas.
    This includes the establishment of co-working spaces, incubators, and accelerators
    to support startups and small businesses, as well as the integration of universities
    and research institutions into the urban innovation ecosystem [201]. 4.4. Smart
    City 4.0 Smart city 4.0 is a theoretical concept that refers to the next phase
    of smart city development beyond smart city 3.0. While Smart City 4.0 is not yet
    fully defined, it is expected to build on the foundations of previous phases and
    further integrate emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, 5G networks,
    and edge computing, to create even more intelligent, responsive, and interconnected
    urban environments [202]. It is likely to focus on creating highly personalized
    and immersive experiences for citizens and visitors, through the use of virtual
    reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies, and the development of smart
    spaces that adapt to individual needs and preferences. It is also expected to
    involve greater collaboration between cities and private sector partners, as well
    as more decentralized and distributed models of governance [203]. 4.5. Global

    the Red Sea coast provides opportunities for trade, logistics, and tourism. It
    aims to connect Asia, Europe, and Africa through its strategic position, enabling
    the development of a thriving economic zone [220]. It is important to note that
    NEOM is still in the development stage, and many aspects of the project are yet
    to be fully realized. As the project progresses, it will be essential to assess
    its implementation, sustainability efforts, economic impact, and the overall achievement
    of its goals. 4.5.8. New Administrative Capital One example of a smart city in
    Egypt is the new administrative capital (NAC), which is currently under construction.
    The NAC is being built to alleviate the population and traffic congestion in Cairo
    and to serve as a model for future sustainable and smart cities in Egypt [235].
    The NAC is planned to be a fully integrated smart city, using advanced technologies
    to enhance the quality of life for its residents [236]. Intelligent traffic management:
    the city will use sensors and cameras to monitor traffic flow and adjust traffic
    lights in real time to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion [206,214,235].
    Renewable energy: the city is being designed to run on clean and renewable energy,
    with solar panels and wind turbines being installed throughout the city [215,235].
    Smart buildings: the buildings in the NAC will be equipped with energy-efficient
    systems, smart lighting, and automated temperature control [228,235]. Smart waste
    management: the city will use sensors to monitor waste levels in bins and optimize
    collection schedules, reducing the amount of waste that goes to landfills [25,235].
    Integrated public transportation: the NAC will have an integrated public transportation
    system, including buses, trams, and a metro line, with smart ticketing and real-time

    Metrics Assessing smart city performance requires evaluating various aspects of
    the city’s implementation of smart technologies and their impact on the quality
    of life, sustainability, and efficiency forecast in 2025 [237,238]. As depicted
    in Figure 5, the evaluation metrics may include: Figure 5. Smart City Evaluation
    Metrics. Infrastructure Evaluate the quality and coverage of the city’s digital
    infrastructure, such as broadband connectivity, sensors, data centers, and communication
    networks. A robust infrastructure is essential for supporting smart city services
    [237,238]. As illustrated in Table 2, all of these cities have made significant
    investments in smart infrastructure. They have all implemented modern transportation
    systems, switched to renewable energy sources, and developed innovative waste
    management and water treatment systems. They have also made significant investments
    in healthcare, education, and security. Table 2. Infrastructure Metric [191].
    It is difficult to say which city has the best infrastructure, as they all have
    their own strengths and weaknesses. However, Singapore [239], Barcelona [193],
    Amsterdam [212], Copenhagen [217], and Tokyo are all leading the way in terms
    of smart city development. NEOM [231] and the NAC [236] are also promising new
    developments, but they are still under construction. Overall, these eight cities
    are setting the standard for smart city infrastructure in 2025. They are all investing
    in technologies that will help them become more sustainable, efficient, and livable
    [240,241]. 2. Governance and Policy Examine the city’s governance structure and
    policies related to smart city development. Assess the level of collaboration
    between different stakeholders, including government agencies, private sector
    partners, and the public. Search for evidence of effective planning, coordination,
    and regulation of smart programs [237,238]. As depicted in Table 3, there is no
    one-size-fits-all approach to smart city governance and policy. Each city has
    its own unique set of challenges and opportunities, and its government must tailor
    its approach accordingly [230]. Table 3. Government and Policy Metric [214]. Another
    common theme is the focus on sustainability [213,214]. Many smart cities are using
    technology to reduce their environmental impact [225]. For example, they are using
    smart transportation systems [214] to reduce traffic congestion and pollution,
    and they are using smart water systems to conserve water [225]. Overall, the governance
    and policy frameworks of these smart cities are well-established and ambitious
    [230]. These cities are all working to develop and implement policies that will
    support their smart city visions. However, there is still some work to be done
    in terms of data sharing and cybersecurity [211]. 3. Energy Efficiency Assess
    the city’s efforts to optimize energy consumption through smart grids, smart buildings,
    and energy management systems. Look for proposals that reduce energy waste, promote
    renewable energy sources, and improve overall energy efficiency [237,238]. The
    energy efficiency score is a measure of how efficiently a city uses energy by
    2025. It is calculated by considering factors such as the city’s energy consumption,
    its renewable energy production, and its energy efficiency policies [215]. As
    shown in Table 4, Singapore [239] has the highest energy efficiency score, followed
    by Barcelona and Amsterdam [212]. These cities are all leading the way in terms
    of sustainable urban development. They have implemented a number of policies and
    initiatives to reduce their energy consumption and increase their reliance on
    renewable energy [215]. Table 4. Energy Efficiency Metric [199]. Dubai and NEOM
    are also making significant progress in terms of energy efficiency. These cities
    are investing heavily in renewable energy projects and are developing new technologies
    to improve energy efficiency [215,231]. The new administrative city in Egypt is
    still in its early stages of development, but it has ambitious plans to become
    a sustainable city. The city is targeting an energy efficiency score of 70 by
    2030 [236]. Overall, the energy efficiency of smart cities is improving. These
    cities are leading the way in terms of sustainable urban development and are setting
    an example for other cities around the world [242]. 4. Mobility and Transportation
    Evaluate the city’s transportation infrastructure, including smart traffic management
    systems, public transportation networks, and integration of emerging technologies
    like electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles, as illustrated in Table 5. Propose
    smart solutions to reduce traffic congestion, promote sustainable transportation
    alternatives, and improve mobility for residents [237,238]. Table 5. Mobility
    and Transportation Metric [198]. Overall, these cities are all making great strides
    in smart mobility [214]. They are investing in a variety of projects, such as
    autonomous vehicles, shared mobility, and sustainable transportation. These investments
    are helping to make these cities more livable and sustainable [225]. 5. Environment
    and Sustainability Assess the city’s initiatives aimed at preserving the environment
    and promoting sustainability. Look for programs that focus on waste management,
    air quality monitoring, water conservation, green spaces, and the utilization
    of renewable energy sources. Consider the city’s overall carbon footprint and
    its efforts to mitigate climate change [237,238]. As illustrated in Table 6, all
    of the cities have made significant progress in terms of environmental sustainability.
    However, there are some clear leaders, such as Singapore, Copenhagen, and Amsterdam.
    These cities have achieved high scores in all categories, and they are well-positioned
    to continue their progress in the years to come [78,218]. Table 6. Environment
    and Sustainability Metric [208]. 6. Public Services and Civic Engagement Evaluate
    the availability and accessibility of digital services provided to residents,
    such as e-governance platforms, online service delivery, and citizen engagement
    tools as depicted in Table 7. Taking into consideration the city’s efforts to
    involve the public in decision-making processes and the extent to which technology
    enhances civic participation and responsiveness [237,238]. Table 7. Public Service
    and Civic Engagement [195]. Overall, these cities are all making significant progress
    in terms of public services and civic engagement [240]. They are using technology
    to improve the lives of citizens, and they are also encouraging citizens to get
    involved in local decision-making. These cities are setting a good example for
    other cities around the world, and they are showing how technology can be used
    to create more livable and sustainable cities. 7. Data Management and Privacy
    As shown in Table 8, examine how the smart city collects, stores, and analyzes
    massive data generated by smart technologies. Assess the level of data security
    and privacy protection measures in place, as well as transparency in data usage
    and consent mechanisms [211,237,238]. Table 8. Data Management and Privacy [196].
    Data Management High: Cities with strong data management practices have clear
    policies and procedures for collecting, storing, and using data. They also have
    robust security measures in place to protect data from unauthorized access or
    disclosure. Medium: Cities with medium-level data management practices have some
    policies and procedures in place, but they may not be as comprehensive or well-enforced
    as in high-level cities. They may also have some security measures in place, but
    they may not be as robust as in high-level cities. Low: Cities with low-level
    data management practices have few or no policies and procedures in place for
    collecting, storing, and using data. They may also have very few security measures
    in place. Privacy High: Cities with high levels of privacy protection have strong
    laws and regulations that protect the privacy of citizens. They also have transparent
    data collection and use practices, and they give citizens the ability to control
    their personal data. Medium: Cities with medium levels of privacy protection have
    some laws and regulations in place, but they may not be as comprehensive or well-enforced
    as in high-level cities. They may also have some transparent data collection and
    use practices, but they may not give citizens as much control over their personal
    data. Low: Cities with low levels of privacy protection have few or no laws and
    regulations in place to protect the privacy of citizens. They may also have opaque
    data collection and use practices, and they may not give citizens any control
    over their personal data. 8. Quality of Life (QoL) Assess the overall impact of
    smart city initiatives on the quality of life for residents. Consider factors
    such as improved access to healthcare, education, safety, public amenities, and
    cultural opportunities [234] as it Table 9. Evaluate the level of inclusion and
    equity in the implementation of smart technologies to ensure that benefits are
    accessible to all sectors of the population [237,238]. The QoL score is based
    on a number of factors, including: Table 9. Quality of Life (QoL) Metric [218].
    Economy: the city’s GDP per capita, unemployment rate, and job growth rate [225].
    Healthcare: the quality of the city’s healthcare system, life expectancy, and
    infant mortality rate [123]. Education: the quality of the city’s schools, universities,
    and adult education programs [175]. Environment: the city’s air quality, water
    quality, and green space [230]. Safety: the city’s crime rate, traffic accident
    rate, and fire rate [212]. Culture: the city’s museums, art galleries, theaters,
    and other cultural attractions [175,218]. Leisure: the city’s parks, sports facilities,
    and other recreational opportunities [175,218]. Transportation: the city’s public
    transportation system, roads, and airports [214]. 9. Economic Development Evaluate
    the impact of smart city initiatives on economic growth, job creation, and innovation.
    Look for evidence of attracting investment, supporting local businesses, fostering
    entrepreneurship, and creating a favorable environment for technology startups
    [237,238]. As depicted in Table 10, Singapore [239] has the highest GDP per capita
    of all the cities listed. NEOM has a 0% growth rate, while NAC has a negative
    growth rate. It is important to note that GDP growth rate is not the only factor
    that contributes to economic development. Other factors such as unemployment rate,
    inflation rate, and QoL also play a role [200]. Table 10. Economic Development
    Metric [200]. Overall, the economic development of the smart cities listed above
    is promising. These cities are all working to improve their infrastructure and
    to become more attractive to foreign investment. As a result, they have the potential
    to become major economic hubs in the years to come [200]. Consider whether the
    city has established appropriate metrics and indicators to measure the performance
    and effectiveness of smart city initiatives [237]. Assess the availability of
    data-driven feedback loops that allow continuous monitoring, evaluation, and iterative
    improvement of smart city projects [238]. It is important to note that assessing
    smart city performance is a complex task, and the evaluation criteria may vary
    depending on the specific goals, context, and priorities of each city [243]. 5.2.

    multiple stakeholders, such as government agencies, businesses, and citizens.
    It can be difficult to coordinate these stakeholders and ensure that they are
    working together towards a common goal [246]. 5.3.6. Public Acceptance Smart city
    projects need to be accepted by the public in order to be successful. If people
    do not trust or understand technology, they may be reluctant to participate [243].
    Despite these challenges, there are a number of cities that are making progress
    in implementing smart city solutions. These cities are finding ways to overcome
    the challenges and gain the benefits of smart city technologies. 5.4. Recommendations
    Here are some of the ways that cities are overcoming the challenges of implementing
    smart cities: 5.4.1. Finding New Sources of Funding Cities are finding new ways
    to fund smart city projects, such as through public-private partnerships, impact
    investing, and crowdfunding. 5.4.2. Building New Infrastructure Cities are investing
    in new infrastructure, such as smart grids, fiber optic networks, and sensor networks.
    5.4.3. Protecting Data Privacy Cities are developing new data privacy and security
    policies to protect the personal data of their citizens. 5.4.4. Securing Smart
    City Technologies Cities are using security measures, such as encryption and firewalls,
    to protect smart city technologies from cyberattacks. 5.4.5. Building Consensus
    Cities are working to build consensus among stakeholders and the public on the
    benefits of smart city technologies. The challenges of implementing smart cities
    are significant, but they are not insurmountable. With careful planning and execution,
    cities can overcome these challenges and reap the benefits of smart city technologies.
    6. Conclusions In conclusion, this paper has provided a comprehensive review of
    global models of smart cities and explored the potential applications of the Internet
    of Things (IoT) in shaping the cities of the future. The analysis of various smart
    city initiatives from around the world has revealed common themes and key components
    that contribute to their success. These models encompass a holistic approach that
    integrates technology, governance, and citizen engagement to create sustainable,
    efficient, and livable urban environments. Through the examination of different
    IoT applications in smart cities, it has become evident that the deployment of
    connected devices and sensors has the potential to revolutionize urban systems
    and services. From transportation and energy management to healthcare and waste
    management, IoT technologies offer innovative solutions to address the complex
    challenges faced by cities. They enable real-time data collection, analysis, and
    decision-making, leading to improved efficiency, resource optimization, and enhanced
    quality of life for residents. However, while the potential benefits of IoT applications
    in smart cities are promising, several challenges and considerations need to be
    addressed. These include data privacy and security concerns, interoperability,
    and standardization issues, as well as social implications. Policymakers, urban
    planners, and technology providers must work collaboratively to address these

    gadgets and technologies together, the Internet of Things (IoT) eliminates the
    need for human involvement. This will allow cities all across the world to grow
    smart (or smarter). The development of smart city systems that encourage sustainable
    living, better resident comfort, and increased productivity is achieved through
    the IoT. For smart cities, the IoT depends on a number of underlying technologies
    and fields to operate. This article examines the IoT in smart cities in great
    detail. The basic components of the IoT-based smart city landscape are covered
    at the beginning of this chapter, after which we move on to the technologies that
    enable these domains, such as the architectures used, the networking technologies
    used, and the implementing algorithms related to artificial intelligence (AI)
    for IoT-based smart city systems. Then, we''ll look at some of the most popular
    smart city strategies and implementations. Finally, we discuss the challenges
    smart city IoT installations encounter as well as potential solutions. Previous

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction In the near future, the
    agricultural sector is called to face a significant challenge due to increasingly
    scarce resources, extreme weather conditions, a growing population, and a reduction
    in arable land [1]. Indeed, according to the FAO, by 2050, the world’s population
    will reach about 10 billion and, to be able to feed everyone, we will have to
    produce 70% more food [2], [3]. A practical and feasible solution is to move from
    the old farming concept to smart agriculture, with the adoption of information
    and communications technologies (ICTs) that help farmers to monitor, manage, and
    optimize their operations more effectively [4]. In particular, the introduction
    of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications, every single step of agricultural
    production can be improved: from soil management to minimizing water consumption,
    from plant protection to animal health and farm automation [5], [6]. Smart devices
    located infields are able to collect information and control the evolution of
    the different processes at various production stages. Besides, the miniaturization
    of electronic components allows to implement IoT sensors with reduced form factor
    and energy consumption, monitoring many variables of interest, such as temperature,
    humidity, wind speed and direction, soil conditions, chemical concentrations,
    crop growth, and solar exposure, as well as possible damages caused by drought,
    hail, or flooding. IoT systems integrate all this and other data and turn it into
    useful statistics: for example, predictive analysis allows farmers to use the
    strictly necessary resources (water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc.) and only where
    there is a real need, e.g., for poorly irrigated areas of the field, weak or sick
    plants, etc. [7], [8]. Despite such potential benefits, the deployment of smart
    agriculture systems is still in its infancy. Indeed, an obstacle to the digitization
    of agriculture is the lack or limitations of Internet connectivity in many areas.
    In the literature, several communication protocols have been proposed, with different
    characteristics related to cost, coverage, power consumption, and reliability
    [9]. Among the available technologies (summarized in Fig. 1 in terms of power
    consumption and coverage range), low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs), enlightened
    in a dashed box in Fig. 1 represent the best solution for supporting smart agriculture
    requirements. One of the most adopted LPWAN technology is LoRaWAN, which offers
    wide network coverage, built-in security, low cost, and limited power consumption
    during operation [10]. Fig. 1. Classification of wireless technologies: power
    consumption versus communication range [11]. Show All Indeed, LoRaWAN is an open
    system based on a very robust modulation (called LoRa), which provides several
    interesting features for covering rural areas with simple devices [9]. For such
    reasons, LoRa has been widely employed and tested in the agricultural field, connecting
    environmental sensors measuring temperature, air/soil moisture, etc., or to control
    different kinds of actuators (e.g., irrigation valves), and in applications, such
    as tractor communications, livestock monitoring, and location tracing [12], [13],
    [14]. Differently from existing surveys, which either treat LoRa together with
    all other IoT solutions or consider very specific technological aspects, we consider
    the adoption of these systems from an holistic perspective. For example, LoRa
    is cited in [5] in the general framework of IoT; [7] cites LoRa among the most
    promising technologies for agricultural IoT, and the same plan is followed by
    [8] which dedicated a Section to LoRa in Enabling Communication Technologies;
    similarly [15] includes LoRa in IoT communication protocols suitable for smart
    agriculture. On the other hand, [16] is specific to LoRa but is focused only on
    the protocol performance, [13] takes into consideration only the energy consumption
    of LoRa, [17] discusses the application of the technologies of industry 4.0 in
    the context of smart agriculture. Papers [18] and [19] deal with specific issues
    meaning the decision support system (DSS) and robotics in agriculture, respectively.
    Instead, in this article, we strive to provide a thorough and focused analysis
    on LoRa/LoRaWAN application in smart agriculture, offering a comprehensive view
    of the advancements and in-field applications of this IoT technology. LoRaWAN
    relies on LoRa modulation, a robust chirp-based modulation scheme, patented by
    Semtech [20]. It supports wireless connectivity with limited data rates over large
    areas and without the need of an operator. LoRaWAN is widely used in smart industry,
    smart home, smart city and, increasingly, in the smart agriculture environment.
    In the view of the authors of this article, LoRaWAN possesses five main strengths
    (low-cost, long-range, low-power, no-operator, and unlicensed spectrum) that can
    bridge the gap between smart agriculture and smart cities or industries. Moreover,
    several recent improvements on the resource allocation, channel access protocol,
    and network planning can enhance the efficiency of LoRaWAN networks, reducing
    capital and operational costs [21]. In rural areas, several experiments have demonstrated
    good coverage of LoRa [22], [23], [12]. Coverage ranges of up to 5 and 47 km have
    been obtained in the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) and line-of-sight (LOS) propagation
    conditions, respectively. In addition, in the case of NLOS propagation, the coverage
    range can be increased by using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [24], [25]. In
    terms of power consumption, LoRa offers up to 15 years of battery life to its
    devices. The low power consumption is a key feature of LoRa that makes it an ideal
    choice for smart agriculture applications. It was demonstrated experimentally
    that the estimated battery lifetime of a LoRa device may be six times that of
    a Wi-Fi device and two times that of a ZigBee device [26]. In this article, we
    provide a broad survey of LoRa-based smart agriculture systems, analyzing the
    state-of-the-art and highlighting for each solution the possible adoption of Machine
    Learning, control automation techniques, and energy autonomy features. We classify
    these works in four main categories: 1) irrigation systems; 2) plantation and
    crop monitoring; 3) tree monitoring; and 4) livestock monitoring. These LoRa systems
    are analyzed in terms of scalability, interoperability, network architecture,
    energy efficiency, and point out some open issues which traverse most of the current
    smart agriculture systems. References have been selected based on recent papers
    dealing with smart agriculture; however, some contributions in different fields
    useful as a benchmark are cited as well. Finally, we present the lessons learned
    and draw future research directions which we think crucial for the success and
    widespread of such technologies. The remainder of this article is structured as
    follows. Section II provides an overview of LoRa technology and its perspectives
    in agriculture, while Section III offers a brief summary on smart agriculture
    applications and their main challenges. Section IV reports on general purpose
    LoRa-based IoT platforms applied to smart agriculture. Section V, instead, discusses
    specific vertical solutions for smart agriculture, according to the four above-mentioned
    categories. Lessons learned and future research directions are proposed in Section
    VI. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section VII. SECTION II. LoRa and Its Perspectives
    in Agriculture LoRa technology is a proprietary physical layer technology patented
    by Semtech, which is revealing as a promising solution for large-scale low-power
    IoT deployments, including smart agriculture applications. Indeed, by operating
    in the unlicensed industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio bands and with
    a robust chirp-based modulation scheme, LoRa provides a cheap solution for supporting
    wireless connectivity with limited data rates (from 0.3 to 27 kb/s) in large areas
    and without the need of an operator. Moreover, LoRa transmissions are regulated
    by having a maximum transmission power of 25 mW (14 dBm) in the uplink, a configurable
    bandwidth of 125, 250, or 500 kHz, and a duty cycle of 0.1%, 1.0%, and 10%, which
    permit low energy consumption. In some scenarios, the battery of LoRa devices
    can last up to 15 years. Although LoRa technology is limited to the physical layer,
    different network solutions can be built on top of it, by exploiting its transmission
    interfaces. Among these, the most consolidated one is the open-source solution
    promoted by the LoRa Alliance, which is called LoRaWAN [27]. LoRaWAN networks
    are based on a simple star of star topology (Fig. 2): end-devices (EDs), such
    as sensors or actuators deployed infield, transmit packets on the wireless medium
    to fixed nodes called gateways (GWs), which, in turn, forward the collected packets
    to a central network server (NS) interacting with several application servers
    (ASs) [28]. The network infrastructure between GWs, NS, and ASs is typically based
    on a wired Internet technology, while EDs are not associated to a specific GW,
    which greatly simplifies implementation (e.g., in case of mobility [29]): in case
    a duplicate packet is simultaneously received by multiple GWs, the NS is responsible
    of filtering these packets and performs other simple decisions on network configuration.
    Fig. 2. LoRaWAN typical architecture. Show All To minimize the protocol complexity
    and the energy consumption, LoRaWAN employs a simple Aloha MAC protocol and defines
    three classes of devices (Fig. 3). Device classes represent different ways of
    managing the reception operations performed by the EDs. Class A devices, corresponding
    to the lowest energy profile, can receive downlink packets only in two time windows
    following the transmission of their own packet to the GW. In other words, devices
    can sleep all the time and downlink transmissions are triggered only after an
    uplink one. Class B devices add to this possibility a periodic scheduling of reception
    windows, by keeping a time synchronization with the GW. Finally, class C devices
    are constantly listening to the channel for downlink packets. Any time that a
    new packet is ready for transmission, devices attempt to transmit by randomly
    selecting one of the available channels in the ISM bands (e.g., in the 868 MHz
    there are 16 channels in Europe), together with a modulation parameter called
    spreading factor (SF). More into details, six different SFs are used in LoRa (from
    SF7 to SF12), which result in different symbol times and in almost orthogonal
    transmissions: when two signals modulated at different SFs overlap, the GW is
    able to decode both transmissions in a wide range of power ratios among the signals
    [30]. Unlike many other IoT technologies, the LoRaWAN specification offers dedicated
    end-to-end encryption to application providers, together with network-level security
    primitives, which allow sharing the same network among multitenant applications
    [31]. Fig. 3. LoRaWAN technology stack. Show All Summarizing, the ease of deployment
    with excellent coverage, the availability of devices with very low energy demand,
    and intrinsic security mechanisms make these systems very suitable for innovative
    agriculture applications. Indeed, several state-of-the-art IoT applications in
    smart agriculture are based on LoRa/LoRaWAN networks. For example, LoRa is used
    to connect sensor nodes measuring environmental parameters or to control different
    kinds of actuators (e.g., solenoid valve for irrigation purposes), and in applications
    such as livestock monitoring and location tracing [13], [10], [14]. These applications
    are not critical for data rates and latency, but often require to work in large
    rural areas, with limited access to energy grids and the Internet, and with decision
    mechanisms which benefit from data-driven learning. SECTION III. Smart Agriculture
    Applications and Challenges While industrial production processes have already
    become smarter and autonomous thanks to the implementation of the so called Industry
    4.0 concept, the integration of technologies such as IoT, artificial intelligence
    (AI), robotics, and big data is more recent in agriculture. The availability of
    IoT technologies for supporting wireless connectivity in rural areas and controlling
    infields smart objects shows a great potential for improving the agricultural
    sector, toward the so called smart agriculture [17], [18], [19]. Indeed, farm
    monitoring and automation can make production more efficient and sustainable [7],
    by promptly detecting and reacting to water or moisture stress, wastes of raw
    materials, crops’ diseases, pests, and nutrient deficiencies, as well as problems
    related to the wellbeing of farm animals. The interest on the development of smart
    agriculture applications has been demonstrated by the recent commercialization
    of agricultural sensors and robots (called Agribots), specifically designed for
    reducing the intense physical labor traditionally required in agriculture [15].
    Apart from the availability of smart devices for interacting with the farm in
    the physical world, smart agriculture applications require to build a digital
    representation of the farm status and a decision logic based on the collected
    data. Different protocols can be envisioned both for providing the wireless connectivity
    to heterogeneous devices (from simple low-cost temperature sensors, to complex
    remote-controlled robots) and exporting data for analysis and decisions [32],
    [33]. Since a large amount of data can be produced by agricultural sensors, big
    data analysis can provide efficient monitoring and processing methods [34]. Data
    processing may involve various features such as data loading, validation, aggregation,
    prediction, classification, image or video processing, and data mining. Thus,
    based on the acquired data, DSSs can optimize the productivity and reduce the
    ecological footprint of the farm. Researchers recognize that digitization of farming
    processes and activities is an important challenge for the adoption of smart agriculture
    technologies [32], [35]. In particular, the major challenges to digitization in
    agriculture can be categorized as follows. Communication Issues: As we will detail
    later, large-scale implementations of IoT solutions require robust and secure
    network architectures. The reliability of communicating information still represents
    a challenge to be addressed in the agricultural context and justifies the adoption
    of LoRa/LoRaWAN technologies. Energy Management: The power supply in devices for
    smart agriculture is a significant challenge and energy harvesting systems are
    a relevant area of research. The main issue concerns the sensor’s power supply
    and how to optimize efficiently the power consumption. Moreover, distributed nodes
    can execute some computations (Edge computing) which consumes more energy, while
    sensor batteries have a limited capacity. Consequently, smart devices require
    efficient energy storage and supply. Data/Device Heterogeneity: In general, the
    agricultural data is produced by heterogeneous sensors (soil sensors, weather
    sensors, trunk sensors, leaf sensors, etc.). In addition, IoT devices generally
    use different network protocols and platforms. Thus, in addition to sensors heterogeneity,
    network and protocol heterogeneity should be considered as well. Getting these
    technologies to work together is often an issue, especially for unskilled farmers.
    Physical Deployments: Spatial deployment of devices on farms proves to be a significant
    challenge, especially when the entire farm needs to be monitored across a large
    area and with different application scenarios (soil, plants, trees, animals, etc.).
    Data Management: The difficulty of interpreting the data can be a huge barrier:
    indeed, numerous sensors are necessary and big data analysis could be required
    to better understand and forecast the unpredictability of agricultural ecosystems.
    Generic Platform: To promote the adoption of smart agriculture technologies is
    often required to develop user friendly software platforms. The challenge here
    is to build a universal platform that can be easily modified to support different
    types of monitoring ranging from specific crop to livestock. These challenges,
    together with the cost of infrastructure investment, the complexity of technologies,
    lack of farmers’ education and training, data ownership, and privacy and security
    concerns, has motivated the research and development of innovative platforms,
    specific network technologies, and new architectures for smart agriculture [32],
    [35]. SECTION IV. Generic LoRa-Based Platforms Since agricultural applications
    are widely different, varying from soil and air monitoring, to irrigation automation
    and livestock breeding, several general purpose IoT platforms have been adapted
    for farmers to accommodate all these applications together under a unified, easy
    to understand and simple to use interface. Therefore, in this section, we will
    discuss some of these LoRa-based platforms horizontally designed for smart agriculture,
    while in the next one, we will dig into more vertical and application-specific
    systems, focusing on the four reference scenarios depicted in Fig. 4. Fig. 4.
    Four reference applications in smart agriculture. Show All Generic and open IoT
    platforms can indeed help to digitize farms by integrating numerous agriculture
    applications, harmonizing specific sensing devices, actuators, and decision logics,
    which exhibit heterogeneous requirements in terms of network bandwidth, latency,
    sensors’ complexity, and energy requirements. A clear example is constituted by
    FIWARE [36], a powerful open-source platform, sponsored by the European Commission,
    that provides standardized interfaces for many different IoT sectors including
    agriculture. The FIWARE platform includes several parts called generic enablers
    (GEs), which provide components and reference implementations that support specific
    APIs, and can integrate data collected from heterogeneous sensors using different
    communication technologies, to create custom applications [37], [38]. Several
    GEs are available making it easier to interface with IoT systems, and the IoT
    Agent for LoRaWAN offers a bridge between LoRaWAN and the FIWARE Context Broker
    (the core component of the “Powered by FIWARE” platforms). Moreover, FIWARE can
    be combined with other third-party platforms to provide accessible tools to worldwide
    farmers and consumers too [39]. Another example is the work in [40] where low-cost,
    LoRa-based devices are used for soil temperature and humidity monitoring, and
    the data is processed and sent to the Cayenne IoT Platform for storage and visualization
    [41]. This platform is a drag and drop project builder for developers and engineers
    that can be used in different IoT applications. It encompasses cloud-based web
    applications as well as mobile apps for Android and IOS devices. Cayenne can integrate
    any tool into the library with a wide variety of IoT ready-to-use devices and
    connectivity options. Other LoRaWAN-based IoT platforms are more specific to the
    agricultural world, aiming at improving the management of generic farms in a highly
    customizable way. For example, the LoRaFarM platform [42] has a generally applicable
    “core” infrastructure, which can be completed with specialized ad-hoc modules
    depending on the farm’s characteristics and requirements. The LoRaFarM platform
    derives its topological structure from the LoRaWAN architecture, since low-level
    communication patterns are built around the LoRaWAN technology (see Fig. 5). Hence,
    expansion modules can be added at farm level (or low level), if they include physical
    hardware to be installed in the deployment (sensors or actuators), as well as
    a high level, in case data processing is needed. The middleware, in the LoRaFarM
    domain, refers to the set of entities and technologies by which data coming from
    farm-level modules are collected, stored, and exposed to high-level modules. This
    middleware can be defined as a sort of “connecting layer” between the farm and
    the back-end domain. Fig. 5. LoRaFarM platform: levels and parallelism with LoRaWAN
    [42]. Show All One of the main advantages of the LoRaFarM platform is that heterogeneous
    subnetworks, in terms of capabilities (transmission range, data throughput, and
    energy consumption), can be incorporated without altering the platform structure
    and, thus, making it highly scalable, flexible, and suitable for a wide range
    of scenarios. Indeed, this gives the freedom to choose the most suitable communication
    protocols and traffic policy to monitor and control the farm different areas,
    such as greenhouses and fields. Messages between nodes employing different protocols
    are translated by a multiprotocol GateWay (mpGW), enabling communications between
    non-LoRaWAN-enabled nodes and the LoRaFarM middleware, in a seamless way. Its
    protocol translation functionality, the mpGW can be enriched with edge computing
    features, to process and aggregate sensor data. Moreover, LoRaFarM can be extended
    with new functionalities like data analysis and prediction of the evolution of
    environmental parameters to prevent plant diseases, relying on AI and Machine
    Learning techniques. Finally, the mySense environment proposed by Silva et al.
    [58] is a sensor data integration framework aimed to systematize data acquisition
    procedures to address common smart agriculture issues. It facilitates the use
    of low cost platforms such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, making available a set
    of free tools based on the do it yourself (DIY) concept. The mySense platform
    builds over a 4-layer technological structure (sensor nodes, crop field and sensor
    networks, cloud services and front-end applications) and is accordingly divided
    into four levels of operation: Level 1, for data collection using common data
    transfer technologies (ZigBee, GSM/GPRS, LoRa, etc.); Level 2, for GWs (possibly)
    running local tasks according to the fog or edge computing paradigms; Level 3
    for storing data in the cloud; and Level 4 for high-level applications. Data can
    arrive from any device provided that complies with the data formats allowed by
    the platform. Summary and Insights: This Section discussed LoRa-based platforms
    which can be exploited to unify different applications into one simple and easy-to-use
    platform. Platforms such as Fiware, Cayenne, LoRaFarM, and mySense provide standardized
    interfaces to integrate different agricultural applications with each other. These
    platforms provide ready-to-use solutions and connectivity between heterogeneous
    networks. With these platforms, LoRa can integrate and complement existing systems
    based on other network technologies (ZigBee, Bluetooth, etc.), making them highly
    scalable. SECTION V. Application-Specific LoRa Platforms In this section, we provide
    an in-depth review focusing four reference scenarios: 1) irrigation systems; 2)
    plantation and crop monitoring; 3) tree monitoring; and 4) livestock monitoring,
    which broadly cover most of smart agriculture applications. A. Irrigation Systems
    Accurate monitoring of the soil water status allows to achieve seasonal water
    savings of up to 90% compared to traditional management, increasing productivity
    and introducing significant savings in energy costs for the water pumps management
    [59]. To improve water management in agriculture, it is necessary to analyze and
    monitor the complex water interactions that occur in field, following the concept
    of soil-plant-atmosphere (SPA) continuum systems [60]. Indeed, the knowledge of
    the water status of the SPA system plays a significant role for understanding
    the crop water stress and implement water saving mechanisms with a minimal effect
    on the production [59]. Measuring the evapotranspiration (ET), which refers to
    the amount of water that passes from the soil into the air due to the combined
    effect of plant transpiration and evaporation, is another complex task. Examples
    of these sensors are the lysimeters or sophisticated micro-meteorological sensors
    (e.g., Eddy covariance), whose cost and complexity limit their application to
    research studies [61]. Cheaper systems are the time domain reflectometry (TDR)
    technique or gravimetric methods [62], whose main limit is the difficulty in calibration
    and automation. Some LoRa-based irrigation systems are implemented using development
    boards such as Arduino, ESP32, Pycom, or STM32, e.g., [43], [44], [47], [48],
    [46], and [51]. Few of them also include energy harvesting modules, such as an
    hydroelectric generator, allowing them to operate for decades. For example, the
    LoRaWAN-based irrigation system in [51] comprises an energy-neutral irrigation
    node (Fig. 6) with the following modules: controller module, power module, irrigation
    module, and transmitter module. Fig. 6. Energy-neutral irrigation node described
    in [51]. Show All Exploiting AI and data coming from different sensor, such as
    air temperature and humidity, soil temperature and humidity, light intensity,
    etc. makes possible to develop and train specific irrigation models to calculate
    the exact amount of water to be distributed. For example, the works [54], [55],
    [56] provide machine-learning-based smart irrigation systems, all employing LoRa
    technology. In particular, in [55], a random forest classifier predicts the soil
    moisture and, thus, irrigation is planned accordingly. In [54], instead, multiple
    linear regression algorithm is employed to train the model using two highest correlation
    coefficient features: 1) light intensity and 2) soil humidity. Data is collected
    with a LoRa P2P network, which uses a master–slave and TDMA-based MAC protocol.
    Each slave node has a unique address and can transmit a packet in each of the
    reserved TDMA time slots. Alternatively, a Penman-Monteith-based irrigation model
    allows for an optimal irrigation strategy for different crop growth periods and
    uses the ET parameter to estimate the amount of water [63]. This solution requires
    an integration of actuators, sensors and a meteorological station in a LoRa network
    [49], [50]. In addition, third-party services such as weather information or fog
    computing may be needed to decide on irrigation schedules [57]. Since in LoRaWAN,
    the latency of downlink communication from GW to Class-A nodes (sensors or actuators)
    is relatively long (must first wait for an uplink transmission), few systems employ
    alternative Master/Slave protocols [52], [53], [54]. These protocols increase
    the stability of the LoRa irrigation system, avoiding packet collisions and, thus,
    can save water during the close command of the solenoid valve. Finally, AREThOU5A
    [43] is an example of a water management system that combines data collected from
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in the field and satellite data provided by international
    weather forecast services, to achieve efficient water usage strategies for farmers.
    It employs a WSN with two different sensors for measuring the temperature and
    the soil moisture in field. A routing subsystem controls and routes the data and
    information through LoRaWAN and TCP/IP with SSL network interfaces. The LoRa network
    is used to collect data from the EDs and perform administration processes, while
    the TCP/IP SSL works as a bridge to the rest of the network architecture. Summary
    and Insights: Comparing the characteristics of different irrigation systems, summarized
    in Table I, it is relevant to note that most of these LoRa-based irrigation systems
    adopt temperature, humidity, and soil moisture sensors. However, albeit all cited
    papers are recently published, ML is used only in 1/3 of the applications. TABLE
    I LoRa-Based Irrigation System Comparison Furthermore, only 13% of these irrigation
    systems used an evapotranspiration-based methodology. This strategy, which is
    often expensive, may be accomplished by combining inexpensive sensors and AI (with
    a more comprehensive approach integrating meteorological variables measured by
    a weather station with variables measured by soil sensors into the system), significantly
    lowering the cost of direct evapotraspiration measurements. Such improvements
    could lead to more effective water management, with the simultaneous impact of
    decreasing water usage and increase crop output. Finally, LoRaWAN communications
    can be tuned to adapt the duty cycle and manage the system optimally: for example,
    when the irrigation system is not in use, sensor data could be collected every
    hour or even less, while when irrigation is taking place the measurements could
    be increased to every 5–10 min. This way, the use of water and energy could be
    further reduced [71]. B. Plantation and Crop Monitoring Plantation and crop monitoring
    requires a large number of sensors to obtain an effective control and, thus, increase
    productivity, especially when agricultural fields are very heterogeneous. For
    example, in order to optimize the production while minimizing the ecological footprint,
    it is necessary to control the injection of pesticides and fertilizers [72], [73],
    increasing yields up to 10% and saving fertilizers up to 37% [74]. Such control
    can be performed by varying the pesticides and fertilizer application rate over
    time and space. Crops do not always need a uniform application, as some areas
    have different requirements due to their location (sunlight, soil features, etc).
    Over-fertilization can deteriorate water quality, favor weed growth, and reduce
    profit. Vice-versa under-fertilization restricts yield or reduces crop quality
    [75]. The application rate can be modified based on weather impacts, nutrient
    availability, and seasonal cycles [73], [75]. Some optical or ultrasonic sensors
    indirectly assess the nutrient request (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, etc.)
    of the crop at the time of application [72]. In addition, to reduce the loss of
    productivity in crops, surveillance systems can be adopted [76]. Providing visual
    monitoring to growers can prevent crops from getting damaged by intruders, ensure
    the field conditions or enable the detection of pests attacks remotely. Although
    there are plenty of devices which can be exploited for building a real-time visual
    monitoring system, deploying them in a wide area and over wireless channels can
    be challenging [77], [78], [79]. Table II summarizes the main characteristics
    of several plantation and crop monitoring systems, based on LoRa technology. The
    nodes used in these systems should be of small dimensions, self-sufficient in
    terms of energy, relatively cheap, and often able to acquire a large variety of
    parameters. For example, three different sensor nodes have been developed by Valente
    et al. [64] and tested in a vineyard field: node 1, with an ultrasonic anemometer
    (that measures the direction and speed of the wind) and a sensor that monitors
    bulk electrical conductivity, in addition to volumetric water content (by measuring
    soil permittivity) and soil and air temperature; node 2, an irrometer watermark
    soil water tension sensor; and node 3, an all-in-one weather station with 12 sensors
    to measure air temperature, relative humidity, vapor pressure, barometric pressure,
    wind speed, gust and direction, solar radiation, precipitation, lightning strike
    counter, and distance. It should be remarked that each node contains sensors which
    differ for the sampling rate, accuracy, and supplied energy. The nodes send data
    using LoRaWAN to a GW that is connected to a the things network (TTN) server.
    In the TTN server, data is decoded and sent to the ThingSpeak [80] platform for
    visualization and possible analysis and aggregation. Fig. 7 summarizes the different
    blocks composing the nodes: 1) a maximum power point tracker (MPPT) applied to
    a photovoltaic source and connected with a storage system; 2) a dc/dc switching
    converter to interface the source with the storage system and loads; 3) the LoRaWAN
    module for communication; and 4) the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) module
    to convert the signals available from sensors. TABLE II LoRa-Based Plantation
    and Crop Monitoring System Comparison Fig. 7. Block diagram of the sensor nodes
    taken from [64]. Show All In [66] a LoRa-based IoT monitoring system for starfruit
    plantation is presented. The LoRa network implemented includes three nodes and
    one master, and it can cover a range of 700 m. For optimal growth, starfruit plants
    need soil pH conditions between 5.5–7.5. Thus, thanks to the proposed LoRa system,
    the farmers can make important and precise decisions about how to grow the crop.
    Similarly, works [65], [67], [68], [69], [58] present solutions to increase production
    and fruit quality, with optimal use of resources through LoRa-based networks.
    The Smart Mushroom Cultivation is a system used to automatize the production of
    expensive mushrooms [67]. The smart system includes devices to monitor and control
    humidity and C O 2 levels through sensors and actuators all connected using LoRaWAN.
    The sensor nodes measure the ambient condition inside Mushroom House (humidity,
    temperature, and C O 2 ), and data is sent to the remote server for monitoring
    and analysis. An automatic control maintains the ambient conditions between the
    required levels. Finally, there are cases where anomaly detection near the sensor
    is required to allow decisions and actions as soon as possible. In this direction,
    Brunelli et al. [70] proposed a new paradigm of monitoring and pest detection
    to improve the performance of an apple orchard. They add intelligence to the LoRa
    nodes, shifting the detection of anomalies near the sensor. The application is
    developed on a low-energy platform powered by a solar panel, realizing an energy-autonomous
    system capable of operating unattended continuously over LoRa networks. Summary
    and Insights: Plantation and crop monitoring requires the control of numerous
    parameters, captured by different heterogeneous sensors deployed in the agricultural
    fields. Some of the sensors used in the cited papers are specific to the type
    of crop, while others (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) are deployed in almost
    all of the literature works. In addition, the use of AI is not yet widely adopted,
    and only three out of nine papers adopt automatic control for the implementation
    of DSSs. An innovative approach in this context would be to add intelligence to
    the LoRa nodes, while moving the DSS closer to the sensor. Finally, note that
    the maximum size of the LoRa payload is 250 bytes; this allows a wide variety
    of parameters to be monitored and transferred in a single packet. For example,
    Sacaleanu and Kiss [69] send eight agri-meteorological measurements in a single
    LoRa packet of only 16 bytes. C. Tree Monitoring Trees are essential in modern
    society and are widely applied in a great number of scenarios including soil erosion
    prevention, air purification, wood or fruit production. For supporting the managers
    of urban/rural green infrastructures and forests, it is important to constantly
    monitor the tree conditions, in terms of growth rate and failure risk, as well
    as micro-climate parameters in the tree surrounding areas. The analysis of this
    data allows the characterization of the trees functional responses to their environment
    and a prompt action in case of problems. Tree monitoring also requires reliable
    long-range communications in the presence of foliage, large sensor densification
    (i.e., one sensor per tree), and measurements of various physiological/biological
    parameters from specific locations (at the root, the trunk, or the branch) as
    a function of vegetation type to obtain accurate readings [83]. In these systems,
    it is also important to measure changes in position over time or instantaneous
    trunk accelerations. Table III summarizes the main characteristics of relevant
    Monitoring systems. TABLE III LoRa-Based Sensors Applications in Tree Farms One
    of the main properties to be measured is the water transport in the xylem of the
    trunk (called the sap flow). A possible measurement method is the Heat Balance
    Method, developed by Granier [91], [92], which is based on analyzing the temperature
    difference among two probes inserted into the stem wood at a 10 cm distance along
    the vertical trunk axis. The probe in the higher position is heated, while the
    lower one provides the stem wood reference temperature. The temperature difference
    generated between the probes represents an index of the transpiration activity
    of the plant, expressed as a variation of the flux density. This method can be
    used for accurate measurements of sap flow in plants, providing a reliable calibration
    procedure to relate the temperature difference to the actual sap flow [93]. For
    example, the TreeTalker (TT) [81] is a device that measures sapflow (water transport
    in the trunk), wood temperature and humidity, multispectral signature of light
    transmitted through the canopy, tree trunk radial growth, accelerations along
    a 3-D coordinate system used to detect tree movements, air temperature, and relative
    humidity, which can be additionally complemented by soil temperature and volumetric
    water content. A TT node is connected via LoRa wireless connection to a GW, that
    manages up to 48 devices in one cluster. The GW is, in turn, connected to the
    Internet via GPRS and sends data to a computer server. This technology can be
    applied to monitor the root plate tilt, as well as the flexion and the accelerations
    that tree trunks receive under the force of the wind for the evaluation of tree
    failure risk. Another solution to analyze the health condition of a tree consists
    on the electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), it is a well-known technique with
    a wide range of applications. EIS has been applied to characterize solids, liquids,
    both in the laboratory and industrial environments. Moreover, assessment of physiological
    states of some trees (pinus, chestnut, etc.) has also been studied. The method
    based on bioimpedance indexes allows determining three distinct physiological
    states: healthy and watered plants, plants with a high level of hydric stress,
    and plants with disease [94], [95], [96]. For example, Amaro et al. [82] integrated
    an EIS system in a sensor node to analyze the health condition of the tree and
    transfer the results through the LoRaWAN protocol. Finally, tree monitoring systems
    are often influenced by the presence of foliage which can severely impact wireless
    communication systems performance. This generally leads to node densification
    to increase coverage levels, especially in large areas, resulting in additional
    costs and constraining the design of LoRa systems in nonhomogeneous vegetation
    environments [84], [85], [97]. For such reasons, a small drone with a GW is sometimes
    required for collecting data from nodes and solving the Fresnel zone radio propagation
    issues encountered in tree farms [98], [86]. Summary and Insights: In this section,
    some methodologies for monitoring tree health have been discussed. It is important
    to highlight how LoRa can be easily integrated into these systems, e.g., to measure
    the lymph flow or bio-impedance of trees. In case the parameter to be monitored
    involves roots, it has been shown that LoRa can be used for under-ground or near-ground
    communications too [12], [99]. Finally, the use of drones for data collection
    has been exploited to solve the problem of foliage scattering. D. Livestock Monitoring
    System Smart livestock practices aim at improving the productive and reproductive
    parameters, feeding and handling of feces, producing a direct effect on the increment
    of the farmers’ income, and also better milk and meat production [100]. The implementation
    of these practices requires to monitor the general health conditions of the animals,
    by tracking some biological signals to be associated to symptoms of disease, estrus
    and calving [101]. Wearable sensor technologies provide the possibility of remotely
    managing individual animals facilitating urgent interventions, responding to time
    and labor-intensive concerns in a more efficient way [87]. In extensive livestock
    production systems, the absence of access to networking and animal contact presents
    a barrier to the effective use of these technologies. Wearable sensors, to be
    more practical for extensive management settings, must: 1) network over longer
    distances; 2) have reliable power supplies (preferably renewable); 3) be low-cost
    so that damaged and lost sensors are less economically impactful; and 4) transmit
    data in real time. For these reasons, LoRaWAN technology is indicated for above
    described applications, some of which are summarized in Table IV. Primarily, these
    systems are used to monitor the animal health, but by integrating LoRa technology
    with a GPS, remote grazing systems can be implemented [87], [88]. TABLE IV LoRa-Based
    Sensor Applications in Livestock Monitoring Animal monitoring can involve completely
    different scenarios; as a consequence, the LoRa network architecture could require
    a more specific design effort to work either in indoor or outdoor settings. For
    example, the work in [89] proposes two different versions of GWs: an indoor GW,
    designed for installation in sheltered areas such as barns and cowsheds and oriented
    toward dairy cattle livestock scenarios, and an outdoor version, more specific
    for open areas such as paddocks and pasture lands, and designed for beef cattle
    livestock scenarios. The indoor GW is conceived for monitoring several important
    physical parameters typical of the shed environment, such as temperature, relative
    humidity, illuminance, carbon dioxide (C O 2 ) , and ammonia (N H 3 ) concentration,
    while the main purpose of the outdoor GW is to manage nodes in remote areas, far
    from the shed, directly on the pasture land. In the open field scenario, weather
    parameters (temperature and humidity) are collected, for purposes of correlation
    with the animal health status. Moreover, in the presence of large herds, the high
    node density could cause an increase in collisions between sent packets. In such
    scenarios, a MAC layer that includes a listen-before-talk (LBT) mechanism could
    prevent as much as possible packet collisions among nodes. Indeed, LBT-based carrier-sense
    multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) can be incorporated with the
    physical layer of LoRa [89]. The CA mechanism is based on a random retransmission
    time that randomizes the access of the nodes to the wireless medium. The size
    of the pasture area is another factor to consider in deploying the LoRaWAN network.
    In particular, it has been shown that in large areas of pasture, the use of a
    mobile GW that moves along the track is a better solution than the use of one
    or more static GWs [90]. Contrarily, when the livestock area is not too large,
    using only one static GW is preferable because the data extraction rate value
    is high enough and the energy consumption is lower compared to multiple static
    GWs or one mobile GW. The instance of cattle monitoring in New Mexico, as described
    by Actility [102], is one of the successful illustrations of a large-scale LoRaWAN-enabled
    deployment. Due to the large size of these desert ranches (10000–20000 hectares)
    and the large number of cows to track (up to 7000), monitoring and obtaining information
    regarding cattle wellbeing can be time consuming and expensive. Indeed, while
    the cattle were previously followed using traditional GPS devices, the absence
    of reliable cellular connection throughout the whole grazing region made this
    method ineffective. These issues were solved with an off-the-shelf LoRaWAN solution
    because of its extensive range and good coverage. Finally, LoRa technology can
    be used for sharing the short text messages and voice messages in the absence
    of cellular coverage. For example, COWShED [103] is used for supporting livestock
    transhumance in Senegal. Summary and Insights: In this section, we showed how
    LoRa is used to collect information about the movements and health of livestock,
    as well as on the conditions of grassland. LoRa can also aid herders in achieving
    remote grazing by combining data with electronic fences, to identify whether animals
    have crossed it. In addition, LoRa has been used to monitor environmental parameters
    of barns, demonstrating how this technology can be adopted in both outdoor and
    indoor scenarios. Additionally, innovative MAC schemes, such as LBT method could
    be implemented to minimize packet collisions when big herds present, and to mitigate
    the limits on the effective duty cycle of channel occupation. Finally, in the
    absence of cellular coverage, LoRa/LoRaWAN solutions have been used for large-scale
    cattle monitoring or even supporting livestock transhumance for text/voice messages.
    SECTION VI. Lessons Learned and Open Issues This Section discusses the lessons
    learned and the open research challenges for using LoRa technology in smart agriculture.
    According to the aim of this article, it was learned that, given the wide variety
    of sensors used in smart farming systems, different communication protocols need
    to be integrated, particularly when different platforms/vendors coexist and data
    must be collected from the various subsystems. In addition, since power supplies
    are frequently unavailable in a large agricultural area, nodes should be as energy
    self-sufficient as possible. Using local or edge data processing could mitigate
    this problem, optimizing the energy consumption. Moreover, keeping the logic on
    the Edge of the network could alleviate the hurdle on LoRa’s centralized communications
    (especially on the downlink). The development of interoperability in smart agriculture
    systems can also be accelerated by platforms such as FIWARE and Cayenne, while
    machine learning can be used to model and analyze technical problems, improving
    scalability of LoRa networks and predicting network congestion. The experience
    gained in Industry 4.0 can be transferred to agriculture, considering some peculiarities,
    including the need to cover large spaces that cannot be manned. In addition, there
    is the need to provide device power supply and data security (partially solved
    by leveraging on LoRaWAN built-in security schemes). Another significant factor
    is the initial cost of the system, which must be as low as possible since the
    pay-back time also depends on elements that cannot be predicted during the year,
    such as weather. Finally, it has been recognized that although ICT has long-term
    sustainability issues to be solved, they show great potential for improving the
    usage of natural resources, especially when cyber–physical systems (CPSs) are
    combined with IoT, AI, machine learning, and neuromorphic computing techniques
    [104]. Through the study carried out in this article, it is also possible to understand
    in which area LoRa has been applied and is emerging in recent years. In particular,
    among the application areas discussed in Section V, Fig. 8 shows in a pie chart
    that more than 40% of the analyzed studies focus on water management, while almost
    25% are dedicated on crop monitoring, followed by tree monitoring. This result
    is in line with recent market surveys on LPWANs (e.g., [105]), and other general
    studies on communications protocols for smart agriculture [9]. Fig. 8. Distribution
    of the LoRa papers according to smart agriculture application areas. Show All
    All this confirms the great potential of implementing smart agriculture solutions
    using IoT, and LoRa technology in particular. However, there are still some open
    issues that need to be faced: for example, LoRaWAN works quite well in uplink
    when it needs to collect data from sensors, while downlink connections might suffer
    high latency. In what follows, we briefly discuss future research directions related
    to downlink latency, energy management, device heterogeneity and interoperability,
    data management, and scalability. These open issues must be solved for LoRa systems
    to be widely adopted in smart agriculture. We conclude the Section with an eye
    on other wireless technologies, different from LoRa/LoRaWAN. A. LoRa Downlink
    Performance The downlink performance of LPWAN systems still represents a challenge
    since it is related to the energy consumption. In particular, LoRaWAN allows different
    tradeoffs between communication latency on the downlink channel and energy consumption.
    Nodes are classified by classes: they can receive only after an uplink transmission
    (Class A), or at regular time intervals (Class B), or at any time (Class C). The
    modern trend is to optimize energy efficiency, hence, data are transmitted only
    when necessary or periodically. According to the authors’ opinion, a further optimization
    could be retrieved by local data processing. As a matter of fact, even if nodes
    remain asleep most of the time, as in [57], or with scheduling intervals of reception
    windows of 10–20 min as in [48] and [50] or a few hours [58], local processing
    always lowers the data to be transmitted decreasing the transmission time; it
    has been successfully tested in [42] where edge processing on the GW allows a
    more effective control of the actuator nodes. This last approach improves also
    reliability since it allows farms to work even if the Internet connection of the
    LoRa GW is absent for a few hours. Reliability can also be improved by a Master/Slave
    access control method for the LoRa network [52], [53], [54]. Alternatively, for
    short-range communication, a Wake-up Radio (WuR) can be adopted. WuR technology
    is an ultralow-power receiver that is continuously listening to the channel while
    spending a few nanowatts or microwatts depending on the circuit’s design. WuRs
    work in parallel to the main LoRa transceiver and allow asynchronous wake-up of
    the nodes with low latency. With the LoRa-WuR scheme, the downlink latency can
    be reduced by almost 90% compared to the traditional LoRa protocol for a ten nodes
    cluster [106], [107]. B. Energy Efficiency Considerations In addition to downlink
    communication performance just explained, the energy consumption in an agricultural
    ED can include turning on booster pumps or solenoid valves, activating sensors
    over a long period, use of GPS and data transmission, etc. Nodes should be autonomous
    as much as possible since usually power supplies are not available in a wide agricultural
    area. Besides, the use of batteries needs to minimize disposal costs and pollution.
    Providing solutions to avoid the use of batteries by harvesting energy from the
    environment would encourage the deployment of wireless devices in smart agriculture.
    The use of different energy sources, such as solar energy, piezoelectricity, thermal,
    wind, water, and radiofrequency is consolidated [108]. However, making a device
    completely energy-neutral requires a thorough analysis of power consumption in
    different working states [109]. One facilitation is the availability of a renewable
    energy source as in [51]; on the other hand, a high energy consumption due to
    the heating of one probe as in [91] requires a different design or the remote
    monitoring of the energy available or harvested as in [110]. It is evident that
    there are many factors that influence the analysis of offering-demanding energy,
    it varies on a case-by-case basis and does not lend itself to systematic analysis;
    on the other hand, in this context, machine learning algorithms can give a significant
    contribution. Infact, the ML approach has been already successfully applied in
    different contexts allowing to implement an efficient renewable energy selection
    based on the geographic location [111], or to retrieve a good energy prediction
    [112]. An application example is given by the energy-neutral system for pest detection
    [70] which takes advantage of ML algorithms. C. Heterogeneity and Interoperability
    Smart agriculture systems are quite heterogeneous in terms of sensors and, in
    some cases, it is also required to integrate different communication technologies,
    e.g., when multiple platforms coexist and data arrives from different subsystems.
    LoRa platforms are used with ZigBee to implement hybrid communications managing
    different sensors clusters or with the IEEE 802.11s-based system to build a mesh
    networking architecture. The path for the integration of different technologies,
    such as cloud, IoT, and software-defined networking, with AI is proposed in [113]
    with the related challenges and opportunities. Assuring communications in heterogeneous
    smart agriculture systems is a critical issue that has been studied for example
    in [114], where LoRa and ZigBee hybrid communications are implemented. Precisely,
    two LoRa sensor clusters and two ZigBee sensor clusters are used and combined
    with two ZigBee-to-LoRa converters to communicate in a network managed by a LoRa
    GW. The token ring protocol in the ZigBee network and polling mechanism in the
    LoRa network is used. The system can work with a packet loss rate of less than
    0.5% when the communication distance is 630 m for the ZigBee network and 3.7 km
    for the LoRa network. An hybrid LoRa/IEEE 802.11s-based mesh networking architecture
    is proposed in [115], where an effective network protocol selection mechanism
    is developed to choose the right interface. Protocol selection is based on multiple
    parameters, including network communication interface type, GNSS position of the
    APs, RSSI of nearby nodes, type and amount of data to be transmitted. Large data
    to be transferred in a short time can rely on the IEEE 802.11s-based network while
    small data can be transmitted through a LoRa-based mesh network. Platforms such
    as FIWARE [116], Cayenne [41] and mySense [58], discussed in Section IV, can also
    give a push to achieve interoperability in the smart agriculture systems. The
    above described solutions can benefit of an “industry 4.0”-based approach where
    the integration of different protocols cooperate to address the needs of automating
    computing and technology processes [113], [18]. D. Machine Learning and Big Data
    Management The integration of big data analysis with machine learning can provide
    predictions about future outcomes, such as fruit quality or detect crops’ diseases
    using historical data, analytical techniques, and statistical modeling [117].
    The benefits of ML in the agriculture are relevant [118]. However, the deployment
    of models is the most challenging step to bring the ML algorithms in the production
    fields, and thanks to its advantages, LoRa technology could make a big contribution
    to taking this step. Collected data can be used to implement an intelligent system
    capable of supporting the identification of varieties and predicting the quality
    of the final product [64]. In fact, exploiting ML, the data can be used by the
    biologists to develop crop models and perform disease prediction [68]. The agricultural
    industry produces a large amount of data collected by heterogeneous sensors, so
    best practices should include the mechanisms to reduce the memory and time for
    data analysis. Thus, to pursue such objectives, edge computing models are also
    applied [119]. Distributed data process, such as MapReduce [120], may avoid bottlenecks
    when transferring all data to a single server, as in [121] where the proposed
    method adopts smart sensors to measure the soil quality indicators, while the
    preelaborated data is transmitted using the LoRaWAN protocol. The Apache Spark
    environment is then used to implement a parallel algorithm for statistical models
    based on the soil indicator data obtained from the experimental field. E. LoRa
    Scalability and Network Improvement As concerns scalability, some open points,
    shared with general applications, are recognized. For this reason, most of the
    reference literature does not directly address issues related to agriculture.
    Indeed, scalability is a key feature in LoRa networks due to its long-range and
    large number of devices can concurrently reach a given GW. The network scales
    quite well if dynamic transmission parameters are used, in combination with multiple
    sinks. However, the correct behavior of the NS is not easy to be evaluated [122].
    In fact, the NS presents some challenges from the point of view of its optimization,
    such as processing duplicate packets or packets from other networks, or bringing
    down the entire network in case of Internet connection loss. LoRa networks are
    bound by strict legal requirements, particularly where no LBT schemes are utilized.
    The transmission duty cycle (TDC) regulates the ISM bands to determine the maximum
    time that the band can be occupied, typically bounded to 1%. This implies that
    devices may not occupy the ISM band for more than 36 s per hour, forbidding the
    transmission of new packets when this limit is attained [123]. Machine learning
    can be applied to model and analyze technical problems, improving the scalability
    of LoRa networks and predicting network congestion [124]. Further developments
    could include enhanced ADR mechanisms, optimization of GW locations, and interference
    cancelation techniques [125]. Finally, some challenges remain such as the widespread
    adoption of multihop communications in LoRaWAN. Literature has shown that multihop
    or mesh topologies can extend the coverage of LoRaWAN networks and improve energy
    efficiency in certain scenarios [126]. These solutions propose intermediate nodes
    to forward messages to other EDs to extend the coverage. Other open points include
    the use of GWs as intermediate nodes, GW-to-GW communications, and practical large-scale
    deployment of LoRaWAN mesh networks. F. Other Communication Technologies The choice
    of a specific communication technology is central to the performance of IoT-based
    agricultural applications. Other than LoRa, many standards for wireless communications
    can be employed, including Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-Wave, RFID, Sigfox, and NB-IoT.
    Some of them work well in the short-range (within 100 m), while others are more
    useful to cover long distances (up to tens of kilometers). Examples of the former
    are Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-Wave, and passive and active RFID systems, while in the
    latter, standards are Sigfox and NB-IoT (and LoRa of course). As discussed previously,
    the deployment of a massive number of IoT devices might cause interference problems
    especially for technologies using the unlicensed spectrum, such as ZigBee, Wi-Fi,
    Sigfox, and LoRa. On the other hand, IoT devices operating with a licensed spectrum
    eliminate interference problems but might increase costs significantly. Several
    papers have analyzed different aspects of wireless communication protocols for
    smart agriculture, studying possible applications and comparing their performance.
    For example, ZigBee-based smart agriculture systems are described in [127], [128],
    [129], [130], and [131]. The biggest challenges for ZigBee networks are the limited
    range and increased power consumption (compared to LPWANs) and relatively low
    data rate (e.g., compared to BLE or WiFi). Therefore, ZigBee is better suited
    for small-scale scenarios [130], while the use of this protocol is not suitable
    when the agricultural area is vast and the distance between sensor nodes is large.
    On the other hand, the works [132], [133], [134], [135] represent successful examples
    of NB-IoT applications in smart agriculture. Indeed, extensive coverage, adaptable
    power consumption (depending on the mode of operation), and low interference among
    nodes, are features that make NB-IoT an interesting protocol for various agricultural
    systems [136]. However, NB-IoT employs licensed frequency channels, which results
    in higher subscription prices for the associated system even if it offers a higher
    data throughput than LoRa. Moreover, when there is an existing LTE infrastructure
    already in place, the need for hardware update may be another source of expense
    for such a system. This might be a drawback in the context of smart agriculture
    if the projected return on investment is not high enough to cover these costs
    [137]. Overall, the choice of the communication technology in smart agriculture
    needs to consider many factors and requirements, such as support for roaming,
    suitability of technology to small-scale, medium-scale, and large-scale deployments,
    geographical location, costs, etc. For example, it has been shown that Sigfox
    and LoRaWAN excel on network capacity, battery lifetime, and cost, whereas NB-IoT
    achieves higher quality of service and lower latency [27]. Finally, while LoRaWAN
    has been considered the most suitable communication network for IoT in smart agriculture
    [16], it is still difficult to tell which technology will dominate the market,
    or if several technologies will coexist, perhaps specializing on different application
    domains. SECTION VII. Conclusion Although the expected transition to smart agriculture
    has already begun, researchers around the world are still looking for new solutions
    to improve agricultural productivity through IoT architectures. Indeed, albeit
    applications in agriculture can benefit from the experience gained in Industry
    4.0, they require specific knowledge regarding sensor management, energy optimization,
    and data processing. LoRa technology is widely adopted, as it allows building
    an autonomous network that meets some of the requirements of the smart agriculture,
    such as low-power and long-range communication. The adoption of LoRa-based systems
    in agriculture results in an effective way to improve the connectivity of farms,
    encourage the deployment of DSSs and consequently improve their management, leading
    the agricultural sector toward smart agriculture. In order to provide a more focused
    and comprehensive view of the applications in the field, in this article, we restricted
    our focus to LoRa/LoRaWAN technology and its uses in the context of smart agriculture.
    We presented many LoRa applications in the field, and we discussed some open issues
    and research areas for future improvements. The main challenges analyzed using
    LoRa Technology in smart agriculture, are: latency on the downlink channel, energy
    management, heterogeneity and interoperability of the devices, data management,
    and scalability. All of these can benefit from the use of machine learning algorithms.
    Indeed, AI and edge computing are still scarcely used but related algorithms and
    technologies are now mature and may be successfully applied in this field. Finally,
    the optimization of multiple GW locations and multihop topologies to extend the
    coverage of LoRa networks have been recently tested to further improve the performance
    and coverage. NOTE Open Access funding provided by ‘Università degli Studi di

    has rapidly boosted image and text data. Using image and text matching algorithms,
    computers can match images and texts based on semantic content. Methods use visual
    and textual object co-occurrence data and coarse-level relationships [ 1]. However,
    the fine-level connection between modalities fails without intramodal semantic
    inference. Scene graphs can model intramodal semantic linkages and capture visual–textual
    interactions, essential for interpreting scenes in images and text. One of the
    techniques used in text mining is latent semantic analysis (LSA). The goal of
    latent semantic analysis is to build a set of ideas connected to a collection
    of documents and the terms those documents contain. These concepts can then be
    utilized to investigate the relationships between the documents and the terms
    [ 2]. A matrix with word counts for each document is constructed from a massive
    text (rows represent unique words, and columns represent each document), and a
    mathematical technique known as singular value decomposition is used to reduce
    the number of rows while preserving the similarity structure among the columns.
    This is done to make the matrix more manageable. Divergent thinking response sets
    have always been challenging to analyze because of their inherent open-mindedness
    regarding the number of ideas that may be stated and the number of concepts and
    words used to express each notion. It is well known from cross-disciplinary studies
    that LSA-the number of words can skew-based approaches in response [ 3]. Many
    recent studies have sought, without success, to use LSA to measure the semantic
    distance of answers demonstrating similar levels of divergent thinking. The current
    research contributes to applying LSA to a recent interdisciplinary field smart
    farming. The researchers have provided the 10 promising research areas in the
    smart farming field that need more attention. Farming provides essential needs
    and nutrition to people, a crucial component of an economy. As a result of advancements
    in innovation and science, the agricultural segment underwent another revolution.
    Through the use of automation systems in different exercises, information technology
    has expanded the potential of the agricultural sector [ 4]. As agricultural technology
    develops and advances, advancements like precision farming, GPS, sensor systems,
    and robotics have emerged. Various techniques are used to create automated systems,
    including digital image processing, machine vision, and computer vision. For example,
    using distributed and parallel computing in farming science can reduce computational
    time, leading to faster plant recognition [ 5]. As our population grows exponentially,
    great importance is placed on energy, biological resources, arable land, and water
    to sustain our bodies and nourish us. Since the global population consumes more
    food than farmers can produce, global grain inventories are at their lowest point
    in 30 years. Seventy percent of India’s people rely on farming for their livelihood
    [ 6]. Various crops are grown for high yields and quality fruits and vegetables.
    To cultivate these crops, highly sophisticated techniques are required. Agriculturists
    and other farming specialists have been using computers more frequently recently,
    which will have long-term effects on agricultural software [ 7]. Generally used
    in agribusiness, image analysis is a powerful technique for nondestructive research
    of agricultural products [ 8]. Images have influenced the development of digital
    image-capturing hardware and software. Digital image analysis’s ability to perform
    objective, nondestructive examination is its most significant advantage. There
    are technologies like infrared, ultraviolet, and near-infrared (NIR) that can
    process clear images or dark images for humans (NIR). A digital image is a 2D
    portrayal of a constrained set of digital values. The suitability of “f” for any
    pair of spatial coordinates (x, y) is known as the gray or intensity level of
    a given image at that point [ 9]. Here, x and y are coordinates in space, and
    f (x, y) is the image’s function. In a digital image, the amplitude and coordinates
    are finite and discrete. To process a digital image, a digital computer is required.
    Digital image processing consists of a small set of interconnected parts. There
    is a specific function and value for each part. These components are called pixels,
    images, or picture elements [ 10]. Many different computer algorithms are used
    to process digital images. There are several uses for image processing, including
    enhancing the visual appeal of images and getting them ready for measurement.
    Using satellites, aircraft, and remote sensing to capture images, digital image
    processing techniques were used for farming [ 11]. Computers were used to process
    and analyze these pictures. Because of recent technological breakthroughs in picture
    capture and data processing, imaging approaches have been created to solve various
    issues in the farming industry. Thermal imaging, fluorescence imaging, hyperspectral
    imaging, and photometric (RGB) feature-based imaging are only a few imaging modalities
    that have made substantial contributions [ 12]. Instead of just integrating information
    technology into farming, smart farming emphasizes creating and applying knowledge.
    Information technology should allow agricultural machinery and devices to collect
    and analyze data before making judgments or preparing them semiautomatically [
    13]. It is founded on developing big data technologies, the Internet of Things
    (IoT), satellite observation [ 14], connected data, and artificial intelligence
    (AI) at every stage of the farming supply chain [ 15]. The market for smart farming
    is expected to be worth $23.1 billion globally (including precision farming).
    They employed the Internet to connect various networked devices, such as sensors,
    drivers, and smart objects, to mobile devices [ 16]. Furthermore, IoT services
    share data with intelligent control and decision-making systems due to the widespread
    use of cloud-based remote data collecting. Such talents could offer the smart
    farming sector efficient output. The traditional farming method involves improving
    modernized cultivation while investigating an IoT region of interest in the agricultural
    industry [ 17]. Over the past 10 years, IoT development has provided many benefits
    in every area. Incorporating scalable software, hardware, cost-effective processes,
    autonomous systems, and intelligent decisions are made possible by the IoT [ 18].
    In the agriculture and agribusiness industry, managing vast amounts of data are
    crucial for numerous jobs [ 19]. During harvest season, specialists in vegetable
    trimming, for example, should be faced with a plethora of vegetables. Moreover,
    professionals who employ the increasingly popular organic farming method throughout
    the growing season must manage enormous quantities of fertilizer. Several new
    trends have emerged in recent years, including sensors and the IoT, machine learning
    and AI, robotics and automation, precision agriculture, and sustainable practices.
    With the help of sensors and the IoT, it is possible to collect and analyze data
    about the development of crops, the quality of the soil, the temperature, and
    several other significant factors. With machine learning and AI, it is possible
    to predict food yields, weather patterns, and other variables that affect the
    production of agricultural products. Robots can also perform other labor-intensive
    duties, such as weeding and harvesting. Precision agriculture utilizes technology
    to optimize each plant and field individually instead of treating them all similarly.
    Smart farming research prioritizes sustainability because it can potentially reduce
    the negative environmental impacts of agriculture hence based on these principles,
    our paper contributes to finding the latest trends in smart farming and describing
    the research constituents in this field. The researchers have provided 10 clusters
    based on the high-loading terms fetched from the bag of words. Smart farming is
    an emerging field in the current scenario as it brings a revolution in agriculture,
    and this field needs more attention to increase its impact. This study reviewed
    3,229 published studies on smart farming through LSA, used for semiautomated document
    categorization. Through this experiment, the author predicted ten current research
    areas on which future researchers and practitioners can work to make more impact
    on smart farming. This study also helps researchers to see which areas need more
    attention and provides a road map for future smart farming. 2. Literature Review
    Agriculture 4.0, the fourth agricultural revolution, is paving the way for a more
    sustainable, efficient, and environmentally conscious agricultural system through
    digital technologies [ 20]. Farmers have enhanced their practices and reduced
    their environmental impact due to new agricultural technologies [ 21]. Smart farming
    techniques have advanced in the past decade thanks to smart farming techniques,
    large-scale farming in open areas, farming in controlled conditions, and the rearing
    of dairy animals and poultry [ 22]. “Smart farming” offers more advantages than
    traditional agriculture since it uses cutting-edge technology, improved infrastructure,
    and data collected at every farming process. Implementing sufficient monitoring
    can enhance the quality of the product [ 23]. As one example of how this information
    could be used, imagine being able to predict the arrival of a new pest or illness
    thanks to the information gathered. Preserved data can help bolster farm labor
    force numbers, streamline operations, and reduce pesticide and fertilizer overuse.
    Even the sharing of specialized knowledge among experts in other fields is possible
    with this cutting-edge farming technique. When putting the smart farming approach
    into practice, the phase in which data are collected is a very crucial component
    of the process. Access to relevant database information is helpful when making
    decisions, planning agricultural operations, and allocating tasks [ 24]. However,
    gathering all of the information offered or provided on farms and putting it together
    is a challenging task that requires expertise and prior experience. Those who
    live through farming will have a difficult time with this. There are various approaches
    one can take to obtain information from a farm. Technology-based monitoring and
    development is the primary source of most information required for efficient farming
    [ 25]. A proposed research initiative suggests the implementation of a Smart Farming
    Oriented Big Data Architecture (SFOBA) as a means to enhance decision-making in
    the agricultural sector [ 26]. This approach aims to tackle technical and socioeconomic
    limitations by leveraging big data technologies and IoT. One more research work
    proposes a comprehensive farm architecture combining big data technologies, IoT
    components, and knowledge-based systems [ 27]. It addresses challenges in the
    agriculture industry, focusing on handling small files without impacting computation
    performance. In the same context, another research proposes an AI-based SFOBA
    for smart farming, combining big data technologies, IoT components, and knowledge-based
    systems [ 28]. The architecture ensures system durability and data modeling, transforming
    business needs into analytics. Within farming, the soil is seen as of the utmost
    significance. According to the findings of a study on artificial soil aeration
    conducted in the year 2020, it was discovered that soil aeration improves hypoxic
    conditions and offers advantages to the bacterial populations in the soil and
    the root morphology [ 29]. In a recent study that was carried out in the same
    area, researchers compared the effects of a micro/nanobubble aeration system and
    a subsurface artificial air layer aeration system on plant growth, fruit yield,
    irrigation water-use efficiency, and fruit quality in response to different treatment
    conditions. The studies were carried out under various circumstances [ 30]. In
    one more study, the researchers studied the effect of irrigation strategies on
    fruit yields of greenhouse tomatoes [ 31]. Microsprinkler irrigation, drip irrigation
    under plastic film, and microsprinkler irrigation under plastic film were the
    three methods of irrigation that the researchers looked at to determine how each
    affected the nutritional content of the soil. To circumvent these limitations,
    this study plans to do an systematic literature review (SLR) on the IoT in agriculture
    by mining the Scopus database for relevant articles. The primary goal of this
    research is to develop and deploy a semiautomated literature review that more
    reliably captures recent developments in the field. We undertook a semiautomated,
    quantitative study on the Scopus data thanks to LSA [ 32], a branch of natural
    language processing (NLP) [ 33]. The KNIME tool, used to develop the author’s
    semiautomatic analysis method, is freely available to any researcher [ 34]. This
    study’s assessment of IoT in agriculture is helpful because it summarizes the
    most important aspects and emerging trends in the field. This strategy has been
    used in numerous contexts before to portray growing tendencies and critical nodes
    in numerous areas of study [ 35– 38]. Recent innovations in IoT in farming have
    not been thoroughly studied, but the researchers believe this is due to a lack
    of empirical study. The PRISMA criteria (2009) provide the minimum requirements
    for a systematic review or meta-analysis report. Reporting on the search for examinations,
    screening those studies, eligibility, and inclusion in the study pool is necessary
    for quantitative analysis [ 39, 40]. New standards established for 2020 stipulated
    that SLRs must include checklists, in-depth explanations, and flowcharts [ 41].
    This study adheres to the new PRISMA principles to collect and analyze qualitative
    literature on IoT farming (2020). There are several ways to conduct SLRs, and
    bibliometric analysis is one of the methods in this field. In the direction of
    SLRs, researchers have done a bibliometric analysis on smart farms for the last
    10 years of data starting from 2012 [ 42]. This analysis looks at 489 publications
    that were published between 2012 and 2021. According to the research findings,
    there is a growing body of literature on IoT and agriculture. The most notable
    authors, prolific journals, and productive institutions are all part of the bibliometric
    study that includes the most referenced works. There are three distinct categories
    for collaboration maps. The researchers in 2021 have already conducted an analysis
    using Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), another method for conducting this analysis
    [ 43]. The authors proposed several methods for mining patent databases in search
    of new and unfilled technologies applicable to smart farms. In addition, we propose
    employing network analysis to develop a technical road map for smart farms. In
    another recent study, researchers investigated the current research trends and
    knowledge structures for smart farms. The LDA topic modeling technique analyzed
    the themes covered in 104 academic publications from the Korea Citation Index
    related to smart farms. The evaluation of the keywords and their associations
    was carried out [ 44]. Another method is used for conducting semiautomatic literature
    reviews. As per the best of our knowledge and literature analysis, it is claimed
    that LSA techniques have not been applied to smart farming technology. In NLP,
    LSA is a technique that may be used to recognize and make meaning of a text through
    the use of term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF) metrics (LSA)
    [ 45]. Putting words in a bag is a great way to extract and infer essential relationships.
    Bag of words (BOW) analysis is a powerful technique for analyzing massive amounts
    of text (BOW) [ 46, 47]. LSA is used by academics to systematically examine textual
    content and answer a predetermined research question [ 46]. Furthermore, it has
    been demonstrated that mathematical models can achieve the same results as the
    human mind while processing text [ 48– 50]. The fundamental purpose of this study
    is to foresee and uncover developing tendencies in the IoT in agriculture. Upon
    extensive review, it has been concluded that descriptive research is available
    in smart farming. The researchers have reviewed the field of smart farming by
    using the bibliometric technique, a manual and statistical approach applied to
    data to give overall bibliographic dimensions of the area. In recent studies,
    researchers have involved LDA techniques in various fields like blockchain technology
    (BCT) [ 51], smart cities [ 52], smart agriculture [ 53], and many more. However,
    the LSA techniques are still missing in the smart farming field, which has motivated
    the authors to explore the field of smart farming using LSA technology. In Table
    1, the authors provide a deep insight into existing and current research concepts,
    results, and technology used. Table 1  Analysis of existing and current research.
    While significant progress has been made in this field, some research gaps still
    need to be addressed. Some of the research gaps identified in the field of smart
    farming are as follows: (i) The IoT, AI, edge computing, cloud computing, blockchain,
    and other technologies are all part of smart farming. However, more study is required
    to determine the best ways to combine these tools to boost agricultural productivity
    using smart farming. (ii) Using intelligent devices for soil assessment is an
    emerging field of study that has attracted considerable interest recently. Several
    research gaps must be addressed, including standardization of protocols, calibration
    of smart devices, data validation, data integration from multiple sources, cost-effectiveness,
    user-friendliness, application of smart devices in various soil types and environments,
    and generalizability and utility. (iii) A more concise understanding of this concept
    is required for the security issue and data privacy in smart farming. Moreover,
    a closer look at the literature reveals several gaps and shortcomings in smart
    farming irrigation systems, sustainable smart farming, and climate-smart farming.
    In this article, we do a network analysis of the subject at hand using the Vosviewer
    program and display the resulting image. Following are the research questions
    that are addressed in this study. Research Question 1: Who are the most prominent
    experts in smart farming, and what are the most prominent countries, keywords,
    and publishing houses in this field? Research Question 2: How have IoT capabilities
    changed farming? Research Question 3: What have the most recent developments been,
    and where do you see smart farming headed? The graphical structure of the manuscript
    is represented in Figure 1.    Figure 1  Study design. 3. Methodology In this
    study, the corpus for the experiment is selected by following the PRISMA guidelines,
    which are depicted in Figures 2 and 3, representing the study’s recommended technique.    Figure
    2  Flow diagram of PRISMA guidelines considered for selecting corpus.    Figure
    3  Proposed methodology. 3.1. Selection of String The first step of a SLR is creating
    a string according to Kitchenham and Charters’ guidelines [ 60]. The string was
    constructed by applying Boolean AND/OR logic to the chosen topic and the keywords
    that were found to be relevant. The AND operator on a search query will only return
    articles containing the specified keywords. When you use an OR operator, you will
    get a list of articles with at least one of your chosen keywords. In this analysis,
    the phrases “Farming,” “IOT,” and “internet of things” are central. After applying
    every possible combination of keywords and Boolean operations, the final search
    string looks like as follows: (“IOT” OR “internet of things” OR “smart”) AND (“Farming”).
    3.2. Data Source Though several online libraries might be utilized to search for
    articles on IoT in farming, our investigation relied on Scopus, an extensive and
    trustworthy database [ 61]. Using the final search term, 4,305 results were retrieved
    from Scopus; 3,229 met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were included in the
    analysis. According to the author’s inclusion/exclusion criteria, only studies
    written in English were examined, and those without an abstract, year, or other
    essential details were disregarded. A subset of the collected corpus is shown
    in Figure 4; it consists of a few examples, each with a title, authors, year,
    publishing source, keywords, and abstract.    Figure 4  Corpus sample. 3.3. Tool
    This research used the text-mining capabilities of the open-source application
    KNIME [ 62]. There is a result, the learning curve, and Vosviewer, an open-source
    software application, is used for network analysis [ 63, 64]. Before text can
    be mined from it, it must be preprocessed using KMINE. Words in the document are
    stemmed, stop words are eliminated, and part of speech (POS) tags are added before
    processing begins (only in English) [ 61]. POS tagging generates a token of words
    in the source material (BOW). The LSA relies on words from the BOW dictionary.
    During the normalization process, KNIME’s case converter node is utilized to change
    the case of each document to either lower or upper case. The delicate nature of
    the topic calls for this case conversion to eliminate bias. For example, stop-words
    like is, am, are, etc., which individual has no meaning to be eliminated from
    a document [ 46]. When applied to LSA-based text mining, the stemming process
    helps reduce redundant information, making the operation more efficient [ 65].
    As depicted in Figure 5, the KNIME procedure is utilized for document preprocessing.    Figure

    a meta-analysis and a network analysis to address the questions posed at the article’s
    outset. 4.1. Meta-Analysis Descriptive statistics on the pool of publications
    under consideration are the backbone of any meta-analysis. Corpus contains various
    information regarding the author, countries, source, publication year, etc., so
    the author provided information about the leading author, journals, countries,
    keywords, etc. 4.2. Leading Author from Corpus The top 10 most influential researchers
    in the IoT Farming field are ranked in Table 2 according to the number of documents
    and citations in the chosen corpus. Table 2  Leading author in smart farming.
    This concludes that the author Dr. Anupam Kumar from the “School of Public Policy
    at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi,” has the most significant number
    of articles on IoT farming and has been cited 398 times. 4.3. Publications by
    Year Figure 6 shows that the first articles on “Internet of Things Farming” emerged
    in 1989. Similar to the yearly number of papers contributed, this trend has been
    rising steadily. As a result, it is possible to have as many as 983 publications
    in this area by 2021. This indicates that IoT in agriculture is a dynamic field
    of study. In addition, there has been an uptick in the number of inquiries I have
    received from people curious about beginning sustainable agricultural practices.    Figure
    6  Year-wise publication analysis. 4.4. Publications by Journals Figure 7 shows
    the 10 most-cited journals. About 2.13% of all papers were published in the “Journal
    Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,” which contains the most articles
    (69). As a result, the “Journal Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing”
    has an H-Index of 48 and an impact factor of 0.626.    Figure 7  Top 10 dominating
    journals in GHRM. 4.5. Leading Countries The most prolific publishing nations
    are displayed in Figure 8. Figure 9 displays the top 10 nations by document count
    and by the network connecting them, revealing that India has the most referenced
    research on the subject of IoT Farming, with a total of 11,718 citations for 1,689
    publications [ 66– 68].    Figure 8  Country-wise publication.    Figure 9  IoT
    farming interconnection of countries. Better agricultural opportunities may emerge
    as a result of such international cooperation. Scientists from different countries
    exchange ideas and techniques to improve farming. Keywords can also be analyzed
    via network theory to reveal where a field of study is headed. For some, this
    may also serve as a springboard for further investigation. Figure 10 depicts a
    keyword network analysis.    Figure 10  Keywords analysis. 5. Term Frequency-Inverse
    Document Frequency (TF-IDF) Constructing, from the corpus, a document word matrix
    that lists the absence/presence or frequency of specific terms within a particular
    document can greatly ease textual analysis. Incorporating this matrix into your
    search can help you find frequently used or widely spread expressions. The TF-IDF
    score is calculated for use in this context. Words with a high TF-IDF score were
    found in this study by calculating the TF-IDF score for each article in the corpus
    and looking at which ones had the most weight in comparison. One of the NLP techniques
    used to categorize and summarize text is the “term frequency-inverse document
    frequency” technique (TF-IDF) [ 69– 71]. The methodology is applied to the terms
    retrieved from the relevant corpus to determine how vital those terms are. The
    TF-IDF algorithm uses the frequency with which each term appears in a given document
    to calculate the weights of the terms retrieved from the corpus and included in
    BOW [ 47]. The occurrences of a term in a text are counted using the TF methodology,
    often known as the TF method. Then, the number of instances of the phrase in the
    document is divided by the total number of occurrences in the paper [ 72, 73].
    IDF is a valuable instrument for making this determination. See the following
    equations for the TF-IDF formula. For the corpus used in this study, the TF-IDF
    values were computed automatically using a KNIME workflow using Equations (1)
    and (2). The calculated values are shown in Table 3. Twenty of the most frequent
    terms in BOW were chosen for this study. Table 3  Calculated TF-IDF score for
    3,229 documents. The corpus includes 3,229 articles scraped from Scopus, and 18,804
    tokens were used to construct BOW’s vocabulary. Figure 11 displays the top 20
    most-used phrases from these 18,804 tokens visually.    Figure 11  Top 20 frequent
    terms. The author employed clustering to isolate five key latent subjects from
    the corpus, even though many recovered terms were likely redundant or noisy. The
    produced matrix comprises 18,804 terms by 3,229 columns, with the restriction
    that only the top 20 terms by 3,229 columns may be utilized to represent the data.
    Words with only one occurrence in the corpus populate the matrix. During the transformation,
    terms are given different amounts of weight based on their relative importance
    in the source document. There is a possibility of using the corpus’s TF-IDF scores
    to group-related documents together. 6. Predicting Recent Trends Using K-Means
    Clustering Articles in the Scopus database on IoT farming can be analyzed by grouping
    them, then assigning topics based on terms that load into these groups. After
    K words are extracted from the BOW corpus, they will be clustered using K-means
    to yield a topic solution. For example, Deerwester [ 74] recommends that, for
    a corpus of 3,229 documents, 10 subjects are a fair number of topics. The 10 optimal
    themes and their associated high-loading words are shown in Table 4, which was
    generated using KNIME. Their respective TF-IDF scores can now define each of these
    10 subjects/clusters. Graph coding has been used to represent each cluster to
    represent the K-mean clustering. The shapes used to represent clusters are represented
    in Table 5. Table 5  Cluster coding. Table 4  High-loading article based on cluster.
    During the experiment, authors calculated TF absolute, TF relative, IDF, and TF-IDF
    scores for the boag of words. Based on the TF-IDF score, K-mean clustering is
    applied to identify 10 different clusters. In Figure 12, K-Mean clustering is
    represented graphically.   (a)         (a)  (b)  (c)  (d)         Figure 12  Representation
    of K-mean clustering: (a) TF (abs) vs. TF (rel) values are represented; (b) clusters
    are represented against the TF score; (c) clusters are represented against the
    IDF score; (d) clusters are represented against the TF-IDF score. In Figure 12,
    four types of graphs are shown where in (a) TF (abs) vs. TF (rel) values are represented,
    in (b) clusters are represented against the TF score, in (c) clusters are represented
    against the IDF score, and in (d) clusters are represented against the TF-IDF
    score. These problem descriptions represent emerging tendencies in IoT farming,
    and they can guide future studies in this area. 6.1. Labeling the Clusters K-mean
    clustering can refine the recovered clusters in light of the TF-IDF score by identifying
    the highest-scoring cluster. Then, appropriate labels are assigned to the clusters
    after reviewing the terms included. The results are then sorted into categories
    according to their relative importance, with the former being considered current
    trends on the path of future study and the latter being identified as areas needing
    additional study. Finally, like high-loading items, their associated ratings can
    be grouped (Table 4). 7. Recent Trends and Future Direction in the Field of Smart
    Farming In the subject of smart farming, this is demonstrated by the topics and
    clusters retrieved using K-means clustering applied to TF-IDF scores. 7.1. Cluster
    I: IoT Ecosystem for Smart Farming The United Nations predicts that by 2050, the
    world’s population will have hit 10 billion [ 104]. This results in an ever-increasing
    need for goods and services provided by the Agricultural industry. However, food
    security has become the most pressing international issue due to the worldwide
    decline in arable land, the exhaustion of natural resources, and unexpected environmental
    challenges, including global warming, salinization, and flooding. Environmental
    monitoring applications using sensors to measure air, water, and soil quality
    are examples of how the IoT has significantly impacted the technological and economic
    domains [ 105]. While wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been widely utilized
    in agriculture, laying the groundwork for the advent of “smart farming,” the introduction
    of the IoT in agriculture as an improvement over WSNs has led to a proliferation
    of IoT-related applications in the industry. A few applications of drone technology
    in agriculture include unmanned aerial vehicle farming, farm monitoring, soil
    tracking and tracing analytical data and prediction, and many more [ 106]. However,
    co-op ecosystems have not fully adopted AI and Internet-connected items despite
    the rapid growth of technology. Consequently, an earlier study proposed AI-based
    applications and ontologies that would benefit the ecosystem of smart agriculture
    cooperatives [ 107]. This research also specifies the architecture of the cooperative
    ecosystem, as well as its components, interactions, and agreements, all of which
    are essential for successful collaboration. 7.2. Cluster II: IoT in Precision
    Farming One of the most well-known IoT in agriculture is precision farming. Tracking
    animals, vehicles, fields, and inventories with cutting-edge apps is a great way
    to improve farming precision and management [ 108]. Sensors collect data to determine
    the best farming strategy, allowing farmers to collect and analyze it in real
    time for more informed decisions. Precision farming relies heavily on irrigation,
    livestock, vehicle monitoring, and other techniques [ 109]. Precision farming
    is a technique that considers soil and environmental factors to maximize productivity.
    When the operating data of connected devices are tracked in real time, it is possible
    to see how much water and nutrients are available. Precision farming is based
    on data analysis; these data are captured through the sensors installed on the
    farms. As the data capturing techniques are changed, the traditional methods to
    manage the data are insufficient [ 110]. In a subset of the research study, authors
    addressed the YieldPredict framework, which provides farmers with information
    that can improve their crop yields through more informed decision-making and better
    agricultural planning [ 111]. This study merges preprocessed crop data such as
    soil parameters, area, production, and seasonal rainfall with an existing smart
    farm ontology. These characteristics were chosen because it is possible to gather
    data related to them. In contrast, obtaining information about remote sensing,
    crop genotypes, and vegetation index is more challenging. Traditional database
    management systems cannot store IoT sensor data. Smart farming requires cloud-based
    data storage and an end–to–end IoT platform. These strategies help execute higher-quality
    activities, according to experts. Sensors are the leading IoT data collectors.
    Using analytics tools, the data are reviewed and interpreted. Data analytics can
    analyze weather, livestock, and agricultural conditions [ 112]. The information
    uses additional technological advances, improving conclusions. IoT devices receive
    data from sensors to provide real-time agricultural monitoring. Predictive analytics
    helps you make better harvesting selections. Trend analysis helps farmers plan
    for weather and crop harvesting. Farmers have benefited from IoT since it has
    increased both the amount and quality of their harvests by allowing them to monitor
    better and maintain crop and soil health [ 113]. 7.3. Cluster III: Sustainable
    Smart Farming The domestication of animals and plants occurred a few thousand
    years ago, the use of crop rotations and other improvements in farming practices
    occurred a few hundred years ago, and the “green revolution” with systematic breeding
    and the widespread use of artificial fertilizers and pesticides occurred within
    the last few decades [ 114]. Some examples of major shifts in farming methods
    throughout history include the ones listed here. The growing adoption of ICT in
    farming could herald the beginning of a fourth agricultural revolution [ 115].
    Sustainable farming does more than preserve the planet’s natural resources; it
    also decreases or eliminates emissions of greenhouse gases, boosts soil health
    and fertility, and raises crop yields. At its core, sustainable farming is concerned
    with safeguarding and increasing the Earth’s capacity to produce food, reducing
    emissions, and increasing farm profitability to ensure the financial stability
    of farmers and their communities. Better IoT tools will allow for constant quality
    control and oversight in the farming industry [ 116]. Complex challenges have
    arisen due to a lack of research and development in smart sustainable farming;
    these include the management and operation of IoT/AI equipment, data exchange
    and management, interoperability, and the analysis and storage of massive data.
    7.4. Cluster IV: Security Challenges in Smart Farming The privacy and safety of
    data stored on devices is the most crucial consideration in smart farming. On
    the one hand, “smart farming” has opened up new horizons in the agricultural industry,
    while on the other, cyber-attacks are mushrooming like rabbits throughout the
    landscape. Due to the ease with which a denial-of-service (DoS) attack may be
    executed inside the precision agriculture ecosystem, there is the potential for
    significant repercussions, and a large-scale coordinated attack can destabilize
    national economies. In particular research, the researchers have demonstrated
    that a DoS attack has occurred in the smart farming ecosystem [ 117]. This attack
    can hinder the functionality of a smart farm by interfering with the placed sensors
    on the field. As a result of the proliferation of the IoT, there is a broad spectrum
    of vulnerabilities that can be taken advantage of by cybercriminals and other
    individuals with nefarious intentions (IoT) [ 116]. Even though enhancing utility
    and efficiency is one of the declared goals of the smart farm, there is a possibility
    that its users and specialists could be put in danger if the network is not adequately
    protected [ 118]. The layer-wise security challenges are discussed in Figure 13.
    The IoT is built on a four-tiered architecture. The first layer is the physical
    layer, the second is the edge layer, the third is the cloud layer, and the fourth
    is the communication layer [ 119].    Figure 13  IoT layer and corresponding security
    challenges. 7.5. Cluster V: Smart Irrigation Management System The agricultural
    industry overcame conventional irrigation’s shortcomings thanks to “smart” irrigation
    systems. The various advantages of smart irrigation systems and solutions have
    resulted in their widespread use [ 120]. Farming experts and farmers advocate
    for water-efficient irrigation practices. Smart irrigation is made possible by
    various soil moisture sensors and wireless communication technologies that allow
    for more accurate forecasting and planning in the face of unpredictable weather
    patterns [ 121]. To help conserve water worldwide, smart irrigation systems reduce
    water waste. Future smart irrigation systems will be able to regulate water consumption
    thanks to improvements in sensor technology [ 122]. Smart irrigation is used in
    community botanical gardens, municipal parks, and schoolyards. Smart irrigation
    has completely changed how farmers used to rely on the elements. As a result,
    irrigation practices are changing, and crop yields are rising thanks to new smart
    irrigation technologies [ 123]. Intelligent irrigation systems automatically adjust
    watering schedules and run times to meet the landscape’s needs. These measures
    have a significant impact on water efficiency in the field. The watering schedule
    of conventional irrigation controllers is based on a preprogramed schedule and
    timers [ 124]. On the other hand, smart irrigation controllers use sensors to
    track variables like humidity, temperature, soil moisture, and even the amount
    of water lost through evaporation to determine how much water to supply to individual
    plants. 7.6. Cluster VI: Blockchain-based Cyber-Solutions in Smart Farming Blockchain-based
    supply chain tracking can help prevent foodborne illness. It is a safe way to
    keep track of information that allows for intelligent farming and index-based
    crop insurance [ 125]. It can also reduce transaction costs, enhance farmers’
    market access, and generate more money. In farming and food, blockchain has limits
    despite its enormous potential benefits. By tracking where food cravings originated,
    establishing a trustworthy food supply chain, and fostering mutual trust between
    farmers and their customers, BCT in farming can facilitate the development of
    direct marketplaces for farmers [ 126]. The research in this domain includes precision
    farming, farm safety, agricultural commerce, and food distribution networks. The
    blockchain is maturing into a fully-fledged technology that can be integrated
    into all next-generation Internet intelligent applications. A blockchain’s “nodes”
    are distributed ledgers that ensure data integrity and sincerity [ 127]. Prohibited
    users cannot perform fraudulent transactions since the blockchain network is capable
    of smart contracts and consensus. Another aspect of introducing blockchain in
    smart farming can be a use case of the automatic trigger-based transaction system.
    Blockchain-based smart contracts automatically trigger payments when a condition
    is met without incurring exorbitant transaction fees [ 128]. Farmers may theoretically
    be compensated for their goods as soon as they are delivered without suffering
    significant financial losses. Many farmers have difficulty selling their products
    at a reasonable price. Intermediaries earn the most money with the least amount
    of effort. Smart contracts enable direct communication between farmers and retailers,
    removing the need for intermediaries. They would receive a higher price for their
    wares [ 129]. Farmers can increase their yield by employing big data, cyber-physical
    systems, AI, blockchain, and other technologies to monitor the activities and
    interactions on smart farms. Increasing technological integration increases the
    total number of potential attack vectors [ 130]. To prevent cyberattacks on the
    intelligent agriculture ecosystem, precautions must be taken. This research presents
    an ontology for smart farming that can encode the sensors and interactions unique
    to each farm. The authors constructed a smart farm environment using physical
    components, digital copies, and a representation graph. The dynamics of the relationships
    between the farm’s owner, workers, sensors, and vehicles are categorized and documented.
    7.7. Cluster VII: Climate-Smart Farming (CSF) The climate-smart farming method
    considers global warming and hunger in developing countries. Increasing agricultural
    output is one of CSF’s three goals, with the final goal of improving the food
    and financial security of the world’s poor (75% of whom live in rural areas and
    depend on Farming for their livelihood) [ 131]. The second objective is to reduce
    human vulnerability to climate-related threats like drought, pests, and illnesses.
    Third, increase your resilience to long-term pressures such as shorter seasons
    and climate change. The third phase is to reduce emissions per calorie or kilogram
    of food produced, slow deforestation in agricultural areas, and absorb atmospheric
    carbon dioxide. Despite its sustainable farming base, CSF is distinct from other
    farming methods. First, it addresses global warming [ 132]. Second, CSF evaluates
    the synergies and tradeoffs between productivity, flexibility, and mitigation
    as its second function. Third, CSF seeks additional financial opportunities to
    address the vacuum in investment. Future climate-smart agricultural research could
    lead to a system that uses fewer inputs thanks to the help of high-precision tools
    and approaches, that reduces nutrient loss to the environment by keeping soils
    in place in the fields rather than contributing to erosion, and that reduces and
    mitigates emissions from livestock while still providing enough food to feed a
    growing population [ 133]. 7.8. Cluster VIII: Livestock Precision in Smart Farming
    When it comes to monitoring livestock, smart farming refers to real-time monitoring
    of individual health, welfare, production/reproduction, and environmental influences
    [ 134]. Industry 4.0 relies significantly on innovative production techniques
    like precision livestock husbandry. Precision Livestock Husbandry hosted its first
    annual conference in 2003. It utilizes automated monitoring devices such as sensor
    cameras, microphones, Internet access, wireless communication networks, and other
    computer software programs [ 135]. It also assists farmers in enhancing decision
    management by keeping track of large animals “per animal” and detecting subtle
    but significant changes in behavioral patterns or unrelated parameters. Precision
    Livestock Husbandry aims to improve farm profitability, efficiency, and longevity
    by building a symbiotic relationship between crop and animal farming [ 136]. The
    livestock precision system comprises cameras, microphones, and other sensors for
    tracking animals and specialized computer software. The findings can be quantitative,
    qualitative, or concerned with sustainability issues [ 137]. Future research may
    develop a web-based system for collecting and analyzing the above data to aid
    livestock producers, consultants, and others in making management decisions that
    reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to the web-based framework, BCT can
    be included in the platform to facilitate the growth of cattle farming industry
    characteristics such as data security, privacy, sharing, tracking, and smart contracts
    [ 138]. 7.9. Cluster IX: Soil Assessment Using Smart Devices Monitoring soil conditions
    enables farmers to maximize yield, eliminate disease, and allocate scarce resources
    more effectively. Temperature, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, hydrogen, oxygen,
    water volume, potential, and radiation are measured by networked sensors [ 139].
    IoT-device-integrated sensors transmit data to a distant server or cloud storage
    for further processing. These data can improve farming operations, identify trends,
    and modestly increase yields and quality [ 140]. Optimal crop growth, biotic and
    abiotic stress resilience, and agricultural products can be enhanced by analyzing
    real-time physical and chemical soil data, such as temperature, moisture, pH,
    and pollutants, utilizing sensors and plant wearables [ 141]. The agricultural
    soil sensors include temperature, moisture, organic matter, pH, insect/pest, and
    soil pollutant sensors. In addition, IoT-based sensors are put in the soil to
    monitor the quality of the ground and assess its appropriateness for various crops.
    This enhances the operation of the agricultural sector by providing the most significant
    possibilities for producing error-free products, resulting in an overall improvement
    [ 142]. Thanks to technological advancements, farmers can now access a complete
    package that analyses soil quality and offers various farming tactics. Precision
    Farming comprises several strategies that make it feasible to adopt intelligent
    measures to increase the overall efficiency of farming. Smart Greenhouse Farming
    is the future of soil evaluation utilizing intelligent instruments. Smart greenhouses
    use IoT to control agricultural production areas autonomously [ 143]. This reduces
    weather hurdles and predator danger, protecting crops at any cost. The autonomous
    feature of intelligent greenhouses provides farmers with real-time insights and
    increases efficiency. It has intelligent sensors, gateway communication, and an
    intuitive interface for monitoring irrigation, lighting, humidity, temperature,
    and crop activities. 7.10. Cluster X: Edge and Cloud Computing in Smart Farming
    Due to technological improvements, smaller and more precise sensors are becoming
    increasingly practical and utilized in several scenarios [ 144]. The rapid adoption
    of IoT and cloud computing has led to “smart” healthcare systems, cities, mobility,
    grid, homes, metering, etc. Farmers in India, China, and other developing nations
    depend primarily on their crops for survival and export. Farmers and the government
    would benefit from using IoT and cloud computing in farming since it would assist
    in controlling expenses, monitoring performance, and improving maintenance [ 145].
    As digital transformation continues, edge computing is becoming increasingly popular
    in many fields. Smart farming is now getting increasingly popular because of edge
    computing technology. In farming, edge computing is faster and more efficient
    than cloud infrastructure. Smart farming and computing at the network’s edge can
    help precision farming [ 146]. Edge computing allows farmers to improve how they
    run their businesses and make their operations more efficient, which in turn helps
    them cut costs. Much like its contemporaries in “Edge Computing,” cloud computing
    is a dynamic and rapidly expanding sector of the IT industry [ 147]. Technology
    has advanced thanks to the creation of cloud services, which enable on-demand
    access to resources, virtualization, and scalability. Utility computing, virtualization,
    and service-oriented architecture are all characteristics of cloud computing.
    IT services are available pay-as-you-go via Internet-based “Cloud” infrastructures.
    The evolution and administration of cloud computing on farms are the subjects
    of this investigation [ 148]. The potential of cloud computing in other fields,
    such as farming and medicine, is also highlighted. 8. Conclusion With IoT, farming
    has become data-driven, enabling timely, cost-effective, and ecologically sustainable
    farm management. Thus, developing countries whose GDP depends on farming must
    include IoT in farming. Developing nations lack the infrastructure for precision
    farming; hence, a methodological paradigm is needed to connect ground sensors
    to compute nodes cost-effectively, considering data processing limits and constraints.
    Crop yields are lowered by natural disasters, peasants, careless seed planting,
    erratic watering, and locust infestations. Farmers face significant challenges
    due to soil erosion, biodiversity loss, and increased food demand. Farmers often
    give up and accept less than they deserve when faced with difficulties of this
    nature. Farmers must adopt IoT to keep constant tabs on their crops and turn forth
    delicious food. In this work, the authors conducted a comprehensive literature
    review utilizing a data mining technique from NLP. They identified 10 distinct
    areas where smart farming and farming are currently progressing. Trends in these
    areas can help and guide the efforts of present and future researchers. Data Availability

    I. Introduction Cyber-physical systems (CPS) represent an emerging generation
    of engineered systems that are built from, and depend upon, seamlessly integrated
    computing, communication, and control technologies [1]. The first notion of CPS
    takes us back to 1941 when, soon after the invention of Z3, the first fully functional
    program-controlled computation machine was developed by Konrad Zuse for the survey
    of aircraft wings [2]. Later, in the 1990s, with the technological advances in
    sensors, instrumentation, networking, and embedded computing, much greater interest
    in enabling interactions between computational and physical systems began to emerge
    [1]. Around 2006, “cyber-physical systems” found its formal name at the National
    Science Foundation in the United States [3]. The widespread exploration of CPS
    is motivating customer-focused and intelligent solutions in many industries: from
    home automation [4], smart city [5], and energy management [6] to health services
    [7], transportation [8], agriculture [9], and entertainment [10]. Disruptive innovations
    have been possible in CPS due to their ability to enable interactions between
    different components within systems [11] with one another through digital platforms,
    e.g., blockchain [12], to make well-informed, real-time, and intelligent decisions
    in the physical world. This can be demonstrated via two simple examples: (i) In
    the energy sector, energy users with distributed energy resources - such as rooftop
    solar panels and batteries - can interact with one another in the virtual layer
    (digital platform) of a smart grid to decide on various energy trading parameters
    and exchange electricity with one another for the negotiated price over the distribution
    network (physical system) [13]. (ii) Similarly, in the transportation system,
    vehicles can interact with one another and with road-side intelligent nodes through
    a digital platform while on the road and can have real-time information on traffic
    and estimated travel time across different routes that enable them to take the
    best possible path (physical) to reach their destination. The usefulness of the
    CPS springs from their properties of interoperability, connectivity, networking
    capability, communication, decentralization, autonomy, and modularity [14]. Interoperability
    allows a CPS to exchange mutually understandable data between its components whereas
    connectivity between components via various communication protocols enables this
    exchange. A unique characteristic of CPS is their modularity which enables a CPS
    to change and reconfigure its response in accordance with the users’ needs and
    convenience. For that purpose, a CPS — an interconnected network of components
    or subsystems — needs to have networking capability for all subsystems to interact
    with one another simultaneously to complete target actions without losing their
    autonomy in decision-making and decentralized control capabilities. This direct
    interaction of different components with one another for making real-time decisions
    characterizes the uniqueness of CPS [15] compared to traditional critical infrastructure
    systems. At the same time, it also poses the challenges of modeling the decision-making
    process of each agent within a CPS to maximize the combined benefits while maintaining
    system constraints [16]. In particular, in cases where rational agents with conflicting
    interests interact with one another, it becomes an extremely challenging task
    to model their complex interaction by deciding whether they should either cooperate
    or compete with one another to attain specific objectives. Examples of such objectives
    include, but are not limited to, reducing costs [17], maximizing revenue [18],
    balancing supply and demand [19], confirming reliability and security of the system
    [20], promote visibility and care [21], and ensuring the sustainability of the
    environment and system operation [22]. This necessitates such a decision-making
    process to be based on solid mathematical foundations that can ensure an efficient
    and secure operation of the CPS. Given this context, game theory is a natural
    approach to model interactive decision-making in CPS. Game theory is a formal
    analytical and conceptual framework with a mathematical toolset that enables it
    to model complex interactions among self-interested players [23]. It has been
    used in a wide variety of disciplines including economics [24], finance [25],
    operational research [26], energy [27], social science [28], political science
    [29], psychology [30], military [31], and retail markets [32] for several decades.
    In recent times, a large volume of interesting research has also been reported
    in the literature focusing on game-theoretic approaches for CPS [33]. Since the
    types of CPS are diverse due to their difference in applications and the pattern
    of agents’ interactions within each system, the key research question that arises
    is whether it is possible to grasp the entire scope of how game theory can be
    used to model the operation of CPS. To answer this question, this paper provides
    a comprehensive understanding of the state-of-the-art game-theoretic research
    in the area of CPS to help researchers: 1) to conduct new research requiring agent
    interactions within the CPS, 2) to be prepared to address new challenges that
    may arise in CPS, 3) to design and implement operational algorithms for CPS that
    are efficient and cost-effective, and 4) to develop new services that can be offered
    by CPS. By presenting clear insights into the recent advances in the game-theoretic
    study of CPS, this article can be helpful for new researchers in the area of energy,
    engineering, economics, signal processing, medicine, agriculture, and transportation.
    The main contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows: We provide a
    detailed background of different types of CPS and their general structure. We
    comprehensively discuss different types of game-theoretic approaches that are
    suitable for and have been used in CPS research. We identify and explain the relevance
    of game theory for CPS given their various characteristics. We review how game
    theory has been used in different areas of CPS research. We identify and discuss
    a number of challenges for future CPS implementations that can be addressed by
    using game theory. We note that there are several recent survey papers that are
    relevant to CPS research. For example, in [16], the authors have discussed how
    game theory can contribute to shaping the future of peer-to-peer energy sharing
    in the electricity market. The operational requirements of communication networks
    for electric system automation are featured in [34]. In [35], the authors have
    provided an overview of CPS research from a closed-loop system perspective. A
    comprehensive overview of the properties of CPS and guidance on how a CPS architecture
    can be tailored from a provided framework are discussed in [36]. The Reliability
    and security issues of CPS are surveyed in [37], [38], and [39]. A review of blockchain-based
    security and operation of CPS is given by the authors in [40] and detailed explanations
    of the relevance of CPS for industrial processes can be found in [41]. Clearly,
    these reviews have contributed significantly to the body of CPS knowledge giving
    researchers a good understanding of various aspects of CPS. Their foci are either
    on a specific area of CPS such as energy systems and industrial CPS or on a particular
    property of a CPS such as security. Thus, they are more suitable for readers who
    have some prior knowledge of different types of CPS and their characteristics.
    This paper, on the other hand, is written for readers with no (or very limited)
    knowledge of CPS and applications of game theory in CPS research. Therefore, we
    first provide readers with necessary background information on different types
    of CPS and their general structure. Then, after a discussion of some elements
    of game theory, we illustrate why game theory is one of the most relevant approaches
    to deal with challenges in CPS research and how existing studies have utilized
    it. Further, this paper differs from existing review articles in terms of the
    arrangement of contents, the focus of discussion, and the identification and explanation
    of future challenges. We note that experienced researchers will also benefit from
    this work to enhance their comprehension of the topic. The rest of the paper is
    organized as follows. In Section II, we provide a comprehensive background on
    CPS followed by a review of different game theoretic approaches in Section III.
    The relevance of game theoretic approaches in CPS research and a detailed overview
    of applications of game theory in various CPS research are given in Section IV.
    Finally, the paper is concluded in Section V. SECTION II. Overview of Cyber-Physical
    Systems As an emerging research area, investigations of CPS involve multiple overlapping
    disciplines of science and engineering. Consequently, the formal definition of
    the CPS has also evolved based on different perspectives from different scholars.
    In [42], CPS is defined as a technical platform where physical processes affect
    computations through a feedback loop and vice versa [43]. The authors in [44]
    defined CPS as a network physical engineering system that monitors and controls
    the operations of physical systems through computations. In summary, a CPS is
    a system that features a compact combination of, and coordination between physical
    systems and digitally networked systems [45] through a feedback loop. In this
    paper, we formally define CPS as follows: Definition 1:A CPS is a system that
    brings both a physical system and a digital (or cyber) networked system together
    under the same framework, where the activities in the physical system can be monitored,
    analyzed, and controlled by the computational ability, agility, and adaptability
    of the digitally networked system, via communication through a feedback loop between
    the two systems. A completely autonomous CPS can learn from the surroundings and
    make decisions and operate independently in real-time, whereas a semi-autonomous
    system operates independently only in pre-defined conditions. A. Architecture
    The architecture of a CPS depends on its type and functionalities. However, according
    to the definition, each CPS, in general, needs to 1) create a digital twin of
    its physical structure for real-time monitoring and analysis, 2) have an intelligent
    control unit for estimation and decision-making, and 3) a unit for executing algorithms
    to execute the decision in the physical structure through a feedback control loop.
    To perform these regular applications, the architecture of a CPS has five levels,
    as shown in Fig. 1, irrespective of its specific type and purpose [46]. These
    are a smart connection level; a data-to-information conversion level; a cyber
    level; a cognition level; and a configuration level. FIGURE 1. This figure gives
    an illustration of how different levels integrate the cyber and physical spaces
    of an operational CPS - inspired by [46]. These levels enable CPS to collect real-time
    data from the physical world, construct cyberspace (digital twin), and provide
    analytics and computational capabilities in cyberspace to create control signals
    to manage the physical system for specific tasks and objectives. Show All 1) Smart
    Connection Level To create a digital domain of a physical system for monitoring,
    analysis, and decision-making purposes, the first step is to acquire accurate
    and reliable data from different components of the physical system [47]. For accurate
    collection and measurement, IoT has become popular as the data acquisition tool
    [48]. The concept of IoT is derived from networked smart devices [49], and an
    integrated IoT allows the monitoring and sensing of various environmental and
    mechanical parameters of a CPS in real-time, collecting the information accurately,
    and passing the information to the server through using appropriate communication
    protocols, e.g., 5G [50]. Two important factors need to be considered in the smart
    communication level of the CPS. First, considering various types of data that
    stem from different components of the CPS, a seamless and tether-free method for
    the acquisition of data needs to be established [51]. Second, secured communication
    protocols need to be confirmed for data transfer from the IoT devices to the server
    [52]. Further, selecting appropriate sensors (specifications) to collect data
    from different machinery and components is also important [46]. 2) Data-to-Information
    Conversion Level Timely access to data and information is the key to the success
    of any business and it is also true for the successful implementation of the CPS.
    Data conversion aims to discover correlations and hidden patterns with the purpose
    of extracting useful information. Collected data from different components of
    the CPS can be divided into three types [53]: structured data, semi-structured
    data, and unstructured data. For structured data, a distributed database system
    is used for management and storing purposes. To store unstructured data, Hadoop
    distributed file system and not only structured query language is popularly used
    [53]. Finally, semi-structured data are unified into a standardized format by
    extensible markup language and stored in either a relational database management
    system or distributed database system. To extract meaningful information from
    the acquired data, an effective data-to-information conversation level is needed.
    The most widespread technique is data mining [54]. In general, data mining techniques
    analyze large volumes of data to discover useful, interesting, and valuable structures
    [55]. Popular data mining techniques that have been used in the CPS include clustering
    [56], classification and regression [57], artificial intelligence [58], deep learning
    [59], Bayesian learning [60], and machine learning [61]. 3) Cyber Level The cyber
    level is the central information hub [46], where information is being pushed from
    every connected component within the network to form the digital twin of the physical
    structure [62]. According to IBM [63], a digital twin is a virtual representation
    of a system that is built and updated from real-time data and uses simulation
    [64], machine learning [65], and reasoning [66] to assist decision-making. Hence,
    all information is being managed, analyzed, and benchmarked in this level of the
    CPS which helps to optimize the decision made at the cognitive level. Unfortunately,
    this level is also the primary target of hackers and prone to security breaches
    [67]. As a result, the security of the cyber level is of paramount importance
    for a secured and optimal operation of the overall CPS [68], [69]. Extensive research
    on the cyber-physical system security has been reported for green buildings [70],
    smart grids [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], transportation systems [76], [77], [78],
    medical CPS [79], [80], [81], autonomous robot system [82], [83], [84], smart
    city [85], [86], [87], and smart agricultural system [88], [89], [90]. 4) Cognition
    Level This level of a CPS helps to take correct decisions about actions in the
    physical structure of the system. Decisions are taken based on comprehensive knowledge
    of the monitored system and the analyzed information at the cyber level [46].
    CPS addresses issues relevant to both human and artificial cognition. For example,
    CPS can take over particular cognitive tasks from the users, and through the exchange
    of information with them, it can produce the necessary useful outputs [91]. In
    doing so, the cognitive level relies on various computational models [45], develops
    algorithms [92], and produces control signals to execute various actions in the
    physical structure of the CPS. 5) Configuration Level Configuration level acts
    as a supervisory control of the overall CPS [46] that applies the corrective and
    preventive decisions taken in the cognition level to the physical space of the
    CPS. Thus, if there is any change in the circumstances in the physical space,
    it is monitored, recorded, and analyzed at the cyber level and subsequent necessary
    actions are planned at the cognition level. Then, to adjust the quality and efficiency
    required for the newly adopted circumstances, the configuration level executes
    necessary control actions in the physical space [93]. B. Attributes The five-level
    architecture empowers CPS with various attributes to efficiently function in different
    application domains. Examples of such attributes include adaptive control, data-driven,
    predictive maintenance, inter-connection between systems, Internet-of-Things,
    real-time monitoring and control, human-machine interaction, and security and
    privacy. 1) Adaptive Control Adaptive control can be defined as the ability of
    a CPS to modify its mode of action with the changing environmental factors to
    achieve the best possible outcome. For example, in medical CPS, respiratory modules
    are used to assist patients to breathe. These modules are capable of tracking
    time-varying target pressure, estimating the hose characteristics of the module,
    and adjusting the pressure over the hose according to the need of the patient
    [94]. In smart agricultural and autonomous robotic systems, applications of adaptive
    control can be found in irrigation and moisture distribution [95] and military
    surveillance and intervention [96] respectively. Similarly, adaptive control is
    used in green buildings for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC)
    and lighting control based on occupancy [97], in smart grids for price-signal
    enabled demand response [98], in transportation for coordinated control of electric
    vehicles [99], and in manufacturing for laser welding and additive manufacturing
    [100]. 2) Data-Driven Since the beginning, data has been an integral part of the
    CPS. The working principle of a CPS revolves around interactions between the physical
    and cyber systems enabled by the flow of data between them. Thus, CPS can alternatively
    be defined as a data-driven system. The management, control, and performance of
    different subsystems in a CPS are therefore highly impacted by the data obtained
    from different relevant sources and a large number of data-driven techniques and
    algorithms have been proposed over the last decade. For example, in the smart
    grid, the security of the CPS is a major concern and data-driven approaches have
    been used to address this issue [101]. In green buildings, heuristic data-driven
    algorithms are used to control the set-point temperatures of air-conditioning
    systems based on environmental conditions and people’s preferences to reduce the
    electricity bill [102]. In [103], the authors have discussed the importance and
    use of IoT data for medical imaging, whereas similar applications of data in a
    smart city are shown in [104] and [105]. The extensive application of data has
    also been demonstrated in transportation systems [106], robotics systems [107],
    agricultural system [108], and industry 4.0 [109]. Another important aspect of
    these data-driven CPS is the reliability of the data. With the recent emergence
    of affordable sensors and sophisticated data acquisition systems along with better
    communication speed, it is now possible to collect the large amount of data produced
    by the inter-connected facilities of the CPS. For example, a single machine in
    a manufacturing plant can generate thousands of production and health monitoring
    information within seconds that can be translated to several trillions of records
    of data per year [110]. Since, these data are being used by the cyber and cognition
    systems of a CPS to have an overall understanding of the current state of the
    physical system, forecast the variation of different environmental parameters,
    and subsequently decide the action plans to control various appliances of the
    physical systems, the reliability of data is of paramount importance in CPS [111].
    Examples of recent research that discussed the reliability of data acquisition,
    data communication, and data processing in the CPS can be found in [112] and [113].
    3) Predictive Maintenance Extensive use of data enables CPS to perform predictive
    maintenance, which is a technique that utilizes data analysis tools and techniques
    to identify anomalies in the operation of different subsystems and estimate possible
    defects in equipment and processes to fix them before failure. Predictive maintenance
    has been successfully done in green buildings for HVAC and home automation systems
    using machine learning techniques [114] and found its application in medium voltage
    switch gear to enable energy and mobility revolutions in the smart grid [115].
    In the transportation sector, such as in railways, faults in the pantograph and
    catenary systems significantly increase the risk of fatal incidents. Periodic
    or post-fault maintenance of these systems is also expensive. Hence, by obtaining
    data from the railway, predictive maintenance not only reduces the cost of sustenance
    but also reduces the probability of casualty substantially [116]. Further applications
    of predictive maintenance can also be found in manufacturing plants. For instance,
    in [117], an online technique is developed for real-time anomaly detection of
    equipment in a manufacturing plant using hierarchical temporal memory that can
    learn and adapt continuously and robust to noise. Similarly, predictive maintenance
    can also contribute to improving the performance of the CPS in medical [118],
    agriculture [119], and robotics [120]. 4) Inter-Connection Between Systems An
    important trait of CPS is the interconnectivity between its different elements.
    In a smart city, for example, green buildings with smart building management and
    automation system are connected with one another and can share energy, water,
    and other resources among themselves [121]. An example of such a community is
    shown in Fig. 2. By communicating with one another, different agents within a
    CPS interact to achieve individual and collaborative goals by taking informed
    actions. In doing so, each may act selfishly and competes with other agents with
    limited or complete access to environmental information and others’ action plans
    to achieve its own objectives such as reduction in cost [122], balancing between
    demand and supply of resources [123], increase access to community resources [124],
    and improve communication for critical operations [125]. On other hand, agents
    may also work together and cooperatively take decisions to obtain goals that bring
    collective benefit to the overall CPS. Examples of such cooperation are available
    in green buildings [126], robotics [127], smart grid [128], transportation system
    [129], and manufacturing plants [130]. FIGURE 2. An illustration of how different
    green buildings of a smart city can be interconnected with one another and share
    resources among themselves for self-sustainability. Show All 5) Internet of Things
    The interconnection and transfer of data between different subsystems of CPS have
    been possible due to the emergence of IoT (Internet of Things). IoT can be defined
    as the wireless network that enables the pervasive presence of a variety of objects
    (or things) through Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, sensors, actuators,
    and mobile phones and makes the objects interact with one another and cooperate
    with their neighboring objects to attain the common objectives [131]. The application
    of IoT is critical and extensive in the CPS. For example, IoT’s highly integrated
    and open nature is ideal for smart agriculture that enables integration of autonomous
    equipment from various organizations for irrigation, weather forecasting, and
    social media stream for rapid events including threats, floods, and earthquakes
    detection [132]. By providing a platform for communication between different appliances
    within green buildings, IoT can not only help the owners of the building to reduce
    the use of unnecessary resources and thus cost [133] but also enable them to share
    the unused resources with other peers within the community for better sustainability
    [134]. Typical examples of such roles of green buildings are found in smart cities
    [135] and smart grids [13]. In robotics, IoT has been proven to be essential for
    designing multi-robot systems in industrial and academic areas [136]. In particular,
    the localization of robots is more reliable when robots can cooperate with an
    IoT-based smart environment [137]. Further, detailed discussions on the application
    of IoT for manufacturing and medical services can be found in [138] and [139].
    6) Real-Time Monitoring and Control The use of IoT has made it possible for the
    CPS to monitor the function of its different subsystems in real-time, timely acknowledge
    the variations in environmental framework, and take perceptive and intelligent
    decisions accordingly. Through the use of digital twins, now it is possible in
    large manufacturing plants to scrutinize and mentor every stage of the production
    process to ensure mass production of high-quality commodities in shorter time
    frames [140]. Continuous monitoring of critical patients and providing real-time
    telemedicine services either onsite or remotely is also possible now in medical
    CPS. For example, in [141], the authors argue that telemedicine could be an effective
    way to improve the overall health care of cardiovascular disease with a reduced
    health cost, while [142] shows how real-time monitoring of patients conditions
    can save many lives through automatic management of oxygen saturation. Continuous
    monitoring of activities of different subsystems and control of their actions
    for more productive outcomes are also very common in green buildings [143] - for
    HVAC, lighting, and flexible appliances control; smart grid [144] - for auditing
    of phase measurement units and security; transportations [145] - for coordinated
    charging and discharging of electric vehicles; agriculture [146] - for adaptive
    irrigation; and robotics [147] - for localization and routing control. 7) Human-Machine
    Interaction Human-machine interaction (HMI) refers to the communication and synergy
    between a human and a machine that is usually done through a graphical user interface.
    The agent-based architecture of the CPS enables its different agents to directly
    communicate with humans to take instructions for accomplishing certain tasks.
    Extensive use of HMI can be found in medical CPS, smart grid, robotics, transportation,
    and manufacturing. In medicine, for instance, in [148], the authors present a
    touchless and gesture-based HMI framework for the operating room to enable surgeons
    to define a personalized set of gestures to control the arbitrary medical computerized
    systems. HMI also finds its application for smart grids where energy customers
    directly set their preferences over the web [149] to set parameters and preferences
    for participating in demand response programs. In robotics, HMI is used for designing
    rehabilitation robots and socially assistive robots to augment the efforts of
    caregivers, parents, and educators [150]. The practice of HMI can be found in
    developing automated vehicles [151] and digital twin-based smart manufacturing
    [152] in the domain of transportation and manufacturing respectively. Finally,
    HMI is also used in precision agriculture for the real-time display of various
    sensor data on temperature, humidity, and solar irradiation and enabling users
    to control the overall agricultural CPS [153]. 8) Security and Privacy Due to
    the highly interactive nature of the decision-making process and significant use
    of data, maintaining the security of the system and preserving users’ privacy
    have become major concerns for CPS. It is estimated in [154] that cybercrime will
    cost the world about $ 10.5 trillion annually by 2025. In particular, smart grids,
    smart cities, green buildings, medical facilities, agricultural farms, and manufacturing
    plants are most vulnerable to cyber attacks for extensive use of IoT, where controlling
    and monitoring are based on Internet-based protocols. As such to maintain the
    secured operation of CPS, novel preventive methodologies and security architectures
    are developed. For example, in [155], the authors demonstrated how artificial
    intelligence can be utilized as a key tool to save green buildings from cyber
    attacks. Artificial intelligence is also proven to be very effective in protecting
    smart grids, intelligent vehicles, and smart cities from hackers by developing
    adaptive baseline behavior models, effectively detecting new, unknown attacks
    by combining known and unknown data sets based on predictive analytics and machine
    intelligence, as discussed in [156], [157], and [158] respectively. Other examples
    of technical approaches that have been used to develop security measures for CPS
    include big data analysis [159], cryptography [160], machine learning [161], deep
    learning [162], and distributed ledger technology [163]. Importantly also, for
    making data available from CPS, and sharing, provably private transformations
    are required that retain data utility, a comprehensive survey of such relevant
    differentially private techniques for CPS is provided in [164]. A short review
    of the attributes of CPS that make game theory an appropriate tool to model its
    decision-making and control framework is given in Table 1. TABLE 1 Summary of
    Attributes of CPS That Make Game Theory an Appropriate Tool to Model its Decision-Making
    and Control Framework C. Types Different attributes enable CPS to operate in different
    application domains. Depending on these applications, there are different types
    of CPS that operate either independently or in a coordinated fashion to deliver
    services that are environmentally friendly, reliable, secured, efficient, agile,
    and cost-effective. The purpose of this section is to introduce the readers to
    selected CPS that have particularly found many game theoretic applications. 1)
    Green Buildings Green buildings - also known as smart or intelligent buildings
    - are buildings with capabilities to gather information and respond to it [165].
    With a major focus on sustainability, green buildings are equipped with modern
    technologies including 5G, artificial intelligence, Internet-of-Things (IoT),
    and cloud and edge computing that make them energy efficient and human friendly
    [166]. Like other CPS, the building management system (BMS) in a green building
    monitors the building’s health and environment in real-time through its data collection
    systems (IoT and sensors), measures the physical built environment, and sends
    data to its control center for analysis and operational control of the building
    [48]. Key mechanics that shift the building paradigm from ordinary buildings to
    smart buildings include 1) IoT for seamless integration and processing of building
    environmental parameters such as temperature, noise, humidity, electricity and
    water flow, human activity information, and estimation of energy usage [48]; 2)
    BMS for controlling building operation according to human needs and activities
    [167]; 3) Flexible loads for scheduling and administering of household activities
    [168]; 4) big data management for analysis and forecasting [169]; 5) artificial
    intelligence for automatic, well-informed, and real-time decision making [170];
    and 6) distributed energy resources for increasing use and management of green
    energy [171]. A graphical illustration of green buildings is shown in Fig. 3.
    FIGURE 3. This figure gives a graphical illustration of a green building. The
    building is equipped with flexible loads and distributed energy resources. The
    intelligent building management system received real-time information about the
    building’s environment through its IoT system and makes intelligent and real-time
    informed decisions using artificial intelligence techniques based on the received
    big data. Show All 2) Smart Grid A smart grid - also known as smart power grid
    [173] - utilized modern information technologies to deliver power more efficiently
    by responding to a large spectrum of conditions and events. According to the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [174], the smart grid consists of
    seven domains including customers, markets, service providers, operations, bulk
    generation, transmission, and distribution (Fig. 4). The heart of the smart grid
    that reflects its properties as a CPS is the smart infrastructure system consisting
    of a smart energy subsystem, smart information subsystem, and smart communication
    subsystem [175]. The smart energy subsystem enables advanced power generation,
    distribution, and consumption. In contrast to the traditional power grid, the
    power generation and flow pattern are more flexible in the smart grid due to the
    integration of distributed energy resources [176]. However, flexibility in power
    generation also makes power flow control much more complicated. The role of the
    smart information subsystem is to provide advanced information management [177]
    including data modeling, information analysis, integration, and optimization,
    enables business settlement and transactions [178], and facilitate real-time monitoring
    and management of devices in the smart grid [179]. The smart communication subsystem
    of the smart grid provides the platform for connectivity and information transmission
    among systems, devices, and applications. The communication subsystem consists
    of different types of networks including enterprise bus, wide area networks, field
    area networks, and premises networks. For efficient operation of the smart grid,
    it is important that the communication subsystem supports the Quality of Service
    of data [180], is highly reliable with a high coverage [181], and guarantees security
    and privacy. FIGURE 4. This figure gives a graphical illustration of the conceptual
    model of smart grid as proposed by the NIST [172]. Show All 3) Intelligent Transportation
    Systems The idea of intelligent transportation systems was conceptualized and
    developed in the 1980s when cognitive information was incorporated into the road
    infrastructure and vehicle [182]. Since then, the transport sector has evolved
    immensely. In particular, as accidents and fatalities that are affecting both
    the economy and environment adversely in rising every year [183], the need for
    next-generation transportation systems in air traffic, car control, and railway
    leveraging advanced computing and sensing capabilities has increased significantly
    to improve safety and throughput. Now, intelligent transportation systems can
    enable vehicles to avoid traffic congestion [184], reduce energy and land consumption
    [182], improve driving control, safety, and security [185], act as a distributed
    energy resources to provide a balance between electricity demand and supply [186]
    and reduce cost (or, increase benefit) for the vehicle owner [187], and improve
    environmental sustainability [188]. Disrupting technologies and innovating tools
    that are contributing to revolutionizing the transport system for a safer and
    greener future include in-vehicle sensor technology [189], in-roadway sensors
    [190] and over-highway sensor technologies [191], IoT and cloud services [192],
    tools for big data analysis [193], artificial intelligence [194], traffic sensing
    technologies [195], distributed ledger technology for transportations [185], and
    vehicle-to-vehicle communication and network [196]. 4) Tele-Medical Systems Tele-medical
    systems are networked systems of medical devices that provide life-critical and
    context-aware services in hospitals for high-quality continuous care for patients
    [197]. For example, at present, the advancement in medical sensors, wireless sensor
    networks, and cloud computing has transformed the monitoring and computation processes
    of a stand-alone system to a remote monitoring system by overcoming the geographical
    barrier [198]. Thus, it is now possible to provide patients with both in-home
    and in-hospital care. The Tele-medical system also provides a platform for using
    necessary computational resources to make intelligent decisions about a patient’s
    conditions based on the analysis of the patient’s historic data from the digital
    record and real-time data from smart devices and bio-sensors based monitoring
    systems [199]. To successfully provide life-critical services, a typical Tele-medical
    system architecture consists of four layers [79] including a data acquisition
    layer, data concentration/aggregation layer, cloud processing, and storage layer,
    and action layer. The data acquisition layer is responsible for collecting patient
    medical information and passing this information to nearby computationally-capable
    devices. The data concentration/aggregation layer concentrates data from each
    device in the data acquisition layer, aggregates them, and sends them to the cloud.
    Cloud processing and storage layer securely store patient information in the cloud,
    process the data following the privacy-preserving procedure, and uses advanced
    analytics to support health professionals to make informed decisions about patients.
    Finally, the action layer provides either passive (ECG monitoring) or active actions
    (robot-assisted surgery [200]) for the medical treatment of patients. An overview
    of these four layers is shown in Fig. 5. FIGURE 5. This figure gives a graphical
    illustration of four layers of a Tele-medical system including data acquisition
    layer, data concentration/aggregation layer, cloud processing, and storage layer,
    and action layer. These layers enable a Tele-medical system to collect patient
    information, aggregate it, and process it to make actionable items to save lives.
    Show All 5) Autonomous Robotic Systems (UAV/UGV) Autonomous robotic systems such
    as unmanned air vehicles (UAV) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) are becoming
    very popular as the next generation CPS [201]. A UAV is commonly known as a drone,
    which can fly like an aircraft without any human pilot or any person on board
    [202]. UGVs, on the other hand, are robotic systems that operate on land without
    any onboard human operator [203]. Thus, as the term “unmanned” indicates, both
    UAV and UGV operate without an onboard human operator but may be controlled through
    a fixed control station [204]. Some unmanned systems also act completely autonomously
    without any human intervention during their operation [205]. Autonomous robots
    can travel either between two pre-defined points or need to adapt to the environment
    based on surrounding information to complete their mission. Hence, depending on
    application areas, autonomous robotic CPS are built upon simultaneous localization
    and mapping techniques [206], accurate data acquisition and processing units [207],
    machine learning and artificial intelligence computation tools [208], and secured
    and low latency communication and control procedures [209], [210]. The cyber domain
    and the physical domain of autonomous robotic CPS are tightly connected with the
    coupling effect. According to [211], the coupling effect can have two meanings:
    1) the macroscopical data that flows from the physical domain to the cyber domain
    for analysis and processing to take effects in the physical domain again; and
    2) the mutual reliance between different components in cyber and physical domains
    in a micro level. To implement a complete and operational autonomous robotic CPS,
    understanding these coupling effects is critical to smoothly operate UAV and UGV
    with constrained communication, computation, and control resources [212]. 6) Smart
    Cities A smart city, as the name implies, is an urban area that utilizes technologies
    to become connected and agile to address 21st-century environmental, social, and
    economic challenges and improve the quality of life of its citizens. It comprises
    of several CPS operating simultaneously to address the challenge of reducing infrastructure
    risk in the smart city [213], improving information and operational security [214],
    and making a balance between financial impact and operational and safety impacts
    on the people in the smart city [215]. The concept of a smart city encompasses
    a wide range of applications that constitute the backbone of any municipality.
    For example, a smart city should have access to the smart digital health system
    [216] fueled by modern bio-compatible and accurate sensors, advances in body area
    network [217], and reliable and ubiquitous communications [218]. To improve the
    safety of roads in a smart city and provide drivers with a more convenient driving
    experience, intelligent transportation has become an essential part of a smart
    city. Smart driving applications employ different technologies to evaluate the
    status of the road and traffic conditions and help the drivers with real-time
    status updates [219]. Smart transportation can also help drivers to find a cheap
    and vacant parking spot in a busy city [220]. A smart grid is another application
    domain within a smart city that improves the efficiency of power generation, distribution,
    and consumption with reduced costs, pollution, and positive environmental impact.
    Houses and buildings in smart cities are equipped with their own solar and storage
    systems and an implication of this adoption of distributed renewable resources
    is the increased use of real-time pricing [221], demand-response management [222],
    peer-to-peer energy sharing [223], and energy security [224]. Meanwhile, buildings
    in a smart city are expected to be green buildings with smart appliances, adaptive
    control systems, own energy generation and energy storage facilities, and necessary
    securities services [215]. Buildings are able to be connected to one another for
    sharing resources such as energy [13] and become self-sustainable as a connected-community
    [121] when needed. Finally, public safety service is another key focus of smart
    cities to ensure people’s security and safety - especially under unusual circumstances
    such as natural disasters and political unrest [215]. Firefighters, police, and
    medical staff should respond promptly when needed and provide the affected people
    with necessary services by using state-of-the-art technologies. However, in times
    when technologies are down due to a disaster, alternative solutions are needed
    for these emergency departments to communicate and offer services [215]. An overview
    of how such a diverse set of CPS can co-exist and work together to make a smart
    city operational is shown in Fig. 6. FIGURE 6. This figure gives an illustration
    of smart city. A smart city can be thought of as a collection of different CPS
    including green buildings, smart transportation, smart energy grid, and connected
    communities to ensure a safe, convenient, and prosperous urban experience for
    its inhabitants. Show All 7) Smart Agricultural Systems By 2050, the world population
    will exceed 9.0 billion [225]. To feed this huge number of people, significant
    challenges have to be overcome to achieve the desired level of agricultural productivity
    under stringent constraints of limited resources, less skilled labor, less arable
    land, and climate change. Precision agriculture [226] - a smart CPS-based farming
    practice - has emerged as one potential solution to address this grand challenge.
    Precision agriculture has embraced autonomous, data-intensive, and disruptive
    technologies to locate and quantify spatial variability of soils, develop tools
    to enable precision management of crop nutrition, and use the current exponential
    volume of data to make decisions about ‘site, plant, and animal-specific management
    decisions to improve efficiency, productivity, quantity, profitability and sustainability
    of agricultural production’ [227]. With the advancement of the Internet of Everything
    (IoE) [228], land becomes a substrate in smart agriculture where different kinds
    of sensors acquiring heterogeneous data are connected to the Internet through
    a rural network. The real-time collected data is stored in the cloud database
    and processed and analyzed to identify land characteristics and requirements.
    Then, appropriate decisions based on weather, site information, and market conditions
    are taken by the intelligent decision-making unit to send to either the domotic
    system [229] or the farmer in charge for action and treatment. 8) Industry 4.0
    By integrating innovating functionalities through IoT, IoE, big data analytics,
    cloud manufacturing, and fog computing, CPS has provided a great opportunity to
    build advanced industrial systems and applications - Industry 4.0 [46]. The Third
    Industrial Revolution of the late 1990s not only digitalized and automated industrial
    production through extensive applications of electronics and computers but also
    laid the foundation blocks for Industry 4.0. Facilitated by the Industrial Internet
    of Things (IIoT), artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous robots, and smart digital
    technologies, today’s Industry 4.0 creates a better interconnected, automated,
    and holistic manufacturing ecosystem, thereby offering higher efficiency [230],
    productivity [231], scalability and security [232], privacy [233], and the autonomous
    operation of production processes [234] by ensuring that different components
    including equipment, logistics systems, work-in-progress components, and others
    (including people) directly interact with one other to achieve collaboration.
    Therefore, cyber-physical systems are integral to achieving the vision of Industry
    4.0, as CPS couples the physical productions and operations with the cyber systems
    through big data, augmented reality, cloud computing, and IoT to enable the seamless
    exchange of real-time information and commands. SECTION III. Overview of Game
    Theoretic Approaches The five-level structure and subsequent attributes enable
    different CPS to take real-time decisions on their action plans through interaction
    between their different components [236]. Due to these interactive characteristics
    of CPS, game theory [237] has been extensively used in the past decade to model
    the decision-making behavior of rational agents within a CPS by capturing their
    both competitive [238] and cooperative nature of interactions [239]. Essentially,
    game theory is a mathematical tool that conceives social situations among rational
    players and analyses their strategies in competitive environments where the outcome
    of a participant’s action depends on the preferences and actions of other participants
    [240]. Applications of game theory can be found in economics [241], politics [242],
    engineering [243], defense [244], medical [245], marketing [246], and recently
    topics in the broader area of CPS [247]. Depending on how each player chooses
    strategies to optimize their objective, game theory can be divided into two categories:
    cooperative games and non-cooperative games. In general, cooperative games deal
    with a coalition of players and decide how players can appropriately divide the
    value of the coalition among themselves. Meanwhile, non-cooperative games study
    which moves players should rationally make. Further, some games can take the form
    of either a non-cooperative or a cooperative game depending on the modeling of
    players’ interactions. In this paper, we refer to such games as hybrid games.
    A. Cooperative Games Cooperative game theory analyses the behavior of rational
    players when they cooperate and articulates the formation of coalitions that strengthen
    the players’ standings in a game [235]. Both coalition games and Nash bargaining
    are considered cooperative games [16]. Coalition games study the formation of
    different types of the coalition of players within the game and their properties
    [16]. Commonly, a coalition game is expressed by the pair (N,ν) , where N={1,2,⋯,|N|}
    refers to the set of players who seek to form coalitions and ν is the value that
    players collectively receive for being associated with each coalition S⊆N . In
    the characteristic form of coalition game [235], the value ν of a coalition is
    set by the members of the coalition S and is not impacted by how the members in
    coalitions N∖S are structured. As shown in Fig. 7, coalition games can be classified
    into three types: canonical coalition games, coalition formation games, and coalition
    graph games. Another branch of the cooperative game - Nash bargaining - on the
    other hand, focuses on the terms and conditions that players are required to follow
    to form different coalitions [248]. FIGURE 7. This figure shows different types
    of coalition games including (a) canonical coalition game, (b) coalition formation
    game, and (3) coalition graph game. In a canonical coalition game, conditions
    for forming a grand coalition are the main focus of the study with a significant
    emphasis on how to stabilize the grand coalition. The formation of appropriate
    coalition structures and their properties are the foci of a coalition formation
    game. Finally, the coalition graph game establishes a grand coalition or a network
    of coalition structures using point-to-point communication between members of
    the coalition. This figure is inspired by Fig. 1 of [235]. Show All 1) Canonical
    Coalition Games Canonical coalition games have been widely formalized and meticulously
    understood. These games can be expressed with either a transferable utility (TU)
    or a non-transferable utility (NTU), in which the formation of a grand coalition
    of all players is never detrimental [16]. In other words, in a canonical coalition
    game, no group of players can less benefit by cooperating with one another compared
    to acting non-cooperatively. The main aims of coalition games are to study the
    properties of the grand coalition and determine how the profit resulting from
    cooperation can be distributed among the players in a fair manner [235]. The most
    common solution concept of canonical coalition game is the core [249], [250],
    which is directly linked to the stability of the grand coalition. Typically, the
    core of a canonical coalition game is a set of payoff allocations that confirms
    that no player will be better paid off by leaving the grand coalition N for another
    coalition S⊂N . However, it is not guaranteed that the core of a TU or NTU canonical
    coalition game always exists. In many instances, the core can be empty and the
    grand coalition is not stable. In these cases, alternative solution concepts such
    as the Shapley value and the Nucleolus are explored. The Shapley value [251] -
    introduced by the Novel Laureate Lloyd Shapley in 1951 [252] - was first characterized
    for TU canonical coalition games and later extended to NTU games. It takes into
    account the order in which the players in (N,ν) join the grand coalition. If the
    players join in a random fashion, for example, the Shapley value allows payoff
    to each player according to its expected marginal contribution when it joins the
    grand coalition [235]. Although the Shapley value is unrelated to the core in
    general, it lies in the core for convex games [249], [250]. Another popular solution
    concept for canonical coalition games is the nucleolus, which is proposed mainly
    for TU games [250]. According to this solution concept, each player is provided
    with an allocation that minimizes the dissatisfaction of the players from the
    allocation they can receive in a given game (N,ν) . The nucleolus of a canonical
    coalition game exists and if the core of the game is not empty, it is in the core
    [235]. The applications of the nucleolus are many in game theory. One prominent
    application in the area of CPS is planning the power system expansion [253]. 2)
    Coalition Formation Games The network structure and the cost to form coalitions
    have major impacts on the solution of the coalition formation game. Like canonical
    coalition games, coalition formation games can also be in characteristic form
    with TU or NTU. However, unlike canonical games, coalition formation games can
    also be in partition form [254] and the gains that a coalition offers to its members
    are limited by the cost of forming the coalition [255]. Due to this reason, the
    composition of a grand coalition is very rare. In a coalition formation game,
    the main aim is to study the coalition structure including coalition type, coalition
    size, and stability of the overall structure. Since a network topology can be
    affected by environmental changes, the variation in player numbers, change is
    the characteristics of each player, and other factors can alter the stability
    of the coalition [256]. For solution concepts of coalition formation games, modified
    Shapley value, core, and nucleolus are used. Shapley value is referred to as B
    value with the restriction property [235]. The restriction property implies that
    for finding the B value, one needs to proceed in two steps: first, if there are
    M=|M| partitions as results of the coalition formation game, consider each partition
    m∈M of the game and determine the Shapley value ϕ m of each partition of the coalition.
    Second, determine the B value as the 1×M vector ϕ of payoffs implemented via combining
    the resulted allocation of each partition [235]. However, the restriction property
    does not apply to the core or the nucleolus [235]. With B present, the core and
    the nucleolus depend on the values of coalitions B m ∈B and the values of coalitions
    that are not in B . Therefore, the analysis to find the core and nucleolus is
    more challenging than that of the Shapley value, the details of which can be found
    in [257]. 3) Coalition Graph Games In some scenarios, underlying communication
    between different components or agents within the CPS plays a major role to decide
    the utility and other characteristics of the game, for example, peer-to-peer energy
    trading in energy network [258]. Coalition graph game is ideal to model such scenarios
    with competitive players [259] by representing the connectivity between different
    players through graph [260]. In the graph form, a coalition game can be TU or
    NTU, but the value of a coalition is influenced by the external network structure.
    In particular, how different players are interconnected with one another strongly
    and significantly impact the properties and outcomes of the game [235]. The main
    aims of a coalition graph game are 1) to develop distributed algorithms for players
    who plan to build either a directed or undirected network graph and 2) to study
    the properties including stability and efficiency of the established network graph.
    In the course of finding solutions for graph games, Myerson analyzed situations
    in which communication between players is restricted in TU games [261] and introduced
    the graph-restricted game, where the outcome of a coalition is determined by the
    total payoffs obtained in the original game by its connected subcoalitions [262].
    Then, he proposed a solution concept - known as Myerson value [263] - for graph-restricted
    games. Myerson value is essentially the Shapley value of graph-restricted games
    that focuses on the player’s characteristic function as the Shapley value and
    on its communication graph at the same time. Later, the Myerson value was also
    characterized in terms of component efficiency and fairness [264]. 4) Bargaining
    Games Bargaining is an economic phenomenon that circumscribes negotiations, payoffs,
    and disagreement [265]. The modern theory of bargaining was proposed by John Nash
    in 1950 [266] as a two-player bargaining problem. In the Nash bargaining model,
    two players demand a portion of some commodity in different applications, e.g.,
    energy trading [267], communication channel and power [268], and electric vehicle
    charging and discharging [269]. According to the bargaining solution, if the total
    amount requested by both players is less than the available quantity, both players
    can have what they requested. On the other hand, if the total requested amount
    is greater than what is available, none of the players gets their desired goods.
    Different solution concepts are used for addressing bargaining problems. According
    to the solution approach proposed by John Nash [266], a bargaining solution should
    satisfy the properties of affine transformation invariant, Pareto optimality,
    irrelevant alternatives independent, and symmetrical property. The main principle
    of this solution is to maximize the product of surplus utilities of the players.
    Other bargaining solution concepts include Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solution
    [270] and Egalitarian bargaining solution [271]. The Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining
    solution equalizes the ratios of maximal gains whereas by Egalitarian solution
    maximizes the minimum of surplus utilities. B. Non-Cooperative Games Non-cooperative
    games are the games in which no cooperation is allowed between players to support
    their decision-making process [272]. A M players the non-cooperative game can
    be expressed by its strategic form as {M,{ X m } m∈M ,{ U m } m∈M } , where M={1,2,⋯,M}
    is the set of players, X m is the strategy vector of player m , and U m is the
    utility that a player m∈M obtains for its choice of strategy x m ∈ X m [273].
    The most popular solution concept of a non-cooperative game is the Nash equilibrium
    [240]. According to [274], in a M player game, Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies,
    in which the actions of each player m∈M is its best response to the actions taken
    by the players in set M∖{m} . Formally, Nash equilibrium is expressed as a vector
    of actions x ∗ =[ x ∗ m , x ∗ −m ] such that U m ( x ∗ )≥ U m ( x m , x ∗ −m ),∀m∈M
    . x ∗ specifies a stable state of a non-cooperative game in which no player m∈M
    can increase its utility U m by taking an alternative action other than x ∗ m
    when the actions of players in set M∖{m} are fixed at x ∗ −m [16]. The non-cooperative
    game can be divided into different categories with distinctive attributes and
    we provide a summary of each category as follows. 1) Non-Zero Sum and Zero-Sum
    Games In a non-cooperative game, if one player’s gain (or loss) does not necessarily
    bring loss (or gain) to other players, the game is known as non-zero-sum game
    [275]. On other hand, in a zero-sum game [276], the sum of the objective functions
    of two players is zero - the gain of one player brings loss to another player
    and vice versa. Examples of non-zero and zero-sum games include the Prisoner’s
    Dilemma [277] and chess game [278] respectively. 2) Finite and Infinite Games
    A non-cooperative game is called a finite game if each player of the game has
    a finite number of strategies. That is, each player can choose an action from
    a finite set of alternatives. An example of a finite game is chess. Finite games
    are also known as matrix games [272]. If a game is not finite, it is an infinite
    game. In an infinite game, the rules are changeable and the objective is to keep
    perpetuating the game. An example of an infinite game is the pursuit of excellence.
    3) Deterministic and Stochastic Games A game is referred to as a deterministic
    game [279] is the players’ strategies lead to completely predictable outcomes.
    A good example of a deterministic game is chess - the rules are specified and
    no additional variables are involved that may lead to variation in outcomes. In
    a stochastic game [280], on the other hand, the outcome of at least one player
    of the game is affected by an additional variable with a known probability function,
    for example, poker tournaments. 4) Complete Information and Incomplete Information
    Games When all information including the players, their objective functions, and
    corresponding probability distribution regarding a game are known to all players
    it is called a non-cooperative game with complete information. otherwise, the
    game is called an incomplete information game. An incomplete information game
    is also known as the Bayesian game [281]. A Bayesian game consists of a set of
    players, a set of actions, types of players, a payoff function for each player,
    and probability distributions associated with the types. The solution of a Bayesian
    game is the Bayesian Nash equilibrium. A non-cooperative game reaches its Bayesian
    Nash equilibrium when each player chooses a strategy that maximizes the expected
    payoff considering the types and strategies of other players [282]. 5) Perfect
    Information and Imperfect Information Games Games with perfect information are
    associated with sequential non-cooperative games, in which all players know what
    actions are chosen by all other players in the past. It is important to note that
    only in sequential games players can have perfect information. It is important
    to note that perfect information is different from complete information. In a
    complete information game, every player knows the strategies and payoffs of the
    other players but they may not necessarily be aware of the actions taken by other
    players [283]. These types of games where players do not have perfect information
    about other players within the game are referred to as imperfect information games.
    6) Static and Dynamic Games In the static game, players concurrently choose their
    strategies without having any information about each others’ action plans. In
    dynamic games, however, players can choose their strategies more than once and
    during the decision-making process, each player can know about the previous strategies
    of other players. A branch of the dynamic game is the repeated games in which
    a fixed strategy game is played periodically [283]. In repeated games, before
    choosing a strategy at the beginning of each period, a player observes the decisions
    made by other players in previous periods and then decides his current strategy
    accordingly. C. Hybrid Games A hybrid game can be either a cooperative or a non-cooperative
    game depending on how players are interacting with one another to optimize their
    decisions. For example, a Stackelberg game [284], also known as leader-follower
    game [285], can be considered as both non-cooperative and cooperative game based
    on followers’ modes of interactions in response to leaders strategy. In [286],
    for example, the authors proposed a non-cooperative Stackelberg game in which
    followers of the game interact with one another non-cooperatively in response
    to the leader’s decision and reach a Nash equilibrium. Meanwhile, the authors
    in [22] approached the Stackelberg game as a cooperative game in which followers
    respond to the leader by forming a coalition with one another using a coalition
    formation framework to achieve their desired objectives. A demonstration of the
    Stackelberg game in both cooperative and non-cooperative modes is shown in Fig.
    8. Thus, the Stackelberg game and other games that follow a similar phenomenon
    in articulating players’ strategy can be considered as hybrid games. FIGURE 8.
    In this figure, we illustrate an example of how a Stackelberg game can be used
    as both cooperative and non-cooperative games depending on how different players
    interact and respond. In (a), all followers of the Stackelberg game collectively
    choose their strategies to respond to the leader of the game. Hence, this game
    refers to a cooperative Stackelberg game. In (b), however, each player independently
    responds to the decision made by the leader without collaborating with other players
    in the network. Hence, this game is a non-cooperative Stackelberg game. Show All
    SECTION IV. Game-Theory for Cyber-Physical Systems In CPS, due to high engagement
    between different components for making decisions based on real-time monitoring
    and control, and the criticality of adaptive control and predictive maintenance
    for the system’s operation, make game theory an ideal candidate to model the users’
    behavior within a CPS and capture their activities to achieve certain objectives.
    As such, what follows is an overview of how game theory has been extensively applied
    in different domains of CPS in the last decade. Further, the summary of the discussion
    is given in Table 2 and 3. TABLE 2 Summary of Applications of Game Theory in the
    Areas of Green Buildings, Smart Grids, Intelligent Transportation Systems, and
    Tele-Medical Systems TABLE 3 Summary of Applications of Game Theory in the Areas
    of Autonomous Robotic Systems, Smart Cities, Agricultural Systems, and Industry
    4.0 1) APPLICATION IN GREEN BUILDINGS In green buildings, the physical system
    consists of the structure of the building, appliances (HVAC, lights, washing machines,
    hot water systems, and refrigerators, etc) within the building, and other equipment
    such as solar panels and batteries. Smart appliances are connected together through
    various communication protocols through which they can communicate with each other
    and with the home automation system in real-time within the building. Through
    artificial intelligence, and machine learning techniques, the home automation
    system can extract useful information from various sub-systems of the buildings
    and analyze them in its digital twin where various game theoretic techniques can
    be used to make useful decisions on energy usage, cost of living, thermal comfort,
    home security, users’ privacy, and resource management and sharing. Thus, as a
    CPS, green buildings have all the attributes explained in Section II-B that enable
    game theory to be used to tackle several challenges of design and construction
    of the building, energy and comfort management within buildings, and sharing resources
    between buildings while maintaining security and privacy. a: CONSTRUCTION & INCENTIVES
    To better promote green building constructions, government incentives are widely
    adopted across the world. Game theory has been used to design the government’s
    reward and penalty evaluations to better promote green building development projects.
    For example, [287] developed a prospect theory-based evolutionary game model to
    investigate a suitable strategy for promoting green building construction using
    four scenarios and determined dynamic reward and static penalty as the best strategy.
    While government incentives are important, real-state developers need to comply
    with government regulations to come forward to construct green buildings. Through
    an evolutionary game framework, the authors in [288] showed that strong government
    regulations could be inefficient in motivating developers to achieve target green
    constructions, and therefore a balance needs to be achieved between regulation
    and builders’ own philosophy for encouraging sustainable building design [289].
    It is also important to manage conflicts in the construction contract, e.g. using
    game theoretic models [290], [291] while conforming to the architectural design
    [292] and understand occupants viewpoint about dwelling in green buildings [293]
    for better social acceptance. b: ENERGY USAGE & COMFORT The importance of game
    theory is also evident in modeling the synergy between different appliances in
    managing energy usage and comfort within buildings. For example, the main sources
    of energy usage in buildings are HVAC, lighting, and hot water systems. Fortunately,
    these are also flexible loads that open opportunities for energy conservation.
    However, for saving energy and efficient building operation, it is important to
    opportunistically control and optimize these appliances as well as perform necessary
    predictive maintenance. In [294], game theory is used with reinforcement learning
    to develop a technique that can determine suitable settings for a building’s HVAC
    system by updating and enhancing its knowledge about the best action for HVAC
    control under different conditions from historic information about weather conditions,
    the stochastic nature of the power grid operation, and human activities. A game-theoretic
    demand-side management technique for buildings is studied in [295] to reduce the
    peak-to-average ratio of a community in Sydney. The authors in [296] considered
    three scenarios based on occupancy within a building and showed that game theory
    can be effectively used to model the decision-making process of building owners
    and residents about participating in green retrofit projects. Further, a non-cooperative
    Stackelberg game that uses different discomfort and interruption indicators for
    controlling residential air-conditioning systems is proposed in [297] to reduce
    the electricity cost to the customers and maintain their thermal comfort. c: ENERGY
    SHARING Besides individual energy and thermal comfort management capability, another
    unique characteristic of modern buildings is the ability to communicate with one
    another for sharing resources [121]. The research in this area of research is
    diverse and substantial. For example, in [298], [299], [300], and [301], the foci
    of the research have been to design game-theoretic algorithms that will enable
    multiple green buildings within a community to share common resources such as
    renewable energy [298], [299] and battery capacity [300], [301] with one another
    to reach a solution that is beneficial in terms of improving sustainability and
    reducing the cost to all participating buildings. d: CYBER SECURITY Green buildings
    are prone to cyber-attacks. Hence, maintaining cyber security in green buildings
    is very important and game theory has been proven to be a useful tool for that
    purpose [302]. In particular, green buildings are equipped with wireless networks
    and IoT that are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. As such, a zero-sum game model is
    built in [303] to control the attack and enable the defense mechanism to realize
    secured transmission of information from sensors to the controllers. A similar
    application of game theory for CPS security can also be found in [304]. Nonetheless,
    to attack a building or similar CPS and achieve the desired physical disruptions
    in its operation requires the attacker a good understanding of the failure conditions
    of the system and its control principles. Therefore, to build a robust security
    system for a building, consideration of such issues is important. Meanwhile, it
    is also important to make a balance between the security of a building and the
    cost of implementing those security measures. A game theory-based method is modeled
    in [305] that considers the failure conditions of the system and its control principles
    while implementing the security measures. Further, defense mechanism policies
    against different types of attacks using a hybrid-stochastic game are proposed
    in [306] that balances the security overhead and control cost. Through game theory,
    green buildings also contribute to improving the energy efficiency of the modern
    smart grid by providing various energy management services as active prosumers.
    2) APPLICATION IN SMART GRID In the smart grid, resources used for the generation,
    transmission, and distribution of electricity, buildings, electric vehicles, and
    battery storage can be thought of as the physical systems of the CPS. These resources
    are mostly interconnected and can communicate with one another to make intelligent
    decisions [128] in order to attain individual objectives [273]. The decisions
    are taken in cyberspace, e.g., via game theory and distributed leader technology
    [307] using data-driven techniques based on big data from different subsystems.
    Different computational intelligence techniques are utilized for the decision-making
    process [308] and cloud-based information processing makes the decision-making
    faster and scalable [48]. Smart grid attributes such as IoT enable the controller
    to sense any changes in the environmental settings and access the internet of
    information to make predictive decisions about various parameters for adaptive
    control of the activities of various components within the system. Security and
    privacy are of paramount importance in a smart grid where real-time monitoring
    and control are strictly used for energy and thermal comfort management without
    compromising the privacy and security of the people. Users can actively participate
    in energy management through human-machine interaction and can influence the overall
    energy system behavior through social platforms [309]. The practice of game theory
    is extensive in the smart grid. Beginning from designing demand response management
    schemes, game theory finds its applications in developing transactive energy frameworks,
    implementing peer-to-peer energy sharing schemes, designing real-time pricing
    and incentive mechanisms, managing energy in microgrids, and providing solutions
    to maintain power system security and stability. a: DEMAND RESPONSE Demand response
    can be defined as the voluntary reduction or schedule of electricity use by customers
    with the purpose to keep the electricity grid stable by maintaining the balance
    between demand and supply of electricity. Direct involvement of customers in demand
    response makes game theory a perfect candidate to model the voluntary change in
    energy usage behavior by the people [310]. Now, demand response can be done either
    via direct control of customers’ load by the electricity operator [126] or through
    providing incentives to the customers through a real-time pricing scheme as explained
    in [311], [312], and [313]. In the direct control demand response scheme proposed
    in [126], the purpose of using a cooperative game is to minimize the cost of forming
    unions of multiple users and single retailer that enable residents to indirectly
    access the balancing market to reduce the risks and costs for the retailer. In
    indirect control, on the contrary, the use of game theory helps to optimize the
    scheduling of flexible loads [98], develop suitable incentives through dynamic
    pricing scheme [311], [312], and engage extensive customers participation in demand
    response [314]. Another alternative of demand response technique - known as negawatt
    [315] - has emerged recently and a cooperative game-based negawatt management
    is proposed in [316] to demonstrate how negawatt trading can bring financial benefits
    to the participating customers without any negative impact on the physical distribution
    network. b: TRANSACTIVE ENERGY Transactive energy and peer-to-peer energy sharing
    are the other two branches of the smart grid that have broad applications of game
    theory. Transactive energy uses economic and control techniques to manage the
    flow of energy within a power system. On the other hand, peer-to-peer energy sharing
    is a part of a transactive energy mechanism that helps prosumers in a community
    to share their surplus with other peers at a price negotiated by themselves. In
    both cases, prosumers’ flexibility in changing their energy usage behavior plays
    an important role where game theory has been used extensively. For example, a
    nucleolus-based cooperative game solution is proposed in [317] that utilized the
    flexible loads of prosumers and considers the uncertainties of renewable energy
    resources to manage energy in local communities. A Stackelberg game is used to
    develop a joint energy and reserve dispatch model in [318] to ensure the reliability
    of system operation under renewable energy uncertainty. To maximize the benefit
    of distributed energy resources for flexible prosumers in terms of procuring revenues
    by trading electricity in the market, the authors in [319] and [320] explore algorithmic
    and non-cooperative games respectively to realize suitable transactive energy
    frameworks. Other aspects of transactive energy and peer-to-peer sharing, in which
    game theory has been used extensively include regulation services [321], balancing
    supply and demand [322], reducing electricity cost [323], [324], peak load reduction
    [22], encouraging customer participation [325], security of energy transactions
    [326], and privacy-preserved energy trading for neighborhood area networks [327].
    c: PRICING Both demand response and transactive energy services necessitate the
    active participation of prosumers. A key incentive to motivate prosumers actively
    participate in energy management is an attractive pricing scheme. Consequently.
    designing new and fair pricing schemes has been a core focus of smart grid research
    for a long time using game theory due to its inherent ability to capture people’s
    rational behavior. For example, to assist the grid, a dynamic pricing profile
    using a non-cooperative game is proposed in [328] to engage prosumers to address
    the duck curve problem. With a similar purpose of helping the grid, a game theory-based
    dynamic pricing strategy is studied in [311] that not only achieves significant
    peak load reduction but also enables participating prosumers to achieve noticeable
    profits for participating in the demand response program. Similar dynamic pricing-based
    demand response programs can also be found in [312] and [329] that use Stackelberg
    game, and [330], [331] using non-cooperative Nash game. d: MICROGRID MANAGEMENT
    Another aspect of smart grids that finds considerable use of game theory is microgrid
    management including energy trading between microgrids and designing energy management
    services within a microgrid. In terms of energy trading, games that have been
    used include Stackelberg game [17], non-cooperative Nash game [332], multi-level
    interactive game models [333], Bayesian game [334], and cooperative game theory
    [335], [336]. For managing energy within microgrids, on the other hand, hierarchical
    decision-making processes are modeled in [337] and [338] using Stackelberg game
    theory for maximizing profits for different stakeholders within a microgrid including
    users, microgrid controller, and microgrid aggregators. For optimal dispatch of
    power within a microgrid, an evolutionary game is used in [339], whereas the authors
    in [340] use a population game for distributed control of microgrid with the same
    purpose of dispatching active and reactive powers. Finally, non-cooperative games
    are used in [341] and [342] for managing energy within microgrids considering
    the intermittent nature of renewable energy generation. 3) APPLICATION IN INTELLIGENT
    TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS As IoT and emerging computational techniques are revolutionizing
    the emerging technological realm, transportation networks and vehicles within
    the network are becoming smarter day by day. Innovation in personalized electric
    cars, heavy automotive vehicles, roadside real-time communication and monitoring
    devices, and intelligent transportation systems are contributing to moving people
    across the globe through safe, hassle-free, cost-effective, and efficient mobility
    options. Using real-time information on traffic conditions, weather and historic
    information of the driver’s driving patterns, the cyber unit of each vehicle is
    able to use game theory to calculate the safest and fastest route to its destination
    and adaptively change the routes as the data shows changes in the circumstance.
    For that purpose, all components of the intelligent transportation system need
    to be interconnected with one another through a smart communication system such
    as 5G, human need to interact with the vehicle directly, and each component of
    the CPS should have its own control unit to execute the action plan decided by
    its cyber unit in real-time. In particular, game theory has been heavily used
    for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) [343] and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) [344] technologies
    for coordinating energy charging, discharging, and transferring of energy by different
    stakeholders. In V2V, for example, applications of game theory can be found in
    modeling electricity trading between electric vehicles [345] using a Bayesian
    game; autonomous V2V decision making in the roundabout using prisoner’s dilemma
    [346]; modeling lane-changing behavior of drivers using two-person non-zero sum
    game [347] with both complete and incomplete information; enabling longitudinal
    autonomous driving through Nash differential game [348], and allowing vehicles
    to offload their computation-intensive tasks to neighboring vehicles using Stackelberg
    game [349]. a: INTELLIGENT DRIVING Intelligent transportation system has other
    beneficial and intelligent attributes including autonomous driving capability,
    safe driving experience through real-time information processing, and cost savings
    through opportunistic use of its fuel. In [350], for example, the authors present
    a game theoretic traffic model that can be utilized to test and compare various
    autonomous vehicle decisions and control systems. To avoid unintentional congestion
    in data communication among autonomous vehicles, a bimatrix game is proposed in
    [351], which can effectively solve the performance bottleneck and optimize the
    process of communication. Similarly, a Nash differential game is used to address
    longitudinal autonomous driving for intelligent hybrid electric vehicles that
    ensures the safety, economy, and comfort of the riders are optimized. b: MONITORING
    & CONTROL However, such autonomous driving of vehicles relies on the real-time
    monitoring and accurate control of traffic conditions on road including vehicles
    and pedestrians. For example, with IoT and intersection controllers in place,
    traffic control in intersections can be managed properly through a cooperative
    game-enabled mechanism [352]. It is also possible to accurately manage the change
    of lane by autonomous vehicles on roads through stochastic game [353]. Vehicles
    can also interact with pedestrians for their safe navigation through the road,
    as proposed in [354] using an empirical game theory. c: ENERGY SERVICE V2G, on
    the contrary, is being used for providing regulation services to the grid, coordinated
    scheduling of charging and discharging of electric cars, facilitating peer-to-peer
    energy sharing within communities, planning for future smart cities, and demand
    response management purposes. For instance, a non-cooperative Stackelberg game
    and a potential game are formulated in [344] to motivate electric vehicles to
    provide frequency regulation services to the power grid. Meanwhile, game theory
    is utilized in [355] to provide voltage regulation services to the grid. Topics
    on coordinated scheduling of charging and discharging of electric vehicles are
    studied in [356], [357], [358], and [273] using Stackelberg and coalition games,
    while it is shown in [359] and [360] that different game theoretic approaches
    also have the capacity to enable electric vehicles to participate in peer-to-peer
    energy sharing. Other applications of V2G for providing energy services can be
    found in [361] and [362]. We further find the use of different games in the context
    of V2G in infrastructure planning projects for charging and discharging in smart
    cities [357], [363] and demand response management using electric vehicles [364],
    [365]. 4) APPLICATION IN TELE-MEDICAL SYSTEMS In a tele-medical system, the physical
    system includes the hospitals with a patient monitoring unit, tele-consultation
    interface, and sensory units consisting of an ECG sensor, medical super sensor,
    motion sensor, and EMG sensor. The data collected by these sensors are transferred
    through a wireless local area network (WLAN) to a collector where the data is
    converted into useful information. This information is processed in the cloud-based
    medical server from where doctors can access the data and remotely help the patient
    in real time. The details of the architecture of tele-medical system can be found
    in [366]. The key attributes of tele-medical systems include real-time monitoring
    and control, the use of IoT to enable data-driven decision-making, human-machine
    interaction, maintaining the security of the interconnected system, and preserving
    the privacy of patient information. The use of game theory in tele-medical CPS
    stems from their applications in diagnosis and treatment. In particular, game
    theory has been used for building efficient healthcare IoT, optimizing the diagnosis
    and treatment process, and building trust between doctors and patients. a: EMERGENCY
    SERVICE In critical medical emergency situations, for example, health monitoring
    systems in wireless body area networks need to send data packets with critical
    health information with less processing time than regular health care information.
    In [367], the authors demonstrate that evolutionary games can accelerate the process
    of critical data transfer in a priority-based time-slotted fashion. The importance
    of low latency data transmission is also recognized in [368], which focuses on
    fog-based Internet-of-Health Things and proposes a weighted majority game theoretic
    approach for selecting fog devices in indoor and outdoor regions for delay-sensitive
    health care system. A similar application of game theory in health care IoT can
    also be found in [369]. b: DIAGNOSIS & TREATMENT Game theory has also been proven
    very effective in optimizing the diagnosis and treatment process of different
    diseases. In [370], for example, the authors explore game theory to develop a
    model the liver transplantation consultation for patients who suffer from Alcoholic
    Liver Disease. To enable privacy-aware medical imaging for patients’ treatments,
    a novel encryption method is proposed in [371] using Nash bargaining. Another
    image processing technique is proposed in [372] that uses a game theory-based
    meta-heuristic FIR filter to compress the medical image for online use. A cooperative
    game-based leukemia classification approach is proposed in [373] using a data
    set containing 400 samples of human leukemic bone marrow. A cooperative Bayesian
    game model is proposed in [374] to analyze the benefit of relying on a clinical
    decision support system for the overall reputation of a health facility. In [375],
    the authors model cancer treatment as a game and use an evolutionary game theoretic
    approach to decide the optimal amount of drug for chemotherapy. A review of studies
    that discuss how game theory has been used for cancer treatment can be found in
    [376]. c: TRUST MANAGEMENT Game theory also has a notable application in building
    trust between patients and healthcare systems. In particular, with the advancement
    of artificial intelligence in the health care system, the trust issue in medical
    consultation has become a concern for patients [377]. In [378], the authors use
    game theory to analyze and discuss how to establish continuity and trust in primary
    health care. And to build this trust, it is important that have a positive public
    opinion about the doctor-patient relationship. For that purpose, a tripartite
    evolutionary game is studied in [379] to examine the behavioral strategies of
    doctors, governments, and netizens, and analyze their impacts on the evolution
    of public opinion on the doctor-patient relationship. Finally, it is concluded
    in [380] that medical CPS is a disruptive approach to enable smart healthcare;
    however, the security and privacy of medical devices and low latency interoperability
    between them is critical for their sustainable operation in the diagnosis and
    treatment of diseases. Game theory can play a big role in that purpose as shown
    in [381] and [382] respectively. d: OTHER APPLICATIONS Another game-theoretic
    application in medical CPS can be found in analyzing the medical disputes among
    different levels of medical institutions [383], capturing strategic behavior of
    surgeons in operating rooms [384], quality maintenance of hospital medical equipment
    and pharmaceutical products [385], optimal scheduling of ambulance dispatching
    [386], sharing of resources (doctors) among hospitals [387], medical waste recycling
    and transportation [388], and for solving congestion in the plastic and reconstructive
    surgery match [389]. 5) APPLICATION IN AUTONOMOUS ROBOTIC SYSTEMS (UAV/UGV) For
    autonomous robotic systems including UAV and UGV, it is imperative for agents
    to interact with one another and with other entities of the environment with delay
    tolerant and efficient communication protocols for accurate routing, localization,
    and completing the target actions. Therefore, the physical architecture of the
    UAV and UGV consists of a central processing unit that controls the flight (or
    routing) of the UAV (or UGV). There is a ground control station that provides
    the human controller with facilities to access the control of the UAV/UGV during
    operation. Smart communication between the physical units and UAV/UGV is used
    for transferring the control signal from the station to the vehicles. The central
    processing unit analyzes the environmental data obtained from the UAV/UGV in real-time
    and process the data to generate secured control commands to feedback to the vehicles
    for execution. Thus, adaptive control, real-time monitoring and control, data-driven
    adaptive control, and security are the main attributes for the successful operation
    of UAV and UGV systems. For details, please see [390]. In this domain, game theory
    has been used for modeling the decision-making of and interaction between agents.
    In this domain of CPS, game theory has been extensively used to (1) decide the
    optimal placement of UAV, (2) coordinate and control UAV and UGV, (3) save energy
    and power, and (4) ensure security. a: COMMUNICATION SERVICES For providing communication
    services to the UGV on the ground, the UAV height has an impact on the service
    quality and coverage. It is important that they are positioned appropriately so
    that the number of UAV deployments can be reduced significantly to provide the
    desired network services. In [392], a non-cooperative game is used to find the
    optimal locations of UAVs for providing communication services, e.g., to a group
    of UGVs operating on the ground. In [393], the authors study the routing problem
    for multi-agent UAVs using game theory where a set of UAVs collect information
    via surveillance of an area of interest without relying on a reliable communication
    medium to coordinate with other UAVs. Similarly, in [394], an artificial intelligence-based
    game theoretic approach is proposed for UAVs to control their flight algorithms
    to position themselves in suitable locations to maintain strong connectivity.
    Details of how joint coverage and connectivity for distributed UAV networks can
    be facilitated via game theory are detailed in [395] and [391]. Note that the
    communication platform provided by UAVs enables the coordination and control of
    both UAVs and UGVs, as shown in Fig. 9. FIGURE 9. This figure shows how multiple
    UAVs can coordinate with one another to provide a platform for communications
    between UGVs to operate on the ground. This figure is inspired by the discussion
    in [391]. Show All b: SURVEILLANCE Coordination between UAVs and UGVs using their
    real-time spatial and temporal locations and electromagnetic information is important
    for their path planning and obtaining intended objectives with the desired efficiency.
    For example, in [396], a game theory-based optimization technique is proposed
    for path planning for multiple UAVs to improve the mission efficiency and range.
    A similar approach is used for recurring scenarios in [397], in which the coordination
    among robots with shared objectives are analyzed using a potential game. The alliance
    between UAV and UGV is studied in [398] for cooperative surveillance using a co-evolutionary
    algorithm that prioritizes early detection and improves the success rate. A dynamic
    multi-team antagonistic game is proposed in [399] for multiple UAVs to solve problems
    of tactical decision-making with incomplete information. Other examples of game
    theoretic coordination of UAV and UGV can be found in [400] and [401]. c: ENERGY
    EFFICIENCY Most of the unmanned vehicles are deployed in areas that are not easily
    accessible by humans due to either locational hazards (e.g., mountains and forests)
    or security threats (e.g., battlefield). As a consequence, frequent replacement
    of the batteries of the robots is not feasible. Hence, it is important to optimize
    the operation and maintenance of UAV and UGV for efficient and opportunistic use
    of energy. In fact, UAV cooperative control has been used in many UAV communication
    networks such as in [402] where a potential game is used for the purpose of power
    control. For the purpose of increased battery life, delay-aware and energy-efficient
    task management techniques for IoT platforms for UAV and UGV are studied in [401],
    [403], [404], and [405] that use joint-auction coalition game, non-cooperative
    game, coalition formation game, and non-cooperative matching game with no-regret
    learning respectively to develop the mechanisms. Further discussion on how game
    theory can be used to ensure energy-efficient activities of UAV and UGV can be
    found in [406]. d: SECURITY In autonomous robotic CPS, game theory has also been
    utilized extensively for modeling and analyzing the cyber-physical security of
    time and location-critical UAV and UGV applications. One general way to design
    such game theoretic formulation is to model the interaction between a UAV (or
    UGV) operator and an interdictor where each of them could be benign or malicious
    [407]. The solution of the game is then analytically studied to understand its
    effects on the rationality and strategies of both parties and find the equilibrium
    points under different selected security regimes. A dynamic game approach for
    preparing a secured and resilient networked system is proposed in [408] and demonstrates
    its effectiveness for a UAV network. For securing transmission in a two-tier UAV
    network, a two-level game based on a many-to-one matching game and a coalition
    formation game is implemented in [409] that guarantees the desired secrecy performance
    of the system. UGV in the defense force sometimes faces the threat of intelligent
    autonomous adversaries to disrupt the transfer of resources [410], e.g., by manipulating
    the signals in the GPS. To address this challenge, a Stackelberg game-theoretic
    countermeasure is proposed in [411] to develop new security solutions against
    the such attack and tested on UAV networks. Another example of game theoretic
    application in a similar domain can be found in [412] that uses an interdependence-aware
    game-theoretic framework for compensating the power losses that could cause due
    to an attack by the malicious agents within the network. 6) APPLICATION IN SMART
    CITIES A smart city, as depicted in Fig. 6, is a platform that integrates different
    types of CPS together to efficiently manage assets, resources, and services within
    urban areas to improve its overall city operations. Thus, the architecture of
    a smart city is alike to the one shown in Fig. 1 with all attributes outlined
    in Section II-B. The smart city architecture and attributes enable the collection
    and flow of data across different CPS, and then process and analyze the information
    for monitoring and managing power plants, traffic and transportation systems,
    water supply systems, waste management systems, health systems, community service
    systems, and maintaining the security of the citizen. Due to the scale of operation
    in a smart city, the management of data is challenging, and game theory has been
    proven to be very effective. In [413], for example, a Stackelberg game is utilized
    to design an intelligent edge computing algorithm that can alleviate the huge
    computing pressure from smart cities as the number of data increases day by day.
    Another game theory-based edge computing technique is proposed in [414]. In particular,
    an evolutionary game is used to qualitatively study the validity and stability
    of the trust management mechanism for smart cities. While most of the smart city
    activities have been explained as part of different CPS in this paper, waste management
    and security surveillance are exclusively relevant to the smart city. a: WASTE
    MANAGEMENT The seamless flow of data across different agents within the smart
    city enable game theory to contribute to waste management systems. For example,
    In [415], the authors identify the decision behaviors of contractors using an
    evolutionary game for better construction and demolition of waste management.
    In particular, the authors discuss how the decision of contractors can be influenced
    in different circumstances and identify the main factors that have impacts on
    their decision-making process. For example, it is shown that supervisory intensity,
    supervision costs, penalties, waste disposal costs, and revenues from illegal
    dumping are the major element that regulates government and contractors’ initiative
    regarding waste management. In [416], the authors propose a technique that can
    help analyze different express packaging waste recycling models for smart cities.
    With the purpose to contribute to designing effective incentive measures and recycling
    models, this work uses a differential game to understand the behavioral characteristics
    of individuals and different types of recycling models. It is identified that
    a cooperation-driven recycling model can have the highest revenue and subsidies
    are necessary for improving recycling in the smart city. b: SECURITY Security
    is another crucial component for the smart city considering its reliance on data-driven
    infrastructures [417]. In terms of maintaining privacy and security in the smart
    city, game theory has been used for ensuring the security of critical infrastructures
    like smart grids [418], gas and water systems [419], traffic systems [412], and
    IoT [420]. In [418], a dynamic multi-stage game is developed using reinforcement
    learning to identify the optimal attack sequences for given objectives to help
    to improve the security of the system. A non-zero-sum game is proposed in [419]
    which identifies that the interdependence of power systems on natural gas and
    water systems of the city may influence attackers to target water and gas systems
    for a cyber attack. Therefore, appropriate security measures need to be taken
    for these critical infrastructures as well. In [412], a Stackelberg game is used
    to optimally allocate the backup power sources for base stations to ensure uninterrupted
    services to power and transportation sectors of the smart city in case there is
    a power interruption due to a cyber attack in the smart grid. Finally, a repeated
    game-based enhanced clustered WSNs-based IoT security is proposed in [420] to
    combat selective forwarding attacks and thus preserve network stability. A detailed
    overview of the importance of game theory for cyber security can be found in [421].
    7) APPLICATION IN SMART AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS Smart agricultural system consists
    of a sensor layer, which can be thought of as the physical system of the CPS.
    This layer includes various kinds of crop sensors and smart objects responsible
    for real-time data collection and monitoring. Occasionally, thermal drones may
    also be used for detecting heat from objects and materials used for agricultural
    purposes. The smart connection between different components is provided by the
    network layer with communication technologies available between sensors and the
    Internet. The IoT platform utilizes a wireless sensor network for large-area surveillance
    and helps the farmer to maintain the optimal condition for maximum productivity.
    The service layer of the smart agricultural system serves as the cyber and cognition
    levels of the CPS. This layer is responsible for the processing and analysis of
    collected data for taking optimal decisions about agricultural plans. The data
    processing unit and decision support system of the service layer manage the collected
    information from the fields and take decisions for optimal crop yield, resource
    savings, and quality assurance. Finally, the application layer mimics the configuration
    level which enables farmers to take necessary actions by providing visualization
    of information and suggesting different kinds of field optimization deployments
    including irrigation, pesticide drift control, cultivation process, and crop disease
    protection. Further details of the architecture can be found in [422]. Considering
    the applications of different layers, the main attributes of a smart agricultural
    system include adaptive control, IoT, real-time monitoring and control, interconnectivity,
    predictive maintenance, and human-machine interaction, which make game theory
    a suitable tool to apply for modeling smart agricultural activities. The Exploration
    of game theory for innovative agricultural practice is diverse - starting from
    the selection of agricultural crops as proposed in [423] in 1962 to today’s challenge
    of water allocation for agriculture purposes [424]. For the agricultural CPS,
    in particular, game theory finds its main applications in two areas: smart farming
    and water management. a: SMART FARMING In smart farming, farmers have better control
    over the cultivation process including animal husbandry, crop diseases, pest control,
    moisture control, and weather prediction through real-time monitoring of crops,
    an inspection of irrigation equipment, and predictive maintenance of the crops
    and field as required. Game theory has been used considerably for these purposes.
    In [425], for example, a smart farming technique is proposed using a cooperative
    game that enforce farms to cooperate together for better performance and solving
    problems with defective farms. A perfect information non-cooperative game with
    a hierarchical structure is developed in [426] to demonstrate how the production
    efficiency of multiple farms can be affected if some farms may choose to deviate
    from their strategies after the game reach a Nash equilibrium. Blockchain-based
    trust management for agricultural green supply is designed in [427], in which
    the authors use a Bayesian game to ensure the data reliability provided by different
    sensors. For agricultural land fragmentation, a non-cooperative game is proposed
    in [428] to establish the finding that if a government wants to manage agricultural
    land fragmentation, similar strategies should not be chosen for all agricultural
    lands. Finally, how grain production management can be used to reduce global warming
    under financial constraints and the time value of money is studied in [429]. In
    particular, the authors developed an evolutionary game to evaluate the performance
    of financially constrained producers when they adopt a sustainability strategy
    while considering the government’s long-term cap-and-trade regulation. b: WATER
    MANAGEMENT Another important attribute of agriculture is the water management
    system. In fact, agriculture is the largest consumer of water [430], and a water
    management system is responsible for administering water across different lands
    or scheduling the flow of water for the same land for irrigation purposes. Sharing
    a body of water for agricultural practices raised conflicts between farmers for
    centuries, some of which have been captured in game theory for developing water
    management solutions. Several kinds of literature in the eighties and nineties
    addressed various water management problems among different farms. For example,
    the authors in [431] suggest an oligopoly model to set the definition of the equilibrium
    on water volume to find a solution to the irrigation problem. In [432], the problem
    of pumping water from a common aquifer is modeled using differential open loop
    and feedback games. It is demonstrated that dynamic inefficiency increases as
    more landowners have access to the aquifer. Combining game theory with policy
    analysis, the authors in [433] investigate how irrigation institutes influence
    the distribution of equilibrium outcomes of irrigators. Today, the management
    of water for irrigation still remains a challenge as part of the smart agricultural
    CPS. In [434], Wald’s maximin model of game theory is used for modeling the decision-making
    process in farming irrigation systems considering uncertainties. A Bayesian game
    theory is used in [435] to develop an intelligent IoT irrigation system that carries
    out cruise irrigation based on humidity information and a path planning algorithm.
    Finally, a detailed discussion on farmers’ cooperation in participatory irrigation
    is given in [436], in which game theory is used to identify that local funds may
    incentivize farmers to cooperate together to make participatory irrigation sustainable.
    8) APPLICATION IN INDUSTRY 4.0 According to [437], the architecture of Industry
    4.0 consists of all levels depicted in Fig. 1 and subsequently possesses all desired
    attributes articulated in Section II-B. As a result, as other CPS discussed in
    this paper, the game theory also has increased applications in the area of manufacturing
    - in particular for quality assurance, sustainable manufacturing, and production
    certainty in Industry 4.0. a: QUALITY ASSURANCE Irrespective of the product type
    - whether the plant is for the healthcare service or food quality assessment,
    for example - game theory has found its application in all sectors of manufacturing.
    In healthcare service, for instance, an equilibrial service composition model
    in cloud manufacturing is proposed in [438]. In the proposed model, both cooperative
    and non-cooperative games are used to model the interaction between manufacturing
    cloud service providers and consumers to ensure improved quality of services based
    on consumers’ needs. In the sports industry, game theory is used in [439] to provide
    efficient services in the sports arena. In particular, a two-player game-based
    model is formulated for efficient decision-making by monitoring officials utilizing
    IoT-based data on athletes’ performance. For smart food quality assessment, a
    game theory-based framework is established by [440]. In the framework, a Bayesian
    game is explored to develop a computing platform for quantifying the probability
    of food quality using IoT-based data from restaurants and food hubs. b: SUSTAINABLE
    MANUFACTURING In the fashion industry, shoes and clothes are being shifted towards
    sustainable manufacturing - the culture of throwing away products is replaced
    by responsible consumerism. However, this practice is yet to be adopted by the
    manufacturing farms with large-market shares. In [441], the authors have discussed
    how different types of game models can effectively capture the engagement of different
    stakeholders to practice sustainable product usage and how that can impact the
    apparel industry. Evolutionary game theory is being used in [442] and [443] to
    understand how the Government’s regulation and enterprise decisions can affect
    the manufacturing industry and select the green and low-carbon innovation in manufacturing
    enterprises. c: PRODUCTION CERTAINTY & OTHERS To reduce the supply chain risk
    and uncertainties of producing customized products, a three-level game theoretic
    model is proposed in [444] in the area of crowd-sourced manufacturing. This study
    models interactive decisions that determine the optimal solutions for a single
    manufacturer, multiple distributors, and multiple subcontractors by confirming
    that all stakeholders’ profits are maximized. Among other manufacturing industries,
    the use of game theory can be found in cellular manufacturing systems (using a
    cooperative game [445]), cloud manufacturing (using a minority game [446]), vaccine
    manufacturing (using an evolutionary game [447]), warehousing industry (using
    a cooperative game [448]), and prefabricated building project (using an extensive
    form game [292]). SECTION V. Proposals for Future Research Based on the discussion
    in this paper, it is clear that the properties of CPS and how different types
    of CPS are contributing to changing our lives are well demonstrated in the existing
    literature. On the one hand, CPS like tele-medicine systems, smart grids, smart
    agricultural systems, and autonomous robots offer facilities including emergency
    diagnosis and treatments, electricity, sustainable food supply, and defense against
    the enemies that are critical for our survival. On the other hand, the amenities
    and convenience offered by green buildings, intelligent transportation systems,
    industry 4.0, and smart cities make our lives spontaneously easy and rewarding.
    We have seen in our discussion - also summarized in Table 1 - that the characteristics
    of CPS are well aligned with the properties of multi-agent systems. Therefore,
    the usefulness of outcomes of various CPS is contingent on the interaction between
    different agents and their interactive decision-making models. Given this context,
    game theory has found profound applications in CPS research and has been used
    extensively in the literature - as compiled in Table 2 and Table 3 - to address
    miscellaneous decision-making and control challenges. However, albeit the contribution
    of game theory in the CPS research to date is voluminous, there are a number of
    potential challenges that are yet to solve - particularly lying in innovative
    ways to merge the roles of different CPS for the greater good. These challenges
    are encapsulated in the following discussion. A. Connected Community While green
    buildings are capable of optimally managing their own resources as well as sharing
    some of their resources with neighboring buildings, how such individual and collective
    management of resources can be exploited to benefit other CPS needs to be investigated.
    For example, as buildings are responsible for 60% of total electricity consumption
    [48], collectively they could be very useful for providing demand flexibility
    to the grid. However, this would necessitate multiple buildings to cooperate with
    one another and act as a connected community [121], which is challenging given
    the fact that building owners are self-interest entities. Game theory could be
    a potential tool to model such a scenario. For example, either coalition formation
    or a potential game could be used to encourage coalitions among different green
    buildings to exploit their elasticity in managing distributed energy resources
    to provide demand flexibility to the grid. B. Intelligent Transportation for Medical
    Purposes Emergency response is a crucial part of medical CPS and intelligent management
    of ambulances is vital for this service. In an emergency, it is not only important
    that ambulances are dispatched as a priority but also choosing the optimal path
    to reach the patient at the earliest possible time is also essential. Making ambulances
    parts of intelligent transportation systems could be one potential solution to
    increase the efficiency of medical services. In that case, ambulances will be
    able to interact with other intelligent vehicles on road, information hubs, and
    satellite navigators to find the optimal route to reach their destination and
    help save millions of lives. For example, a Stackelberg game [284] can be used
    to model some scenarios in which ambulances - as part of the intelligent transportation
    system - will act as the followers of the game to optimize their reaction time
    and time delay to reach the destination in response to the medical emergency request
    issued by the medical CPS - modeled as the leader of the game. C. Interference
    in Autonomous Robotics Systems UAV-based networks are self-organizing networks
    that are prone to wireless interference. It is expected that a large number of
    UAVs and UGVs will be deployed for different tasks, which will intensify the challenge.
    Hence, new techniques will need to be developed to address interference management.
    One potential way is to use a mean field game to analyze the dynamics of a large
    number of interacting rational agents (i.e., UAV or UGV). Mean field game has
    the capacity to capture the stochastic nature of a system, e.g., channel dynamics
    of UAV-based network in this case, without the need for information exchange during
    the execution of the algorithm [391]. Therefore, it could be a suitable tool to
    model interference in UAV-based networks with limited backhaul and fronthaul connectivity.
    D. Reinforcement Learning for Smart Agriculture In reinforcement learning-based
    game theoretic models, an agent automatically learns from its past experience
    and environment and utilizes the feedback to strategically decide on its action
    to optimize its objective. Thus, such a technique is very suitable for smart agriculture
    to reduce the impact of the uncertainty of weather conditions, the pattern of
    weed attacks on the crop, market volatility, and local demand for food on farming.
    Further, such a model could also be useful for learning the best way to distribute
    water among different farms and eventually improve the performance in every session
    to optimize the use of water. E. Resource Recycling in Smart Cities As discussed
    earlier, a smart city could be thought of as a platform in which different types
    of CPS exist together. While it is a challenging task to maintain all the resources
    needed by different systems simultaneously, it also opens opportunities to recycle
    some of the resources within the smart city. For example, if UAVs are primarily
    used for goods delivery purposes [460], it could be also possible to opportunistically
    use these UAVs for providing security services to the city [461]. This will not
    only help the city to save significant costs but also reduce the waste material
    in the long term for the betterment of the environment. Nonetheless, it is a significant
    challenge to model the opportunistic use of resources for different purposes,
    which can be modeled via resource-sharing games like cake-cutting or cooperative
    games. F. Knowledge-Based User Motivation for Smart Grid In the future, prosumers
    will play a major role in smart grid energy management. Hence, it is important
    for energy users to learn about the future energy transition and equip themselves
    with the knowledge and skills that are needed to be a part of this transition.
    This is mainly because people’s perspective about technology and using capability
    can significantly impact the uptake of a new technology [462], [463]. Therefore,
    a significant amount of research needs to be devoted to preparing courses and
    training modules targeting different classes of people to educate them about future
    energy transition, its importance, and how it is going to impact the environment
    and people’s life in the future. SECTION VI. Conclusion In this paper, we have
    provided a summary of the recent advances in game theoretic applications to cyber-physical
    systems. For that purpose, first, we have introduced different types of cyber-physical
    systems and discussed the general framework that all cyber-physical systems have
    in common. Second, background on different types of game theoretic models has
    been given and popular solution concepts of each type of game have been discussed.
    Third, the relevance of game-theoretic applications to cyber-physical systems
    has been identified through a thorough review of cyber-physical systems’ properties.
    Then, we have discussed how diverse game theoretic approaches have been explored
    to address challenges in different cyber-physical systems followed by a short
    summary of these approaches. We have also identified a number of important topics
    to consider for future research. Due to the importance of this topic in our current
    data-driven world and the comprehensive provided discussion, discussion, it is
    hoped that this paper will be useful to both experts and non-experts in developing
    a greater understanding of the role of game theory in the study of cyber-physical
    systems, and will serve as an entry point into the subject for those wishing to
    enter the field. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like

    Internet of things (IoT) is a network of physical devices together with network
    components and data analytics tools. The building blocks of IoT such as sensors,
    network tools and software systems are all interconnected to enable them to collect,
    exchange and process data. Due to the recent technological developments, the widespread
    usage of IoT systems is on the rise. According to the predictions made by Cisco,
    there will be 75 billion devices connected to the internet by 2025 [1]. IoT has
    a great potential to revolutionize the businesses and society in terms of various
    aspects. For example, different applications of IoT are capable of efficiency
    increments, improvement in the quality of life, and achieving a better management.
    Countless physical devices and objects are mentioned as “Smart” devices (e.g.,
    appliances, trash cans, water meters, vending machines). Such devices involve
    contemporary features that are accomplished by utilizing location-based technologies
    and exchanging data with each other ubiquitously. The utilization of IoT enables
    the governments to develop and deploy intelligent technical solutions, such as
    smart transportation systems [2], smart parking [3], smart homes and buildings
    [4], and smart bridges [5]. It is possible to implement IoT based systems in the
    agricultural sector as well. Some examples of these systems are real-time farm
    monitoring, weather prediction and water conservation. Like all of the IoT applications,
    these use cases require sensors, data collection and data processing, which allow
    them to be called examples of “Smart Agriculture (SA)”. Agriculture plays a critical
    role in the growth of the economies of countries and also for the human species
    because it allows production of the main sources of food. It also holds an important
    place in the development of human civilization. According to the United Nation
    Food and Agriculture Organization, 70% more food is needed to feed the additional
    2.3 billion people across the globe by 2050 [6]. Due to the increased demand for
    food, additional effort is put into increasing the efficiency of food production.
    Employing the emerging technologies and techniques in the field of agriculture
    can be considered as one strategy to achieve this. A generic farm monitoring IoT
    system involves deployment of different types of sensors such as environmental
    and soil sensors. Processing of the data collected by IoT sensors like CO2, rain,
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture [7], and plant health information [8] may
    help in developing strategies to achieve improvement in productivity as well as
    economic profit. After being collected, these data are then sent to cloud servers
    through gateways by means of the communication protocol used in the system (Fig.
    1). Download : Download high-res image (441KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 1. End to end data flow in a smart farm. One of the problems that the farming
    sector is facing today is climate change which results in inefficiencies in the
    weather forecast [9]. As a result, it becomes difficult for farmers to make strategic
    decisions for preventing damages due to uncertain weather changes. It is possible
    to make any emergent decision by using the IoT weather predictive models. In this
    way, farmers can make predictions on the rainfall and control pesticide waste.
    Hence, advanced irrigation and fertigation systems considering environmental parameters
    can be built. It is possible to optimize irrigation water in farms through IoT
    systems. Using the sensors involved in such systems, various data are collected
    and they are stored in a cloud database for generating predictive models. Such
    models may be utilized to forecast weather conditions or water needs of the plants.
    As a result, the risk of throwing excess water to the plants is reduced. This
    brings about reductions in water costs as well as water-related issues. When the
    wireless communication protocols suitable for SA systems are considered, they
    are expected to allow for convenient data transmission between the components
    of the system. As a result, it becomes possible to collect a large amount of data
    from a variety of sensors. These data can then be processed to improve efficiency
    in different aspects such as water saving by means of irrigation optimization
    or yield maximization through fertilizer optimization. The appropriateness of
    a protocol to an SA system may be evaluated considering different parameters such
    as range, power consumption, data transmission rate, and cost, which are provided
    as the most important parameters for wireless communications [10]. Each of these
    protocols have some advantages and disadvantages over others. Therefore, selecting
    the most suitable protocol for a particular SA system is an intensive task. Considering
    the necessities in SA applications, usage of low power wide area network (LPWAN)
    communication protocols is becoming more widespread. The design of LPWAN protocols
    allows for a high number of low-power devices to be distributed over very large
    areas and establish a reliable connection between them. Long Range Wide Area Network
    (LoRaWAN), Sigfox, and Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) can be considered
    as the leading LPWAN technologies [11]. On the other hand, there are some widely
    used non-LPWAN protocols that are Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) and ZigBee. Obviously,
    the wireless link between the components is important and inherent feature of
    SA systems. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate the capabilities and the properties
    of the available wireless communication protocols at the design stage of the SA
    systems to fulfill their application-specific requirements. One example may be
    the sensors distributed uniformly over the entire farm. Providing power to these
    sensors and collecting data from them may be an issue especially when the farm
    spans over large areas. The power consumption associated with the communication
    protocol in such sensors is expected to be low while allowing for wireless data
    transmission to remote locations. As can be understood from this example, there
    may be various types of issues related with the SA application and the available
    protocols. Hence, it is essential to evaluate the features of the protocols together
    with the SA system requirements. LoRaWAN, Sigfox, NB-IoT, Wi-Fi, and ZigBee may
    be considered as key protocols for SA systems because these are either recently
    developed or widely used protocols in SA applications. Also, they require different
    infrastructures and hardware for different level of budgets. Hence, these protocols
    may fulfill the needs of SA systems for various applications. Even though there
    are some other LPWAN protocols (such as MIoTy, NB-Fi, and Weightless) that are
    mentioned in the IoT literature, there no application examples of them in SA domain
    [12,13]. As a result, only these five protocols are involved within the scope
    of this study. As for the SA applications, it was found out that there are six
    major application types commonly mentioned in the relevant literature. These application
    types are water saving, weather forecasting, soil condition monitoring, fertilizer
    optimization, crop disease and pest management, and energy harvesting. Therefore,
    the suitability of the protocols for these application domains is discussed. In
    the next section, existing review studies about SA mentioned, their limitations
    are highlighted, and contributions of this study are provided. That section is
    useful for understanding how this review differs from the existing ones and fills
    the gap in the literature. Since the paper focuses on smart agriculture applications,
    the general architecture of SA systems is introduced in Section 3. The commonly
    used layers in the literature are explained with a focus on the network layer.
    One of the aims of this study is to introduce the features of some wireless communication
    protocols within the context of SA applications. Therefore, in Section 4, such
    information is provided to accomplish this aim. This information involves comparing
    the significant properties of the protocols. Also, some inconsistencies in various
    sources are highlighted. Next in Section 5, requirements of the SA applications
    have been introduced together with some use cases. We believe that clear understanding
    of application-specific requirements and protocol-specific features, which are
    given in Sections 4 and 5, is critical at the design stage of the SA systems.
    So with this study, we also aim to provide an insight for the points to consider
    when designing an SA system. In Section 6, current challenges and limitations
    are provided within the scope of the paper. The future trends are highlighted
    in Section 7 to provide an idea on what protocols may be more common than others.
    We believe that understanding the leading protocol provides useful insight for
    future applications. Finally, the paper is concluded with Section 8. 2. Related
    works 2.1. Literature review and motivation The wireless communication protocols
    are integral and important part of SA applications. This can be verified by the
    fact that they are discussed in some of the relevant review papers. For example,
    LoRaWAN and its potential for smart farming were discussed earlier by Citoni et
    al. [14]. It was stated that LoRaWAN is the most appropriate protocol for IoT
    as it satisfies three main metrics that are energy efficiency, coverage, and scalability.
    In that paper, the focus is given to the features and applications of LoRaWAN.
    Besides, limitations and research challenges of this protocol is provided and
    the associated low data transmission rate is underlined. In another work surveying
    IoT systems about arable farming, four of these key protocols (ZigBee, LoRaWAN,
    Wi-Fi and Sigfox) are said to be relatively common [15]. In that work, the related
    IoT systems are described using three layers: device layer, network layer and
    application layer. Challenges associated with each of these layers are given separately.
    Latency, data rate, wireless link quality and communication range are some of
    the given challenges about the network layer. However, comparison of these protocols
    and their applications are not provided explicitly in the paper. In addition,
    there are numerous review papers involve various applications of IoT in different
    fields of agriculture [[16], [17], [18]]. Yet, they do not explicitly mention
    the communication protocols in these applications. Furthermore, in some other
    previous surveys, properties of the IoT protocols are provided together with their
    example applications [14,15]. However, the inconsistent technical information
    given in different works are underlined in none of the previous review papers.
    Besides, the classification of SA studies based on both their application area
    and the utilized communication protocols are not discussed in detail yet. In addition,
    many aspects of smart farming have been discussed by Farooq et al. [19]. For example,
    topics like cloud computing, big data storage, security issues, farm management
    as well as IoT protocols for SA are covered. The SA application domains were collected
    under three different topics as livestock monitoring, precision farming, and greenhouse
    monitoring. Each topic involves different applications such as weather monitoring,
    pest and crop disease monitoring, irrigation monitoring, and water management.
    Even though the scope of the paper is very wide, the information provided about
    the protocols is quite limited, and their limitations and advantages are not discussed
    for specific application domains. Sinha and Dhanalakshmi made a thorough discussion
    about the important components of IoT in SA including new technologies, data analytics,
    and security issues [20]. The study involves sections about numerous application
    domains like management of water, nutrient, waste, soil, and irrigation. The importance
    of the wireless technologies has been mentioned in the paper, but there is no
    dedicated explanation for the wireless communication protocols for the application
    domains. One survey paper where the reason for inconsistent information in the
    protocol specifications mentioned was written by Foubert and Mitton [10]. In that
    study, they propose a direct selection guide among the long-range wireless protocols
    after introducing their respective properties. The long-range protocols have been
    evaluated under two main categories as mobile band-based and ISM band-based. Even
    though an application example about of agriculture has been demonstrated in the
    paper, the main theme of the paper is not focused on various agricultural applications.
    In addition to research papers, there are numerous whitepapers in which current
    state analysis and future forecasts about smart agriculture market are made. In
    particular, the estimated worth of the SA market for 2021 is reported to be USD
    12.9 billion, and this amount is projected to increase up to USD 20.8 billion
    in 2026 [21]. It has been highlighted that the factors like world population growth
    and loss of arable lands increase the necessity of efficient usage of energy resources
    as well as the technology-supported agricultural production [22]. As a result,
    it is possible to conclude that utilization of energy efficient technologies is
    critical for sustainability of food production in a contemporary way. Besides,
    development of agricultural systems concerning the energy efficiency is important
    for fighting against the serious issues like climate change and global warming.
    In a very recent whitepaper, importance of digital technologies for agriculture
    has been exhaustively presented [23]. According to the whitepaper, the position
    of wireless sensors and networks in agricultural applications is very critical
    and their use is becoming more widespread together with IoT technology. The energy
    consumption issue of wireless sensors has been mentioned and the importance of
    research activities about it is underlined. The increasing number of the SA systems
    and research papers in this field are obvious results of ever increasing human
    population in the world. Due to the large amount of studies published in the domain
    of SA for various applications, it is critical to categorize and analyze the most
    recent publications in this field. In addition, since the data transfer between
    the components of an SA system is commonly accomplished via wireless links, wireless
    communication protocols are important elements of SA systems. Hence, determination
    of most common protocols for specific applications is necessary for making predictions
    on the potential future directions of the related research in SA domain. The protocols
    used in the wireless links are the major factors that affect the overall energy
    efficiency of the system because there is a continuous communication among the
    system components. Thus, evaluation of an SA system in terms of its energy consumption
    requires careful consideration of the wireless communication protocol used within
    the system. Therefore, an exhaustive comparison among the features of the widely
    used wireless communication protocols is necessary for fulfilling the requirements
    of a particular SA systems at the design stage. The motivation of this review
    study is to help the researchers recognize the prospective problems due to the
    limitations of the protocols and their application-specific advantages. 2.2. Research
    gaps and contributions Despite the presence of various review papers about different
    aspects of SA systems, one can confidently claim that there is not a dedicated
    study discussing the features of different wireless communication protocols for
    specific SA applications. In particular, the existing studies either do not mention
    the possible applications of the protocols by comparing them or involve only limited
    number of protocols (See Section 2.1). In this paper, we surveyed a comprehensive
    characterization of these key protocols and discussed their benefits for the future
    SA applications. To find the related papers, year-based search activities were
    performed in three platforms, namely, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar.
    Analysis of annual distribution of the available papers is a common method that
    can be seen in some other review studies [17,24]. The used search terms consisted
    of the name of the protocol together with “smart agriculture” keyword. The related
    search results were inspected manually. There were two main reasons for this manual
    inspection. i) Obviously, the search results contained papers from broad range
    of applications. However, the scope of this study is limited to six major application
    areas (see Section 1). Manual inspection of the search results was required to
    filter out those studies that were not about one of the six application areas.
    ii) In addition, it was observed that the results were not provided in detail
    in some of the conference proceedings. Therefore, such studies were not considered
    as complete work and hence excluded from the survey. Furthermore, the review papers
    within the search results were used as alternative source for finding more studies
    of application scenarios. In other words, the appropriate references given in
    these review papers were explicitly reviewed before being added to the survey.
    We also represent a set of attributes to objectively compare different kinds of
    protocols. Many papers involving an SA application have been carefully investigated
    and it has been found out that some protocols are more common. Therefore, we explored
    the applications in which these protocols are used and categorized them in terms
    of the following key points: • Properties of the protocols used (operating frequency,
    data rate, range, power consumption, security, cost, limitations) • Purpose of
    the application Thus, the main contributions of the paper are the following: 1)When
    a communication protocol is considered, it is expected to find similar technical
    specifications in different resources. However, in the existing studies where
    one of the five communication protocols is used, it was observed that there is
    some inconsistent information about the protocols. This is an undesired situation
    since it may cause confusion at the design stage of SA systems. When the related
    review papers are investigated, no discussion about such inconsistencies have
    been encountered. Therefore, we consider this absence as a research gap, and in
    this study, highlight the inconsistent information found in the literature. This
    is accomplished by collecting most of the features and the corresponding technical
    specifications together and presented in an organized way. For this purpose, two
    tables (Tables 1 and 2) have been generated in Section 4. We believe that these
    tables facilitate the comparison of the technical specifications of these protocols
    and allows for reaching the protocol-specific features in a convenient way. In
    addition, the possible reasons for encountering such inconsistencies are discussed.
    Together with these discussions, the tables may guide the possible researchers
    for selecting the protocol appropriately and allow for reaching the particular
    study for the design details. Table 1. Key Features of Wireless Communication

    the key points above, the appropriateness of a particular protocol to a particular
    SA application is discussed. For this purpose, features offered by the communication
    protocols have been explained (See Section 4) and the requirements for the SA
    applications are provided (See Section 5). 3)The open issues, challenges, and
    future technological trends have been evaluated within the scope of wireless communication
    protocols in SA. In particular, issues related with financial cost, security in
    SA systems, quality of the communication, and hardware optimization are mentioned.
    In addition, promising and popular technologies requiring effective usage of the
    communication protocols are listed as the trending topics such as aerial systems,
    cellular communication, big data analytics, and energy harvesting. 4)To highlight
    the leading protocol and the SA application area, year-based analysis of the existing
    studies has been performed. To achieve this, the papers in the literature are
    categorized considering their application area, the network protocols used and
    the year of publication. For each of the categories, rates of changes in the number
    of publications are calculated. Such an analysis allows for understanding the
    most common protocol as well as the SA application area together with generating
    future projections. 3. The architecture of smart agriculture The IoT systems,
    in general, have architectures based on different layers. However, there is not
    a standard list of layers that is admitted by all the researchers [81]. The differences
    in the various sources are possibly because of the different necessities in the
    applications as well as the naming conventions preferred by the authors. For example,
    a smart city application may have several layers like physical, network, database,
    virtualization, data analytics, cognition, sensing, middleware, and application
    layers [[82], [83], [84]]. Similarly, in papers related to SA, different layers
    are mentioned. However, we decide to include those layers that are common in majority
    of the previous work [[85], [86], [87]]. These layers are the perception layer,
    network layer and application layer and they are detailed in the following subsections
    (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (369KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Layers of a generic smart agriculture system. 3.1. Perception layer
    This is the layer where the real-world integration is performed by collecting
    application-specific data through the sensors. It is constructed of physical objects
    (i.e. sensors and actuators) that can take physical quantities (temperature, humidity,
    wind speed and direction, solar radiation, air quality, etc.), process, store
    and transmit the data, and transform the data into digital control signals. The
    specifications of the hardware involved in this layer need to be determined according
    to the requirements of the application. For example, parameters like sensitivity,
    operating range and resolution of the sensors should be carefully inspected to
    decide if they are suitable for the intended measurement. 3.2. Network layer This
    layer is considered as two different layers namely, the network (or gateway) layer
    and the transport (or transmission) layer by some authors [[88], [89], [90], [91]].
    On the other hand, it is considered as one single layer in some sources [15,19,[25],
    [56], [92], [93], [94]]. This layer makes the connection between the perception
    and application layers. This is the layer where the digital data collected from
    the physical environment is sent to the network gateway for storing them in a
    cloud or a local database. In SA applications, it beneficial to transmit the data
    wirelessly because the distance between the perception layer nodes and the network
    layer receiver is possibly very high. Besides, a wireless link will enable convenient
    and flexible location of the sensor in the field. For these purposes, the wireless
    data transfer between the sensors and the gateway is accomplished through various
    protocols such as LoRaWAN, Sigfox, NB-IoT, Wi-Fi, and ZigBee. 3.3. Application
    layer It is the layer enabling the user interaction. The data collected at the
    perception layer is made available for the end-user at the application layer.
    This layer provides services by means of a set of IoT protocols (MQTT, XMPP, CoAP,
    RESTFUL, AMQP, etc.) for communicating with the database. This data is visualized
    for user information and possible user intervention. This layer is important for
    distant monitoring of the system related data (real-time or historical) and performing
    required actions remotely. Besides, these tasks requiring access to system data
    should involve authorization control which is accomplished in the application
    layer as well. 4. Wireless communication protocols in smart agriculture Based
    on the range of coverage, the wireless communication protocols can be grouped
    under two main categories as long-range and short-range protocols. Usage of these
    protocols can be determined by considering the conditions and requirements of
    the system [[63], [95], [96]]. Long-range network protocols are capable of transmitting
    data from one device to another over vast distances and some examples are LoRaWAN
    [63], Sigfox [97], and NB-IoT [98]. These protocols are used within SA systems
    that require to connect devices in very large fields. On the other hand, short-range
    network protocols such as Wi-Fi [98] and ZigBee [99] allow data to be transferred
    over shorter distances, and are more appropriate for smaller scaled SA systems.
    Visual comparison of these protocols in terms of range, data rate and energy consumption
    are given in Fig. 3 and they are detailed by describing their technical specifications
    in the following sub-sections. Download : Download high-res image (137KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Comparison of the wireless communication protocols.
    The power consumption levels are color-coded as shown by the legend on the top
    right side. There exist numerous features of these protocols some of which are
    more significant than others in terms of IoT requirements. For instance, SA applications
    should be able to handle adequate data transfer rate, also have a large range
    of coverage because of the high number of sensors spread over the entire field.
    Besides, it is not practical to provide line power to all of the sensors individually.
    Therefore, the sensors may be powered by batteries and a high replacement interval
    for the batteries is desired. As a result, the total power consumption is another
    key parameter for sensors, which is affected by the power requirement level of
    the communication protocol used. The operating frequency of a protocol is a parameter
    that directly affects the other parameters like data rate, coverage, and energy
    consumption. For example, a high operating frequency is likely to cause more power
    consumption while allowing for a higher data rate. Like most of the systems connected
    to the internet, SA systems are vulnerable to possible cyber-attacks. Hence, ensuring
    the security of the system at all layers is an important issue. The properties
    like power consumption, transmission rate, and coverage are mentioned as the important
    requirements of an IoT communication protocol in the literature [14,96,100]. Considering
    these key features, two different tables are created by collecting information
    from various sources to compare these protocols. The more significant properties
    involving the key features are collected in Table 1 and the other properties that
    are less commonly mentioned in the literature are given in Table 2. As can be
    seen in Tables 1 and 2, different values for some properties of the protocols
    are specified in different sources. For example, the specified range for ZigBee
    changes from 10 m to 120 m according to information collected from different sources
    [14,15,[26], [27], [31], [32], [33], [34]]. Similarly, in eight different sources,
    the minimum and maximum data rates for Sigfox are given in the range between 10
    bps and 1000 bps [15,25,[46], [48], [52], [53], [54], [55]]. The reason for such
    inconsistent information may originate from various causes. For instance, the
    specifications of the hardware used for taking the measurements affect the result.
    Also, the conditions of the medium (like humidity percentage) where the measurements
    are taken have some influence on the observations. Furthermore, licensed frequency
    bands for particular communication protocols in some countries may be different.
    Therefore, even though all other conditions are suitable for achieving a high
    data transmission range, it may be limited by constitutions of Information and
    Communication Technologies (ICT). However, the origin of such inconsistent information
    is mentioned in none of the references in Tables 1 and 2. In a typical SA system,
    large number of sensors are involved and they are expected to communicate with
    the gateway from a distant location. Thus, a higher data rate is needed. In the
    short-range protocols, a solution to achieve larger coverage area is to add more
    network nodes to the system, however it increases the network complexity as well
    as the deployment cost [101]. Among the long-range protocols, Sigfox has the largest
    range but its data rate is about 1/250 times of NB-IoT and 1/50 times of LoRaWAN
    which makes it an improper solution for SA systems. By its second largest range,
    LoRaWAN has a data rate of about 1/5 times smaller than NB-IoT. However, in terms
    of power consumption and cost, LoRaWAN is superior to NB-IoT. 4.1. ZigBee ZigBee
    is a Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) communication protocol based on the
    802.15.4 standard. It was developed by ZigBee Alliance and its two major properties
    are being low cost and consuming low power, which make them suitable for home
    automation and networking [102]. ZigBee offers reliability, cost-effectiveness,
    security, low power consumption, 16-bit/64-bit addressing mode, and supports star,
    peer to peer, and cluster tree topologies. It has recently attracted the interest
    of the research community due to such important features and for the deployment
    of wireless sensor networks (WSN) [103]. The usefulness of ZigBee protocol for
    SA was shown in the numerous and diverse applications mentioned in the earlier
    works. In particular, low-power WSN topologies consisting of multiple sensors
    as end-nodes and a router for transmitting the data over larger distances may
    be equipped with ZigBee [19]. For instance, ZigBee-based WSN architectures exist
    for monitoring the temperature of soil and humidity as well as classifying the
    content of the soil moisture using deep learning methods [104]. Since the ZigBee
    hardware is widely available in the market, it is commonly utilized for quick
    prototyping by being attached to microcontroller boards [105] and single board
    computers [106]. Despite its common usage in SA, one major drawback of ZigBee
    is reported to be not having sleep-mode operation [107]. This situation may cause
    inefficient power consumption, which is a key factor for IoT applications. However,
    transition between active and sleep modes can be achieved by appropriate programming
    and hardware. One example can be monitoring of a greenhouse using ZigBee transceiver
    modules where power consumption analysis are performed for two different durations
    of sleep period [108]. Another example usage may be a ZigBee network with mesh
    topology developed for water saving [109]. In that work, the collected soil parameters
    are effectively transmitted to a distance of 75 m where an aggregation node exists
    for processing of the received data. In the context of SA, the main challenge
    with using ZigBee may be the inefficient power consumption and the low range and
    data rate features. Therefore, utilization of this protocol is not appropriate
    when the agricultural land is very large and the distance between the sensor nodes
    is high. Instead, ZigBee is more suitable for small scaled experimental trial
    areas. 4.2. Wi-Fi Wi-Fi is one of the earliest and most commonly used wireless
    technologies with the particularly IEEE 802.11 standard being released in 1997
    [110,111]. It has been recognized as the most promising alternative to the Global
    Positioning System (GPS) for indoor context-aware and location-based services.
    It is mainly used in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) through the use of the
    2.4 GHz or 5 GHz frequency bands. Its transmission range may be up to 1 km and
    the minimum data rate is 150 kb/s. As Wi-Fi is commonly available in many indoor
    and outdoor locations, it is considered as the first option for various IoT applications
    of SA like data collection and cloud connection [112] and condition prediction
    by means of data mining [113]. It may also be used together with other protocols
    in an SA system. For example, in a hybrid monitoring architecture for SA environment,
    ZigBee is used in the channels requiring low data transmission while Wi-Fi is
    utilized for the tasks like surveillance video streaming [114]. Nevertheless,
    the power consumption level of Wi-Fi is high for several IoT systems. Therefore,
    utilization of Wi-Fi may not be feasible in all SA systems because the power requirement
    for Wi-Fi is difficult to be satisfied in outdoor locations. To overcome this
    shortcoming, there are studies in which external power is provided through in-field
    photovoltaic solar panels [115]. The appropriateness of solar panel usage was
    shown by constructing a tree-structured WSN where the collected soil and environmental
    data at end nodes are transmitted to central fertigation unit. In addition, the
    power consumed by the nodes was reduced by adjusting the timing configuration
    of the data acquisition and transmission intervals. One alternative scenario in
    which Wi-Fi is utilized can be a smart irrigation system based on soil moisture
    measurements and weather forecasting [116]. This application architecture involves
    establishment of a Wi-Fi link between the sensors in the field and a UAV that
    is used as a water-spraying agent in the system. The weather forecast information
    was fetched from an open weather API and this information was combined with the
    sensor data for spraying water to the field. Even though Wi-Fi protocol is old
    and mature technology, the major limitation is its high-power consumption. Therefore,
    it becomes almost impossible to use this protocol when the hardware cannot be
    connected to main power line. Even though there are some efforts in using solar
    panels, this brings about the installation and maintenance costs. 4.3. Sigfox
    Sigfox is a wireless communication technology that uses ultra-narrowband cellular
    networks therefore it is capable of performing transmission with low data rate.
    The cellular infrastructure allows Sigfox to be used in rural areas thereby making
    it appropriate for IoT and M2M systems [117]. One of the early usages of the Sigfox
    network was a system for localizing livestock in mountain grassland during the
    summer season [118,119]. With the help of Sigfox end-to-end communication, it
    can be possible to divide into various layers namely end layer, backbone layer
    and sensing layer and allow them to interact with each other to provide the application
    services for SA [120]. For example, monitor silo and tank levels, measure the
    temperature of grain stocks, protect remote farmhouses and outbuildings, secure
    gates and deter livestock thieves, optimize colony health with remotely monitored
    beehives, monitor food temperatures along the entire cold chain [121]. A water
    quality monitoring system can be provided as an example application of Sigfox
    in SA [122]. The architecture of this system takes advantage of two key properties
    of Sigfox that are operation with low duty cycle and using ultra narrow band.
    Since the first property results in low power consumption, the system is equipped
    with a solar panel for charging a Li-Po battery thus yielding an off-grid monitoring
    system. Furthermore, bidirectional control mechanism and improved security are
    mentioned as two important features of Sigfox for the monitoring system. The main
    advantage of Sigfox for being deployed in various SA applications is reported
    to be possessing no requirement for additional facilities as well as having high
    coverage in majority of EU countries. In an irrigation management system developed
    recently, both Sigfox and LoRaWAN were used [123]. The system architecture was
    designed for vertical communication to the cloud, meaning that sensors only communicate
    with a local gateway (i.e. do not communicate with each other). The local communication
    was accomplished via LoRaWAN while the collected data at the local gateway is
    transmitted to a cloud server through Sigfox. Despite its very low power consumption
    feature, Sigfox has low data transmission speed. In addition, it uses unlicensed
    ISM band frequencies which is prone to signal inferences and unreliable data transfer
    [10]. This situation may not be suitable for the agricultural applications where
    efficient data transfer is critical. For example, an irrigation control application
    based on continuous monitoring of soil moisture should be obtaining the relevant
    information on time, otherwise over-or under-irrigation situations may be encountered.
    4.4. Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT) NB-IoT is considered as the latest radio access
    technology that emerges from Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to enable
    support for IoT devices. NB-IoT provides a number of suitable deployment options
    with a massive coverage range. It coexists with Global System for Mobile Communications
    (GSM) and long-term evolution (LTE) under licensed frequency bands 900 MHz [62]
    and it holds a frequency bandwidth of 200 kHz [79]. It offers long battery life,
    excessive coverage area, low cost and high network security [124]. Two successful
    application examples of NB-IoT in SA can be given as livestock tracking and monitoring
    of environmental parameters in a greenhouse [125]. The architecture of the livestock
    tracker system enables instant reporting of the livestock location together with
    the system parameters such as the battery level. The location information, which
    can be determined via mobile networks or satellite systems, may also be useful
    geo-fencing applications. In the greenhouse monitoring system, the architecture
    contains many sensors to collect and monitor detailed data such as water pH level,
    light intensity and energy consumption. The system can run on batteries and features
    a two-way communication scheme for enabling firmware and software upgrade. The
    properties that make NB-IoT a suitable protocol for various SA systems may be
    extensible coverage, half-duplex communication, flexible power consumption based
    on the mode of operation, and improved security. One other example SA architecture
    in which NB-IoT is utilized can be monitoring of a paddy storage [126]. The humidity
    information in the paddy bags was measured by pin sensors and this information
    is transmitted to a gateway using NB-IoT protocol. It was shown that a 10,000
    mAh lithium polymer battery was able to run the system for 48 h. Even though NB-IoT
    offers higher data rate than Sigfox and LoRaWAN, it uses licensed frequency bands
    which brings about subscription costs to the related system. Another source of
    cost for such a system may be the requirement of hardware upgrade when there is
    an existing LTE infrastructure [10]. In the context of smart agriculture, this
    may be a limitation when the reserved investment costs are not high enough to
    afford these costs. 4.5. Long-Range wireless area network (LoRaWAN) LoRaWAN refers
    to a network layer protocol created by the LoRa Alliance and runs on LoRa chips.
    It uses the advantages of LoRa modulation to create networks, and it is focused
    on the IoT paradigm. LoRaWAN uses a star topology where the nodes, collect the
    sensor data and send it to the gateways. The gateways convert these data to a
    form that can be transferred via internet protocol (IP) and then forward it to
    a remote application server through the Internet. It has been specifically designed
    for IoT applications to connect a huge number of sensors, and appliances over
    a network spanning large areas. The LoRaWAN architecture can be divided into two
    parts as front-end and back-end [95,127]. Gateway elements and end-node devices
    constitute the front-end part. On the other hand, the critical tasks like security
    assurance, data storage and query scheduling are performed by the network servers
    that are involved in the back-end part [128]. LoRaWAN is widely used in smart
    city applications because such applications require wide network coverage; however,
    its usage in other social aspects is getting more widespread. The investments
    for LoRaWAN infrastructure by governments and private operators started to be
    realized in the last four years in different countries [129]. LoRaWAN is commonly
    utilized in variety of SA application areas including weather forecasting [130],
    irrigation control and farm monitoring [14]. One notable feature of LoRaWAN is
    low power consumption, which makes it an ideal choice for SA systems. In the presence
    of solar-based energy harvesting capability, it was experimentally shown that
    the estimated battery lifetime of a LoRaWAN unit may be six times of a Wi-Fi unit
    and two times of a ZigBee unit [33]. An IoT architecture having dynamic number
    of layers for different application and computation scenarios was proposed earlier
    [131]. This dynamic structure was shown to be appropriate for various smart systems
    including SA. Experiments with different scales of SA were performed and it was
    reported that a message traffic of 1500 messages/minute can be handled by LoRaWAN
    protocol. In another LoRaWAN-based SA architecture, a middleware layer exists
    at the center and this layer improves scalability of the system by allowing various
    modules be attached to it [132]. Ease of deployment and modularity features of
    LoRaWAN were provided as the leading reasons for using this protocol. Reliable
    data transmission was observed during the field experiments performed for three
    months. Like Sigfox, LoRaWAN uses unlicensed bands and has the same security issues.
    In addition, it is known that LoRaWAN has a poor performance when direct line
    of sight is not available between the transmitting and receiving modules [10].
    This situation may be a major drawback for those SA systems deployed in rural
    areas with uneven terrains. 5. Wireless communication protocols used in various
    smart agriculture applications The developing nations have majority of their Gross
    Domestic Product (GDP) dependent on agriculture [133]. Agricultural activity extends
    from crop cultivation (farming), timber to livestock rearing for domestic consumption
    or economic purposes as raw materials to other activities. It is expected that
    there will be a vast food crisis in the near future because the estimated world
    population for 2050 is 9.7 billion [134]. To overcome this situation, investments
    in the development and deployment of IoT systems particularly in farm automation
    and SA have been increased. Even though there is a diverse range of applications
    of IoT in agriculture, the most common ones may be listed as follows: 1) Automated
    irrigation systems for saving water and time [135,136]. 2) Collection of environmental
    data for weather condition forecasting [137]. 3) Soil condition monitoring for
    yield maximization [[138], [139], [140]]. 4) Crop monitoring to reduce costs [141].
    5) Pest management for preventing diseases [142,143]. 6) Utilization of renewable
    energy sources for cost minimization and sustainability [144,145]. There are numerous
    research activities in each of these fields and in the following subsections,
    the related works are collected according to their area of applications. The relevant
    references in which the utilized communication protocol is explicitly provided
    are summarized in Table 3. It should also be noted that only the studies published
    since 2015 are included in Table III. Table 3. Wireless Communication Protocols

    efficiency of food production requires precise amount of irrigation in agriculture;
    however, the increment in the need for water eventually results in the relevant
    risk of its scarceness. It is also known that 70% of the freshwater in the world
    is required for irrigation of agricultural plants [384,385]. Therefore, efficient
    usage of the water resources is a critical task. To avoid decrements in the yield
    amount due to water stress, the farmers generally tend to apply extra water. Obviously,
    this situation will have a negative impact on the productivity while consuming
    extra water and energy than needed. Besides, over-irrigation may cause some water-related
    diseases as well. Thus, in turn, SA makes it possible to use optimal amount of
    water, avoiding both under- and over-irrigation. Simultaneous accomplishment of
    three key properties that are increasing crop yield, decreasing costs, and maintaining
    environmental sustainability has been the focus of the project “smart water management
    platform” (SWAMP). Development and performance assessment for hands-on applications
    of precision irrigation within this project were performed in four pilot areas
    in three different countries namely, Brazil, Italy and Spain [386]. FIWARE, an
    EU-funded IoT project in which solution libraries for smart applications [387]
    and precision irrigation [388], forms the basis of SWAMP project. It also has
    some common features with alternative smart agriculture initiatives such as “Flexible
    and Precise Irrigation Platform to Improve Farm Scale Water Productivity” (FIGARO)
    project [389] that aims at improving water efficiency while minimizing costs through
    a smart irrigation management platform. In order to outline the challenges and
    constraints of deployment of such IoT based large-scale pilots, Brewster et al.
    discuss several issues including technological and connectivity problems. They
    indicate that LPWAN technologies (such as LoRaWAN and SigFox) may be useful to
    overcome the issues related to coverage [390]. The majority of the studies collect
    and utilize environmental and weather related data such as temperature, humidity,
    soil moisture, and water level [234]. Among the studies concerning water savings,
    Andre et al. developed an irrigation system to optimize the irrigation timings
    [235]. This system is based on WSN for real-time collection of environmental data
    and LoRaWAN is suggested as the suitable protocol for the system. Another way
    to save irrigation water is to apply water locally to the required parts of the
    fields. A rule-based method is developed by Masaba et al. in which the dry parts
    of the field are determined via temperature, humidity and soil moisture readings
    [391]. This system utilizes BLE technology to establish connection between the
    sensor nodes at locations with no internet connection. Noha Kamal et al. design
    an IoT based water quality monitoring system for continuously measuring some parameters
    such as pH, turbidity, and temperature of River Nile [173]. The system is said
    to be suitable for deployment in irrigation canals of River Nile for optimal irrigation.
    Besides, the cloud connection of the system is established using Wi-Fi and extension
    for GSM protocols are suggested as future work. As an example application of livestock
    management, Tanumihardja et al. designed a monitoring system for observing water
    level in troughs. The system employs a WSN that uses LoRaWAN as the wireless communication
    protocol [236]. It allows cattlemen to monitor their trough ubiquitously via mobile
    devices. A Raspberry Pi single board computer was used as a gateway to send the
    data to the server. Since the potential users of the system (i.e. the cattlemen)
    have possibly minimal familiarity with technological devices, it is designed to
    be self-configuring. To achieve low power consumption and remote access requirements,
    ATMega-based microcontrollers are in the sensor nodes that contain float switch
    sensors to measure the water level. 5.2. Weather forecasting and data analytics
    Measuring and monitoring the weather-related parameters is an important task in
    agriculture since sunlight and rainwater are critical for photosynthesis and hydration
    of the plants. Hence, plant growth highly depends on the weather conditions. The
    unpredictable weather is one of the causes of the problems encountered by the
    farmers that eventually results in reduction of production and profit. Thanks
    to novel data analytics methods, it is possible to perform weather forecast by
    using historical weather data. As a result, it becomes possible for the farmers
    to get prepared for various unwanted cases such as pesticide poisoning or irrigation
    just before the rain. For example, if the measured soil moisture is at a level
    which an irrigation activity is required and a rainfall is expected in a short
    time period, then the farmer may choose not to initialize the irrigation. One
    reason for performing weather forecasting or soil condition prediction is to achieve
    water savings. Various smart irrigation frameworks are developed by means of soil
    moisture [392] or soil water requirement [146] prediction to manage the irrigation
    scheduling. Fraga et al. described a smart irrigation system that addresses limitations
    of urban areas such as not having direct access to the internet or electric grid
    [130]. They propose an architecture based on LoRaWAN to make communication with
    sensors and fog nodes. Eventually, optimal irrigation schedule and weather forecasting
    tasks are accomplished. Predicting a future value generally requires utilization
    of some machine learning methods [278]. Braga et al. make use of gradient boosting,
    random forest and deep learning to forecast evapotranspiration, a measure of water
    loss from the plant [393]. Another method based on support vector regression and
    k-means clustering is developed for prediction of soil moisture changes as a response
    to the weather conditions [289]. Even though the majority of the studies about
    forecasting uses LoRaWAN, there are other works based on the other communication
    protocols such as ZigBee [394], BLE [395], and Sigfox [396]. 5.3. Monitoring of
    soil moisture, mineral and pH levels The plants need water as a vital resource
    to live, grow, and reproduce. The water requirement of the different plant species
    may vary from one another. One common way to identify the water requirement of
    a particular plant is attachment of a sensor for measuring the soil moisture and
    the water content in the neighboring area [[397], [398], [399], [400]]. Such a
    measurement enables the farmer be informed about the water content and hence be
    able to determine if an intervention is necessary. In addition, actuators (e.g.
    solenoid valves) can be automatically controlled by programming electronic hardware
    to which the sensors are connected [243]. If a low humidity level is detected
    by the moisture sensor, this data is processed and sent to the solenoid module
    as a control signal to provide the necessary water automatically. Potential of
    hydrogen (pH) is a measure affected by the amount of different minerals present
    in the soil. Some examples of these minerals are nitrogen, potassium, calcium,
    iron, and sulfur where nitrogen and potassium being important minerals for the
    growth of the plant [401]. The pH level changes between 1 and 14 where increment
    in pH value indicates transition from high acidity to high alkalinity. The range
    of pH between 5.5 and 7.5 is said to be optimum for most plants for a proper growth
    [402]. ZigBee is one of the commonly utilized protocols particularly in the systems
    involving soil moisture sensing [403] and environmental data together with pH
    levels [297]. However, LoRaWAN is used in a WSN irrigation system in conjunction
    with aerial image processing where data transfer over longer distances is required.
    The system is intended for monitoring of agricultural parameters in cacao crops
    by providing information about weather, ground conditions, and water flow and
    pressure through a mobile application [330]. Monitoring of soil characteristics
    including pH level and data transfer over short distances via Bluetooth is another
    alternative solution for such applications [404]. 5.4. Fertilizer optimization
    Fertilizer can be defined as the substance containing key nutrients for plant
    growth. These nutrients may be important for particular parts of the plants. For
    example, nitrogen contributes to leaves; phosphorus is critical for root, flowers
    and fruit; and potassium is important for water movement through the stems [405].
    Any lack or abundance of nutrients may lead to serious undesired effects on the
    plants. Therefore, applying correct type of fertilizers in optimal amounts is
    important since their uncontrolled usage may cause imbalance in soil nutrient
    levels. This situation may also contribute to climate change by triggering deforestation
    [120,406]. Nevertheless, an efficient fertilization practice requires determination
    of missing nutrients, fertilizer amount to be applied, and appropriate place for
    fertilization [407]. Satisfaction of these requirements needs to be done carefully
    and for this purpose, special fertilization methods using IoT have been proposed
    in the recent years. The latest IoT applications for fertilization systems aim
    at automatic prediction of the areas with lack of nutrients in the fields [310].
    Such a system allows for optimal usage of fertilizer resources by offering the
    possibility of consuming the fertilizer only on the required locations in the
    field. This optimization can be further improved by combining the fertilization
    process with the irrigation system [151,[408], [409], [410]]. Utilization of other
    technologies is possible in the fertilization systems. In particular, images collected
    through UAVs or remote sensing are useful for calculation of the normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI) that reflects important measures like crop health, vegetation
    amount and nutrients in the soil [29,411,412]. Hence, they allow for location-based
    determination of fertilizer requirements. Recently, NB-IoT protocol for smart
    fertigation is utilized in a tomato greenhouse [227]. The related system design
    involves integration of irrigation and fertilization. The required amount of fertigation
    is automatically determined according to instantaneous greenhouse data. Eventually,
    yield increment, as well as water and fertilizer usage improvement, are achieved.
    In a relatively older work, several issues such as irrigation, fertilization and
    management are addressed particularly in citrus cultivation. The related project
    is based on measurement of citrus soil moisture and nutrients using ZigBee to
    develop a system in which fertilization and irrigation are automated and integrated
    [88]. 5.5. Crop disease and pest management Like inappropriate amount of water
    or nutrients in the soil, pests are one of the other factors having impact on
    the crop yield quantity and quality. In particular, pests may cause diseases and
    hence, prevent the plant from a healthy and productive lifecycle. Therefore, timely
    detection of the threats caused by the pests is important for minimizing the crop
    loss. This detection process can be accomplished by IoT systems in which the data
    collected by the sensors is processed appropriately for pest detection. One successful
    application can be provided as usage of satellite imagery [413] or UAV systems
    [414] for determining the location-based health status of the crops in the large
    fields. Additionally, smart traps successful applications of IoT-based pest management
    because they are capable of capturing, counting and identifying the insects automatically
    [415,416]. Optimal usage of insecticides is another important issue under this
    topic because their inappropriate usage may not provide complete prevention or
    may be harmful to the plant while killing the pests. In an earlier work, a disease
    and pest prediction system, which aims to warn the farmer when there is a risk
    of pest attack, was developed [417]. This system was tested by collecting numerous
    environmental data in an orchard and it can be helpful for applying appropriate
    amounts of insecticides on time. An infection prediction method is developed as
    a part of an integrated smart farm management system [355]. The system involves
    a network framework in which a reliable communication between the IoT devices
    is ensured through LoRaWAN protocol. The prediction algorithm is tested on strawberry
    cultivation as a part of the system for estimating the occurrence frequency of
    pests infecting crops. In another work developed for pest prevention in potato
    plants, climate data collected through low-cost sensors placed inside the farms
    is processed to generate a decision support system [347]. ZigBee protocol is used
    by the sensors for wireless communication within the system. Furthermore, an early
    monitoring and control system against epidemic diseases in potato and tomato crops
    is proposed [418]. Such kind of system provides environmental monitoring data
    that maintain the growth of crops and predicts the conditions that lead to epidemic
    disease appearance. Since a typical agricultural area is very wide, the developers
    preferred to use cellular services due to its relatively long-range and robust
    wireless communication links. The system is proven to be efficient in optimizing
    the total amount of applied chemicals and improving the quality of crops. On the
    other hand, image-based disease detection systems exist. In one of such works,
    the detection system utilizes image compression methods to decrease the total
    data sent to the cloud. The detection algorithm is based on segmentation methods
    together with support vector machines (SVM). The hardware part of the system involves
    Raspberry Pi as the single board computer, and the built-in Wi-Fi module is used
    to establish the cloud connection [351]. 5.6. Energy harvesting IoT devices and
    sensors are intended to work in distant areas where the line power is not readily
    available most of the time. This case is true for particularly SA systems. Besides,
    usage of batteries is not feasible because regular replacement or recharging of
    the batteries are required. Therefore, alternative methods for supplying power
    to such components need to be clearly defined. Some of the methods for providing
    power to IoT hardware include extracting energy from environment through specific
    circuitry. These methods utilize various aspects such as vibration [419], thermal
    energy [420], radio frequency [421], and solar energy [422]. Even though the majority
    of the previous studies on energy harvesting in SA systems are related with solar
    energy [190,423,424], some other works based on radio frequency are present [425].
    Among the systems that utilize solar energy, LoRaWAN and ZigBee are the commonly
    used protocols. A prototype device including a solar panel is designed and manufactured
    in order to collect and transmit data in a SA system [378]. The device uses LoRaWAN
    protocol for communicating with other components in the farming system. This work
    investigates the limitations of LoRaWAN and determines some network parameters
    like data rate and latency. In another work, sensor nodes are powered with solar
    energy to take measurements from the environment and ZigBee protocol is used for
    communication between the nodes [145]. The performance of the solar-powered sensor
    node is compared with a non-solar one. It is shown that utilization of solar power
    increases the battery lifetime. Solar energy is also used for battery charging
    purposes in SA systems to use that energy at a later time when the available energy
    is limited [361]. Lifetime of a WSN is maximized by addressing the related issues
    such as unstable energy harvesting and low panel conversion efficiency. Validation
    of the system is performed via a simulation environment in which 20 sensor nodes
    are placed and their communication is established with ZigBee protocol. The simulation
    results show that the lifetime of the sensor node as well as network throughput
    increases with the system. 6. Open issues and challenges Deployment of SA systems
    with various scales are facing with various challenges that need to be overcome
    for efficient utilization of the technology in the future systems. Regardless
    of the raise that IoT has achieved over the last few years, various theoretical
    and practical challenges restrict its proper management and performance. These
    challenges are given in detail in the remaining part of this section. 6.1. Cost
    Some of the cost issues can be specific for SA while others are related with general
    IoT systems. For example, sensors and gateways in an SA system may be expected
    to operate in harsh outdoor conditions in general. This situation will bring about
    extra concerns and costs about their manufacturing. In particular, some electronic
    equipment may require being water and dust resistant by fulfilling standards like
    IP68. Other than the manufacturing costs, IoT components such as sensors, gateways
    and base station infrastructure may constitute majority of the hardware cost related
    with communication systems. This specific communication hardware is expected to
    meet the system requirements which directly affects the cost. In order to preserve
    the reliable operation of the SA system over longer durations, maintenance must
    be performed on a regular basis. Therefore, the maintenance costs need to be considered
    during the feasibility studies before the deployment. Besides, one other source
    of operational costs may be the necessity of subscriptions. For example, NB-IoT
    protocol operates at licensed cellular frequency bands. This necessitates usage
    of service provider infrastructure and dedicated hardware both of which increase
    the deployment and operational costs. However, other protocols operating at unlicensed
    frequency bands do not have such drawbacks about the cost. One final source of
    the cost may be due to the large amount of data generated. Obviously, collection,
    transmission, and storage of the system data in a reliable way is critical for
    efficient operation of SA systems. Furthermore, processing the data for making
    smart decisions to increase the yield requires usage of server computers with
    high computational power. Most of the times, this is accomplished by a paid subscription
    to a cloud server provider. The type of the subscription needs to be decided concerning
    the communication protocol used by the IoT system in the farm. The reason for
    such a concern is the maximum data rate offered by the protocols are different
    and at the same time, allowed download/upload limits depend on the type of the
    subscription. As a result, these limits should be consistent between the protocol
    and the subscription to ensure an effective and reliable data transfer. 6.2. System
    security The gaps in the security system may cause several consequences like permanent
    loss of data and modification of data so that its reliability becomes debatable.
    On the other hand, unauthorized access to the secure data can result in privacy
    issues and eventually yield a reduced confidence in the customers. As a result,
    SA companies may be financially affected by the lack of security in their cyber
    systems. In addition, one other serious threat may be the access of the third
    parties to the in-field physical devices. The device control being captured by
    the attackers may cause loss of the crops or plants if inappropriate treatment
    of necessary elements are applied in an uncontrolled way [[426], [427], [428]].
    One major factor that increase the vulnerability of an SA system is having hardware
    components with limited computation and memory features. Therefore, it becomes
    infeasible to run complex attack-prevention algorithms as well as cryptographic
    algorithms on these devices [29]. There are different criteria that can be used
    for classification of vulnerabilities and risks in an IoT system, or more specifically
    in an SA system. One strategy for categorization of the treats may be considering
    the security issues in each of the layers of an SA system. Since the devices and
    protocols used in each layer is different, it is obvious that vulnerabilities
    associated with these layers require specific attention [429]. On the other hand,
    issues and limitations related with software and hardware of the IoT components
    may be source of the vulnerabilities [430]. In particular, the source of the vulnerability
    may be originating from the encryption standard used by the wireless communication
    protocol as well. For example, old version of Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) security
    standard is a well-known source of vulnerability. In a ZigBee network, the attacks
    may be targeting different layers of the communication. Adding malicious contents
    by eavesdropping on the radio channel or overwriting the memories of the nodes
    by adding a malicious node to the network can be given as two possible threats
    in a ZigBee network [431]. On the other hand, LPWAN technologies are reported
    to be vulnerable to threats like packet forging and replay attacks [432]. These
    issues are known to be originating from message integrity code (MIC) or sequence
    number (SN) protected by message authentication code (MAC) being short, which
    may eventually result in denial of service (DoS) or message injection. In general,
    overall vulnerability of IoT systems is caused by the lack of compliance with
    the security standards or security recommendations made by the official authorities.
    It should also be underlined that the responsible behavior of all entities in
    production and supply chain is required for a complete security assurance in IoT
    systems. Unethical behavior of any entity (e.g. a non-standard manufacturing for
    cost saving) may hurt the security [433,434]. The risk of being cyber-attacked
    increases together with the level of vulnerability. Nowadays, the cyber-attack
    incidents are progressing in the agriculture sector due to excessive usage of
    digital devices that are continuously connected to the internet. The consequences
    of cyber-attacks in agricultural sector may cause human-related or financial problems.
    Some of the many examples can be given as disruption of delivery, snatching of
    private data such as confidential formulations and demographic information of
    the employees [435]. One strategy to enhance cybersecurity and mitigate the risks
    in SA is to utilize blockchain technology which allows shared control of a distributed
    ledger in a decentralized network [436]. The blockchain applications may be useful
    in an SA ecosystem by means of recording and tracking of the entire food production
    process [437]. By securing the details of the production steps such as breeding,
    fertilizing, processing, transporting, and warehousing, it becomes possible to
    provide confidence, ensure compliance with standards and resolve the possible
    problems. 6.3. Communication quality Ensuring an uninterrupted communication in
    an SA system is important because sensor data should be collected consistently
    for a reliable smart decision system. Besides, status of the in-field actuators
    need to be checked and monitored continuously to prevent undesired situations.
    For example, monitoring of the status of a solenoid valve is important for preventing
    flood or over-irrigation situations. There are various factors affecting the quality
    of wireless communication in SA applications as the components are expected to
    operate under outdoor conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to protect the hardware
    from being damaged by the weather events like rainfall and wind. Even though the
    protection unit increases the deployment cost of the system, this will not only
    reduce the maintenance costs but also contribute to the quality of the communication
    in longer times. One other factor constituting a risk for communication quality
    is interference, which can be defined as distortion of a useful signal by some
    other signal. Therefore, an ambient containing numerous different signals simultaneously
    is prone to interference. In a smart farm equipped with many wireless sensor nodes
    as well as gateways, the possibility of interference is high and this situation
    is an obvious challenge for a reliable communication. The risk of interference
    is higher for the protocols using unlicensed frequency bands such as ZigBee, Wi-Fi,
    Sigfox, and LoRaWAN. On the other hand, the protocols like 5G and NB-IoT that
    use cellular networks with licensed frequency spectrum have lower possibility
    of interference. However, utilization of these systems require extra costs for
    hardware infrastructure and subscription [52]. 6.4. System design and hardware
    optimization Any redundant hardware will increase the investment as well as the
    maintenance costs in a system, eventually yielding profit decrement in the agricultural
    sector. Therefore, it takes a careful design process to determine the number and
    type of the sensors together with the gateways in an SA system. The system design
    and the protocol to be used are mutually affected by the parameters like the distance
    between sensors, total data transmission rate over the wireless links, and the
    power consumption at the sensor nodes. Obviously, this is a complicated optimization
    problem where many constraints should be taken into consideration. 7. Future Trends
    In the SA systems, collective utilization of various technologies is emerging.
    This situation is observable in the recent publications about SA and IoT. In the
    following subsections, the expected future trends in SA applications are elaborated
    by mentioning the technologies for data collection, data processing, and data
    transmission. 7.1. Aerial systems and satellite communications The sky-level observation
    of the agricultural fields has been made possible by the developments in the aerial
    technology. Since such observations allow for larger areas of the field to be
    inspectable simultaneously, various contemporary applications utilizing aerial
    systems have emerged in the last decade. While the earlier efforts in this domain
    focused on simple tasks like remote monitoring and observation [438,439], later
    applications involve more sensitive measurements such as crop yield mapping [440],
    pest management [441], vegetation index calculation [442]. The agricultural data
    collected at high altitudes primarily contain the images or videos of the field
    as well as the GPS-based coordinate information. These images may be regular RGB,
    thermal, infrared, multispectral, or hyperspectral images depending on the type
    of the application. Therefore, processing of these data in a collaborative manner
    to perform a specific task can be considered as a promising research area. The
    aerial data collection from the fields may be performed through different means
    among which UAVs [24,443] and airships [444] are common. These vehicles may be
    operated either manually by a remote control or automatically by loading specific
    missions to the vehicle. In both cases, wireless data transmission between the
    vehicle and the ground station or the satellite systems may be required. In the
    manual operation, the control signals are received from the remote control used
    by an operator. This means that the vehicle needs to be inside the coverage region
    of the remote control during the entire operation. Whereas in the autonomous operation
    mode, the location of the vehicle is typically controlled by the GPS signals which
    require an active communication with the related satellites. Therefore, it can
    be understood that a wireless link to a reference device is crucial for a reliable
    operation of the aerial vehicles. The features like controlling the vehicle over
    vast distances or maintaining a safe flight in case of an interruption in the
    GPS signal can be considered as important future applications under this topic.
    Besides, it was recently reported that a multi-UAV system may be more efficient
    than a single UAV in accomplishing multiple tasks [445]. Therefore, a real-time
    wireless communication between the UAVs should be established and maintained to
    ensure a high degree of coordination in the system. Since the UAVs are expected
    to move in a collaborative manner, an ad-hoc networking architecture is expected
    to be developed for such systems. Despite some recently proposed ad-hoc architectures
    for routing data packets among the UAVs, design of multi-UAV communication systems
    is very critical for future applications. Satellite imagery can be considered
    as another solution for agricultural monitoring and data collection. The availability
    of very high resolution (VHR) and near-infrared (NIR) images make it possible
    to improve agricultural practice through weed and pest detection, yield calculation
    and irrigation planning [[446], [447], [448]]. Even though this technology does
    not require a vehicle to fly over the field, the access to a satellite may require
    a higher overall budget. Advantages of aerial systems are unquestionable in the
    challenging environmental conditions of SA practices. With their properties like
    easy operation and high mobility, aerial systems can contribute to high-quality
    data collection, system scalability, and eventually increments in profit. 7.2.
    Fifth generation cellular communications With the emergence of fifth generation
    (5 G) cellular communication technology, it has now become possible to provide
    fast and reliable internet connection to components of SA systems. As a result,
    smart farm requirements like large amount of data exchange, low energy consumption
    and, wide coverage can be satisfied by utilization of 5G. It is also worth mentioning
    that the existing cellular network availability in rural regions is very limited.
    This problem is addressed by deploying 5 G infrastructure in the rural areas and
    hence, performing labor-intensive tasks like planting, harvesting, fertilization
    and irrigation with minimal manual intervention [449]. Accomplishment of such
    tasks requires usage of 5 G remote sensors allowing seamless data transfer which
    enables continuous monitoring, data collection and control [450]. As the future
    applications of 5 G in SA increase, the volume and variety of agricultural data
    will increase which eventually push research activities on big data analytics
    methods. Besides, the possibility of connecting the individual farms will allow
    for efficient usage of resources by managing the smart farms in a collaborative
    manner. Another impact can be the reduction in the need for human labor force
    because accurate crop inspections can be performed through 5 G supported systems.
    One area of wireless communication commonly mentioned together with 5 G technology
    is machine-type communications (MTC) in which the data transmission between the
    sensors and IoT appliances is performed with no human intervention. Provided that
    the system is initially designed for MTC requirements then 5 G may be a suitable
    solution as it allows for reliable communication in remote areas which is usually
    the case in SA [451,452]. Besides, MTC can be used suitably with Sigfox [453]
    and NB-IoT [454], which are known to be suitable LPWAN protocols in SA. 7.3. Big
    data analytics, cloud and edge computing Enhancement of crop quality and quantity
    requires continuous collection of in-field data and monitoring of the plant status.
    Therefore, from the initial sowing and cultivation phase until reaching to the
    final consumer, various types of data are collected in the domain of SA. As a
    result, the total amount of data with various types becomes very large. Descriptive
    data such as chemical attributes of the soil, satellite imagery reflecting the
    physical characteristics of the farming area, aerial images collected using UAVs,
    and structured data from IoT sensors are some examples of these data [455]. This
    type of data is typically named as big data, which requires specific hardware
    and methodologies for being processed. The clustering and classification methods
    as well as rule based learning methods are some of the strategies useful in processing
    of big data [456]. Particularly, artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector
    machines (SVM), discriminant analysis and decision trees are reported to be useful
    methods for this purpose [457,458]. However, these algorithms cannot be executed
    on regular computers. Due to the large amount of data, this processing should
    be performed on distant cloud computers having suitable hardware to handle the
    big agricultural data [459]. This situation can be considered as another pushing
    factor for the emergence of fast and reliable communications protocols being used
    in SA because transmission of the big data to the cloud computers is infeasible
    with slow internet technologies with small coverage. The concept of edge computing
    is worth discussion at this point because it mainly aims at reduction in the total
    amount of transmitted data to the cloud. In other words, it becomes possible to
    save bandwidth by reducing the network traffic. This is accomplished by pre-processing
    the collected agricultural data at local edge devices before being transmitted
    to the distant cloud computers. The pre-processing computation performed at edge
    devices, namely edge computing, outputs the required data for the cloud computing.
    Therefore, only the data necessary for cloud computing is transmitted through
    the network. The steps of edge computing may involve different data compression
    or dimensionality reduction methods to decrease the amount of data. Since the
    computational load of edge computing is not as high as cloud computing, the edge
    devices may be hardware with limited computational capabilities such as single
    board computers or microcontroller boards. Edge computing has high potential for
    contributing SA in various domains such as increased crop production, farm security,
    and food supply chain. However, services based on edge and cloud computing are
    not mature enough for being adopted in SA [460]. 7.4. Infrastructure for LPWAN
    technologies The LPWAN protocols operating at licensed frequencies require installation
    of relevant infrastructure for being used actively. In addition to their main
    features like low power consumption and having wide range, they offer more reliable
    data transfer, which is a critical feature for SA systems. Among them, NB-IoT
    can be noted as an emerging technology as the investments made by industry as
    well as interest from the academia to NB-IoT are on the rise [120]. As a result,
    increments in the studies for widening the coverage of LPWAN protocols are expected
    in the near future. On the other hand, the major limitations of short-range protocols
    such as power consumption and coverage are the issues addressed by LPWAN technologies.
    LoRaWAN protocol contributes to LPWAN technologies by providing additional advantages
    such as scalability and security for SA systems [461]. Since the required infrastructure
    for LoRaWAN is relatively simpler than NB-IoT, the related hardware is easier
    to install and use. 7.5. Efficiency in energy harvesting and consumption Since
    the majority of SA components are required to operate in remote areas, most of
    the time, it is neither possible nor feasible to provide on-grid power to all
    elements of an SA system. The efforts for finding a solution to this situation
    have concentrated on two main topics that are (i) minimization of power consumption
    in IoT devices, and (ii) energy harvesting from environmental conditions. Low
    power consumption can be achieved by optimizing the circuit design of the sensors
    for application-specific purposes. In addition, frequency and duration of sleep
    mode operation may be adjusted for efficient energy consumption. Furthermore,
    development of dedicated communication protocols consuming reduced power during
    data transmission is another topic that may be important for future applications.
    However, in general, such protocols achieve reduction in power consumption at
    a burden of smaller overhead thereby resulting in a decreased security and reliability.
    On the other hand, utilization of renewable energy sources, particularly solar
    energy, is expected to be more widespread because they provide off-gird energy
    to the system. One limitation of photovoltaic systems may be the lack of energy
    generation during nighttime and cloudy weather. Therefore, advancements in the
    energy storage technology, as well as the smart gird systems for efficient utilization
    of energy in a collaborative manner, may be expected in the future. 7.6. Protocols
    and application areas In the current state of SA applications, most of the studies
    are small scaled examples that contain testing of different communication protocols
    and IoT hardware. Thus, it is necessary to deploy large-scaled systems to be able
    to evaluate the usefulness and generate feedback information for future development
    of practical SA systems [390]. The fast-evolving technological aspects have an
    impact on changing our daily habits by making various possibilities to emerge
    during the years while causing some others to lose their importance and popularity.
    A similar situation is true for the application areas and the utilized communication
    protocols in SA systems. To support this statement, various distributions of the
    papers in Table 3 are investigated. These distributions are generated by categorizing
    the papers according to their publication year in addition to the area of application
    and the utilized communication protocol. As a result, it became possible to understand
    which communication protocol and which application area are emerging in the recent
    years. In other words, these distributions allow for highlighting not only the
    most common application areas and protocols but also how their domination change
    over the years. Thus, it becomes possible to generate a future perspective using
    the current trends in SA. For this purpose, two pie charts and two 3D bar graphs
    are generated. Specifically, the charts in Figs. 4 and 5 show the percentage of
    papers utilizing the specified protocols and their application areas, respectively.
    More detailed year-based distributions, which are useful for understanding the
    trends, are provided by the bar graphs in Figs. 6 and 7. Download : Download high-res

    to application areas. It is clear from Fig. 4 that Wi-Fi is the mostly used protocol
    and it is followed by LoRaWAN and ZigBee. Majority of the studies use these protocols
    whereas the percentages of the other two protocols (Sigfox and NB-IoT) are about
    1/10 times of these dominating ones. Besides, more than 60% of the studies in
    the literature are about either water saving or soil condition monitoring. The
    next popular application area is energy harvesting, yet its percentage is around
    half of soil condition monitoring as can be seen in Fig. 5. The annual distribution
    of total number of studies has an increasing trend (Figs. 6 and 7). When the protocol-specific
    distribution in Fig. 6 is inspected, it may be seen that ZigBee is present in
    all years, and Wi-Fi and LoRaWAN are absent in only one of the years. However,
    total number of usages for ZigBee and Wi-Fi decrease in 2018 and 2019. On the
    other hand, LoRaWAN can be seen as an emerging protocol as its usage increased
    in the last five years. Other LPWAN protocols, Sigfox and NB-IoT, appear only
    in recent years with a very limited number of usages. The application-specific
    distribution in Fig. 7 shows that number of soil condition monitoring applications
    increases until 2018 but it starts to decrease in 2019. Nevertheless, the other
    widely used application, water saving has an increasing trend since 2015. Besides,
    energy harvesting applications are present since 2016 and its rate has increased
    in the last three years. In addition to analyzing number of papers, it is also
    useful to compare the percentages of papers according to recent years. In Fig.
    8, annual rates of the protocols are provided while the rates are given for the
    application areas in Fig. 9. It is obvious that domination of ZigBee and Wi-Fi
    is affected by the emergence of LPWAN technologies in 2018 and 2019. In particular,
    usage of LoRaWAN is on the rise as it has about 30% of share in the last four
    years. On the other hand, the rate of studies about water saving and soil condition
    monitoring has the highest values in the recent years. However, share of water
    saving slightly decreased after 2017 as a result of increments in investments
    for efficient usage of energy resources. Download : Download high-res image (251KB)

    the papers. According to these distributions, it may be concluded that LoRaWAN
    is the promising protocol for SA and the applications for economic usage of resources
    (i.e. water saving and energy harvesting) are on the rise. These inferences are
    consistent with the ultimate goal of efficient usage of world resources. In addition,
    Wi-Fi still stands as a popular short-range protocol due to its common availability.
    8. Conclusion In this paper, utilization of five different wireless communication
    protocols in various smart agriculture applications has been surveyed. The benefits
    offered by these protocols for six different application areas are highlighted
    and example case studies in these areas are provided. The focus of the study has
    been given to those protocols that are commonly used in IoT systems for wireless
    communication. The application-specific suitability of the protocols is discussed
    considering the requirements of the applications together with the features of
    the protocols. Besides, the future trends related to these protocols are underlined
    by accounting the possible requirements in the future and investigating the number
    of annual publications about various smart agriculture applications utilizing
    a protocol within the scope of this paper. The open issues and challenges are
    discussed to understand the limitations that prevent the SA systems from being
    deployed and used commonly. The system security and costs are the two leading
    factors of this situation. In addition, educated farmers having more familiarity
    with IoT and are more comfortable with digital technology are necessary for expedited
    adoption. The future of the wireless communication protocols in SA has been evaluated
    by considering the leading recent technologies used in different applications.
    Aerial systems, satellite communications, 5G networks, and cloud computing are
    some examples of the technologies shaping the future opportunities and necessities
    in SA applications. Furthermore, it is underlined that infrastructure installation
    for LPWAN protocols is expected to be more common to ensure more secure data transfer
    over longer distances. There is a large number of publications in the literature
    mentioning the technical specifications of the protocols involved in this paper.
    The technical data in different sources are expected to be similar; however, some
    of the information provided in these publications are inconsistent. The circumstances
    in which the technical data is measured and the hardware used for deployment may
    be the source of the differences in these data. Nevertheless, such details are
    not given in the previously published papers. Considering the major advantage
    (the long-range communication capability) of NB-IoT, Sigfox, and LoRaWAN, they
    are appropriate for large-scale commercial smart farms. Since it is neither practical
    nor feasible to provide line power to all devices in such farms, the next concern
    should be the power consumption. Due to the relatively high-power requirement
    of NB-IoT, the other two protocols may be considered as more appropriate for smart
    agriculture applications. In addition, the low latency benefit of NB-IoT is not
    a high-priority requirement for smart agriculture. On the other hand, the low
    data transfer rate of Sigfox makes it unsuitable for large fields involving a
    high number of sensors. At this point it may be underlined that, in general, there
    is a correlation between the energy consumption and data transmission speed of
    a protocol. In other words, when the data should be transferred at a higher rate,
    the appropriate protocol is expected to consume more energy. Development of new
    protocols for improving this situation may be a topic that can be a valuable future
    technology. In order to reveal and underline the trending protocol in SA, year-based
    distribution of the published papers within the scope of this study has been observed.
    The papers obtained through the search strategy explained in Section 2.2 were
    categorized according to the application areas and the communication protocols.
    As a result of this categorization step, Table 3 has been generated to see the
    annual distributions of the studies. These year-based distributions are presented
    and discussed in Section 7.6, and visualized in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7,
    Fig. 8 - 9. According to the analysis results, LoRaWAN has the highest number
    of uses in all of the smart agriculture application areas among LPWAN protocols.
    When the advantage of being an open standard is combined with other benefits like
    low power consumption, long-range and sufficient data transfer rate, LoRaWAN may
    be the optimal solution for most cases. Even though the widespread usage of LPWAN
    technologies is increasing in recent years, short-range communication protocols
    are still commonly used in research projects, prototyping and small fields. These
    protocols provide higher data rates in general while requiring relatively high
    power. Despite the drawback of their high-power consumption, the required hardware
    for these protocols can easily be accessed on the market. This ease of accessibility
    makes them the first choice for rapid prototyping and development. Declaration

  description: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has fundamentally
    reshaped the agricultural sector. In recent years, academic research on the IoT
    has grown at an unprecedented pace. However, the broad picture of how this technology
    can benefit the agricultural sector is still missing. To close this research gap,
    we conduct a bibliometric study to investigate the current state of the IoT and
    agriculture in academic literature. Using a resource-based view (RBV), we also
    identify those agricultural resources that are mostly impacted by the introduction
    of the IoT (i.e., seeds, soil, water, fertilizers, pesticides, energy, livestock,
    human resources, technology infrastructure, business relations) and propose numerous
    themes for future research.

    viewPrecision agriculture 1. Introduction Agriculture is the world''s most prominent
    source of food [1]. The rapid increase in the world''s population is going to
    yield an enormous demand for food in the near future. Additionally, agriculture
    is the world''s largest consumer of water, with a constantly rising demand. This
    causes challenges, which include pollution, scarce resources, arable land limitations,
    and crises related to weather conditions, and raises the need for innovative and
    sustainable agricultural solutions [2,1,3]. Such solutions include smart agriculture
    [4] and precision agriculture concepts [5,6] in which the former refers to using
    cutting-edge technologies in farm management systems to improve productivity and
    sustainability [7] while the latter is about using technologies to ensure that
    agricultural resources, such as soil and seeds, get exactly what they need for
    optimum health and productivity. The smart global agriculture market is expected
    to reach $15.3 billion by the end of 2025 [8]. New technologies and innovations,
    including the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, machine learning, artificial
    intelligence (AI), data analytics, computing technologies, and big data, all play
    a vital role in its development [5,9,10,11,12]. As one of the most promising enablers,
    the IoT is considered a paradigm shift in the advancement of the smart agriculture
    field [2], and it is predicted to blur the borders between the physical and the
    virtual world. This is done by equipping things (i.e., devices, machines, objects)
    with processing power and connecting them in a way that enables them to communicate
    and exchange information without the need for human involvement [13,14]. In agricultural
    use cases, the IoT integrates hardware and software, such as sensors, drones,
    actuators, smart vehicles, big data analytics, cloud computing, and AI. This yields
    an enormous amount of heterogeneous data, including temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, the amount of rainfall, leaf wetness, temperature, soil electric conductivity
    (EC) and PH level, luminance salinity, climate, solar radiation, pest movement,
    and human activities as well as pictures and videos taken by drones [2,5,10].
    The data can be transmitted by wireless sensor networks (WSNs), stored and analyzed
    through cloud computing and sophisticated analytic methods. In this regard, computing
    technologies, AI, and machine learning come together to provide insightful information
    and enhanced decision-making, and the data flow in and out of the system is facilitated
    through the IoT [5,15]. Additionally, the IoT can give farmers system access from
    remote places via tablets or smartphones [16]. Consequently, numerous benefits
    have been identified for using the IoT and related technologies in agriculture:
    authentication and traceability of food [17], frost protection, improvements in
    greenhouse systems, fertilization [[18], [19]], irrigation, water consumption
    [20,21], optimal conditions for vegetables and animals, resource usage efficiency,
    agriculture supply chain efficiency and transparency, production optimization
    due to market conditions, cost minimization, profit maximization [3], and food
    safety and quality [22]. The abovementioned challenges and the IoT''s transformative
    potential have attracted substantial scholarly attention. Consequently, the number
    of publications has increased rapidly over the past years, which accentuates the
    need for studies that condense the existing body of knowledge and derive future
    research areas. Although several researchers have investigated related topics,
    a systematic and comprehensive approach is still missing. In the existing literature,
    we found systematic reviews related to the IoT and agriculture in which the authors
    investigated topics such as the IoT''s role in food supply chain and food safety
    [22,23], food quality management [24], irrigation approaches [20], protected agriculture
    [25], ZigBee Smart Agriculture [26], and IoT applications in agriculture [18].
    However, to the best of our knowledge, no recent study has used a bibliometric
    analysis to comprehensively investigate the complete interplay between the IoT
    and agriculture. Additionally, it is unclear which agricultural resources are
    impacted the most by the introduction of the IoT. To fill these gaps, our study
    is based on a structured literature review [27] and is guided by the following
    research questions: 1 What are the publication dynamics in agricultural IoT research
    (i.e., top journals, countries, papers)? 2 What are the most important topics
    in agricultural IoT research? 3 Which agricultural resources are impacted by the
    IoT? The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly synthesizes
    past literature reviews on the IoT and agriculture. Section 3 outlines the methodology,
    and in Section 4, we present the main findings, including descriptive statistics
    pertaining to leading journals, countries, papers, keyword co-occurrence and cluster
    analysis, treemap analysis, and an identification of trending topics. In Section
    5, we outline the impact of the IoT on numerous agricultural resources and summarize
    emerging future research themes. The discussion in Section 6 sheds some light
    on how the IoT is currently deployed in agriculture and highlights potential changes
    and trending topics. We conclude the paper in Section 7 with some limitations
    and an outlook on future research. 2. Literature reviews on the IOT and agriculture
    Several research studies have discussed agricultural IoT applications. The studies
    listed in Table 1 predominately applied traditional literature reviews (LR) or
    systematic literature reviews (SLR) to synthesize the IoT literature and derive
    novel insights. Numerous dimensions of deploying the IoT in the agricultural sector
    have been investigated, varying from evaluating the status of IoT applications
    in farming activities [20] and exploring IoT architectures for food control [23],
    to examining the fusion of IoT and agriculture UAVs in smart farming [28,29].
    For example, Tzounis et al. [3] conduct a review of recent IoT technologies in
    the agricultural sector with a focus on their value-generating potential for future
    farmers and the barriers inhibiting a wide-scale implementation. They find that
    the IoT can optimize production by moving farmlands and greenhouses from a precision
    to a micro-precision model of agricultural production, thereby enabling optimal
    growing conditions for agricultural resources, including seeds and livestock.

    Shi et al. [25] summarize the state-of-the-art of IoT applications in protected
    agriculture and describe the system design and key technologies that contribute
    to this mode of modern agriculture. The authors find that the IoT has a significant
    impact on three main fields of protected agriculture; namely, plant management,
    animal farming, and agri-food supply chain traceability. In this regard, several
    challenges still lie ahead, including reliability, expansibility, universality,
    endurance and intelligence level, operational issues, and cost. Friha et al. [1]
    carry out a comprehensive review of emerging technologies for IoT-based agriculture.
    Their findings indicate that key enabling technologies for agriculture involve
    UAVs, SDN (Software-Defined Network) and NVF (Network Function Virtualization)
    technologies, cloud and fog computing, and middleware platforms. They classified
    IoT applications for smart agriculture into seven groups: smart water management;
    smart monitoring; agrochemical applications; disease management; smart harvesting;
    supply chain management; and intelligent agricultural practices. Based on 167
    papers, Villa-Henriksen et al. [44] analyze the state-of-the-art of IoT applications
    in arable farming, where several challenges, such as spatial data, highly dynamic
    environments, and task complexity, need to be overcome. According to the authors,
    the IoT facilitates monitoring of agricultural resources (e.g., soil, water, crops),
    documentation and traceability, forecasting, and controlling. In a recent study,
    Zhang et al. [48] review the applications of wearable IoT in precision livestock
    farming, highlighting the importance of the accurate perception of information,
    biocompatibility of wearable IoT, and sustainability monitoring in IoT-enabled
    precision livestock farming. The authors conclude that the majority of wearable
    IoT devices are widely applicable to humans due to their ability to generate accurate,
    dynamic, and sustainable signals. However, in the farming context, IoT wearables
    are rarely customized or applied for precision livestock farming. Since its emergence,
    farmers and agri-food businesses have been scrutinizing the IoT as a game-changing
    agricultural technology. Acknowledging its strengths in addressing several smart
    farming requirements, several reviews have been carried out to better grasp the
    development of IoT and its value-generating capabilities in this sector. For instance,
    Tao et al. [47] summarize the insights from 94 articles and find that IoT agricultural
    systems are applied in fields as varied as irrigation management, soil management,
    precision agriculture, and smart farming. However, these benefits may not be fully
    realized because of concerns pertaining to cost (e.g., hardware cost), system
    adaptability (e.g., environmental variations), data quality (e.g., data reliability),
    and devices suitability (e.g., device standardization). When it comes to bibliometrics,
    a few studies have endeavored to review and examine IoT applications in agriculture.
    For example, Jusoh et al. [20] review the current status of IoT applications in
    irrigation practices and highlight future research directions, leading countries,
    and productive researchers. According to the study findings, the IoT literature
    has witnessed an exponential increase in the number of publications since 2016,
    with the dominance of India and China in this research area. In the same vein,
    Hu et al. [30] provide a bibliometric analysis of operational management in IoT-based
    agriculture, using 112 selected publications. Analyzing co-occurring keywords,
    the authors find that the IoT literature revolves around wireless positioning,
    intelligent irrigation systems, quality monitoring of agricultural products, big
    data, intelligent greenhouse monitoring systems, and remote sensing. From the
    perspective of food safety, Bouzembrak et al. [22] review 48 studies to examine
    the relationships between authors, countries, and content. Through the analysis
    of bibliometric networks, the authors find that IoT applications in food safety
    are still in an early stage. They also point out the dominance of Chinese universities
    in the IoT literature; the current focus on food traceability and monitoring of
    food safety and quality; the prevalent use of sensors in temperature, humidity,
    and location monitoring; and an increasing reliance on internet, radio frequency
    identification (RFID), and WSN. Lastly, Ben-Daya et al. [24] conduct a systematic
    literature review and bibliometric analysis of 144 articles identified on Scopus
    to study the potential, challenges, and roles of the IoT and related enabling
    technologies, such as blockchain on food supply chain quality management. Although
    several reviews have been conducted to synthesize the literature about the use
    of the IoT in agriculture, the use of traditional LRs or SLRs is not always the
    best option because they tend to be subjective, labor-intensive, and ineffective
    for analyzing larger bodies of literature [49]. In contrast, existing studies
    that apply bibliometric methods to examine the IoT are scarce and analyze a relatively
    small sample of papers [22], addressing only a specific activity in agriculture
    [20] or employing bibliometric techniques that differ from the ones in our study
    [24,30]. In this paper, we therefore conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis
    of the existing IoT literature in agriculture and use our findings to derive a
    comprehensive research agenda, with the goal of inspiring scholars and practitioners.
    3. Methodology A bibliometric analysis is a structured approach to grasp the dynamics
    of a specific knowledge domain by applying various tools [50,51,52,53]. In our
    study, we followed existing best practices to carry out a reliable and comprehensive
    bibliometric analysis [54, 55, 56, 57] on the impact of the IoT on agriculture.
    As a starting point, we used an authoritative and reliable academic database,
    the Web of Science (WoS), which provides standardized and high-quality publication
    information [58,59,60,61,62]. Fig. 1 shows our research process and the search
    string we used. We did not restrict the time span and the types of publications
    included. For the analysis of results, we used the visualization software VOSviewer
    [63,64]; for text mining and quantitative analyses, we used the web-based data
    analysis framework Biblioshiny [65]. We identified trends, dynamics, and future
    research directions and, finally, we compiled the available information to describe
    those agricultural resources that are mostly impacted by the IoT. Download : Download

    4. Results from the bibliometric analysis Out of 897 extracted papers, 70 had
    missing data (e.g., abstracts, keywords) leading to a final selection of 827 papers
    from 2948 authors (see Table 2); 4.95% (41) of those were single-authored papers.
    The authors provided a total of 2752 keywords, and 1158 were Keywords Plus. While
    the former regularly describe specific applications or their potential, KeyWords
    Plus include words and phrases that can be found in the references of an article
    but not the article itself, and they help to examine the knowledge structure of
    academic fields [66]. The collaboration index was 3.7. This indicator was suggested
    [67] to provide a single measure for fractional productivity on the basis of Price
    and Beaver''s [68] work. According to this index, a near-zero value denotes the
    dominance of single-authored publications. Table 2. Information regarding data

    academic output more than doubled between 2019 and 2020, and the total number
    of published papers in 2020 was 416, confirming the growing importance of the

    the most important journals according to the number of papers published on the
    IoT and agriculture. Sensors leads the list, with a total of 103 articles, followed
    by IEEE Access and Computers and Electronics in Agriculture. In general, journals
    dedicated to information technology and agriculture dominate the list, and no
    journals from fields such as business, management, social sciences, and operations
    research were ranked in the top 20. This indicates that the most important outlets
    focus on IoT applications in agriculture from a technical perspective; this also
    implies a need for interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary knowledge that embodies
    the IoT''s multi-faceted characteristics and its societal and business implications.

    papers Table 5 lists the most influential papers, including the authors, titles,
    sources, total citations (TC), and the average citations per year (ACY). The most-cited
    papers investigate the agricultural impact of the IoT in combination with topics
    such as big data analytics, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and WSNs. A strong
    focus is placed on the role of the IoT to increase the quantity and quality of
    agricultural produce, maximize operational efficiencies, and foster sustainability.
    According to the ACY, the top three cited articles are publications from Wolfert
    et al. [69], Motlagh et al. [70], and Kamble et al. [71]. Wolfert et al. [69]
    investigate the state-of-the-art of big data applications in smart farming and
    highlight the importance of the IoT for automating farm operations, strengthening
    decision-making capabilities, and supporting precision agriculture. Motlagh et
    al. [70] examine the potential of UAVs for advancing the IoT vision, and they
    find that the data collection capability of the technology is suitable for vegetation
    science, environmental monitoring, forestry, remote sensing, and water area detection.
    Kamble et al. [71] analyze data-driven sustainable agriculture supply chains by
    reviewing 84 journal articles. The authors argue that the IoT facilitates the
    collection and sharing of information in real time and augments sustainability
    through enhanced communication, integration, and cooperation between entities
    of the agri-food supply chain. Finally, we observe again that IoT research is
    mostly published in computer science and engineering journals. Table 5. Most-cited

    6 shows the most popular keywords, either provided by authors (left side) or identified
    by an algorithm (KeyWords Plus on the right side) [85,86]. Taken together, they
    provide researchers with in-depth insights into an article''s content and overarching
    trends in a study domain. Since the keywords used in the search query were “IoT,”
    “agriculture,” and “farming,” it is evident that they were highly ranked among
    the authors’ keywords, followed by “WSN,” “PA (precision agriculture),” “smart
    agriculture,” and “sensor.” The presence of complementary technologies, such as
    “cloud computing,” “ML (machine learning),” “big data,” “AI,” “blockchain,” “UAV,”
    “deep learning,” and communication technologies (“LoRa” and “LPWA”) underscore
    their importance for enabling IoT-based agricultural practices and developing
    precision agriculture. Precision agriculture promises to leverage the power of
    the IoT to drive the next revolution in agriculture, optimize operational efficiencies,
    increase automation, and achieve high crop yields. Besides, “security” and “irrigation”
    have been among the top authors’ keywords. Data security is also of critical importance
    as IoT networks can be subject to attacks that threaten the security of the circulation
    of agricultural products [87] and endanger the authentication, access control,
    and privacy of the stakeholders in the agricultural sector [45]. Table 6. Top

    Fig. 3. Treemap based on abstracts. 4.6. Trending topics Fig. 4 illustrates emerging
    topics at the nexus of the IoT and agriculture, portrays research hotspots, and
    detects trends based on a log frequency. The composition of topics in the IoT
    reveals that RFID, environmental monitoring, remote monitoring, and GPS were popular
    topics a couple of years ago. The focus then shifted toward the integration of
    low-cost, low-power, and wireless standard-based network protocols and networking
    paradigms to streamline communications and establish a holistic view of all connected
    devices in smart farming and agriculture. Emerging topics, such as Zigbee and
    SDN (Software-defined networks), appear among others that build the foundation
    for precision agriculture applications (e.g., irrigation supervision, fertilizer
    control, water quality management). These emerging technologies offer agile and
    dynamic solutions that respond to the special requirements of IoT-based agriculture
    applications, such as scalability, network reliability, monitoring of network
    services, and manageability of smart agriculture networks. In 2020, a strong focus
    was placed on technologies, such as AI, machine learning, blockchain, big data,
    cloud computing, and sensors. The combination of these technologies accelerates
    the shift toward precision agriculture, which triggers the necessary tools to
    maximize production, eliminate waste, and improve the overall quality of agricultural
    products. Download : Download high-res image (316KB) Download : Download full-size

    co-occurrence analysis to cluster the dynamics between the IoT and agriculture.
    This relational bibliometric tool enables researchers to identify knowledge divergence
    and research foci in a knowledge domain [53]. To implement the method, all the
    papers that we identified above were analyzed. The authors’ keywords (unit of
    analysis) were extracted, reviewed, and refined if necessary. For example, we
    replaced full-length keywords with abbreviations (e.g., “Internet of Things” with
    “IoT”). Then, we imported the data into VOSviewer. The network was generated by
    conducting density-based spatial clustering, using the full counting method [88].
    The minimum frequency of keyword occurrences was set at four (Table 7), and a
    network with five clusters, each with different colors, was generated (see Fig.
    5). Each node in the figure represents a keyword. The node''s size reflects the
    keyword''s co-occurrence frequency, and the density is illustrated by the closeness
    of the nodes. Table 7. Keyword clustering parameters. Type of analysis Keyword

    network. The most significant cluster (red) revolves around the core role of the
    IoT in agriculture. With the emergence of the IoT, a paradigm shift has become
    evident, leading to the advent of precision agriculture. The IoT represents a
    major driver of precision agriculture that integrates several technologies, including
    WSN, to improve operational efficiencies and productivity in the agricultural
    sector [2]. WSNs consist of numerous sensors that transmit data through a wireless
    network based on communication technologies, such as LoRa (Long Range communication),
    LPWA (Low Power Wide Area network), and LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Networks)
    [21,89]. As a highly popular and preferred technology for IoT systems, LoRa is
    a representative network of LPWAs that supports the development of secure, scalable,
    and efficient networks, with high node capacity, battery longevity, and interference
    immunity. In agriculture, LoRa wireless plays a key role in monitoring soil conditions,
    air temperature and humidity, and light intensity in greenhouses by capturing
    data from LoRa nodes and forming a star network topology that enables efficient
    wireless communication over very long distances and with scalability [72]. Moreover,
    crop information and meteorological data can be obtained from an IoT via LoRaWAN
    networks and leveraged to make smarter irrigation decisions, environmental monitoring
    [90], and highly customizable farming management [91]. The green cluster illustrates
    blockchain technology''s role in agriculture. Researchers in this cluster study
    the improvements that blockchain-based IoT systems can bring in cyber-physical
    systems, peer-to-peer agriculture, and the food supply chain. These contributions
    include improvements in security, privacy, transparency, traceability, scalability,
    and monitoring capabilities [33, 11]. With the immutable and decentralized nature
    of blockchain technology, all the stakeholders in the agricultural sector can
    participate in a transparent, open network and exchange data without the need
    for a central authority [92]. Furthermore, in the era of industry 4.0, blockchain
    technology can help to achieve the sustainability goals of the agri-food supply
    chain [93,94,95]. The blue cluster is an assemblage of various technological enablers
    that support the implementation of smart farming. The development and deployment
    of emergent and cutting-edge technologies in smart agriculture have attracted
    significant attention from scholars [5]. These technologies include cloud computing,
    AI techniques (e.g., ML, deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNN)),
    big data, fog computing, edge computing, and decision support systems (DSS). An
    IoT platform that integrates computing and other technologies is therefore a promising
    solution to achieve a complete information system. In this regard, the enhancement
    in IoT devices and data storage and analysis capabilities is an urgent issue that
    needs to be addressed. Similarly, there is a need for more powerful and efficient
    computing systems [96]. Cloud computing, fog computing, edge computing, and their
    combinations have attracted scholars’ attention [97,98,96,99]. For instance, cloud
    computing can be used to store large amounts of data concerning agricultural production,
    automate control of agriculture processes, support large-scale and affordable
    computing systems, and enable agricultural experts to make accurate and evidence-based
    judgements [25]. With the help of fog computing, it is feasible to design creative
    IoT agriculture platforms that allow large-area data collection and analysis,
    integrate limited network information resources, and automate agricultural monitoring
    [100]. Farmers can take advantage of the capabilities of fog computing to tackle
    the problems inherent in conventional centralized cloud servers, including high
    communication latencies and the inability to ensure scalability, interoperability,
    location awareness, real-time interactions, and large bandwidth. Edge computing
    is another promising technology that recently captured scholars’ interest [101]
    due to its ability to tackle cloud server load challenges caused by large area
    coverage and to monitor agricultural devices, such as irrigation and variable-rate
    fertilizer equipment, and ensure their proper functioning and maintenance. As
    a result, the fusion of the IoT and computing technologies can level up agricultural
    production efficiency, cost effectiveness, and sustainability by devising wise
    water management, smart irrigation systems, and precision irrigation [102,103].
    In the era of agriculture 4.0, farms need to be more intelligent. Smart farming
    that encompasses interconnected sensors, machines, and other technologies will
    produce more and more data (big data) that need to be analyzed to provide better
    decision support and predictions [104]. In this regard, AI and machine learning
    are useful in agriculture to predict crop yield, soil properties, irrigation requirements
    and weather, disease detection, and market estimations [24]. Furthermore, deep
    learning is also expected to power the IoT, with the goal of improving efficiency
    and increasing information quality related to crop yield, soil health, and disease
    resistance. Combining this data-hungry technology with the IoT also serves to
    analyze and extract valuable knowledge from the massive amounts of data collected
    from various IoT nodes, thereby easing several agriculture tasks, such as crop
    yield estimation, weather prediction, pest identification, and obstacle detection.
    Harnessing new technologies alongside the IoT moves conventional agriculture to
    a data-driven and learning system, which is bound to change and continually improve
    [15]. The yellow cluster on the upper right is about the role of drones or UAVs
    in agriculture. With Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and other
    technologies’ further development, drones are increasingly put to use in the military,
    smart cities, and industry—and agriculture is no exception [105]. So far, using
    drones as a remote device to monitor crops has been the main application area
    [106]. Drones’ data transmission through wireless sensor networks and big data
    analytics is vital to capitalize on this technology. Drones can supply a wide
    variety of agricultural resources, such as water, fertilizers, and pesticides
    [107]. Furthermore, farm analysis, time saving, higher production, integration
    with cameras, and GIS mapping are among the benefits of utilizing drones in precision
    farming and the agricultural supply chain [105]. Finally, the last cluster, shown
    in purple on the lower left, highlights the role of industry 4.0 and agriculture
    4.0. Industry 4.0 depends on the real-time connection of physical and digital
    systems along with emerging technologies to change the way work is done and managed
    [108]. In industry 4.0, the IoT has the potential to bring auspicious transformational
    solutions to existing agricultural systems and hasten the pace of IoT penetration
    in agriculture 4.0. With the support of agriculture 4.0, farmers are equipped
    with sufficient tools to control operational processes, reduce costs, and establish
    food traceability systems that are able to reinforce the supervision of agricultural
    products and food safety. 4.8. The IOT and agricultural resources In this section,
    we draw on the RBV and analyze the impact of the IoT on agricultural resources.
    According to Barney [109], the RBV posits that a firm''s competitive positioning
    is determined by its unique resources, capabilities, and the relationships among
    them. From a RBV perspective, resources can be conceptualized as a firm''s processes,
    capabilities, and assets. Several scholars argue that the RBV is useful in identifying
    those factors that determine the competitive advantage of businesses [110,111].
    Based on the insights derived from the bibliometric analysis (i.e., keywords,
    trending topics, and cluster analysis), we identified ten agricultural resources
    that are strongly impacted by the introduction of the IoT. These include seeds
    [112,113], soil [114,115,116,117], water [118,119,120,121], fertilizers [122,123,124],
    pesticides [125], energy [126,127,128,129], livestock [69], human resources [130,131,132],
    and technological infrastructure [133,134]. Since the RBV also includes intangible
    assets [135], we also consider business relations as a critical resource [136]
    that can be significantly impacted by IoT implementation (see Fig. 6). For each
    resource, we outline several insights in the following sections and then further
    develop them into research propositions. Download : Download high-res image (222KB)

    resources. 4.9. Key resources 4.9.1. Seeds In agriculture, seeds are of vital
    importance for product quality and safety. The characteristics and growth rate
    of seeds are key parameters for crop growth [137]. To ensure optimized seeds,
    farmers can use the IoT to manage crops at a micro scale [138]. As such, the sensors
    used in agricultural activities can be placed throughout the fields to control
    the humidity and temperature of the surrounding air, thereby providing real-time
    data on the environmental conditions that are influencing seeds and plants. With
    the use of the IoT, farmers can access a wide variety of information related to
    phytosanitary conditions and seedling production measures, which impact the quality
    and safety of crops [139]. According to [139], IoT platforms provide access to
    information associated with quality, safety, and the process of seedling to be
    used in a crop. Moreover, the IoT accelerates the pace toward precision agriculture,
    allowing farms to optimize yields and minimize the use of seeds [138]. Precision
    agriculture using the IoT is expected to facilitate the analysis of weather changes
    to assist farmers in understanding ongoing weather patterns and their impact on
    crops [140]. Relying on the IoT, it is possible to identify whether a climate
    is adequate for the growth of crops and select seeds that will bring a high yield
    given a specific climate type. Combined with vision-based technologies, IoT sensors
    are helpful to determine the distance and depth for sowing seeds. In this regard,
    Santhi et al. [141] develop Agribot, a sensor and vision-based autonomous robot,
    to sow seeds with the help of global and local maps generated from GPS and a personal
    computer for the on-board vision system. Shadrin et al. [142] develop a smart
    agriculture IoT system to monitor crops, using the test case of controlling seed
    germination. Based on the combination of low-power wireless sensor nodes and AI,
    it is possible to gather data throughout the different stages of germinated seeds.
    In the same vein, Ammad Uddin et al. [143] propose a system for crop monitoring
    from the phase of seed germination to harvest. The benefits of such a system include
    optimization of crop quality and quantity, efficient use of resources, and resistance
    to harsh weather. The application of the IoT for the traceability of seeds is
    conducive to more effective agricultural practices, appropriate land use, and
    a high quality of produce. For example, [139] design an IoT-based greenhouse traceability
    system for the tracking and recordkeeping of seedlings and other agricultural
    products in the germination and growth periods. The authors argue that the implementation
    of this system not only helps to enhance the mode of agricultural production but
    also to establish high-quality standards and commercial value. Therefore, with
    the support of the IoT, farmers can develop a variety of high-quality seeds and
    maximize their profitability by effectively adapting to the weather circumstances.
    Accordingly, this leads to the following hypotheses for future investigations:
    - The use of the IoT positively impacts the quality of seeds. - The use of the
    IoT positively impacts the productivity of seeds. - Soil Soil represents a vital
    non-renewable resource in agriculture, and its sustainability is imperative. As
    soil is threatened by erosion and degradation, there is an opportunity to use
    the IoT for the protection of this critical resource. For instance, the IoT has
    paved the way for productive practices to cultivate soil thanks to the use of
    low-cost sensors, actuators, and affordable internet-based communication technologies
    [144]. IoT devices can aid in capturing the pH levels of soils and the rate of
    Nitrogen depletion in the form of time-series data and exchange it among interested
    researchers and agriculturists for further analysis [83]. Standard chemical soil
    analyses, which are costly and time consuming, can be substituted by IoT sensors
    that record the macro and micronutrients, salinity, and pH levels of the soil
    [145]. Several studies have already examined the role of the IoT to facilitate
    soil management. Jayaraman et al. [83] propose an IoT-based platform called SmartFarmNet
    to automate the capture of soil data, automatically correlate such data, and remove
    invalid data from the perspective of evaluating crop performance. Goap et al.
    [146] use real-time sensing of soil characteristics (e.g., moisture, temperature)
    in combination with weather predictions to develop a fully autonomous irrigation
    system. Likewise, Rawal [147] presents an IoT-based irrigation system to monitor
    soil, adjust the working of water sprinklers to moisture levels, and automate
    the irrigation process. The IoT is envisioned to offer in-situ monitoring capabilities
    (e.g., temperature, soil moisture, salinity) and interconnect with available field
    equipment (e.g., seeders, irrigation systems, harvesters) to enable full-field
    autonomy and more efficient agricultural production systems [148]. Relying on
    data from underground IoT sensors, farmers maintain real-time information about
    soil, thereby making more effective decisions. Furthermore, the IoT allows the
    reduction of detrimental environmental impacts due to its ability to provide instant
    reaction to alert events, including soil erosion. Therefore, the use of the IoT
    in agriculture eases the analysis of soil conditions and other related measures,
    optimizes production efficiencies, and enhances the predictive capabilities of
    farmers to avoid the risk of damaged soil and wasted harvest. On the basis of
    these arguments, we suggest the following hypotheses: - The use of the IoT positively
    impacts the properties of soil. - The use of the IoT promotes the sustainable
    management of soil. - Water Water constitutes a crucial resource for agriculture,
    and the promotion of water stewardship is vital. The IoT emerges as the opportune
    solution for smart water management applications due to the limited integration
    of existing technologies [102]. The deployment of the IoT can benefit several
    applications in agricultural landscape, including irrigation, because the technology
    can help farmers to optimize water usage [146], addressing the problem of water
    scarcity. Developing an IoT-based irrigation scheduling and decision support system
    is expected to provide increased control over farmland water requirements [149].
    Furthermore, the integration of the IoT can conserve water resources thanks to
    the capability of the technology to precisely monitor soil and environmental conditions,
    which are then used for anticipating timely water needs. In this context, Bu and
    Wang [150] propose a system that combines several technologies, such as the IoT,
    AI, and cloud computing, to increase agricultural production by making intelligent
    decisions in real time, such as identifying the amount of water required for optimizing
    crop growth. Such a system is compelling for farmers to create precision water
    applications based on the conditions of single plots in a field and, to an even
    greater extent, at the single plant level. As a result, the IoT can reduce water
    use across a wide variety of agricultural activities and improve water quality
    by sensing chemicals, temperature, pH, moisture, turbidity, dissolved oxygen,
    and conductivity [77]. Overall, the IoT urges for the development of proper water
    management by measuring the exact amount of water needed for irrigation and by
    avoiding excessive water consumption. Therefore, we formulate the following hypotheses
    for testing in future studies: - The IoT can help to use water more efficiently.
    - The Iot can help to improve the quality of water. - Fertilizers Fertilizers
    are considered key resources in agriculture to enhance crop growth, yield, and
    food quality. The excessive and inefficient use of fertilizers for agricultural
    production can bring about economic losses and high water and nutrient wastage,
    thereby resulting in environmental degradation [151]. As a result, it is essential
    to ensure the timely and adequate use of fertilizers to increase crop productivity
    and reduce environmental impacts. The incorporation of the IoT in agriculture
    can achieve efficient and effective fertilizer management and help farmers to
    better control the usage of fertilizers, improve crop quality, and minimize farming
    costs [80]. The deployment of IoT sensors across farms enables farmers to gain
    insightful information related to the amount of fertilizers used. For example,
    Pahuja et al. [152] develop an online climate monitoring system in greenhouses
    to monitor fertilization, irrigation, and climate. The proposed system uses a
    WSN to collect and extract insights from the analysis of sensed data. Farooq et
    al. [45] argue that the IoT can identify contaminated soil and protect the field
    from over-fertilization and crop losses. Ayaz et al. [145] also note that novel
    IoT-based fertilizing methods are used as an aid to estimate the spatial patterns
    of nutrient needs with higher precision and minimum labor efforts. Such accuracy
    and precision can enhance fertilizer efficiency while minimizing the negative
    side effects on the environment. In addition, IoT-based fertilization systems
    are more efficient than classic methods in terms of savings in water resources
    and the amount of fertilizers [153] because the technology can automatically monitor
    soil nutrients and alert farmers about the quantity of fertilizer to be applied
    during the cultivation of land. Therefore, the use of the IoT for fertilization
    helps farmers to optimize fertilizing efficiency, positively impacts the propagation
    of seeds, and reduces pollution caused by the use of chemical fertilizers to the
    soil [154]. Summarizing these discussions, the following hypotheses are proposed
    for future testing: - The IoT positively impacts the timing and efficiency of
    fertilizers. - The IoT reduces negative environmental impacts of fertilizers in
    agriculture. - Pesticides Pesticides are a necessary resource in agriculture to
    avoid pests and disease, reduce bacterial damage, and improve crop yields and
    production quality [155,125]. However, the excessive use of pesticides can lead
    to severe health and environmental damage (e.g., soil acidification, pollution
    of surface water) as well as cost increase and money loss due to wasted labor
    resources or soil acidification [156,157]. In conventional agriculture, the problem
    intensifies because the early detection of pests is nearly impossible. In other
    words, when farmers become aware of pests, high amounts of pesticides are needed.
    Hence, negative consequences will be severe for farmers [155]. Incorporating cutting-edge
    technologies, such as the IoT, can help farmers reduce these adverse effects,
    decrease costs, and participate in more eco-friendly farming. For example, the
    IoT can be used to achieve near-zero consumption of pesticides in greenhouse use
    cases [158]. Wu [159] develops an intelligent agricultural system based on the
    IoT to integrate the monitoring data of soil, sunlight, temperature, and information
    from the Central Weather Bureau and inform farmers of the precise amount of pesticides
    necessary for disease control. In addition, Li et al. [160] develop an intelligent
    platform for strawberry planting management based on the IoT. They report a decrease
    in pesticide usage by 61.67% and in pesticide costs by 32.48%. Chen et al. [155]
    combine AI techniques and the IoT for pest prediction and identification. Their
    experimental results depict 90% percent accuracy in pest identification. This
    precise and early identification leads to the accurate utilization of pesticides
    in terms of time and place. As a result, the use of the IoT in agriculture is
    expected to reduce the damage to soil and the environment. To summarize, IoT implications
    in pesticides management involve pest detection, pesticides’ economics, and environmental
    consequences. We formulate the following hypotheses to be tested in future works:
    - The IoT makes pest detection more efficient. - The IoT positively impacts the
    timing, efficiency, and overall economics of pesticide application. - The IoT
    reduces the environmental impact of pesticides in agriculture. - Energy Energy
    is a crucial resource for all economic sectors, including agriculture [126]. Energy
    management has gained momentum due to its essential role in economic development
    and human well-being. Population growth and the increase in food demand are among
    the factors that lead to increased energy consumption. National resources are
    regularly limited and intensive energy consumption causes severe health and environmental
    problems. Consequently, sustainable solutions are needed to cope with the increasing
    energy demand, and several initiatives in energy management strive to address
    these challenges [161,162,129]. The IoT can integrate various parts of the energy
    chain, including supply, transmission and distribution, and demand. It can foster
    sustainable energy management by improving energy efficiency, promoting the use
    of renewable energy, and decreasing the environmental impact of energy use [163,164].
    In the context of agriculture, IoT sensors can monitor temperature and humidity
    as well as soil moisture and optimize energy consumption based on weather conditions
    and advanced data analytics. In addition, the IoT provides monitoring capabilities
    of crops, soil, and pests. Based on the data collected from IoT devices, energy
    resources can be used effectively and early detection of emergencies is possible
    [2,1]. Energy consumption in agriculture can be divided into direct (e.g., the
    energy usage for irrigation) and indirect (e.g., the energy usage for fertilizer
    or pesticide production of the farm) use cases [129]. For direct energy consumption,
    Benyezza et al. [165] develop a zoning irrigation system based on the IoT. Their
    real-environment experimentation shows a significant decrease in energy and water
    consumption. For the indirect use case, it is found that the IoT can decrease
    energy consumption by reducing the required amount of fertilizers and pesticides
    for cultivation. Moreover, it can reduce waste and maximize crop yields, resulting
    in lower energy consumption for a certain amount of crops [1]. Overall, the IoT
    and the quantum of data produced by IoT devices contribute to more sustainable
    energy management [166,167,168,169]. Thus, we suggest the following hypotheses:
    - The IoT positively impacts energy efficiency in agriculture. - The IoT facilitates
    the incorporation of renewable energy resources. - The IoT facilitates sustainable
    and green energy management. - Livestock With the progressive decline of the family-style
    farming approach in the recent decade, livestock management has steadily become
    intensive and intelligent. The incorporation of ICT to overcome the issues and
    shortcomings of traditional livestock management, boost the productivity of livestock,
    and leverage modernization is of vital significance to achieving stable, sustainable
    development [48]. With the emergence of IoT technologies, farmers would be able
    to maintain improved device communications, automate farm operations, and only
    control and act on activities requiring a higher level of intelligence [69]. Moreover,
    the implementation of the IoT is expected to support traceability systems for
    livestock products since the technology enables producers, consumers, and regulators
    to request and track information related to livestock breeding, processing, and
    transportation, thereby assuring animal food safety and supporting the quality
    management system of animal food [170]. A key advantage of the IoT is also its
    ability to automate communication between agricultural equipment and sensors used
    on the farm. According to Astill et al. [32], this capability leads to automating
    several tasks. For instance, small quantities of feed could transmit an automatic
    order to feed suppliers or elevated levels of ammonia gas and humidity detected
    by environmental sensors can transmit a warning to farmers to increase the ventilate
    rate. Ojo et al. [171] highlight that the IoT can be used to develop a localization
    system that enables real-time livestock location monitoring. Chaudhry et al. [172]
    note that farmers can use the IoT to detect skin temperature and pulse rate of
    animals, which provides enormous insight into animal health and its prediction.
    Finally, Zhang et al. [173] argue that the embedding of the IoT in livestock management
    allows optimal animal feeding and nutrient usage through which improved environmental
    protection, production efficiency, and high-quality products can be achieved.
    To sum up, the following hypotheses can be tested in future studies: - The IoT
    positively impacts livestock production systems. - The IoT contributes to animal
    welfare. - The IoT reduces the negative environmental impact of livestock management.
    - Human resources The critical role of human resources in firms’ success is undeniable.
    Several researchers have outlined the vital importance of human resources management
    in achieving competitive advantage and superior performance [174,175,176]. The
    IoT can bring enormous opportunities to human resources in agriculture, and it
    has the potential to equip farmers with significant monitoring and control capabilities.
    For example, IoT use cases include bee swarm [177], dairy cattle and crops status
    [178], environmental indexes, like soil moisture, humidity, and temperature [179,180],
    field indexes [181], and pest monitoring and control [155]. The IoT can also provide
    farmers with prediction and decision support capabilities. Emergency prediction
    (e.g., extreme weather conditions, diseases) is vital information that the IoT
    enables in agriculture [2]. Additionally, potential crop malfunctions and related
    solutions [182] as well as expert systems for evaluating agricultural land suitability
    [183] are examples of the enabling role of the IoT in prediction capabilities.
    Furthermore, automation is one of the IoT''s major contributions. Successful large-scale
    farm management needs a massive amount of information, analysis, operational works,
    supervision, and knowledge. The IoT can automate all these tasks, thus providing
    farmers significant time, work, and cost savings [184]. With the support of IoT
    capabilities and automation, farmers can better engage in the planning stage,
    make more informed and timely decisions, and concentrate on more strategic tasks.
    Moreover, the IoT and its enabling technologies can contribute to workforce health
    and safety, for instance, by using IoT-based robots or UAVs for unhealthy and
    unsafe operations [185]. As a result, the IoT can lead to increased job satisfaction
    and engagement. The IoT also reduces the need for the workforce and can bring
    substantial cost savings [101]. This is intriguing, specifically in developed
    countries in which workforces are scarce. Briefly, the IoT can contribute to developing
    more skilled workers, who are hard to find in developing countries [1]. Based
    on the previous discussions, we highlight the following hypotheses: - The IoT
    positively impacts human resource efficiency in agriculture. - The IoT positively
    impacts human resource safety, health, and job satisfaction. - Technology infrastructure
    Technology is a crucial resource in organizations. Economic development, national
    competitiveness, industrial growth, and firms’ competitive advantages largely
    depend on technological advances [133,134]. Technological infrastructures in agricultural
    development can be divided into four stages. These revolutions include human and
    animal resources in agriculture 1.0; mechanization and powered machinery in agriculture
    2.0; computer, internet, and high-speed development in agriculture 3.0; and the
    IoT and other cutting-edge technologies in agriculture 4.0 [1]. The IoT represents
    one of the most promising technologies that will hugely impact and transform business
    routines and value creation even more than it has already [186]. The IoT can provide
    significant benefits for several areas of smart agriculture, including automation,
    monitoring, water management, agrochemicals, disease detection, harvesting, and
    supply chain management among others [1]. The IoT constitutes a significant driver
    of smart farming [187]. Its utilization is considered a paradigm shift due to
    its enabling role in near real-time integration of multiple technologies that
    otherwise should act in isolation or communicate with high costs. With the assistance
    of the IoT, WSNs, UAVs, sensors, geospatial technologies, AI-related technologies,
    computing technologies, end-user applications, and robotics can interconnect and
    exchange data and information [2,5,10,3]. For example, the IoT can provide massive
    amounts of data for data analytics, computing technologies, and AI-related technologies,
    such as machine learning and deep learning in real-time, with high efficiency,
    thereby resulting in improvements in extracting knowledge from the data, monitoring,
    decision-making, and supply chain management [2,1,3]. Besides, the IoT can make
    traditional machinery smart and connected [188]. The IoT can be combined with
    blockchain technology in a way that enables IoT data to be stored, analyzed, transferred,
    and exchanged in a secure, transparent network supported by blockchain and its
    privacy-preserving property [33,11]. As a result, the IoT is transforming the
    infrastructures of agriculture into a more intelligent and data-driven sector
    in which technologies can interact, make decisions, and perform automatically,
    with high efficiency and efficacy [145]. Several scholars have developed IoT-based
    systems that integrate various technologies in precision and smart agriculture
    [189,190,191]. The following hypotheses are extracted from the abovementioned
    discussions: - The IoT positively impacts other technologies’ efficiency in agriculture.
    - The IoT increases communication efficiency between agriculture technologies.
    - Business relations Firms'' relationships with their customers, supply chain
    members, and other key stakeholders are among key resources and success factors.
    Firms should meet their stakeholders’ demands to gain legitimacy and remain competitive.
    Improvements in stakeholders'' relationships can facilitate resource acquisition,
    resource and information sharing, regulatory relationships, and strategic alliances
    [192]. The IoT can contribute to stakeholders’ relationships in several ways,
    including integrating supply chain processes, streamlining cooperation, improving
    transparency and tractability, enhancing agility and adaptability, and boosting
    sustainability objectives, such as health and well-being, lower environmental
    impacts, and reduced waste and energy consumption [193,194,195,196]. In the agricultural
    sector, all the supply chain members can easily coordinate and collaborate in
    an IoT-enabled ecosystem. IoT devices provide real-time data of different parts
    of the agri-food supply chain from farm to market. With the help of IoT data and
    analytic capabilities, supply chain members improve their adaptability and agility
    and achieve time savings [194]. Furthermore, with the help of RFID and WSN, transparency
    and traceability of the food supply chain can be ameliorated dramatically [194,81].
    In relation to these capabilities, blockchain technology is a great step forward.
    As such, any supply chain partner in an open and distributed blockchain and IoT-based
    supply chain can check the originality and changes to a product from the beginning.
    Consequently, agriculture stakeholders can be assured of the quality, safety,
    and environmental impacts of products. The IoT can also be substantiated by blockchain
    and smart contracts because they can further improve trust, regulation, and automation
    of supply chain relationships [197,195,198,199,200]. By way of illustration, Awan
    et al. [161] develop a futuristic model that integrates agriculture and food supply
    chain through the IoT and blockchain. Caro et al. [201] use blockchain and the
    IoT to design a decentralized agri-food supply chain management solution. Finally,
    the IoT can foster agri-food sustainability, which nurtures business relations
    and the perceived sense of trust, transparency, and fairness in business transactions.
    To summarize, we formulate the following hypotheses for future examination: -
    The IoT positively impacts business relations in agriculture. - The IoT positively
    impacts supply chain collaboration in agriculture. 4.10. Future research themes
    In Table 8, we put forth an agenda for future research to assist scholars and
    practitioners in understanding and further examining the interplay between the
    IoT and agriculture. The suggested agenda summarizes the transformative potential
    and impact of the IoT in agriculture and advance this research field by highlighting
    ten major main themes: (1) IoT for seeds; (2) IoT for soil; (3) IoT for water;
    (4) IoT for fertilizers; (5) IoT for pesticides; (6) IoT for energy; (7) IoT for

    Discussion In this study, we investigate the impact of the IoT on agriculture
    and its enabling role for speeding up the transition to precision agriculture.
    Complementing previous review studies on the IoT and agriculture [24,3], our findings
    are based on a large sample of documents published in the last decade. The upcoming
    sections provide an in-depth discussion of the progress in the IoT and agriculture
    and summarize the current state as well as major challenges and trending topics.
    5.1. IoT deployment in agriculture Our review reveals several insights into the
    role of the IoT to support agricultural systems and increase the efficiency of
    their operations [2,97,6,3]. We identified the most-cited papers, which illustrate
    that IoT applications are making great strides toward developing a more sustainable
    agriculture and fulfilling the requirements of precision agriculture. IoT technologies
    attracted increased attention and gained momentum because of their ability to
    support farmers in understanding plant health conditions, resource use, and climate
    circumstances, all of which would be difficult to capture otherwise. Another promising
    approach consists in harnessing wireless networks, blockchain, UAVs, AI techniques,
    and big data analytics to increase the automation of field activities, optimize
    crop yields, improve food quality and safety, reduce energy consumption, and cultivate
    sustainability [24,2,6,3]. Consequently, these technologies offer solutions to
    assist farmers in decision-making [2], create an informed and adaptable rural
    community [77], minimize human intervention [217], enhance predictive capabilities
    [195], reduce pesticide use [222], and improve agri-food traceability [223]. By
    analyzing the keyword dynamics, we found that “IoT,” “WSN,” “PA,” “Smart Agriculture,”
    “Sensor,” “Cloud Computing,” “ML,” and “Big Data” are among the common technologies
    currently explored in the context of agriculture. WSN are key enablers for smart
    agriculture, thanks to their ability to capture, monitor, and analyze the data
    from agriculture [224]. As such, WSN technology integrates IoT sensors to foster
    cooperation, thereby measuring and controlling real-time soil and weather information
    [61], electrical conductivity, automated irrigation, air humidity, irradiation,
    frost protection, and wind speed [[225], [226], [227], [228]]. Cloud computing,
    machine learning, and big data are also key enablers for implementing smarter,
    more efficient, and sustainable agriculture, benefitting agri-food producers and
    consumers. Other themes include “UAV,” “Deep Learning,” “Security,” “ANN,” and
    “Irrigation.” Finally, the analysis of keywords mentioned in the papers’ abstracts
    underscores the importance of \"data,\" \"monitoring,\" \"control,\" \"management,\"
    \"energy,\" \"irrigation,\" \"water,\" and \"security.\" Apart from mirroring
    the profundity and progress of digital transformations, these themes illustrate
    that IoT implementations in agriculture are soaring rapidly. Currently, studies
    are lacking that investigate the fusion of the IoT and other embryonic technologies,
    such as 5 G telecommunications, 3D printing, augmented and virtual reality, vertical
    farms, and bioinformatics in the sustainable establishment of agri-food systems.
    Combining these technologies allows farmers to operate more efficiently and creatively;
    however, both positive and negative impacts need to be investigated in more detail.
    Consequently, our study results unlock and highlight the urgent need for additional
    research that examines how responsible use of the IoT can reshape farming practices
    and policies to realize sustainable and inclusive agriculture supply chains [[229],
    [230], [231]]. 5.2. IoT challenges in agriculture The investigation of the IoT
    in agriculture also uncovers several social problems, such as the lack of necessary
    technical skills and capabilities [[195], [232]], the technological divide between
    large and small-scale farms [[233], [234]], and soaring unemployment [235]. In
    an IoT ecosystem, most of the work is carried out by fully automated and autonomous
    devices, thus reducing the need for human interference and causing job losses
    in the long run. Therefore, the substitution of workforces with IoT technologies
    can cause a critical decline in employment numbers. The second challenge is related
    to the technical limitations of the IoT, such as lack of connectivity, network
    bandwidth and latency, power supply, response time, battery efficiency, incompatibility
    of IoT systems with current farm operations, heterogeneity of data and devices,
    and interoperability [[3], [44], [45], [69], [144], [219], [222]]. The third challenge
    includes privacy and ethical issues, including the absence of privacy protections
    in agricultural systems [33], lack of accountability [[236], [237]], and regulatory
    measures associated with data processing and analysis [54]. The widespread use
    of the IoT therefore necessitates an urgent debate, including topics such as ethical
    dimensions, transparency, inclusiveness, and fairness [[75], [238], [239], [240],
    [241]]. The fourth challenge concerns the organizational barriers to IoT deployment,
    such as reluctance to adopt IoT technologies [242,243], share farm data [75],
    bureaucratic processes and paperwork [[92], [244],44], and culture [[78], [245]].
    In addition, the adoption of IoT technologies and processes alters existing organizational
    structures and requires new skills, talents, knowledge, and costs [71,195,108,[81],
    [246], [247]]. 5.3. Trending topics in the IOT and agriculture When it comes to
    the trending topics at the intersection of the IoT and agriculture, we can see
    that RFID, GPS, remote monitoring, Zigbee, and SDN have recently gained popularity.
    Additionally, emerging technologies, such as cloud computing, AI, machine learning,
    big data, and blockchain, are crucial for digitalization of agriculture and smart
    farming [82,69]. Further interesting areas include yield prediction, irrigation,
    livestock monitoring, plant and animal disease detection, waste reduction, field
    productivity, climate forecasting, pest control, automation, efficient farming
    operations, effective land use, wise water and energy consumption, soil fruitfulness,
    visibility and transparency, automation, efficient traceability, and enhanced
    competitiveness. 6. Research implications 6.1. Theoretical implications To provide
    a foundation for further theorization, Table 9 features research gaps, key theories,
    and suggested methodologies that investigate the interplay of the IoT and agriculture.

    Practical implications Several managerial implications can be derived from the
    bibliometric analysis in this study. First, our findings may assist practitioners
    in determining which technological solutions they can leverage to facilitate IoT
    implementations. Second, we developed a framework that can be used by practitioners
    to better understand IoT application areas, the impact of the technology on agriculture,
    and the challenges that may arise during IoT adoption. When implementing IoT in
    farming activities, we highlight the potential contribution of the IoT to achieve
    sustainability in regards to soil, water, energy, workforce, traceability, and
    business relationships. Third, practitioners need to consider the technical and
    socioeconomic feasibility of incorporating the IoT into agriculture while reiterating
    the resulting ethical and social consequences. Fourth, the RBV framework enhances
    practitioners’ understanding of how the IoT can improve the efficiency of vital
    resources and their interconnections as well as their impact on firms’ competitiveness
    (cost and differentiation advantages) and sustainability goals. Finally, the RBV
    framework facilitates practitioners’ endeavors to achieve superior sustainable
    performance by providing several examples for each resource. 7. Conclusions, limitations,
    and future research In this paper, we carry out a bibliometric analysis to investigate
    the interplay between the IoT and agriculture. We evaluate publications from the
    previous decade, answering three overarching research questions that pertain to
    the publication dynamics in the field, the most important research topics, and,
    finally, the identification of those agricultural resources that are impacted
    by the IoT. In terms of academic output, we observed that IoT research in agriculture
    has significantly increased in the last three years, with most research being
    published in journals dedicated to computer science and engineering. Furthermore,
    supplementary topics, such as WSN, sensors, cloud computing, machine learning,
    AI, blockchain, UAVs, and deep learning, are identified as important technologies
    that can benefit farmers in the near future. We also notice a recent focus on
    AI techniques, big data, and blockchain as trending topics in smart and precision
    agriculture. The integration of the IoT with cyber-physical systems, augmented
    reality, virtual reality, additive manufacturing, and bioinformatics has received
    insufficient scholarly attention so far. As a result, future studies need to investigate
    how the IoT can complement other emerging technologies’ ability to sustainably
    manage soil, water, energy, crops, and animals. In addition, we discuss various
    challenges of IoT implementations in agriculture. Our review has some limitations.
    This study carried out a keyword search query against a single academic database,
    namely, the Web of Science (WoS). Consequently, relevant papers not indexed in
    the WoS have been neglected. Accordingly, future studies can use multiple data
    sources (e.g., Scopus, EBSCOhost, Google Scholar), include supplementary keywords,
    and conduct additional analyses to gain additional findings (e.g., main path analysis,
    meta-analysis). The future of the IoT is entwined with the design of efficient
    and sustainable agricultural systems. Consequently, the directions for future
    research identified here should encourage scholars to pursue rigorous research
    on the IoT and agriculture and explore hitherto neglected areas. We suggest numerous
    research directions and recommend that practitioners and agriculture stakeholders
    investigate the IoT''s impact on their performance. We recommend an integrative
    perspective for evaluating the impact of the IoT on agricultural sustainability.
    The benefits of the IoT can only be reaped if practitioners surmount existing
    challenges of IoT adoption in the agricultural sector. In this respect, we have
    identified several challenges that need to be overcome, most importantly issues
    related to unemployment, privacy and security, and ethics. In summary, our study
    bridges the gap between theory and practice pertaining to IoT applications in
    agriculture. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have

  description: Evapotranspiration (ET) represents crop water use and is a key indicator
    of crop health. Accurate estimation of ET is critical for agricultural irrigation
    and water resource management. ET retrieval using energy balance methods with
    remotely sensed thermal infrared data as the key input has been widely applied
    for irrigation scheduling, yield prediction, drought monitoring and so on. However,
    limitations on the spatial and temporal resolution of available thermal satellite
    data combined with the effects of cloud contamination constrain the amount of
    detail that a single satellite can provide. Fusing satellite data from different
    satellites with varying spatial and temporal resolutions can provide a more continuous
    estimation of daily ET at field scale. In this study, we applied an ET fusion
    modeling system, which uses a surface energy balance model to retrieve ET using
    both Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and
    then fuses the Landsat and MODIS ET retrieval timeseries using the Spatial-Temporal
    Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM). In this paper, we compared different
    STARFM ET fusion implementation strategies over various crop lands in the central
    California. In particular, the use of single versus two Landsat-MODIS pair images
    to constrain the fusion is explored in cases of rapidly changing crop conditions,
    as in frequently harvested alfalfa fields, as well as an improved dual-pair method.
    The daily 30 m ET retrievals are evaluated with flux tower observations and analyzed
    based on land cover type. This study demonstrates improvement using the new dual-pair
    STARFM method compared with the standard one-pair STARFM method in estimating
    daily field scale ET for all the major crop types in the study area.

    an ET fusion modeling system, which uses a surface energy balance model to retrieve
    ET using both Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
    data and then fuses the Landsat and MODIS ET retrieval timeseries using the Spatial-Temporal
    Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM). In this paper, we compared different
    STARFM ET fusion implementation strategies over various crop lands in the central
    California. In particular, the use of single versus two Landsat-MODIS pair images
    to constrain the fusion is explored in cases of rapidly changing crop conditions,
    as in frequently harvested alfalfa fields, as well as an improved dual-pair method.
    The daily 30 m ET retrievals are evaluated with flux tower observations and analyzed
    based on land cover type. This study demonstrates improvement using the new dual-pair
    STARFM method compared with the standard one-pair STARFM method in estimating
    daily field scale ET for all the major crop types in the study area. Keywords:

    water use 1. Introduction As food production increases to meet the needs of the
    growing global population, the demand of water for agriculture, especially in
    water-limited areas of the world, has rapidly increased [1]. At the same time,
    drought is prevalent across the globe and could become more frequent under changing
    climate conditions [2]. The competing demands for water resources, especially
    under drought conditions, can lead to large socioeconomical impacts, requiring
    management decisions to balance the needs for water between agriculture, urban
    uses, and natural ecosystems [3,4]. Accurate assessments of water use at field
    scale can be critical to understand spatiotemporal patterns in water requirements
    and help improve water resource management and agricultural practices, for example,
    decisions about irrigation timing and amount [5,6]. Evapotranspiration (ET) represents
    the consumptive water use by a vegetated surface and is a major component of watershed
    water balance. Daily ET maps at field scale (100 m resolution or finer) can provide
    useful information for vegetation condition monitoring [7,8], drought detection
    [9,10], yield prediction [11] and irrigation scheduling [12,13]. While traditional
    ET measurement methods (e.g., lysimeter and eddy covariance flux tower) are limited
    to sampling only a small area (typically of dimensions of a meter to a few hundred
    meters), ET estimation using remotely sensed data can provide gridded water use
    information over large regions, taking advantage of the recent achievements in
    Earth observation capabilities [14,15]. Energy balance methods, with remotely
    sensed thermal infrared (TIR) observations as the key input, have been widely
    used for ET estimation [16]. Using sharpened TIR data from Landsat, ET can be
    produced at 30 m spatial resolution every 8 (16) days under clear-sky conditions
    with 2 (1) functioning platforms, although the revisit can be significantly longer
    in regions of persistent cloud-cover. This relatively long revisit interval may
    not be adequate to capture important vegetation water-use trends, especially during
    key growth and management stages, or during periods of rapid onset of “flash”
    drought. The ET retrieved using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
    (MODIS) TIR data can be generated on a near daily basis, but at a relatively coarse
    spatial resolution (250–500 m) that often does not resolve water use variability
    at field or sub-field scales. To obtain the daily Landsat-scale (30 m) ET needed
    for field-scale monitoring applications, a data fusion method has been employed
    to fuse ET timeseries retrieved from Landsat and MODIS. The Spatial-Temporal Adaptive
    Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) is a widely used data fusion method that was
    originally developed to fuse surface reflectance data from Landsat and MODIS [17].
    STARFM uses spatio-statistical weighting information derived from Landsat data
    and MODIS data on one or more Landsat overpass days and MODIS data on the prediction
    date to obtain Landsat-like estimations on all prediction dates between Landsat
    overpasses. STARFM has been successfully adapted to fuse ET data retrieved from
    Landsat and MODIS and has been used in many studies in various climate zones and
    land use types [9,11,18,19,20]. The weighting information used in STARFM to downscale
    MODIS product timeseries can be derived from either a single pair of MODIS and
    Landsat images or two pairs bracketing the prediction date [17]. To date, most
    applications of STARFM for ET fusion have used one pair of images, since this
    mode is better suited for near real-time applications and uses less imagery. However,
    Xue et al. [21] found that the one-pair approach often did not adequately capture
    rapid changes in ET in intensively managed agricultural systems, such as alfalfa.
    Additionally, under some circumstances, the one-pair approach tends to add an
    artificial discontinuous change in predicted values when switching pairs. While
    there are many studies exploring the impact of different image pair selection
    strategies in surface reflectance fusion [22,23], no similar sensitivity study
    has been conducted characterizing the use of a single pair vs. two pairs of images
    in ET fusion. In this study, we tested the standard one-pair and two-pair options
    as well as a new dual-pair option of STARFM in ET fusion over the Delta area in
    central California, and we investigated the impact of these options on daily ET
    estimation over various land use types. The study objectives are to explore the
    following: (1) the difference among fused daily ET timeseries estimated using
    different strategies of STARFM; (2) the impact of different STARFM methods on
    daily field-scale ET estimation over different land cover types. 2. Study Area
    The study area, located in the Central Valley of California, is shown in Figure
    1 along with land use information for 2014. This area is characterized by a wide
    range of land use and crop types with variable plant and water use phenology,
    which provides a complex condition for testing the capabilities of STARFM in fusing
    ET timeseries over a highly heterogenous area. This area also has the advantage
    of having many available clear remotely sensed observations during the growing
    season, which typically has low cloud cover. Over the past years, there has been
    a significant increase in viticulture within this study area, inspired by the
    region’s Mediterranean climate, characterized by the rainy cold season and dry
    and hot summers. In addition to vineyards, many other perennial and annual crops
    are grown in the region and a large amount of water is consumed for agriculture
    production. However, this area has experienced prolonged periods of drought over
    the past decade, which are projected to be more frequent due to the changing climate.
    To better manage water resources in this area, detailed accounting of seasonal
    water use curves by crop type is needed. Several flux towers are in this study
    area to monitor water and carbon fluxes that can be used as evaluation sites,
    as will be discussed in detail in the Data section. Figure 1. Study area in the
    Central Valley of California, USA (left) and land-use classes from the CROP2014
    dataset (right). 3. Methods and Data 3.1. Methods 3.1.1. Evapotranspiration Retrieval
    Using Multi-Scale Remotely Sensed Data The Atmosphere–Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI)
    surface energy balance model and associated flux disaggregation technique DisALEXI
    were used to estimate surface energy fluxes over the study area using Landsat
    and MODIS TIR imagery. ALEXI/DisALEXI are based on the Two-Source Energy Balance
    (TSEB) model, which was developed by Norman et al. [24] and further refined by
    Kustas et al. [25,26]. In TSEB, the soil and vegetation energy components are
    solved separately (Equations (1) and (2)): 𝑅 𝑛,𝑠  = 𝐻 𝑆 +𝐿 𝐸 𝑆 + 𝐺 0 (1) 𝑅 𝑛,𝑐  =
    𝐻 𝑐 +𝐿 𝐸 𝑐 (2) where the subscripts “s” and “c” represent soil and canopy energy
    flux components (in W m−2), Rn is net radiation, H is sensible heat flux, LE is
    latent heat flux and G0 is soil heat flux. The observed directional radiometric
    surface temperature is partitioned into soil and vegetation components, which
    are used to constrain Rn, H and G. Daily latent heat flux (in energy units of
    MJ m−2 day−1) is converted to ET (in mass units of mm day−1) by dividing by the
    latent heat of vaporization (λ = 2.45 MJ kg−1). Combining TSEB with a simplified
    atmospheric boundary condition model, ALEXI/DisALEXI can estimate evapotranspiration
    from regional to continental scales with remotely sensed thermal infrared observations
    and vegetation index as the key inputs. The regional ALEXI model employs the TSEB
    in a time-differential mode during the morning period to reduce sensitivity to
    absolute temperature errors. For more details about the ALEXI model, see Anderson
    et al. [27,28]. Using time-differential land-surface temperature (LST) observations
    from geostationary satellites, ET estimated using ALEXI is normally at coarse
    scale, on the order of several kilometers. To obtain higher spatial resolution
    ET maps, DisALEXI can be employed to disaggregate the coarse ET from ALEXI using
    higher resolution LST retrievals from MODIS (500–1000 m/approximately daily) or
    Landsat (sharpened to 30 m/8–16 days). More information about DisALEXI can be
    found in Anderson et al. [28,29,30] and Yang et al. [31]. 3.1.2. GEE-DisALEXI
    In this study, Landsat ET was retrieved using a version of DisALEXI that has been
    recently implemented in Google Earth Engine (GEE) under the OpenET project—a collaborative
    effort aimed at providing field-scale ET estimates over the western U.S. for improved
    irrigation and water resource management [32]. The basic algorithm for GEE-DisALEXI
    is the same as the standard version described above and in previous studies, but
    with some differences in the input data preparation and model structure due to
    the specific capabilities and constraints of GEE. These differences are discussed
    in more detail in Section 2. 3.1.3. Gap-Filling STARFM requires Landsat- and MODIS-retrieved
    ET images be spatially filled and MODIS-retrieved ET images additionally be temporally
    filled to ensure that daily MODIS images are available. Spatial gaps in Landsat
    DisALEXI caused by cloud contamination or stripes from the Landsat 7 scan-line
    corrector failure are filled using the method described in Yang et al. [33]. The
    gaps are filled using a weighted function between a STARFM predicted Landsat-scale
    ET and the original retrieved Landsat ET. Temporal gaps in MODIS-retrieved ET
    are filled using the method in Anderson et al. [15]. The ratio between MODIS-retrieved
    ET and ALEXI ET at 4 km is computed and smoothed using a Savitzky–Golay filter
    [34]. Gap-filled daily ET is recovered by multiplying this smoothed ratio series
    by daily ALEXI ET. 3.1.4. STARFM Data Fusion Method STARFM uses Landsat and MODIS
    image pairs from the same day to estimate Landsat-resolution images for other
    MODIS dates [17]. The original method is implemented at the pixel level using
    spectrally similar pixels around the central (prediction) pixel. The change of
    temporal information is obtained from MODIS images based on these similar pixels.
    The final estimation is the sum of the predictions from similar pixels weighted
    by spectral and spatial differences. STARFM can use a one- or two-pair option.
    The single-pair option uses similar pixels from one image pair. The two-pair option
    uses all similar pixels from two image pairs, usually one before and one after
    the prediction date. STARFM is the first operational algorithm open to the public
    for data fusion. Based on the original STARFM, several modified algorithms have
    developed to fuse surface reflectances [35,36,37], as summarized in Zhu et al.
    [23]. For example, the spatial temporal adaptive algorithm for mapping reflectance
    change (STAARCH, [38]) uses similar weight functions, but detects the land cover
    type change points from dense time series of coarse images. To improve the accuracy
    of STARFM in heterogeneous areas, Enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM, [39]) introduces a
    conversion coefficient estimated by linearly regressing the reflectance changes
    of fine resolution pixels of the same endmember and coarse resolution pixel. One-
    and Two-Pair Modes The one-pair and two-pair options are available in the standard
    publicly available STARFM package [17]. The one-pair option normally chooses an
    available Landsat image close to the prediction date and pairs this with the MODIS
    image on the same day. Transition between one pair and the next pair is determined
    by similarity between MODIS images on the prediction and pair dates. The two-pair
    mode uses pairs bracketing a prediction interval. The pair is determined for each
    pixel from the two bracketing pairs by selecting the higher similarity in MODIS.
    For ET fusion, similarity in the ratio between MODIS ET and ALEXI ET is used to
    select the optimal pair to downscale predictions [20]. Proposed Dual-Pair Mode
    The proposed dual-pair mode of STARFM, like the two-pair mode, uses two pairs
    of Landsat- and MODIS-retrieved ET, one pair before and another pair after the
    predict day to predict Landsat-scale ET (Figure 2). However, rather than using
    the pair to determine an average set of downscaling weights employed over this
    prediction at the pixel-level, each pair is used to run the one-pair STARFM algorithm
    over the prediction interval, yielding two high-resolution ET timeseries–one forward
    predicted (ET1) from the first pair and one back predicted (ET2) from the second
    pair. The two ET timeseries are then merged together at the image level using
    Equation (3): 𝐸 𝑇 𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙−𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑟 = 𝑊 1 ×𝐸 𝑇 1 + 𝑊 2 ×𝐸 𝑇 2 𝑊 1 = 𝑡 2 − 𝑡 0 𝑡 2 − 𝑡
    1 𝑊 2 = 𝑡 0 − 𝑡 1 𝑡 2 − 𝑡 1   (3) where ET1 and ET2 are the results of one-pair
    STARFM using pair 1 and pair 2, W is the relative weight assigned to the results
    from using each pair, and t1 and t2 are the date for the two pairs, t0 is the
    prediction date. Under normal conditions, W1 and W2 are estimated using the date
    of two pairs and the prediction day, which yields a smooth weighted transition
    between the results from both pairs. However, this weight factor can also be modified
    to adapt to rapid changes; for example, harvest can be estimated from NDVI using
    change detection techniques [40]. In the case of a detected rapid change, the
    prediction before the change date should be more related to the image pair before
    change, while the prediction after the change date should be more related to the
    image pair after change. In this study, we simply tested assigning W1 as 1 and
    W2 as 0 for pre-harvest to only consider information from image pairs before harvest,
    and we tested the opposite for postharvest to only consider information from image
    pairs after harvest. Figure 2. Schematic diagram of different STARFM modes operating
    under consistent change and abrupt change conditions. On the top of each panel
    is an example of pair information at the pixel level. (a) One-pair STARFM; (b)
    two-pair STARFM; (c) proposed dual-pair STARFM. 3.1.5. Quality Assessment The
    relative accuracy of the various pair options for STARFM was assessed at flux
    tower locations using observations of daily ET. Statistical metrics including
    mean absolute error (MAE), mean bias error (MBE), and root mean square error (RMSE)
    were used in this study. 3.1.6. STARFM Testing Strategy STARFM inputs used in
    this study include periodic ET retrievals from Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 (30 m),
    as well as daily ET from MODIS (500 m). The STARFM modes tested include the original
    one-pair and two-pair mode as well as the dual-pair mode proposed in this study.
    To better examine the impact of different inputs on the quality of the predicted
    Landsat-scale ET, various combinations of input data were tested. The following
    tests are performed: (1) using Landsat 8-retrieved ET with simulated MODIS derived
    through aggregation of Landsat direct retrievals to 480 m ET, to examine the performance
    of different STARFM application strategies using perfectly consistent multi-source
    imagery; (2) using both Landsat 7- and Landsat 8-retrieved ET and MODIS-retrieved
    ET to explore the time series performance from different strategies in comparison
    with flux tower observations; (3) using only Landsat 8-retrieved ET and MODIS-retrieved
    ET to assess, in comparison with test 2, the impact of temporal sampling at the
    Landsat scale. The time-series daily fused ET were compared with flux tower observations
    and analyzed for major crop types to look at the performance of the standard one-pair
    STARFM and proposed dual-pair STARFM for different crop types. 3.2. Data 3.2.1.
    ET Model Inputs ALEXI and DisALEXI model inputs are briefly reviewed here, with
    more detailed information provided in [28,29,31]. Key remote sensing inputs to
    both ALEXI and DisALEXI are raster images of LST and LAI. For the ALEXI model,
    LST data are obtained at two times during the morning rise interval (typically
    1.5 and 5.5 hourafter local sunrise) from the GOES-East and -West imager instruments
    and resampled to a 4 km grid. LAI data are obtained from the 500 m MODIS LAI (MCD15A3H)
    product. These data are spatially aggregated to the 4 km grid and temporally interpolated
    to a daily time step using the Savitzky–Golay methods [15]. Albedo, another primary
    component of the energy balance, is estimated with the narrow-to-broadband conversion
    equation developed for Landsat surface reflectances [41]. Inputs for MODIS-based
    disaggregation of ALEXI ET include instantaneous swath LST data (MOD11_L2), LAI
    (MCD15A3) and albedo (MCD43A3). All MODIS data were from collection 6 and went
    through quality check based on the associated QA data. MODIS LST at 1 km spatial
    resolution was sharpened to 500 m using the thermal sharpening method developed
    by Gao et al. [17]. Landsat-based disaggregation of ALEXI ET was carried out using
    the version of DisALEXI on GEE using TIR and shortwave surface reflectance data
    from Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 collection 1, excluding images with cloud cover exceeding
    70% of the scene. The TIR data were atmospherically corrected using the parameters
    and methods described in Masahiro et al. [42], and then spatially sharpened to
    30 m resolution using a thermal sharpening method similar to that developed by
    Gao et al. [17]. This thermal sharpening method was implemented into GEE using
    the random forest method. MODIS-consistent Landsat-scale LAI was estimated following
    the method described in Kang et al. [43] using machine learning on GEE. A total
    of 1.6 Millon samples were generated from MODIS LAI and Landsat surface reflectance
    data. Surface meteorological data inputs to both ALEXI and DisALEXI, including
    air temperature and pressure, vapor pressure, wind speed, and insolation, were
    obtained from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) at 0.5-degree spatial
    resolution and resampled to the GOES, Landsat and MODIS scales. Land cover information
    used to parameterize surface roughness and spectral characteristics at pixel scale
    was extracted from 2016 National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) at 30 m spatial resolution.
    The pixel level vegetation parameters used in ET models were parameterized following
    Cammalleri et al. [20]. 3.2.2. Flux Tower Data Observations from several flux
    towers operating within the modeling domain during the study period were used
    for qualitative assessment of the fused ET image timeseries. These flux tower
    sites are listed in Table 1 and include US-Tw3, US-Twt, SLM001 and SLM002. Data
    for US-Tw3 (alfalfa; doi:10.17910/AMF/1246149) and US-Twt (rice; doi:10.17190/AMF/1246151)
    were extracted from the FLUXNET 2015 data set, which provides a global dataset
    of water and energy fluxes at ecosystem scale processed using a set of well-established
    and published methods [44]. The data are quality checked, gapfilled and a correction
    factor for energy fluxes estimating the deviation from energy balance closure
    is estimated and provided. The SLM001 and SLM002 data were collected over vineyards
    outside of Lodi, CA as part of the GRAPEX project, which provides water use information
    for improved vineyard irrigation management [5]. The flux tower observations were
    processed following the method described in Volk et al. [45] for gapfilling and
    energy balance closure correction. Table 1. Statistical metrics of evaluation
    of STARFM fused daily ET. Observation Average is the average value from flux tower
    observed closed ET (mm/day); n is the total number of observations; MAE is mean
    absolute error (mm/day); MBE is mean bias error (mm/day); RMSE is root mean square
    error (mm/day). The grey color highlights the method of best performance, comparing
    dual-pair and one-pair. 3.2.3. Land Use Map A detailed land use map for 2014 (CROP2014)
    obtained from California Department of Water Resources website (https://gis.water.ca.gov/app/CADWRLandUseViewer/,
    22 December 2021) was used for analysis of impacts of STARFM strategies on estimates
    of water use by different land use types. The land use survey was prepared by
    Land IQ, LLC and provided to the California Department of Water Resources for
    land use information. This dataset presents approximately 50 crop and land use
    types of the 2014 agricultural land use and managed wetlands for all 58 counties
    in California. Figure 3 shows the percentage of main land use types in the study
    area in 2014 from the land use survey data. The land use types are varied and
    mainly agricultural, except for urban areas. Rice, almond and vineyards are the
    most common agricultural classes in this study area, with another large portion
    classified as idle. Figure 3. Percentage of major land use types in the study
    area based on the 2014 land use data. 4. Results 4.1. Comparison of STARFM Strategies
    Using Synthetic MODIS ET Aggregated from 30 m Landsat ET The standard one-pair
    and two-pair STARFM and the proposed dual-pair STARFM methods were first evaluated
    by using the fusion methods to reconstruct ET images on Landsat overpass days,
    and by comparing the reconstructions with ET images directly retrieved from the
    Landsat imagery. To remove the impact of spatial dissimilarity between the Landsat
    and MODIS ET in the fusion process and focus on the difference in fusion method,
    we used synthetic MODIS images created by aggregating the Landsat ET from 30 m
    to 480-m, close to the 500 m resolution of the MODIS ET timeseries. We then used
    the aggregated 480 m ET as MODIS ET to pair with Landsat ET and applied STARFM
    in the three modes (one, both and dual-pair). The days that are used for this
    test are clear Landsat 8 overpass days in 2014, including Day of Year (DOY) 141,
    157, 173, 205, 221 and 237. To highlight the differences among models, Figure
    4 shows one example of the fused ET images from the different STARFM methods for
    DOY 205 generated from Landsat-synthetic MODIS pairs on bracketing dates or 173
    and 221, and also compared with the original Landsat ET on DOY 205. The one-pair
    result used the pair from DOY 221. All three methods show similar spatial patterns
    as in the original image. However, the standard two-pair STARFM results in lower
    ET patches in the northeast part of the domain, due to pairing with DOY 173 rather
    than DOY 221. Figure 5 shows histograms of average ET computed from all reconstructed
    images for each method in comparison with average directly retrieved ET. The standard
    two-pair STARFM results shift to lower values compared to the direct retrievals.
    While the standard one-pair and dual-pair method had similar performance, the
    new dual-pair method better reconstructed very high and low values of ET and compares
    better with the original Landsat-retrieved ET. Overall, the dual-pair results
    have lower RMSE and higher R2 comparing with the one- and two-pair modes. Because
    the dual-pair method outperformed the standard two-pair STARFM method in this
    test, we use only the standard one-pair and dual-pair STARFM methods in the following
    analyses. Figure 4. Reproduced Landsat-scale ET on DOY 2014205 using different
    STARFM methods comparing with direct retrievals of Landsat ET. Figure 5. Histogram
    of average ET reproduced using the three fusion methods compared average ET from
    the direct retrievals. 4.2. Evaluation of Time-Series Daily ET at Flux Tower Sites
    The fused daily ET over 2014–2018 from DOY 30 to DOY 300 generated using the standard
    one-pair and dual-pair STARFM methods, and using both Landsat 7- and 8-retrieved
    ET and only Landsat 8-retrieved ET, were compared with daily ET observations at
    the four flux tower sites. At most sites, the dual-pair STARFM performs better
    than the one-pair STARFM. MAE, MBE and RMSE for the dual-pair results are less
    than those for one-pair results for almost all the sites (Table 1). The exception
    is US-Tw3, where the MBE of the dual-pair is slightly higher than that of one-pair.
    Assessing impacts of Landsat image temporal frequency, the RMSE for fused ET timeseries
    using only Landsat 8-retrieved ET is higher than when both Landsat 7 and Landsat
    8 are used for both dual-pair and one-pair results (Table 1). This suggests that
    higher frequency in Landsat-like observations can improve the performance of STARFM.
    Although Landsat 7 has gaps due to the SLC-off issue, including Landsat 7 images
    still provides useful time-series information and helps STARFM under both dual-pair
    and one-pair modes. Considering the amount of clear Landsat observations is already
    relatively high, given the low cloud cover characteristic of the study area during
    the growing season, more frequent 30 m resolution ET retrievals—obtained from
    multiple Landsat-like thermal sensors [21]—could be even more beneficial for data
    fusion in areas with higher cloud coverage. Figure 6 compares fused daily ET timeseries
    generated using dual-pair and one-pair STARFM with flux tower observations from
    US-Twt in 2014. This site is planted in rice, with the early season peak in ET
    corresponding to a period when the field is flooded for wildlife habitat. Around
    DOY 100, the field was drained and planted in rice. Rapid crop growth from DOY
    130–170 lead to a second peak in ET. While ET estimated from both methods agrees
    well with the observed data, there are notable periods of discrepancy particularly
    when there are larger gaps between Landsat ET retrievals. Around DOY 110, the
    one-pair results show a quick drop in the fused daily ET at the transition between
    pair dates. In contrast, the dual-pair results are smoother and show a gradual
    decrease during this period, which better represents the drainage process in the
    rice field. Figure 6. Comparison of observed flux tower ET and fused daily ET
    using dual-pair and one-pair STARFM over the US-Twt site in 2014. 4.3. Performance
    of Dual-Pair and Standard One-Pair STARFM over Different Crop Types The performance
    of dual-pair and one-pair STARFM was further evaluated over the major crop types
    in the study area. The evaluation was conducted by reproducing Landsat-scale ET
    for the Landsat 8 overpass days in 2014 using the two STARFM methods and then
    comparing with the original direct retrieval of Landsat ET. RMSE for all Landsat
    dates from both methods are shown in Figure 7. For the crop types examined, RMSE
    in reconstructed ET from both STARFM methods is typically highest at the peak
    of the growing season, following the magnitude of the seasonal water use curve.
    Exceptions are alfalfa, which has relatively consistent RMSE throughout the growing
    season, and rice where RMSE peaks in the early growing season. The high RMSE of
    alfalfa is related with the frequent harvest cycle, which is difficult to reconstruct
    using either method. The high RMSE for rice in the early growing season relates
    to rapid changes in ET during the draining and planting stage of cultivation.
    Figure 7. Comparison of RMSE between dual-pair and one-pair for the tested Landsat
    overpass days in 2014 for major crop types. Comparing the results from the two
    STARFM methods, the dual-pair generally out-performs the one-pair method (Figure
    7) for all crops and most Landsat dates. The improvement using dual-pair STARFM
    is highest for corn on DOY 205 and rice on DOY 141. On average, the improvement
    is highest for corn, alfalfa, rice and sunflower, which is possibly due to more
    frequent change in field conditions (harvest and replanting, flooding and draining)
    or in water use patterns during different growth stages. There is relatively low
    improvement for grape using dual-pair, which might relate to relatively steady
    water use under irrigation. Still, even for vineyards the improvement in performance
    using the dual-pair method is demonstrable. Figure 8a shows a scatter plot comparison
    of ET for grape pixels on DOY 173 reconstructed using both fusion methods with
    directly retrieved ET. The one-pair method has a much broader scatter in comparison
    with the dual-pair method. From the box plots in Figure 8b, the interquartile
    range and 1.5 interquartile range of the dual-pair results is similar to that
    of the direct Landsat ET retrieval, but slightly lower. The one-pair results have
    a broader interquartile range than that of the original Landsat ET, as well as
    higher maximum and lower minimum values. The histogram comparison in Figure 8c
    shows that the one-pair method overestimates ET in the range between 5.5 to 6.8
    mm/day, while underestimating ET in the highest ET range. The dual-pair histogram
    better matches the original distribution, underestimating when ET is higher than
    ~4 mm/day and overestimating rates lower than 4 mm/day. Figure 8. Performance

    have multiple rounds of harvest during the growing season, which poses challenges
    for data fusion methods. Here, we chose one alfalfa site (US-Tw3) to further explore
    the capabilities of proposed dual-pair method with a phenology-dependent weighting
    factor. Figure 9 shows time series of daily ET from the one-pair, dual-pair with
    date-based weighting, and a change-adapted weighted dual-pair methods over US-Tw3
    site. In the latter case, the weighting factors W1 and W2 (Equstion (3)) were
    set to 1 and 0 prior to harvest and 0 and 1 after harvest, with the harvest date
    (165) determined from the MODIS 250 m NDVI timeseries. The fused daily ET data
    from the three methods have similar trends that generally correspond well with
    the observed daily ET, except during this period of rapid vegetation change. The
    Landsat overpass on DOY 165 captured the exact day of harvest, as verified in
    imagery collected by the Phenocam installed on the flux tower. The red line shows
    dual-pair results when both pairs have the weight based on date as in Equstion
    (3). This option causes ET to decrease too early, before the harvest event on
    DOY 165. The blue line shows one-pair mode results, which give an abrupt change
    at the transition between image pairs on DOY 162, again prior to the actual harvest
    date. Using the change-adapted dual-pair weighting (orange line), we can adjust
    the weighting factor based on the change of NDVI to more accurately capture the
    rapid change in ET caused by harvest. Figure 9. Time series of daily fused ET
    using different STARFM modes over the growing season of 2014 for US-Tw3 alfalfa
    site. 5. Discussion 5.1. Advantages and Limitations of the Dual-Pair Option This
    study demonstrates better performance of the dual-pair over the one-pair STARFM
    method for all the major crop types in the study area. The fused daily ET from
    the dual-pair STARFM method compares better with the observed ET than the ET from
    the one-pair STARFM (Table 1). Both MAE and RMSE of dual-pair results are improved
    for all four flux tower sites in comparison with the observations. Comparing reproduced
    30 m ET maps using the two STARFM methods with direct retrievals of Landsat ET
    also demonstrates better performance of the dual-pair method (Figure 4, Figure
    7 and Figure 8) for all the major crop types in the study area, although the difference
    of average ET from the two methods are small. The temporal variation of fused
    ET timeseries from the one-pair STARFM is larger than that from the dual-pair
    STARFM, while the dual-pair STARFM tends to smooth the peaks. The dual-pair method
    also better reconstructs spatial variability in ET across the modeling domain,
    especially in areas that are undergoing rapid changes (Figure 8a1,a2). The newly
    developed dual-pair option has built-in weighting factors that can be adapted
    with a coupled change-detection algorithm. For pixels that do not experience abrupt
    changes in land surface conditions between pair dates, the date-based weight is
    given to each of the dual pairs. However, if abrupt disturbance changes (e.g.,
    fire, thinning and harvest) occur, such as the harvest of alfalfa around day 165
    in Figure 9, the weighting factors can be adjusted to better capture this change,
    effectively decoupling post-change predictions from the pre-change pair date.
    This change-based adjustment of the weighting factors requires information derived
    from other satellite systems with temporal frequency higher than that of Landsat.
    In this study, we used MODIS NDVI as an indicator of abrupt changes, since the
    studied alfalfa site is large and fairly homogenous. In future work, we plan to
    integrate vegetation index (VI) information from combined data sources, including
    MODIS, harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) and Planet data, to increase the
    accuracy of disturbance detection for heterogenous areas. The dual-pair option
    requires two image pairs bracketing the prediction date and therefore is not suitable
    for near real-time ET monitoring where only one image pair from the past is available.
    In this case, a projection from the last available image to present might be accomplished
    by using a VI-dependent scaling flux such as ETo*NDVI, where ETo is the reference
    ET. Therefore, both prior time-series (determined by STARFM weighted dual pair)
    and the projected times-series would be responsive to changes in vegetation cover.
    5.2. Impact of Landcover Type and Patch Scale As demonstrated in Figure 7, the
    dual-pair STARFM method was found to outperform the standard one-pair method for
    all major crop types represented in the study domain. Characteristic water use
    curves for crops grown in the CA Delta region are given in Anderson et al. [18]
    (Figure 18). Relative improvement was strongest in crops with more compressed
    peak water use cycles (e.g., corn, tomatoes), or multi-model water use curves
    (e.g., rice, alfalfa). In general, the largest benefit of the dual-pair STARFM
    scheme will be realized over smaller landcover patches (well resolved at the 30
    m Landsat scale) that exhibit changes in water use with a significantly temporal
    pattern than does the background vegetation (dominating at the coarser MODIS 500
    m scale). These changes are not captured by the MODIS fusion backbone timeseries,
    and thus the STARFM downscaling weights evolve rapidly between MODIS-Landsat pairs,
    leading to discontinuities in fused ET on the transition date between pairs in
    the one-pair mode. Less benefit will be observed over landcovers where temporal
    water use is more consistent from the 30 to 500 m scale, such as in forests and
    natural grasslands. 5.3. Impact of Landsat ET Frequency Comparison between the
    performance of the STARFM dual-pair method applied to both Landsat 7 and 8 compared
    to using Landsat 8 alone (Table 1) demonstrates that data fusion accuracy is improved
    with more frequent high resolution samples. The successful launch of Landsat 9
    will certainly benefit ET monitoring using data fusion methods, especially for
    sites with sudden disturbance, rapid change, or persistent cloud cover. Incorporation
    of additional Landsat-scale thermal data sources (e.g., ECOSTRESS, VIIRS, and
    proposed SBG and LSTM missions) can also serve to improve temporal sampling of
    moisture status at that critical field scale [21]. 6. Conclusions Data fusion
    has been widely used to combine data with different spatiotemporal resolutions
    to obtain higher spatiotemporal resolution image timeseries. The one-pair STARFM
    method has been used to fuse ET estimated from Landsat and MODIS for simplicity,
    but it can result in a sudden change of fused values when switching image pairs.
    Here, we improved the one-pair STARFM by using both pairs of images bracketing
    the prediction day and developed a new dual-pair STARFM method. The dual-pair
    STARFM method out-performed the standard one-pair method both in point comparisons
    with flux tower observations collected in the Central Valley, CA, study area,
    and in reproducing Landsat-scale ET maps directly retrieved on Landsat overpass
    dates. The study demonstrates that the newly developed dual-pair STARFM method
    advances the one-pair STARFM for all the major crop types in this study region.
    We also demonstrate the value of more frequent Landsat observations in improving
    the performance of data fusion. The findings from this study can help to improve
    the time series ET estimation and to provide higher quality of information for
    water resource and watershed management. Author Contributions Conceptualization:

  description: In Australia, digital agriculture is considered immature and its adoption
    ad hoc, despite a relatively advanced technology innovation sector. In this review,
    we focus on the technical, governance and social factors of digital adoption that
    have created a disconnect between technology development and the end user community
    (farmers and their advisors). Using examples that reflect both successes and barriers
    in Australian agriculture, we first explore the current enabling technologies
    and processes, and then we highlight some of the key socio-technical factors that
    explain why digital agriculture is immature and ad hoc. Pronounced issues include
    fragmentation of the innovation system (and digital tools), and a lack of enabling
    legislation and policy to support technology deployment. To overcome such issues
    and increase adoption, clear value propositions for change are necessary. These
    value propositions are influenced by the perceptions and aspirations of individuals,
    the delivery of digitally-enabled processes and the supporting legislative, policy
    and educational structures, better use/conversion of data generated through technology
    applications to knowledge for supporting decision making, and the suitability
    of the technology. Agronomists and early adopter farmers will play a significant
    role in closing the technology-end user gap, and will need support and training
    from technology service providers, government bodies and peer-networks. Ultimately,
    practice change will only be achieved through mutual understanding, ownership
    and trust. This will occur when farmers and their advisors are an integral part
    of the entire digital innovation system.

    is considered immature and its adoption ad hoc, despite a relatively advanced
    technology innovation sector. In this review, we focus on the technical, governance
    and social factors of digital adoption that have created a disconnect between
    technology development and the end user community (farmers and their advisors).
    Using examples that reflect both successes and barriers in Australian agriculture,
    we first explore the current enabling technologies and processes, and then we
    highlight some of the key socio-technical factors that explain why digital agriculture
    is immature and ad hoc. Pronounced issues include fragmentation of the innovation
    system (and digital tools), and a lack of enabling legislation and policy to support
    technology deployment. To overcome such issues and increase adoption, clear value
    propositions for change are necessary. These value propositions are influenced
    by the perceptions and aspirations of individuals, the delivery of digitally-enabled
    processes and the supporting legislative, policy and educational structures, better
    use/conversion of data generated through technology applications to knowledge
    for supporting decision making, and the suitability of the technology. Agronomists
    and early adopter farmers will play a significant role in closing the technology-end
    user gap, and will need support and training from technology service providers,
    government bodies and peer-networks. Ultimately, practice change will only be
    achieved through mutual understanding, ownership and trust. This will occur when
    farmers and their advisors are an integral part of the entire digital innovation
    system. Keywords: agricultural data, data analytics, digital literacy, digital

    demand for food, both in order to ensure quality and quantities, has accelerated
    the need of industrial growth and intensive methods of production in agriculture.
    At the forefront of the new agricultural era, there is an emerging Internet of
    Things (IoT) market that is suggesting several creative solutions. Research organizations
    and scientific associations are seeking to increase their own scope and speed
    by connecting with IoT, contributing technologies and goods to a range of different
    agriculture markets. The IoT idea gained prominence in the year 2000, with the
    development of the Auto-ID at MIT and the subsequent market research reports.
    In IoT, these systems communicate, perceive, and connect with internal & external
    state embedded technologies [1]. IoT is widely seen as the next-generation technologies
    with widespread applicability across almost every facet of the market, with the
    ability to increase the degree of integration of end products, systems, and services.
    IoT technologies are ideal for a number of applications, including healthcare
    services, smart communities, traffic management, agricultural systems, and security
    facilities. ICT(Information and Communication Technologies) being integrated into
    conventional agricultural activities is helping to spark a fourth farming revolution.
    An important facet of technologies such as machine learning, UAVs (Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles), Remote Sensing, Big Data Analytics, etc. is having the capability to
    boost farming activities to new heights. A broad variety of agricultural parameters,
    such as environmental factors, production status, soil condition, irrigation water,
    herbicides and pesticides, weed control, and greenhouse output climate, may be
    tracked in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, and maintain
    process inputs. Smart agriculture and the use of reduced pesticides and fertilizers
    in crops will help to mitigate leaching issues and pollution, as well as the effects
    of climate change, in precision agriculture [2]. Burgeoning IoT technology offers
    many new solutions and further growth opportunities, particularly for novel ideas
    in the agricultural sector. We also benefited greatly from recent developments
    in communication systems and protocols [3], primarily on the lower layers, which
    is the physical, network, and link layer. Besides that, the protocols in the topmost
    layers of the network are critical for effective data exchange and gathering.
    There are many applications, procedures, and designs that can be used in the agricultural
    sector as a whole. There are several ongoing developments in IoT agriculture research
    that involve network engineering and applications, device design, security challenges.
    Furthermore, in several nations and institutions around the world, various IoT
    guidelines and policies have been adopted in agriculture. However, an impressive
    amount of research has been done on IoT and there is still a great need for further
    research on the topic in the agricultural field. This survey paper examines numerous
    challenges and trends related to smart agriculture. 2. IoT-based smart agriculture
    The IoT is reshaping the agriculture sector by providing farmers with a diverse
    set of tools to address several challenges faced by them on the field. Farmers
    can connect to their farm from almost anywhere and at any time using IoT-enabled
    technologies. Sensors and actuators are used to regulate farming processes, while
    wireless sensor networks are being used to monitor the farm. Wireless cameras
    and sensors were used to remotely monitor the farm and collect data in the form
    of videos and pictures. Farmers can also use IoT to keep up with the current conditions
    of their agricultural land using a smart phone from anywhere in the world. IoT-enabled
    technologies have the potential to deplete the crop production cost and increase
    productivity of the land. Some of the key role played by IoT in smart agriculture
    is illustrated via Fig. 1. i. Water management: A major challenge in greenhouses
    is determining the exact amount of water required [4]. To prevent unnecessary
    water use, smart sensors are installed and operated using a variety of IoT techniques.
    Water storage in greenhouses is achieved by the use of automated drip irrigation,
    which is regulated by a soil moisture threshold. Water management may be handled
    effectively via IoT technology by avoiding water waste through the use of various
    kinds of sensors. The sensors are used to monitor the amount of water in the tank,
    and data is saved on the cloud through a mobile application. Farmers may monitor
    the water level using their cell phones. The motor will operate automatically
    as a result of this technology. If the water level drops, the motor automatically
    turns on, and if the water level is high, the motor will shut down. Up to 50%
    of this water is lost in conventional irrigation systems owing to over-watering
    due to inadequacies in traditional irrigation techniques and systems [3]. To address
    this issue, smart irrigation systems powered by IoT assist farmers in avoiding
    water waste and improving crop quality via timely watering. Temperature and soil
    sensors are installed on fields in smart irrigation systems; these sensors communicate
    field information to farmers via a knowledge gateway. Weather-based precision
    agriculture controllers monitor and modify irrigation schedules depending on local
    weather information. ii. Irrigation management: It is in charge of anticipating
    the design, improvement, operation and management of irrigation systems. Tracking
    water requirements of crops based on gathered data and actuating the water flow
    in accordance with the anticipated needs without the participation of human operators
    is one of the objective of irrigation systems. It uses dispersed sensors to monitor
    different soil, water body, plant, and micro-climate factors. The irrigation technique
    (e.g., spray, drip, flooding and nebulizer) has an influence on how to properly
    monitor the water body as well as the actuation mechanism. Weather is one of the
    most significant variables in calculating agricultural water needs. The IoT will
    help to upgrade the new irrigation infrastructure in a more fascinating way. By
    tracking weather and soil conditions, a farmer can refine his irrigation system
    in a variety of ways [5]. Weather prediction data, manage and track the whole
    farm from almost anywhere, Ethernet, and WIFI are all exemplars of how IoT technology
    tracks irrigation systems. Smart irrigation systems driven by the IoT make use
    of field-deployed sensors to monitor soil properties, weather and climatic conditions,
    and agricultural terms for irrigation. iii. Soil management: Soil management entails
    determining various soil parameters such as pH, moisture content, and so on. These
    parameters can be conveniently calculated using IoT sensors. Farmers will then
    take measures such as fertilization, drainage, irrigation, and so on. Soil management
    assists in the discovery of the right plant breed. It also assists in the identification
    of fertilizer needs in the soil. It necessitates a low-latency network for urgent
    intervention. For both enterprises and farmers, soil monitoring has been among
    the most challenging activities in agriculture. There are several environmental
    concerns in soil testing that have an impacts on crop productivity. If these types
    of problems are correctly defined, farming patterns and procedures can be readily
    understood. Soil Humidity, Precipitation, Fertilization, and Temperature are among
    the factors being monitored. The moisture content of soil is monitored using moisture
    and humidity sensors. The findings of a soil testing research survey improve crop
    production and propose fertilization options to farmers [6]. Furthermore, using
    IoT technology to identify polluted soil protects the field from over-fertilization
    and crop degradation. Soil management protects and improves the productivity of
    the soil. Additionally, it lowers input costs, avoids pollution, and increases
    agricultural yields and quality. Prior to planting, the topsoil should be in the
    optimal fitness level for the crop in order to promote fast and effective root
    development. While each farm and crop has unique soil needs, there are a few measures
    that may help promote good soil biology such as: organic fertilization, soil analysis,
    proper tillage, measure for chemical soil protection, etc. iv. Weather management:
    Many relevant factors are combined to preserve and establish an optimal ambience
    for plants while staying under strict limits, such as airflow, temperature, ,
    and levels. This can be achieved by deploying an IoT-enabled ecosystem, in which
    smart sensors and devices exchange data for improved decision-making [7]. Weather
    have the greatest impact on crop production. Farmers can decide the best time
    for planting, irrigation, and harvesting using an IoT-enabled weather forecasting
    system. Probabilistic weather analyses were done using sensors in IoT applications.
    Farmers can learn about environmental conditions such as soil moisture, humidity,
    and air temperature by embedding remote sensors in the fields. Farmers should
    prepare accordingly and adjust the harvesting and irrigation period to boost the
    crop based on historical results. Farmers should take proactive measures to ensure
    a safe crop harvest by arranging and reviewing collected data. v. Precision farming:
    It is an IoT-based farming technique which primarily entails the analysis of data
    collected in the field in order to determine the most productive crop. Farmers
    gather data using sensors and analyze it for forecasting in precision farming.
    Farmers may use the information collected to schedule their farming operations,
    including what seeds to sow, how much fertilizer to use, when to harvest, and
    also what crop yields to expect. Farmers may also track the farm through sensors
    that detect moisture levels, crop output, and livestock levels with the deployment
    of IoT. The sensors can effectively monitor irrigation machinery from afar. The
    data collected on the land is analyzed by IoT linked devices, making data-driven
    decisions on resource allocation and crop harvesting. The conventional method
    of farming to maximize yield and preserve crops was focused on physical inspection,
    and if there was a problem, it was typically resolved after a severe event involving
    the farm, and it was performed on a trial and error basis. However, in precision
    farming using IoT applications, anything can be pinpoint sooner and behave in
    compliance with the collected data. IoT innovations are assisting farmers in increasing
    agricultural output quantity while maintaining efficiency, productivity, and cost
    effectiveness. Farmers will face a variety of problems, including water shortages
    and floods, a lack of suitable land for crop plantations, and cost control. Farmers
    can reduce possible missteps and increase returns by implementing the IoT infrastructure
    and associated technology. IoT-enabled farming allows farmers to make fast decisions
    depending on the circumstances. The use of IoT in farming would greatly improve
    operational productivity. For example: A precision agricultural practice is one
    that involves assessing a field’s inherent soil variability. When the soil in
    a particular region retains more water, crops may be sown more thickly and irrigation
    can be used sparingly. Alternatively, if the plot is utilized for grazing, it
    may accommodate a greater number of cattle than a comparable area with lower soil
    quality. vi. Nutrient management: Nutrient management entails making the most
    effective use of crop nutrients while also preserving the environment. Nutrient
    management is based on the concept of matching soil nutrient supplies with crop
    needs. Nutrients help in producing optimal crop yields when supplied in the appropriate
    amounts and at the right times; providing too little will restrict output, while
    applying too much will not make practical sense and may damage the environment.
    Nutrients that are not properly used by crops may leak into surface and groundwater
    waters nearby. For example, too much ammonia, phosphorus, or nitrogen may degrade
    water quality. Measuring the concentration of nutrients in the soil allows for
    selection of the best crop for multiple cropping cycles on the same land. Nutrients
    and technologies are critical for achieving sustainable agriculture while minimizing
    environmental and economic costs [8]. vii. Waste management: The Internet of Things
    (IoT) proposes a waste disposal solution. IoT sensors may be used to create intelligent
    trash cans. This could be used to read, store, and transfer waste-related data
    through a network. Governance of waste can be accomplished with the aid of certain
    intelligent and streamlined algorithms [9]. viii. Livestock monitoring: The growth
    of agricultural production to provide adequate food for the world’s population
    is becoming a growing worldwide issue. As a result, the significance of livestock
    management in farmland is essential for the survival. Farmers, on the other hand,
    are trying to maintain their cattle in the context of rising worry over land and
    water supplies. Apart from that, farmers continue to focus on reducing waste and
    lowering total expenses. New technological advances are critical in helping to
    enhance the quality and quantity of agricultural output. The Internet of Things
    (IoT) enters the scene at this point. It allows farmers to improve the health
    of their livestock via remote access and data-driven decisions. Cattle Watch is
    a system for monitoring livestock. This cloud-based technology is often used to
    remotely track the well-being of livestock and aids in the identification of livestock
    locations using communication and energy sensors [10]. This method obviates the
    use of an alert system. If any state goes outside of a predetermined parameter,
    the users are told by call, text, or email. As a result, people can view real-time
    information from the comfort of their own homes or workplaces using their smartphones.
    The IoT livestock tracking scheme entails implanting sensors in animals that collect
    specific details about their body and their well-being. Farmers may monitor the
    position, counting, and other similar details of livestock using wireless IoT
    applications. The real-time data provided by the livestock tracking system allows
    sick animals to be identified and removed from the herd, preventing disease spread.
    For example: Farmers can monitor their livestock’s cardiac output, blood pressure,
    respiration rate, digestion, and perhaps other vital signs around the clock using
    connected sensors. ix. Farm Management System (FMS): Farm management systems centralizes,
    administers, and optimizes a farm’s output and operations. IoT based farm management
    system automates the collection and storage of farm data, manages business expenditure,
    agricultural budgets, monitors and analyses farm operations and consumption. Smart
    farming raises production while lowering environmental effects, but this smart
    farming approach is only feasible with the help of FMS. For smart farming, FMS
    is an important component for production, planning, and decision-making [11].
    Farmers can track the entire farm with an interconnected FMS that uses Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSN), Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) modules [12],
    and a micro-controller to capture all of the data. On all sensors and devices
    throughout the field, an identifier is used to provide proper awareness of fertilization,
    weather details, automated buffer zone width tracking, and automatic information
    record generation based on daily farm activities. This data is saved in a regular
    format on the server and can be accessed for even further processing through a
    mobile phone or the internet. An automatic irrigation and control system [13]
    is used to maximize the usage of water supplies. In addition to the irrigation
    scheme, the farm is secured from pests and animals [14]. x. Tracking and tracing:
    IoT provides agricultural firms with helpful data to help them make better choices,
    such as organizing, handling, and communicating with business associates intelligently
    while saving resources and time. RFID and GPS are used to map the conditions of
    soil, air, water, herbicides and pesticides in a growing environment. Using wireless
    network connectivity, a GPS device is used to pinpoint the precise location of
    an agricultural areas and track different agricultural parameters. In [15], an
    architecture was developed to remotely track soil condition and soil structure
    in accordance with crop culture requirements. Through using WSN, ZigBee is linked
    to other devices such as CMS, GSM, and GPRS to track and acknowledge real-time
    data processing. When unexpected changes arise, GPS provides an interface to communicate
    with ARM (an intelligent control device to accomplish tasks such as SMS/MMS) and
    sends an alert to the farm manager, enabling the farmers to take appropriate action.
    Despite its high operating and maintenance costs, it is commonly used in agriculture
    because of its accurate positioning identification and control capabilities. xi.
    Crop management: Crop management involves assessing and recording the well being
    of a crop. Plant and crop diseases can be detected using IoT sensors and RFID
    chips. These details can be gleaned from RFID tags and shared across the internet
    by the reader. This data are processed remotely by the farmer, and necessary steps
    are taken. This will keep pests away from the crops. In agricultural sector, production
    tracking and prediction have played an important role in delivering benefits to
    users in order to produce valuable output while minimizing losses. [16] suggested
    using SVM to forecast rice production with the aid of a Chinese monitoring station
    for specific knowledge of geography. [17] has demonstrated an efficient automatic
    counting strategy for coffee fruit, which helps farmers schedule their agricultural
    processes and efficiently prevent risk. Neural Networks has been used to forecast
    crop production and analyze pest management in the context of environmental conditions.
    Analogously, the research scientist used an Artificial Neural Network to predict
    the current agricultural yield [18]. Due to the extreme changeover in spatio temporal
    and also its crop yielding task, the K-means approach has been proposed for evaluating
    the extreme computational measure. Crop production is fully estimated under various
    edaphoclimatic types of environmental conditions. The effect of numerous agricultural
    parameters within the spectrum of obtained loss by applying decision tree algorithm
    on grain loss analysis and prediction has been explored [19]. Furthermore, CNN
    [20] was used to recognize and categorize the generated drop based on an illustration
    of a vein leaf containing red, white, and soya bean. xii. Blockchain with IoT
    for agriculture: The blockchain is a decentralized ledger of transactions that
    all parties contribute and maintain. It offers a trustworthy source of information
    about the condition of farms, inventory, and agreements in agriculture, where
    such data gathering is often extremely expensive. Blockchain technology enables
    the tracking of food’s origin, thus facilitating the establishment of trustworthy
    food supply chains and the development of trust amongst suppliers and consumers.
    As a secure data storage medium, it enables the employment of data-driven technology
    to improve agriculture’s intelligence. Additionally, when used in conjunction
    with smart contracts, it enables payments on time to stakeholders that may be
    prompted by blockchain data alterations [21]. Table 1 highlights few recent findings
    and shortcomings of different IoT based frameworks for performing smart agriculture.

    agriculture This section of the paper gives an overview of different IoT sensors
    and sensor networks being used for making the agriculture sector smart. A sensor
    is indeed a device that monitors several parameters, such as pressure, light,
    moisture level, and so on. Most of the time, the sensor output is an electrical
    signal, which is sent to a micro-controller for the further analysis on a network.
    The development of simple to advanced sensors represents a transformation in the
    way we gather information, conduct analysis, and connect diverse structures in
    order to attain new ideas we may never before have conceived of. Fig. 2 illustrates
    the components and basic structure of a sensor node used for performing smart
    agriculture. An intelligent sensor node comprise of three components namely: Sense,
    Compute, and Communicate. The sensing component is responsible for capturing the
    real-world parameters such as moisture, temperature, etc. The computational component
    pre-processes the captured parameter value and the communication component makes
    sure that the gateway sensor nodes are able to communicate with gateway nodes
    and can share the information among them. A variety of sensors are available for
    measuring and calculating the specifications of a farming field. The underlying
    concepts of different sensors, as well as their corresponding requirements, are
    summarized below: Download : Download high-res image (109KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Components of sensor node. • PH sensors are being used
    to track the precise quantity of nutrition in soil, which is important for the
    stable germination of seeds and crops. The absorption of chemicals or biomolecules,
    as well as the speed or rate of chemical processes, are both affected by pH [29].
    Soil pH is very important because it affects biological & chemical processes.
    For instance, when pH is low, nutrition, growth, and productivity of most crops
    suffer, and when pH is high/optimal, productivity enhances. Many crops thrive
    in soils with a pH of 6 to 7.5, whereas others favor acidic or alkaline soils.
    For example: In soil management, soil pH acts as an important indicator for crop
    production, therefore its geographical variation must be handled to enhance precision
    management choices. • PIR sensor: A motion detector is integrated into the PIR
    (Passive Infrared) sensor, which tracks the direction of an individual’s movements
    in the field. Additionally, the sensor has a light detector feature: when monitoring
    an object, it converts rise in temperature to voltage for the purpose of examining
    crop production [30]. Everyone produces some IR radiation, with some emitting
    modest levels and others emitting high levels depending on just how hot they are.
    Two slots of IR sensitive material are included in a PIR sensor. Both slots detect
    the same amounts of IR if there is no motion in front of them. When anything hot
    pass in front of the slots, such as an animal, the very first slot detects a variation
    in IR level and produces a positive differential between the two slots. As the
    animal moves from the second slot to the first, the impact is reversed, resulting
    in a negative difference between the two positions. The PIR detects these fluctuating
    amounts of IR. • UV sensor monitors the intensity of ultraviolet radiation for
    optimal crop production [31]. For instance, while using Iot components for weather
    management, it is evident to notice that plants respond to a variety of environmental
    factors, including soil nutrients, airborne chemicals, watering frequency, and
    the amount and type of light they receive. UV radiation has also been shown to
    affect the flavor, fragrance, and appearances of food cultivars, as well as increase
    the terpene concentration of cannabis crops. • Weed seeker is a self-confined
    unit that is usually fitted with opto-electronic components for the purpose of
    weed identification and spraying. The unit is composed of an activated source
    of light and a specific spray sensor that detects chlorophyll. By the use of an
    optical system, the device is capable of detecting and spraying mainly weeds throughout
    the field. The service’s systemic application will greatly minimize herbicide
    use. As a consequence, only a small amount of chemical is needed, lowering the
    implementation cost [22]. While performing crop management, weed control using
    IoT in agriculture is a time-consuming and costly process. Precision weed management
    (PWM) is defined as the administration of the appropriate quantity of inputs to
    the correct target (weeds) at the appropriate time. PWM is centered on using information
    technology to make site-specific weed management decisions. The spectroscopic
    reflectance of the leaves may be used to distinguish between various plant species
    [32]. • Wind speed indicates the speed of the wind at the surface. It is often
    important to observe occurrences in a field, such as changes in wind direction.
    These sensors must be installed at an appropriate height based on the location
    of the crop [33]. The input on wind direction is utilized for weather forecasting,
    crop harvesting, insecticide spraying, and other agricultural operations. Wind
    speed is monitored using a cup-type sensor, with the speed related to the number
    of revolutions. A potentiometer is used to detect the direction of the wind. •
    Water content/Soil moisture sensors for measuring water content are used in a
    broad variety of research fields. The proportion of the quantity of water available
    in the test soil to the overall amount of the test soil denotes the soil water
    content. It is quantified by the variation in capacitance value, that is dependent
    on the soil’s dielectric constant [34]. It can vary from completely dry to the
    saturation porosity of the material. Since the measurements vary according to
    the soil condition, the sensor should be tuned at each location. This sensor tests
    soil water suction, which seems to be a substitute for the effort exerted by the
    plant root in absorbing moisture from the ground. It may be used to determine
    the amount of water contained in the soil or the amount of irrigation necessary
    to achieve a desired level of soil water. The sensor determines the amount of
    water and the degree of moisture present in the field. [35] describes the usage
    of a wireless moisture sensor to track the greenhouse irrigation method. Dielectric
    Soil Moisture Sensors [36] measure an electrical characteristic that varies based
    on the quantity of moisture present in the soil to determine moisture levels.
    • Temperature sensor monitors the temperature changes in the soil that have an
    impact on the absorption of nutrients and moisture. A novel sensing technique
    was developed to precisely map the volume of nutrients in the soil and on the
    surface of the water. A 3-dimensional crop sensing element equipped with photosynthetically
    active radiation technology can be deployed in any field area to measure temperature
    [37]. Ambient condition & asset monitoring are two significant aspects of smart
    agriculture that need temperature sensors. Ice wine cultivation, for example,
    is known to take place within a limited temperature window between −10 °C to −12
    °C throughout a harvesting period. The ice wine business requires very precise
    temperature and humidity for efficient output. Temperature sensors are crucial
    in almost all smart agricultural asset monitoring applications. • Gas sensor determines
    the precise concentration of poisonous gases in farmland, livestock and hydroponics
    by monitoring infrared radiations [38] There are a variety of strategies for reducing
    agriculture’s carbon output, but all of them require the ability to calculate
    and consider existing pollution levels, as well as track improvements. This is
    typically accomplished by the usage of gas sensors equipped with various analytical
    capabilities which could be used to monitor and log the quantities of , , or hydrocarbon
    gases. For example: monitoring is essential for the long preservation of grains
    and cereals. Variations in temperature and relative humidity levels in grain storage
    may be detected using gas sensors, which is significant for freshness and edibility.
    • Humidity sensor captures humidity that has a detrimental effect on plant leaf
    growth, and photosynthesis. As a result, this sensor involves measuring the moisture
    and temperature content of the air to indicate the degree of humidity [39]. Grofit
    offers a variety of climate control instruments that measure air temperature,
    relative humidity, and solar radiation. The device’s data transfer range is up
    to 200 m, and it records measurements for a period of 30 days. • Motion detector
    sensor is often used to locate the position of animals and fields; however, it
    detects the motion of an unexpected entity in the farm and sends warnings to the
    farmer, allowing for prompt intervention and crop loss prevention [40]. • GPS
    (Global positioning system) provides the precise positioning of farm, or livestock
    with respect to latitude, longitude and altitude. With respect to farm management
    systems, drones may be used, that can operate in tandem with sensor and GPS. It
    may be commanded remotely or fly autonomously using software-controlled scheduled
    flights in their embedded devices. Crop condition, irrigation, fertilization,
    sowing, plant enumeration, yield prediction, etc. may all be learned from drone
    data. Drones may be purchased and kept near farmland where they will be charged
    and serviced, or they can be scheduled for agricultural surveys (drone as a service).
    Following the surveys, the drones must be transported to neighboring laboratories
    where the gathered data can be analyzed. • Photodiode helps in identifying the
    soil properties such as organic matter and moisture content using light. It can
    be used by ray attenuation for measuring the soil-water content [41]. • Tensiometer
    detects the force used by roots for water absorption. It measures soil compaction
    using probes. Irrigation scheduling uses tensiometers to assist farm owners and
    other irrigation operators in determining when to irrigate. Tensiometers may be
    used in combination with a water retention curve to calculate how much they should
    water. The subtype of IoT sensors being used in agriculture domain is illustrated

    Precise data analysis is important in agriculture towards growing operational
    reliability and productivity. Based on IoT applications requirement, data analytics
    can be categorized into following types: i. Memory-level [42] ii. Massive analytics
    [43] iii. Business Intelligent data analytics [44] iv. Offline analytics [45]
    v. Real-time analytics [43] Memory-level data analytics deals with analyzing the
    data stored in some storage memory statically. Memory analytics contributes to
    the overall performance of a business intelligence system and offers BI users
    with quicker responses than conventional disk-based BI, particularly for requests
    that take a very long time to execute in a massive database. Massive analytics
    is also referred as big-data analytics. It is the delicate procedure of analyzing
    large amounts of data in order to extract information – such as correlations,
    market trends, and consumer preferences – that may assist companies in making
    sound business choices. While both business intelligence and data analytics include
    the use of data to uncover insights that help the company, there is one significant
    distinction to make. Simply stated, business intelligence is concerned with present,
    whereas data analytics is concerned with the future. Real-time analytics is a
    strategy that involves reasoning and statistics on data in order to provide insights
    that may be used to make faster, and more rational decisions. For certain scenarios,
    real-time analytics simply implies that the analyses are performed immediately
    on the arrival of fresh data. Image analysis has been widely used in agriculture
    for a variety of applications, including disease identification in leaves, stems,
    & fruits, fruit quality assessment, weed identification and irrigation. Lately,
    image processing and IoT have been used in agriculture to boost the efficiency
    of crop production. This entails the need for drones to acquire aerial photographs
    on a regular basis, as well as environmental surveillance using IoT devices. Numerous
    data analytics techniques have been explored in depth in [46]. Fig. 4 illustrates
    the involvement of data analytics in performing smart agriculture. This survey
    paper would not address these techniques in detail. We address the significance
    of data analytics in agriculture and how it can be used to assist in protection,
    estimation, storage management, precise application, and decision-making. Estimation:
    The IoT generates massive amounts of data that can be analyzed over time to determine
    current environmental conditions. Data analytics may be used to analyze data obtained
    from various forms of network sensors, and use intelligent algorithm to forecast
    environmental trends and have data-driven solutions. Even though IoT data could
    also be used to monitor different facets of a field, including irrigation systems,
    it also can be used to forecast and alert farmers about disease and adverse weather
    events, such as flooding or drought [47]. For example, in forestry, sensors may
    be used to detect fire outbreaks and forecast the area within a forest that is
    at risk of igniting. This knowledge will assist firefighters in implementing preventative
    steps at the precise spot. Another field of forecasting is early alert systems
    for natural hazards in order to enhance emergency response. Download : Download

    in smart agriculture. Protection: Landowners are often subjected to harsh climatic
    conditions, which may result in a substandard yield. Fortunately, farmers can
    insure their crops and livestock with the usage of IoT technologies. A sensor
    network can be configured, and remotely unmanned stations can perform surveillance.
    The data may then be analyzed in the cloud. The insurance scheme will have a notification
    device, in which adverse weather events are forecast and insured farmers are notified
    by text message. This encourages farmers to take preventative steps to safeguard
    their activities. An additional value of data analytics in insurance is that insurance
    providers have access to information from distant farms and may trigger an automatic
    payout through IoT digital payment services in the context of adverse weather
    conditions. This will obviate the need for a prolonged claim procedure in which
    the insurance provider visits the farms to determine the degree of the harm. Storage
    management: Agricultural commodities are often destroyed as a result of insufficient
    warehouse control. Although climate, humidity, and some other external conditions
    significantly influence food product, bugs, microorganisms, etc may affect the
    production of food products [48]. The incorporation of IoT and data analytics
    into storage monitoring systems has the potential to significantly increase agricultural
    commodity storage. Sensors may be used to keep an eye on storage warehouses and
    the surrounding environment. The data is stored and processed in the cloud. To
    change the environmental circumstances, a self-automated decision framework based
    on analyzed data can be used. Additionally, when severe circumstances are encountered
    or a pest is found in the warehouse, an alarm signal may be sent to farmers. In
    India, approximately 35% to 40% of fresh produce is lost following harvest due
    to a variety of reasons, like rancidity or pest. Although the IoT has the ability
    to enhance agricultural storage facilities, protection should be incorporated
    into those networks to deter commodity theft during rolling blackouts. Precise
    application: By using sensor data, it is possible to apply pesticides and fertilizers
    precisely to particular areas of the field, increasing production thus decreasing
    farming costs. Although developed countries have already implemented precision
    agricultural practices on farms, developing countries are starting to adopt the
    tech, particularly on research farmlands [49]. Consequently, the implementation
    expense, technology, and knowledge of IoT-based smart agriculture programs in
    different countries continue to confine their adoption. Additionally, since the
    majority of farms in developed countries are small-scale, most farm workers do
    not see the value in implementing such technologies. Developing suitable precision
    farming systems for smallholder farmers remains a testing and design challenge
    for researchers and designers. Another benefit of data analytics in smart agriculture
    is its use of directing machinery to specific positions inside the farm utilizing
    GPS and position details, thus growing farming productivity as opposed to human-driven
    equipment. This will result in time and fuel savings, as well as cost savings
    on operations. Decision-making: Making decisions involves accurate knowledge,
    which can be gleaned from sensor data. The vast volume of data gathered by sensors
    creates resources for learning to enhance decision making in continuously evolving
    environmental scenarios. These choices may be taken in the immediate, intermediate,
    or long term. When those requirements are fulfilled, the IoT device may make automatic
    decisions, requiring little to no human interference. These automatic decisions
    may vary from temperature regulation to irrigation system management. For example,
    in solar farms, machine learning may assist in determining the optimum condition
    for growing a specific crop by analyzing data from sensors measuring nutrients,
    yield, development, transpiration, brightness, smell, and re-transplantation.
    The amount of knowledge gathered from data analytics will also help administration
    and all stakeholders make better policy decisions; thus, it is critical that the
    data is reliable, succinct, full, and timely. Numerous strategic decision-making
    frameworks have been created to assist farmers in making rational agricultural
    and livestock management decisions [50]. The data analytics makes professional
    recommendations to landowners, manages pests and diseases, and makes recommendations
    derived from remote expertise control systems. Machine Learning technological
    farms: Machine learning (ML) may be seen as a breakthrough mechanism for machines
    to mimic human active learning, acquire new information, continuously boost efficiency,
    and attain unique development. On other side humans (in case of agriculture: Farmers),
    are masters at multi-modal processing and can almost immediately integrate incoming
    inputs into an hypothetical knowledge based on their experience [51]. In recent
    years, machine learning models, concepts, and implementations have been very effective
    when coupled with other agricultural methods to reduce crop expenses and increase
    output. On agricultural fields, machine learning technologies may be used in a
    variety of ways, including disease diagnosis, crop identification, irrigation
    management, soil quality, weed tracking, crop quality assessment, and weather
    prediction. After harvest, machine learning may be used to analyze the freshness
    of products (fruits, vegetables, etc.), lifespan, quality of products, and market
    analysis. The application of machine learning in IoT-enabled agriculture could
    be based on a variety of different machine learning algorithms, including Gaussian
    mixture models, Neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), fuzzy clustering,
    etc. [52] present an Iot system with a ML algorithm that anticipates climatic
    conditions for fungal detection and mitigation based on temperature, comparative
    air humidity, speed of wind, and rainfall; furthermore, [53] developed a mechanism
    for disease prevention and monitoring on cotton leaves in conjunction with soil
    quality tracking. In certain scenarios, where the machine learning based IoT model
    faces shortage of streamline flow of data, interactive machine learning proves
    to be fruitful. The interactive machine learning algorithms regulates the learning
    factor of the algorithm by involving humans as agents [54]. The farmers can play
    the role of agents in case of agriculture domain. It has also been presented that
    the intelligence of machines can be improvised by involving human(farmers)-in-the-loop
    [55]. 5. Smart agriculture applications, software and hardware In this section,
    we have highlighted few apps, software and hardware which are playing a crucial
    role in making the agriculture system behave smartly. The apps are responsible
    for collecting the data for further analysis. 5.1. Smart agriculture apps Following
    are some of the most widely used IoT apps in smart agriculture: i. Nutrient ROI
    calculator: eKonimics has launched a revised edition of its highly esteemed ROI
    (return on investment) calculator [56] which aims to assist farmers in optimizing
    yields and earnings. The most recent iteration of the calculator integrates spatial
    uncertainty, providing farmers with a more precise representation of predicted
    nutrient response in production-scale agriculture. Farmers are able to create
    more precise fertilizer application strategies as a result, optimizing the gains
    of farm inputs and therefore can enhance their profitability. ii. Sirrus: It enables
    collaboration between agronomists and farmers by rendering field data available
    and simple to obtain [57]. By linking to the agX framework, users and applications
    can access structured field data offline and exchange it with some other users
    and devices. The advanced advice editor in Sirrus Premium enables service providers
    to offer changes in the field or when consulting with a grower. Users may modify
    fertilizer application rates, costs, and overall product prices. Sirrus credits
    prices dynamically depending on recent or flat rate applications. After selecting
    a product, labeling and safety data sheets (SDS) are widely sufficient to ensure
    proper product safety and usage. iii. FieldAgent: It collects data to create stunning
    agricultural crop health charts, count seeds, plants and identify weeds, among
    other things. It is compatible with the majority of modern DJI (Da-Jiang Innovations)
    drones and takes care of all the flying specifics, allowing you to concentrate
    solely on the targeted map. It displays the comprehensive orthomosaics, plant
    species, weed positions, and precise Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
    crop-health items directly on your computer, along with position data to facilitate
    in-field scouting [58]. Task forecasts are given at the start of each trip and
    are revised as the task changes. Prior to takeoff, you can view and change almost
    any part of your flight route. Without regard for size, way-point, or acreage
    restrictions, you may fly vast fields simultaneously. When the drone’s batteries
    run out, FieldAgent would drive it home and drop it off where it departed off.
    iv. OpenIoT: It assists plant breeders in determining the state of various varieties
    of wheat by calculating humidity, temperature of air and soil. This enables farmers
    to forecast harvest dates, irrigation schedules, and nutrient requirements for
    plant development [59]. v. Farmbot: It makes use of open-source hardware and software
    for IoT in farming. It is based on developing an open source autonomous smart
    agriculture machine for the sake of mankind [59]. FarmBot assists customers in
    producing and growing their own food, developer Rory Aronson (CEO of Farmbot Inc.)
    said [60]. “It is something more than just understanding the origins of your food.
    Anyone who wishes to participate and assist us in building the future of agriculture
    has the potential to do so through their open-source technology”. vi. SmartFarmNet:
    It responds in near real-time to requests raised on time-series streaming data
    via sensors. It integrates non-SQL (NoSQL) and conceptual storage arrays. This
    arrangement manages (user, sensor, aggregated) data, and data caching. SmartFarmNet
    gathers, extracts, and aggregates data streams [61] from nearly all Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) system. For data ingestion, the SmartFarmNet gateway makes use of the OpenIoT
    X-GSN feature [62]. Wrappers are used to interact with sensors. A wrapper is a
    platform which enables the gateway to retrieve and transmit data from and to an
    underlying IoT system. At the moment, the SmartFarmNet network supports data ingestion
    from over thirty IoT interface platforms. vii. iSOYLscout: iSOYLscout is an intuitive
    field scouting application which s imply labels areas manually or using the built-in
    GPS when on foot or in a vehicle. The application can be used to monitor crop
    production, weed infestations, and any other function you want to track around
    the field. Each logged function instantly estimates the area. Interest points
    are denoted by a text tag such as ’Broad weed’. Additionally, notes and/or a photograph
    may be included with the point. ISOYLscout files are automatically imported to
    mySOYL, allowing for wireless and quick data sharing among field and office [63].
    Using iSOYLscout app, the farmer/user initially defines the region of interest,
    which may be scaled to include a single field, a portion of the farm, or the entire
    farm. For instance, the user may choose this based on the kind of data they want
    to collect, which may range from weed infestations to water-logging. Using GPS
    signal, the app will correctly record the position of these locations. Furthermore,
    the software has a manual sketching feature that could be used to distantly add
    a tag to a known place of interest even when the user is not in the vicinity.
    In any scenario, the app will inform the user of the estimated area and allow
    them to modify it. This is particularly advantageous for planning purposes. For
    instance, if a farmer has to establish a 1.0 hectare area of wild bird seed, the
    application will capture this and assist the farmer in properly establishing and
    recording the exact area. Along with regions of interest, any additional information
    deemed helpful by the farmer may be recorded at a particular location on the property.
    Users may create and modify a list of farm-related points. GPS data may be recorded
    automatically or manually. Free text changes of any length are also available,
    as well as the addition of pictures. viii. AgVault 2.0: It enables users to navigate
    whole fields with ease using an inspire drone [64]. The software enables the user
    to configure the UAV’s height, sensor settings, overlapping, steering angle, and
    survey region. The UAV is launched from the inside of the app, autonomously completes
    the preset path, and returns automatically. AgVault app helps in inspecting different
    areas of the field for analyzing the growth rate of crops, insect infestation,
    etc. ix. AgriSync: It helps farmers and consultants to communicate and collaborate
    on farm service concerns. Farmers may communicate with several advisors from different
    organizations in near real-time via video to send and request assistance. Advisors
    can monitor several customer requests with a console and remote video, which enables
    them to see exactly whatever the farmer experiences in real time. The advisor’s
    company will view open cases, settlement status, and farmer reviews in real time
    from a Web-based customer support dashboard [65]. x. FARMapper: It is a web-based
    application of the next generation that enables users to rapidly and easily create
    farm maps [66]. Your map is safely stored in the cloud and it can be accessed
    through mobile, tablets and desktop devices. You can view the farm project from
    nearly every platform that supports a Web browser. The app parses public land
    statistical data for the Municipality, Range, Segment, and quarter segment upon
    clicking on any point. It adds information to every clicked point and highlights
    the parcel. Using the app’s drawing tools, you can create custom polygons in no
    time. Additionally, the app assists farmers in maintaining information on water
    resources, easements, and cultivation. In FARMapper app., the different fields
    are clubbed in the form of maps which can be accessed anytime. Custom Polygons
    are in the app represents different field locations owned by any individual farmer.
    All the maps are stored in cloud and can be accessed anytime with a single click
    using the app, thus helping the farmer to monitor several plots easily. Fig. 5

    IoT combines robotics, drones, remote sensors, and computer vision with constantly
    improving machine learning and computational software to track crops, survey and
    analyze fields, and provide evidence to farmers for appropriate farm management
    strategies that save time and money. Table 2 discusses some of the well known
    IoT software being used in agriculture domain. Table 2. IoT software used in agriculture.

    it can link to several sensors concurrently. Additionally, the Raspberry Pi comes
    equipped with a 40-pin GPIO connector for connecting external sensors [69]. Zephyr
    Zephyr’s goal is to include all components necessary for the development of resource-constrained
    micro-controller or embedded systems. It is a small RTOS for connected, resource-constrained,
    and embedded devices (with a focus on micro-controllers) that supports various

    dependable notifications, and the vast Ubuntu community at your fingertips, taking
    the developer community’s preferred cloud framework to a broad variety of internet-connected
    objects, connected computers, and automated machines [74]. 5.3. Smart agriculture
    hardware In this section, we highlighted some of the well known IoT hardware being
    used in agriculture domain. The most significant hardware component of IoT could
    be its sensors. Power modules, radio frequency modules, and sensor modules are
    used in these units. Table 3 discusses some of the widely used IoT hardware. Table
    3. IoT hardware used in agriculture. Hardware Description ESP8266 The ESp8266
    [75] is a wifi module that helps in establishing wireless connection between different
    components of IoT-based smart agriculture. RTC module This module helps in setting
    up a real time clock. It enables the module to keep track of precise timings of
    any operation to be performed by the designed IoT system [76] DHT11 The DHT11
    is a widely used sensor for measuring humidity and temperature. The DHT11 temperature
    and humidity sensor is a widely used component. The sensor is equipped with a
    specialized NTC for temperature measurement and an 8-bit micro-controller for
    serial data output [77]. Additionally, the sensor is factory tuned, making communication
    with other chipsets easy. The sensor has a precision of ±1 °C and ±1% when measuring
    temperature between 0 °C and 50 °C & humidity between 20% and 90%. Therefore,
    if you need measurements within this range, this hardware might be the best choice
    GSM module It can allow SIM from any GSM network provider and can operate as a
    smartphone with its own specific contact number. The RS-232 protocol can be used
    to link the controller quickly [69]. PIC Micro-controller It is used in defense,
    monitoring devices and domestic appliances. Often included is an EEPROM that is
    being used to permanently store the content [78]. This can be used to store the
    data collected by drones while analyzing the farmland. LM35 The LM35 temperature
    sensor generates an analog O/P voltage equal to the measured temperature. It indicates
    the output voltage in Celsius (C). It is self-calibrating and does not involve
    external tuning circuitry. The LM35 [79] has a sensitivity of 10 mV/degree C.
    If the temperature rises, the output voltage rises as well. 6. Principal advantages
    of IoT in smart agriculture Through remote sensing, smart agricultural systems
    minimize wastage, increase production, and allow management of a wider variety
    of resources. In conventional farming techniques, the farmer was continuously
    out there in the field, checking the farmland condition. However, as farms have
    become bigger, it has become increasingly difficult for farmers to manage everything
    everywhere. This is particularly true in micro-farming, where many distant pieces
    of land could be cultivated for a variety of crops, each of which requires a unique
    set of circumstances and precise control over soil and water. Control systems
    handle sensor input, providing remote monitoring for supplies and decision support,
    as well as automating machinery and equipment to respond to developing problems
    and to assist production. This is not dissimilar to the success criteria for any
    other “smart” marketing strategy; a standardized methodology establishes the better
    utilization of resources enabling production process on the supplier side and
    for satisfying strict demand-side limitations. Thus, in a smart agriculture system,
    it is about controlling agricultural production and, depending on its state, establishing
    the appropriate growth factors – such as moisture, fertilizer, or material content
    – to ensure production of the desired crop. During production, it is all about
    resource management in order to optimize the growth process. Smart and precision
    farming methods, for example, focus on precise sowing using unmanned tractors
    to minimize seed waste and optimize plant spacing to provide the greatest potential
    output per acre. Another example is water usage, which may be improved by using
    precision water delivery techniques such as dripping or subsurface irrigation
    to decrease evaporation and increase soil moisture content by providing water
    only if it is required through sensors and automation. Overall, the whole procedure
    from farm to fork is monitored by sensors and managed by software which reduces
    overall costs, increases overall yield and supply quality, and ultimately improves
    the farmer experience. Following are some of the key benefits of using IoT for
    performing smart agriculture: i. Agility: The improved agility of operations is
    one of the advantages of utilizing IoT in agriculture. Farmers can rapidly react
    to any major change in climate, humidity, quality of air, or the condition of
    soil or crops, thanks to real-time surveillance and forecast systems. Emerging
    IoT technologies aid agricultural experts in saving crops in the face of severe
    weather fluctuations. ii. Clean Process: Precision farming using IoT-based technologies
    not only saves water and energy, making farming more environmental friendly, but
    it also reduces pesticide and fertilizer usage considerably. In comparison to
    conventional farming techniques, this technology provides for a better and more
    organic end result. iii. Automating sowing, irrigation, and harvesting operations
    may help save resources, minimize human error, and lower total costs. iv. Accurately
    monitoring production rates per field over time enables accurate forecasting of
    a farm’s future crop output and value. v. The Internet of Things will aid in the
    advancement of community farming, particularly in remote areas. The IoT can be
    used to encourage services that enable communities to exchange data, knowledge
    and increase contact between landowners and farming expertise [80]. vi. Smart
    agriculture makes extensive use of drones and robotics, which help in a variety
    of ways. This enhancements strengthen the data collection mechanism and facilitate
    wireless surveillance and control. vii. The agricultural sector faces a number
    of challenges, not the least of which is ensuring adequate productivity while
    still ensuring a healthy and nutritious food supply. Numerous allegations of food
    theft have been produced, including adulteration, counterfeiting, and artificial
    manipulation [81]. This kind of fraud is hazardous to one’s health and may have
    a detrimental economic effect [82]. Several of the components of food theft discussed
    in [83] can be resolved by the use of IoT technologies, including product validity,
    procedure integrity, individual truthfulness, and data integrity. The Internet
    of Things can be used to include logistical and analytical regulatory compliance
    for food [84]. viii. One of the alleged benefits of IoT is the opportunity to
    control equipment remotely [85]. The implementation of IoT in agriculture would
    enable significant time and cost savings in inspecting vast fields as contrasted
    to staff personally checking the field by vehicle or foot. Through using IoT to
    determine when and how to apply fertilizers or pesticides, expense and wastage
    may be reduced. ix. The adoption of IoT would enable new business opportunities
    through which independent farmers will escape the manipulation of “middle men”
    and establish direct relationships with customers [86], resulting in increased
    benefit. x. IoT can allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment
    to prevent fraud, expedite component replacement, and ensure routine maintenance
    is performed on time. 7. Key challenges & open research issues We have encountered
    significant technological advancements over the last few decades, and these advancements
    have impacted our daily lives. It is credited with making our lives more convenient
    by putting resources at our fingertips. Among the many innovations in progress,
    IoT, also recognized as M2M, has effectively drawn a large community (in which
    smart sensors gather real-time data and communicate with one another or with the
    internet in order to take appropriate action). IoT as a technology presents both
    prospects and challenges. M2M can be divided into four distinct layers. The first
    component is a sensor that collects real-time data, followed by a communication
    device that handles data transmission. The third computational unit is in charge
    of data analysis, while the service layer is in charge of performing any required
    actions. These four elements are largely carried forward to the Internet of Things.
    The following are the imminent critical issues confronting IoT: i. IoT standardization:
    It is a crucial aspect in developing credibility and establishing a market for
    a novel idea. The introduction of physical objects into the internet creates a
    number of problems in terms of the adaptability of existing internet protocols
    and applications to these objects [87]. In recent years, detailed study has been
    conducted to match current procedures and solutions to these artifacts. The IoT
    includes a diverse variety of heterogeneous devices; if these devices utilize
    disparate standards and protocols, achieving high degree of interoperability is
    challenging. As a result, IoT regulatory agencies such as the IEEE, ETSI could
    prioritize implementing a technical standard to address standardization concerns.
    There are continuing efforts to develop the protocols and specifications necessary
    for millions and millions of IoT devices to communicate with one another. This
    entails interoperability on technological, semantic, conceptual, and organizational
    levels [88]. Interoperability of syntax is synonymous with code formats such as
    XML, JSON, EDI, comma separated variables, etc. as common syntax for data exchange
    [89]. Significant research is expected to be done to promote open standards in
    order to increase interoperability across billions of IoT apps and platforms.
    ii. IoT data: Some of the major issues with data usage in smart agriculture includes
    data reliability, data uniformity, and data volume. (a.) Data uniformity: Agricultural
    data may be lost due to equipment failure or network node breakdown, post-processing
    errors, or pest/disease infestation. Due to the loss of a large number of recorded
    incidents, missing data results in erroneous calculations and degrades the success
    of IoT applications in agriculture. Several researchers have suggested numerous
    imputation approaches over time, including multiple mean matching, kernel smoothing,
    regression technique, and uniform kriging. (b.) Data Reliability: In agriculture,
    the primary cause of missing data is mechanical failure, electricity, weather
    conditions, mislabeled data, and computation error. Numerous implementations of
    data mining techniques [90] exist in smart agriculture, including crop safety
    assistance, irrigation prediction [91], and pesticide reduction [92]. In the other
    side, noisy and abnormal data pose significant impediments to the successful use
    of data mining techniques in smart agriculture. As a result, it is critical to
    manage noisy data using proven techniques [93], (c.) Data Volume: Heterogeneous
    data is another issue with data that arises as a consequence of big data’s existence.
    Agricultural data may be collected using a variety of different technologies,
    including monitors, drones, cameras, and RFID tags. Indeed, since big data is
    heterogeneous, we can employ frameworks that reduce memory requirements and processing
    time correlated with data analysis. iii. Regulatory issues: It is necessary to
    sort out the regulatory and legal structures governing the management and possession
    of farm data between farm workers and data firms [94]. Regulations can vary by
    country in terms of service provision [95] (for example, frequency for wireless
    IoT), technological difficulties, competitiveness, data protection, and security
    [96]. Different laws in different regions of the world can have an effect on how
    IoT is applied in specific applications, such as monitoring and agro-food supply.
    iv. Market issues: Agriculture sector has a very low profit margin, and as such,
    there is a need to coordinate the introduction of IoT-enabling technologies against
    the future benefits. As a result, we address market challenges associated with
    IoT implementation in terms of expense and industry awareness. • Cost: There are
    certain costs associated with IoT implementation in agriculture, which can be
    classified as setup and operating costs [97]. The setup cost covers the expense
    of IoT hardware required for framing a smart environment for agriculture. The
    operating cost is based on a consistent subscription to centralized networks or
    IoT systems that facilitate data processing, maintenance of IoT devices, and knowledge
    exchange, among other aspects. Additional operating costs include those associated
    with data sharing among IoT devices, gateways, and cloud servers, as well as energy
    and maintenance. While certain IoT providers offer free subscription packages
    with restricted features, the amount of linked IoT devices, and the volume of
    information that can be stored is limited. Increased features and facilities result
    in increased payment rates. • Lack of awareness: A significant factor impeding
    IoT adoption in agriculture is a lack of sufficient awareness about IoT and its
    applications, notably among farmers in rural areas. This is a frequent occurrence
    in developed nations, where the bulk of farmers reside in remote areas and are
    often illiterate. If human interference is unavailable, the farmer’s failure to
    use knowledge can be a significant obstacle. v. Security: In smart agriculture
    domain, IoT devices are susceptible to physical tampering, including burglary
    or attacks by rodents and livestock, as well as changes in physical address or
    connection [98]. [99] addressed different security breach cases such as Data Theft,
    SQL Injection attack, etc. at different layers of IoT. Physical components, such
    as sensors and actuators, are the prime focus of the perception layer. Accidental
    or deliberate human activity, malware, or crooks may lead physical equipment to
    malfunction. Consequently, complex and complicated algorithms are challenging
    to incorporate in IoT devices due to their restricted memory, connectivity capacities,
    and low energy usage. Congestion threats, DOS attacks, and routing attacks are
    all possible on the gateway. The protection and positioning of location data and
    IoT-enabled services used in smart agriculture are vulnerable to attacks such
    as system capture [100]. An intruder traps an IoT device and removes cryptographic
    signatures, allowing the attacker unlimited access to the details contained on
    the device’s memory. Such higher-level networking layers may be susceptible to
    denial-of-service (DOS) threats, jamming and man-in-the-middle attacks [101].
    Cloud repositories are susceptible to data tampering and unauthorized resources
    that may disrupt smart farming process [102]. The fast development and widespread
    use of smart mobile technology, and also the combination of IoT with corporate
    digitalization and automation, create new risks and hazards for Information and
    Communication Technologies security on the worldwide market. Potential cyberattacks
    on a variety of different smart agricultural systems may create significant security
    concerns in a dynamic and dispersed cyber–physical context [103]. These risks
    and cyberattacks have the potential to cause significant disruptions to linked
    companies. Additionally, in agriculture’s highly automated environment, smart
    technology and remote administration employed in precision agriculture and smart
    farming are novel to its stakeholders, with the majority of new risks in this
    sector being closely related to comparable concerns in other industries. These
    risks are mostly concerned with cybersecurity, data security, and loss of data
    [104]. Additionally, since the precision agriculture industry makes extensive
    use of heavy equipment that is linked to the internet, there are many new vulnerabilities
    that may have catastrophic effects. Table 4 lists out the different potential
    cyber attacks on smart agriculture. It is important to note that the majority
    of today’s smart agriculture applications are built on IoT technology, which means
    they may directly inherit their security issues. Security features are disabled
    by default in protocols like MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) and CoAP
    (Constrained Application Protocol), and the operator must enable it as per the
    project’s objectives. [105] demonstrates a system for predicting irrigation needs
    based on climatic and environmental data. The technology predicts soil moisture
    using sensor data and makes irrigation recommendations. A web page is used by
    the end-user to communicate with the system. In the gathering, transmitting, and
    storing stages, the article presents no security measures, authentication checks
    or failure diagnostics. Because of the absence of security, systems are susceptible
    to different types of the attack, indicating that the system is extremely insecure.
    Data corruption or inaccuracy causes predictions to be incorrect and decisions
    to be made incorrectly. Incorrect actions can undermine the growth and diminish
    the system’s acceptance. Likewise, [106] developed a system that uses soil moisture,
    light levels, humidity and temperature sensor to monitor farms. Irrigation can
    be controlled manually or automatically using web or mobile apps. The system description
    is devoid of any security mechanisms, leaving the system vulnerable to the entire
    array of attacks described in Table 4. Controlling actuators with instructions
    from a web application that lacks strong security safeguards provides an ideal
    chance for malevolent adversaries to manipulate the system via malicious scripts
    and illegal access. Similarly, for data sharing between the host, the gateway,
    as well as the nodes, [107] offer a smart agriculture architecture. The article
    presents the system’s architecture but makes no mention of interactivity or remote
    control, and it exhibits no security issues. The most damaging attacks, such as
    DoS, signal interruption, data transit, and routing, are those that target the
    network layer, since it is a data exchange platform. Some of the open issues [108]
    available for researchers include: (Malicious Scripts, Phishing attack, Deny of
    services) at Application layer, (Signature wrapping, Booting Vulnerabilities,
    Forged control of actuators) at Edge layer, (Signal disruptions, Data transit
    attack, DoS, Routing attack) at Network layer, (Autonomous system disruption &
    Hijacking, Fake node, Sleep deprivation, Node capture) at Perception layer. vi.
    Reliability: The Internet of Things devices are intended to be installed outdoors.
    This exposes the devices to extreme environmental factors, which may result in
    sensor deterioration over time and connectivity failures. Physical security of
    installed IoT devices and networks [109] must be maintained to safeguard expensive
    equipment against adverse weather events such as floods and hurricanes. vii. Scalability:
    In smart agriculture, a significant number of connected devices and sensors are
    installed, necessitating the use of an intelligent IoT management framework for
    the detection and control of every node [110]. Gateways and protocols in use today
    would have to accommodate a massive range of IoT devices/nodes, e.g., Sigfox supports
    nodes. viii. Localization: Numerous considerations must be weighed when deploying
    IoT systems. These considerations include the IoT device’s capacity to accept
    position and play capability, i.e., to be installed anywhere and linked to the
    remainder of the globe without requiring any (or minimal) modification or the
    deployment of external hardware, such as gateways. Other considerations include
    the optimal location for the IoT system to have sufficient knowledge and reliability
    without creating disturbance [111]. ix. Networking issue: Smart agriculture presents
    a difficult communication challenge between various sensor nodes [112]. Sensors
    conduct large computations that consume energy, but sensor batteries have a limited
    capacity. As a result, networks need effective energy storage. These problems
    do not occur just at the hardware implementation stage, yet even at its network
    layer. Wireless connectivity [113] is critical for the implementation of smart
    agriculture owing to the uptick expense of wiring. Physical implementation demonstrates
    that the efficiency of approved transceivers is exaggerated by the proximity of
    humans, temperature, moisture, and a variety of other obstacles inside the region
    in which a wireless system or node wishes to interact. As a result, the most effective
    and stable technology can be used to transmit data in view of environmental problems
    and rural environments [114]. A thorough review of the problems and issues associated
    with IoT-based smart agriculture connectivity is offered in [115]. x. Resource
    optimization: Farm owners require a resource optimization process to decide the
    optimal number of gateways, IoT devices, communicated data and cloud storage required
    to achieve an advancement in profitability. This is made more difficult by the
    fact that various farms have varying sizes and need varying types of sensors to
    detect farm variables for certain crops or livestock [116]. This will necessitate
    the implementation of sophisticated algorithms and statistical models capable
    of determining the optimum resource distribution while mitigating costs and optimizing
    agricultural production and income. After setting different prospects for prolonged
    research efforts, most IoT applications in themselves enable to identify difficulties
    for research and development to get a dependable as well as viable solution. The
    roadmap was drawn up by correctly identifying the research goals and objectives
    based on an assessment of the following criteria: (i) Thorough apprehension of
    the Smart-IoT architecture, (ii) Appropriate establishment of constraint free
    communication interface in the network minimizing the cost and maximizing the
    heterogeneity, (iii) Correct recognition and subsequent signal processing of incoming
    data when items are synced via the Internet via communication devices, there is
    a tremendous data generation. Therefore, correct management of collaborative data
    sharing is one of the top-priority, (iv) Standards should be developed to enable
    a broad variety of applications and meet common criteria for all potential IoT
    Smart-agriculture applications. Table 4. Different security concerns and attacks

    Cyber Terrorism, Cloud computing attack As IoT primarily develops via synchronization
    of internet devices, steady progress in all domains, from time to time, attracts
    critical concerns, along with updates, that cannot be neglected or disregarded.
    Over the last several years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has made great strides.
    The resources accessible beneath the hood of IoT have run out, and current situations
    have prompted a slew of questions that must be addressed in some manner before
    expanding to newer dimensions. In light of the ever-expanding scope of the IoT,
    several future-related questions have been raised that must be answered before
    we enter a new horizon of performing smart-agriculture. – Would there be any next
    major step in properly identifying and managing the vast array of sensors being
    introduced to setup smart environment for agriculture? – How will the future generation
    of smart-agriculture systems operate in tandem with IoT, especially when technological
    advances is not incessant? – Safeguarding of electrical circuits in IoT system
    against specific environmental conditions such as fire, heavy rain, winds, excessive
    humidity, etc. Different IoT systems for performing smart-agriculture has been
    proposed by several researchers, but crop residue remains a major environmental
    concern. To address this issue [117], we could indeed develop an IoT system infused
    with biotechnology that can assist in gathering data (which would include climate
    factors for growing bacteria and fungi for various sites and croplands) to solve
    the crop residue problem as well as provide a remedy to biodegrade the residue.
    8. Conclusion and future trends IoT has expanded steadily in last few years and
    a variety of IoT-based frameworks have been formulated in a variety of domains,
    most notably in agriculture. This review article discussed the prevailing state
    of the IoT in agriculture by reviewing key works of literature, analyzing current
    IoT research trends, and investigating common IoT sensors, devices, agriculture
    APPs, benefits & challenges, and analytics in IoT-based agricultural production.
    Despite of many challenges, IoT is an innovative breakthrough with a predicted
    exponential rate of growth of 27.1 billion connected components by 2021. Via its
    ubiquitous internet networking, it links diverse gadgets, devices, and individuals.
    The upcoming studies, inventions, and initiatives mostly in field of IoT-based
    smart agriculture would improve the quality of living for farmers and result in
    significant improvements in the agricultural sector. However, a variety of questions
    remain unresolved in order to make things sustainable for small and medium-scale
    growers. Security and expense are critical considerations. As competitiveness
    in agriculture intensifies and beneficial policies are adopted, it is projected
    that the increasing adoption of IoT for framing a smart agricultural environment
    will increase proportionately. Some of the future trends of smart agriculture
    includes: construction of generic platform for all sort of crops and livestock,
    QoS (Quality of Service), usage of explainable artificial intelligence to monitor
    crop growth and disease control, Policies standardization, other technological
    and deployment advancements. Explainable AI [51] is one of the major necessity
    in most of the domains for understanding the reasons behind any specific decision.
    It fades away the traditional black box concept of machine learning and enables
    the farmers/users in understanding the factors behind the obtained solution. CRediT

  description: '[Background] In the context of global freshwater shortage, the search
    for alternative water sources has attracted wide attention from researchers around
    the world, the brackish water is widely distributed and abundant, as an important
    supplement and alternative resource for freshwater, getting high attention. The
    rational utilization of brackish water can not only solve the shortage of water
    resources, increase the irrigation guarantee rate, but also improve the problem
    of reducing farmers蒺production due to the deterioration of soil and water ecological
    environment. [ Methods] This study is based on the CNKI and Web of Science core
    database, using CiteSpace bibliometrics software to analyze literature on agricultural
    brackish water irrigation, aiming at visual presentation of the research authors,
    institutions, research fields and key words of agricultural brackish water irrigation,
    the knowledge structure of current international research, as well as research
    hotspots and regions, were more clearly obtained, aiming to reveal the development
    and research frontier of agricultural brackish water irrigation. [Results] 1)
    From 1999 to 2019, the number of publications related to agricultural brackish
    water irrigation fluctuated and increased, and a core author group composed of
    YANG Jinsong, WANG Quanjiu and LI Peiyue and HUO Zailin was formed; various research
    institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xinjiang Agricultural University,
    China Agricultural University, and University of California Riverside, and other
    research institutions with a high number of publications, the core author group
    and various institutions mainly existed in small teams and distributed. 2) At
    present, domestic and foreign research on agricultural brackish water irrigation
    mainly focuses on agricultural basic science, physical geography and surveying
    and mapping, crops, agricultural engineering, water resources, environmental science
    and ecology, agronomy and other disciplines. The research on the interoperability
    of knowledge content among various disciplines is related to salt water. 3) Research
    on the internal mechanism of brackish water irrigation methods on soil water and
    salt transport, research on crop growth and development, research on desalination
    strategies, improvement of salt accumulation, etc., and the construction of different
    detection methods (models, stable isotopes) may become a new research hotspot
    in recent years. [ Conculsions] Water shortage is one of the main factors leading
    to soil cracking and ecologically environmental deterioration in arid and semi
    鄄 arid areas, which restricts the development of global economy. Therefore, by
    summarizing and analyzing the hot issues and future trends of agricultural brackish
    water utilization, it is helpful for researchers to fully understand the current
    situation of international research and provide theoretical basis for it.'

    (IoT)LogisticsReviewMethodology 1. Introduction As the coverage of the Internet
    increases, so does the number of physical objects that connect to the Internet
    [1]. The number of Internet-connected objects had reached about 12.5 billion by
    2011 [2], and especially with the advent of the 5G-Internet [3], it is projected
    to cross 25 billion by the end of 2020 [4] and 50 billion by the end of 2050 [5].
    So, the Internet-of-Things (IoT), has received a great deal of attention, especially
    in recent years, as it has led to significant changes from lifestyle to emerging
    technologies [6], such as Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication [7], context-aware
    computing [8], and Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) [9]. These technologies
    make it possible to identify, connect, adapt and localize, and track and monitor
    such objects [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15] as wearable devices [16], smart
    home appliances [17], intelligent vehicles and drones [18, 19], and smart applications
    for industrial automation [20, 21] and logistics [22], [23], [24], [25], [26],
    on an open [27], gigantic [28], self-configured, and dynamic [29] internet-based
    network. This improves productivity, accuracy, and economic profitability by integrating
    the physical world directly into computer-based systems and networks [1, 30] with
    no human intervention [31]. Hence, the applications of the IoT have received a
    lot of attention in such areas as smart grid [32, 33], smart home [17, 34, 35]

    systems [86, 87], somewhat reviewed by Atzori et al. [88] and Zhang [89]. Besides,
    increasing attention to the concept of the IoT has led to the publication of many
    other review papers in this field [1, [90], [91], [92], [93], [94], [95], [96],
    [97], [98], [99], [100], [101], [102], [103], [104]]. Despite numerous reviews
    of the IoT applications, a comprehensive review of its application in logistics
    is missing. However, all logistics functions, including the right goods, amount,
    place, quality, time, and price, can be fully supported with the aforementioned
    set of common IoT features [105]. Relying on these features, Zhong et al. [106]
    have developed an environment equipped with various IoT interface devices to convert
    traditional logistics resources into active/passive smart logistics objects. Despite
    this, while studying the features and state of knowledge of IoT-based logistics
    4.0, in line with the concept of industry 4.0, Winkelhaus and Grosse [107] lay
    stress on the lack of systematic reviews on Logistics Internet-of-Things (L-IoT).
    And this research is originally presented to fill this gap. 1.1. Research motivation,
    aim, and methodology The main motivation of this paper is to answer the following
    Research Questions (RQs), based on existing studies, select and evaluate contributions,
    analyze and synthesize data, and report evidences in a way that allows researchers
    to organize their conclusions about what is known and unknown in L-IoT. RQ1) What
    is the state of knowledge of L-IoT? RQ2) What are the trends in research areas,
    methods, and strategies, and what conferences, journals, and publishers have been
    active in the L-IoT over time? RQ3) Which aspect of L-IoT is practical but less
    understood? RQ4) How L-IoT can be categorized to highlight and understand new
    topics? RQ5) What are the future directions of research in L-IoT? Following these
    RQs, the paper aims to directly review and analyze 560 articles and classify 185
    of these papers that have been published between January 2008 and September 2020.
    To answer the RQs, considering several dimensions and categories, first, published/accepted
    papers are systematically classified. The papers are English research works that
    have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and conferences, due
    to the novelty of the term [108]. Doing so, the Google Scholar search engine is
    queried with the exact keywords as “logistic/s AND Internet-of-Things”, “logistic/s
    AND IoT”, and “IoT-based AND logistic/s” in their title. The papers are cross-checked,
    and their citations are also followed to ensure the reliability of the process
    of finding and selecting papers and the validity of the research. 1.2. Research
    contributions The outline of the contributions of this paper relative to the recent
    literature in the field can be summarized as follows: a) The main contribution
    of this research is an autonomous, comprehensive, and systematic review study
    that is presented for the first time on the L-IoT. b) This research introduces
    the features of the L-IoT based on the distinctions from the generic IoT systems.
    c) This is the first study to summarize the existing research and identify the
    conceptual content of the L-IoT as well as its specific architecture and provide
    a framework for classifying and organizing the concept. d) This study explores
    and analyzes the potential for future research and implementation of the L-IoT.
    1.3. Paper organization The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section
    2, special attention is paid to definitions and taxonomies of the L-IoT followed
    by proposing a general architecture for it. Some basic definitions about the IoT
    and logistics are also provided in this section. Detailed analysis and classification
    of reviewed papers are discussed in Section 3. Finally, the conclusion and current
    gaps analysis as well as future research opportunities are presented and discussed
    in Section 4. 2. Definitions and taxonomies Thanks to the literature review, the
    development of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) has first led to
    the transition from traditional logistics to electronic logistics and then to
    L-IoT. Benefiting from Third Party Logistics (3PL) [109], [110], [111], the first
    transition transforms the family business to an online logistics [112], and the
    second further transforms it into a cloud-based, smart, and intelligent logistics
    by leveraging digital sensors [113], [114], [115]. Since a system can be identified
    through the four corners of composition, structure, mechanisms, and environment,
    so following the definitions of logistics and IoT, the components and architecture
    of the L-IoT are defined and analyzed in this section. 2.1. Logistics The term
    “logistics” originates from the medieval Latin “logisticus” of calculation, Greek
    “logistikos” as “skilled in calculating”, ”logizesthai” that means “to calculate”,
    “logos” as “reckoning” [116], and French “Loger/Logistique” as “lodge” [117].
    It entered the English language during World War II in the early 19th century
    [117, 118]. However, it also existed in Roman and Byzantine times as a military
    administrative official called \"Logista\" [119, 120]. Hou et al. [121] attribute
    the beginning of the rapid worldwide growth of logistics to the study of the physical
    distribution in the American agricultural industry. More specifically, since 1997,
    with the development of such plans as the 2013 National Logistics Park Development
    Plan [122], China''s logistics industry has been increasing 10 times by 2016 [123].
    The reason for such attention to logistics is that it can integrate long-run decisions
    on facility location and fleet acquisition with short-term operations of the physical,
    managerial, and information systems to allow goods to overcome time and space
    [121, 124]. Although logistics management involves such short-term operations
    as material and inventory handling and communications in an SC [125, 126], there
    are four perspectives on logistics versus SCs as 1) re-labeling, 2) traditionalist,
    3) inter-sectionist, and 4) unionist. The first simply renames logistics to SC.
    The second positions SC within logistics, and the third claims they have some
    intersections, while the last treats logistics as a part of SC. Accordingly, there
    is disagreement about how SC management relates to logistics [127]. So, following
    the last perspective, this paper focuses specifically on the term “logistics”,
    about which recent research has taken two different directions: economic versus
    behavioral [128]. The former usually focuses on cost [129, 130]/profit [131] optimization
    through mathematical modeling [132, 133] or simulation [134]. While, the latter
    emphasizes the psychological and sociological aspects obtained primarily via questionnaires,
    interviews, and case studies [135], [136], [137]. However, despite the fundamental
    differences, both approaches consider Information Technology (IT) to be the main
    factor facilitating logistics [80, 126, [138], [139], [140]] in both its internal
    and external activities [141]. As the IoT is a major change in the field of IT,
    it is of particular importance for today''s modern logistics [88]. 2.2. Internet-of-Things
    technology IoT is a novel global Internet-based architecture that can specifically
    facilitate the exchange of goods and services [142] in logistics networks [143],
    which include uncertainty [144] and risk [145, 146]. As shown in Fig. 1, the basic
    idea of the IoT is to connect each object to a data network by assigning a digital
    identity [147]. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. The IoT architecture [148], [149], [150], [151], [152], [153], [154],
    [155], [156]. From the figure, the IoT technology is bridging the gaps between
    human, cyber, and physical worlds [157], [158], [159], [160] aiming at creating
    a worldwide network to connect people, things, data, and processes [161], [162],
    [163]. It includes anything in the physical or virtual world that can be integrated
    into global communication networks [164]. More technically, the conjunction of
    the Internet with the RFID and related identification technologies is the cornerstone
    of the IoT technology, shown in Fig. 1 [165], [166], [167], [168]. This is so
    important that some researchers, in addition to advances in wireless communications
    networks, have linked the success of RFID technology in tracking objects, people,
    and animals to the realization of the IoT technology vision [169], [170], [171].
    From a managerial point of view, the vision is the result of combining three views
    of \"object-oriented (sensors or smart things)\", “internet-oriented”, and “semantic-oriented
    (knowledge)” [88] through a network that performs its tasks through four conceptualizations.
    (1) IoT as the setting for liquification and density of resources’ information;
    (2) IoT as digital materiality; (3) IoT as assemblage or service system, and (4)
    IoT as modules, transactions, and service [92, [172], [173], [174], [175]]. Notwithstanding
    the foregoing, there is no single definition or understanding of the IoT and its
    inclusion [88, 166, 176, 177], especially in the field of logistics. It is due
    to major challenges still exist in the real-time information-driven logistics
    services [178]. 2.3. Logistics Internet-of-Things As aforementioned, one of the
    major applications of the IoT is in the field of logistics. The L-IoT is, therefore,
    the IoT system deployed for logistics applications. Thanks to the reviewed papers,
    the proposed architecture of the L-IoT is presented in Fig. 2, based on the general
    IoT architecture presented in Fig. 1. As a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
    [179], it consists of: 1) A core layer to perform cloud computing to manage and
    categorize the data received from the first part of the system, i.e. the first
    three layers, and prepare them for delivery to its second part, i.e. the last
    three layers; 2) Layers 2 and 5 to make object- and service-oriented interactions
    between physical and virtual objects, as well as packaged services and applications,
    and 3) The final business layer to manage the entire system. Download : Download

    the study (185 papers: 2008–2020). The first interface layer transforms physical
    objects into virtual entities to be ready to be analyzed and classified in the
    core layer so that they are available for the system''s various users through
    their applications by passing through the second interface layer. And, finally,
    the whole process is managed by the business layer. The inherent breadth of logistics
    knowledge, along with such a possibility of adapting to the growing concept of
    the IoT, has led to a significant increase in research on the concept of the L-IoT
    since its inception in 2008, shown in Fig. 5. Form the Figure, among the 185 papers
    categorized in this research, with a growth rate of approximately 1.76 papers
    per year, only one research was published before 2010 and most of the papers were
    published between 2011 and 2012, and 2017 to 2020. It should be noted that the
    reason for the slight decrease in the number of articles in 2020, compared to
    2019, can be explained because the initial search was conducted in September of
    that year. This is almost consistent with what is concluded in [180], in which
    39 out of 91 papers (43%) were applied and the rest were related to the theory
    of the IoT, and only 8 out of these 39 papers (20%) are related to the logistics.
    Since most of the papers, they have reviewed were published between 2013 and 2016,
    it is acceptable that the number of applied research works, especially in the
    field of logistics, was not large enough, because, at that time, academics have
    focused more on theorizing the IoT. Further details on how research works are
    distributed in journals (22.5%) and conferences (77.5%), mostly contain conference
    papers that are published by Springer, Elsevier, and IEEE, during the study period
    are shown in Fig. 4. And the growing trend of the journals that are interested
    in the L-IoT during the period is shown in Fig. 5. From the figures, as 2020 approaches,
    not only has the number of journal articles on the L-IoT increased, but the number
    of journals in this field has also increased by about 0.8 journals per year. This
    increase, while the number of conference papers has not decreased, indicates an
    increase in researchers'' attention to the subject. This is in line with the growing
    focus on the IoT and its applications since 2015, which was also studied in [180],
    [181], [182]. Because increasing attention to the use of the IoT in logistics
    cannot logically be exempt from the increase in attention in other areas. Download

    in this study, shown in Fig. 6, is further evidence of the growing trend towards
    L-IoT. The greater contribution of the IEEE and Springer to the published papers
    is not unexpected, given what is shown in Fig. 4. Because in addition to publishing
    journal articles, they are also very active in publishing conference papers. Download

    Now that the issue has been clarified, given the breadth of the scope of both
    the IoT and logistics concepts, it is necessary to provide an appropriate classification
    of the L-IoT to examine its various aspects in detail and answer the RQs raised
    in Section 1.1. The main topics, which include theoretical and empirical evidence
    on the applications of the IoT technology in logistics, can be classified into
    three classes, presented in Fig. 7, i.e. field of interest (12 classes), research
    strategy (RSG) (two classes), and research methodology (RMT) (three classes).

    Fig. 7. Classification of the l-IoT concept and the categories studied in the
    paper at hand. All research papers evaluated in this paper are classified under
    \"field of interest\". \"Research methodology\" is dedicated to the classification
    of research methods used in the reviewed papers. Qualitative research” works,
    which are largely exploratory, are used to highlight understandings of underlying
    reasons, opinions, and motivations to provide insight into the issue or to help
    develop ideas or hypotheses for potential quantitative research. “Quantitative
    research” works, on the contrary, emphasize objective measurements and statistical,
    mathematical, or numerical analysis of data collected through surveys and questionnaires,
    or by manipulating current statistical data using computational techniques. “Literature
    review” is a secondary source that does not report new or major experimental work,
    but contains current knowledge including basic findings and theoretical and methodological
    contributions to the subject. In terms of “research strategy”, a “case-based study”,
    as opposed to a “data-based study”, is an empirical inquiry that examines a phenomenon
    within its real-life situation [183, 184]. Based on the presented 12 categories
    in Fig. 7, Fig. 8 shows the number of articles in each major field of interest
    during the study period. Out of a total of 185 classified articles, 73 (39%) fall
    into the “IoT-based general logistics” category. This group includes studies devoted
    to the principles of L-IoT without regard to a particular field of interest. The
    reason for the large number of studies in this category is that the principles
    of the L-IoT, both academically and empirically, have not yet been sufficiently
    and fully explained. Download : Download high-res image (434KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 8. Research interests in l-IoT (185 papers: 2008–2020). The
    distribution of papers published during the study period, outlined in Fig. 9,
    shows that the proportion of papers published in the fields of “IoT-based general
    logistics”, “IoT-based agricultural, food, drink, and cold logistics”, “IoT-based
    intelligent cargo and objects logistics”, “IoT-based production logistics”, and
    “IoT-based smart inventory control” have strong growth rates, respectively. This
    slope has lower increases in the areas of “IoT-based electronic logistics”, “IoT-based
    chemical logistics”, “IoT-based green logistics”, and “IoT-based railway logistics”,
    while it decreases in “IoT-based emergency logistics”, “IoT-based military logistics”,
    and “IoT-based postal logistics”, respectively. Download : Download high-res image

    and strategies of the reviewed papers during the study period are also presented
    in Fig. 10(a) and Fig. 10(b), respectively. As shown in Fig. 10(a), the share
    of qualitative, quantitative, and review research is about 75%, 23%, and 2%, respectively.
    It is noteworthy that since Tu [185] has used both qualitative and quantitative
    research methods, to achieve a clearer and more accurate view, its membership
    in both methods is considered 0.5. To provide a more accurate view, Fig. 10(c)
    reveals the overall trend of the qualitative, quantitative, and review studies
    over the study period. As shown in the figure, from 2013 onwards, quantitative
    research works have received more attention, while the trend towards qualitative
    approaches, albeit with a low slope, has been declining. In terms of research
    strategies, although the share of case-based papers has been lower than that of
    data-based papers so far, the very small growth trend of data-based papers, compared
    to the increasing rate of case-based papers, shown in Fig. 10(d), builds a brighter
    future for case-based studies. This is also definitely expected due to the wide
    range of applications mentioned in Fig. 8. Download : Download high-res image

    analysis of the literature Based on the classification introduced in Fig. 7, this
    section is devoted to the study of selected papers and provides a holistic view
    of recent and state-of-the-art studies in the field of L-IoT aiming at illuminating
    current gaps and future research directions. Useful information about the classified
    papers is summarized in Table 1 to Table 12, in the order of their Google Scholar
    Citation Score (GSCS). In the tables, QL, QN, LR, DB, and CB, stand for “Qualitative
    Research”, “Quantitative Research”, and “Literature Review”, as well as “Data-Based”,
    and “Case-Based” research works, respectively. 3.1. IoT-Based general logistics
    Employing the RFID, Near Field Communications (NFC), and Global Positioning System
    (GPS) technologies, IoT technology can not only provide real-time visibility for
    operations but also create value for both consumers and providers on the market
    [186, 187]. It can optimize the business and industrial process flows based on
    big data analysis, leveraging smart tags and objects, and implementing ad-hoc
    predictive maintenance applications while delivering efficient logistics service
    solutions [188, 189]. This advanced system helps logistics service providers make
    timely decisions on how to monitor, route, and deliver goods to their customers
    [190], thereby enhancing their competitiveness [191, 192]. This is because providing
    autonomous and self-controlled transport of objects from sender to consignee [193]
    reduces the long response time in traditional logistics networks to several days
    for L-IoT [88, 194]. Such benefits have led many researchers to try to equip regular
    logistics with IoT technology, denoted in Table 1. Table 1. Detailed information

    are part of the emerging concept of industry 4.0 [269], [270], [271], and Industrial
    Internet-of-Things (I-IoT) [272], [273], [274], [275], [276], [277], [278], IoT
    technology combines IT and SC [279] to produce a higher-quality product [280]
    in a more agile process [281], by providing real-time visibility. It also helps
    manufacturers reduce data analysis and decision delays [282]. Because it provides
    high-quality information by enabling fast, accurate, and timely transfer to create
    dynamic control over production logistics systems. Therefore, the IoT can be a
    source of many effective changes in production logistics, especially on a global
    scale [283]. Because production logistics, in its intra- and inter-firm scope,
    accounts for approximately 95% of the total production process [284]. Therefore,
    although the high dynamics of production logistics [284] complicate its modeling,
    many researchers have researched IoT-based production logistics, presented in
    Table 2. Among the researchers, Tu et al. [283] and Tu et al. [285] have proposed
    a unified IoT-oriented modeling framework to tackle its dynamicity. They have
    used ontology, process analysis, and Petri Net (PN) modeling scheme to reduce
    the complexity of the IoT-based production system development. In the meantime,
    Kim and Sohn [286] have also introduced a control system for managing industrial
    machines, resources, and products through the IoT technology. Table 2. Detailed

    intelligent cargo and objects logistics Today, not only manufacturers but also
    the logistics industry is concerned about how to handle cargo. In response to
    this concern, RFID tags can provide and update freight information, such as storage,
    inventory, and delivery conditions, for immediate control, monitoring, and tracking
    through a network connection [299]. They can detect cargo to prevent displacement
    and loss, while weight sensors may also be used to prevent overload in vehicles
    [300]. Further, GPS [301] and Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) can
    be employed to achieve real-time tracking position of vehicles [299, 302, 303].
    However, the high cost of these sensors to overcome such performance limitations
    as operation in harsh and dirty environments with extreme temperatures, facing
    unmanageable data, the need for longer reading ranges, the diversity of the standards,
    etc., makes it uneconomical to incorporate tags into every retail item [304],
    [305], [306]. To meet this challenge, Oliveira et al. [187] and Oliveira et al.
    [186] have presented a low-cost RFID-based intelligent tracking system, named
    “SafeTrack”, to effectively provide route planning and cargo tracking management
    by using geofencing algorithms. Yang et al. [307] have proposed a hybrid cargo-level
    tracking system and other researchers have conducted studies on IoT-based intelligent

    control More technically, using the IoT technology in manufacturing logistics
    is based on the EPC as a unique global identifier of each product, which is used
    to track and trace products [339, 340]. Objects with RFID tags and unique EPCs
    provide information services to subscribers not only locally, but also remotely
    [144, 341]. By this means, RFID technology with the involvement of the EPC in
    warehouses can eliminate industrial risks and theft problems, improve productivity,
    and make products easier to track [342], [343], [344]. However, the use of IoT
    in large industrial applications faces many challenges such as security, safety,
    and reliability [345]. Therefore, although RFID tags can hold all the information
    about objects [346], they usually do not contain all the information. And the
    information supply is made upon linking and cross-linking by using an Object Naming
    Service (ONS) that is similar to the Domain Name System (DNS) [144, 347]. An ONS,
    as the middleware of the system [348], is a directory service for companies wishing
    to look-up EPC numbers on the Internet to instantly know the location, date, and
    time of production [349]. And the assigned RFID, just like a serial number, enables
    the company to have that number [350] to be used through an IoT-based smart inventory
    control system. In such an environment, Wang et al. [351] have proposed a digital
    warehouse management system. Alyahya et al. [352] have studied the capability

    With the development of e-commerce, logistics has attracted the attention of big
    enterprises [364], [365], [366]. E-commerce, unlike other industrial sectors,
    refers to the use of ICT for business transactions [367, 368]. Vendors, in such
    industries, should capable of achieving pull-mode delivery of a broad range of
    services and goods in acceptable volumes and qualities. Interplant Planning and
    Logistics Integration (IPLI) is, therefore, needed to link all Material Requirements
    Planning (MRP) systems via Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) to reduce information
    flow delays [369] and costs, while enhancing flexibility and efficiency [368].
    Because such information flow systems can effectively monitor online customer
    orders in a real-time manner, while guaranteeing products fast flow covered by
    a Time-Based Management (TBM) program [370]. And since the IoT technology is defined
    to do so, it makes sense to use it to aid electronic logistics, although there
    exists a limited amount of research in this field as listed in Table 5. Table

    projected to grow by nearly 14% annually in 2018–2022, compared to 5.48% in 2013–2018
    [378]. However, unlike non-chemical logistics, chemical logistics is non-eco-efficient
    [379, 380], flammable, explosive, toxic, and corrosive, etc. [381]. Therefore,
    its market is not fully standardized and despite its high cost, little information
    is available about it [382]. Notwithstanding, the IoT offers new opportunities
    for advancing chemical logistics to achieve better system performance in globalized
    environments [383, 384]. For instance, since energy consumption is so high in
    the industrial sector, especially in chemical companies, energy monitoring by
    using IoT sensors can be a good source of cost savings [385, 386]. Besides, in
    terms of security, the use of the IoT makes it easy for chemical companies to
    effectively collect data to allow them to quickly identify unauthorised access
    and prevent further intrusion [387]. Such characteristics, along with other benefits
    of using IoT, have prompted researchers to conduct research on IoT-based chemical
    logistics listed in Table 6. Table 6. Detailed information about reviewed IoT-based

    3.7. IoT-Based green logistics Since the consumption of fossil fuels is at the
    heart of logistics operations [393], greater use of these fuels, compared to green
    energy sources such as biofuels [394], leads to greater negative impacts on society
    and environmental sustainability [138, 395, 396]. Thus, the concept of green logistics
    has attracted wide interest [397], despite existing barriers, especially in emerging
    [398] and poor [399] economies. It is one of the most important approaches to
    environmental protection [400], [401], [402] by reducing energy consumption due
    to freight and waste handling, packaging [403], and transportation [404]. More
    specifically, the characteristics of green packaging such as size, shape, and
    material are of great importance in green and sustainable logistics [405, 406].
    This is due to their positive impacts on the products’ transportation [407], overall
    organizational performance [408, 409], and social factors [410, 411]. However,
    due to the need to upgrade technology, it may be able to reap the benefits of
    green logistics in the long run, but it will be costly to implement in the short
    term [412]. Thus, how to achieve green logistics services has become a hot topic
    for SC networks and the logistics industry [178]. And because digital, Internet-based
    logistics is also a major driver of green logistics [82, 386, 413, 414], researchers
    have turned to research in this area, whose research is listed in Table 7. Table

    3.8. IoT-Based agricultural, food, drink, and cold logistics Agri-food logistics
    plays a key role in the global economy [418, 419] and ecology [379]. It is usually
    done in large volumes with high delivery rates [420]. And safety, sustainability
    [421], short shelf-life time of the products [422], [423], [424] as well as high
    demand for traceability [425], [426], [427] and low-cost pressure [428], make
    it more diverse and difficult than other logistics systems [429, 430]. In the
    meantime, the concept of the cold chain [431] and maintaining accurate temperatures,
    as well as monitoring and mitigating risk factors during the transport of food
    [432], vegetables [433], and medicines [434] are of paramount importance worldwide.
    Since, IoT technology can provide significant potential in agri-food logistics
    by enabling the acquisition of real-time data [435, 436], researchers have researched
    the IoT-based agricultural, food, drink, and cold logistics, which are listed
    in Table 8. Among these researchers, Bottani et al. [437] have improved integrated
    food logistics, while reducing costs. Thiesse and Condea [438] have analyzed the
    quality of agricultural products by using IoT technology. Ko et al. [439] have
    proposed a framework for a cloud-based intelligent cold chain that enables users
    to employ any type of IoT devices including RFID tags, Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSNs), and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensor nodes. Tsang et al. [440] and Chen
    [441] have presented real-time IoT-based monitoring systems for product quality
    control and occupational safety in cold chains and fishery logistics management.
    The great importance of transparency and safety in the growing demand of customers
    [441], and the special need for quality control of fishery logistics from sources
    that are wild and vulnerable, distinguishes it from other logistics [442]. Donnelly
    et al. [442] have presented costs and benefits of implementing fishery logistics
    improvement strategies that have been experimentally tested on Italian fishery
    processors by Asioli et al. [443]. However, this type of logistics is long and
    sinuous, and due to the existence of different types of production and distribution
    chains, it is difficult to manage and track upstream and downstream compounds
    and their information [444]. The use of such modern IT as IoT technology makes
    such logistics more secure, reliable, and tractable. Table 8. Detailed information

    IoT-Based emergency logistics Regardless of the source of disasters, such as fires,
    floods, earthquakes, wars, or terrorist attacks, and infectious disease including
    the 2002 SARS-CoV, 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, MERS-CoV, Coronavirus disease
    (COVID-19), and Ebola and Zika viruses outbreaks [470, 471], critical situations
    are often associated with the possibility of serious loss of life and property
    if not responded to properly [472]. Logistics, consisting of facility location,
    relief distribution and casualty transportation, and other operations, has always
    been considered an important factor in emergency response operations [473]. Today,
    emergency logistics is of increasing concern due to the occurrence of several
    man-made natural disasters [474, 475] and epidemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic
    [476]. More specifically, it is estimated that about 75,000 people are killed
    in more than 500 disasters each year and the lives of more than 200 million others
    are affected [116]. And from the beginning of the outbreak until September 22,
    2020, approximately 962,000 deaths from the COVID-19 have been reported to the
    World Health Organization (WHO) [477]. Planning, managing, and controlling the
    flow of resources is critical to help people in such situations [478]. Main challenges
    to emergency logistics planning compared to regular businesses logistics are highlighted
    by Balcik and Beamon [479], Sheu [478], and Caunhye et al. [480] as 1) additional
    uncertainties, 2) complex communication and coordination, 3) harder-to-achieve
    efficient and timely delivery, and 4) limited resources. Accordingly, the emergency
    response operations need the help of a wide range of organizations, including
    firefighting, police forces, ambulance services, local or national public sectors,
    and humanitarian aid organizations. Because it involves providing large quantities
    of rescue equipment, vehicles, and on-site staff as well as food, medicine, and
    essential goods for life [481]. In such situations, information and resource sharing
    becomes much more crucial [482]. And IoT and RFID technologies can empower flexible
    information and resource sharing as well as enhanced collaborations [472, 483,
    484]. In addition, such technologies can also be used to predict disasters to
    prevent the occurrence of accidents and to support evacuation or attention in
    case of emergencies [485], [486], [487], [488]. Such benefits have led scholars
    to try to equip emergencyies logistics with IoT technology. The corresponding
    research are listed in Table 9. Table 9. Detailed discussion about reviewed IoT-based

    initial study of military logistics by Antoine-Henri Jomini, in 1838 [120, 491,
    492], military logistics has become a determining factor in the overall outcome
    of wars [119, 493]. Although military logistics is similar to regular business
    logistics in terms of suppliers, procurement, manufacturing, order management,
    transportation, warehousing, and customers (soldiers), the key to their success
    is not the same. Lenzini [494] has claimed that customers need, information and
    communications technologies, deployment within and outside the continental United
    States, joint interoperability, department of defense regulations, environmental
    concerns (to include enemy forces), and mission requirements are the important
    success factors for the United States Army. In addition to the existence of non-profit
    organizations in military logistics [495], the presence of army retrogrades equipment
    for maintenance and retrograde personnel for medical care are the other differences
    between military logistics and regular business logistics. There are some other
    differences in the external factors including joint interoperability among the
    services’ command, control, computer, communications, and intelligence systems,
    deployment of forces, and soldier and mission requirements [496]. As can be seen,
    one of the vital factors for establishing a good military logistics system is
    the ability to achieve proper communication, which can be well-defined by using
    IoT technology. Notwithstanding, there is a gap in military logistics literature
    about the potential of emerging technologies, including AI and ML, robotics, additive
    manufacturing, blockchain, alternative energy technologies, and the IoT [497].
    Therefore, some research works on the use of IoT technology in military logistics
    has been conducted, which are listed in Table 10. Table 10. Detailed information

    logistics Compared to regular business logistics, efficient mail delivery through
    postal logistics requires a complex transportation network that encompasses a
    large amount of data. The network involves several functional sites with a hybrid
    hub-and-spoke structure, including several delivery and pickup stations, and multiple
    mail processing and exchange centers. Therefore, designing an efficient postal
    logistics network has become a very important issue, despite the special difficulties
    in working with texts and a great variety of letters [504]. The existence of big
    data due to increased storage capacity and speed of computing and communication
    has made cloud computing and IoT technology suitable methods to deal with such
    difficulties [505], [506], [507]. The Internet of Postal Things (IoPT) has then
    emerged as a network of autonomous sensors attached to different parts of the
    mail infrastructure, including mailboxes, delivery vans, sorting machines, and
    individual mail pieces [508], [509], [510]. However, how to use RFID technology
    to manage parcel processing [511] and how to accurately computerize, characterize,
    and standardize such a highly dynamic logistics network are still unclear. Because
    optimality [504, 512] and accuracy [513] are very important issues in postal logistics.
    Although the use of IoT technology allows these features to be achieved at a reasonable
    cost and with the highest accuracy, little research has been done so far (see
    Table 11), while some research has been done on the compatibility of RFID technology
    with postal logistics [513], [514], [515]. Table 11. Detailed information about

    requirements [517] in line with the criticality of real-time monitoring, especially
    in high-speed railway networks of such large countries as China [518], Russia,
    and the USA as well as the European Union [519] have led to the development of
    IoT technology in railway logistics [517, 520]. Because proper ICT can enable
    a railway logistics organization to achieve a rapid response to logistics demand
    based on the optimization of existing rail transportation and the integration
    of resources and costs [521]. In the meantime, the intelligent identification
    system of railway logistics is more readable, more recognizable, locatable, more
    addressable, and more controllable via the RFID and IoT technology [522]. However,
    although the RFID technology has become more attractive in railway logistics,
    information collision is inevitable. Conflict of tags, as a multi-channel access
    problem, excessive goods, and dynamic changes are also denoted as the essential
    challenges of the railway RFID-based logistics. However, by using cloud computing
    technology, such issues can be resolved by further developing the IoT technology
    in railway logistics, which are studied in some research papers listed in Table

    research provides a systematic review of L-IoT studies. The main definitions and
    concepts related to logistics along with the definitions, concepts, and proposed
    architecture of L-IoT and its distinctive and special features in accordance with
    the architecture and features of the IoT are presented in this paper. The main
    theoretical contribution of the paper is to identify and guide future research
    in the field of L-IoT, which is presented using comprehensive and critical analysis
    of the literature. By carefully reviewing journal and conference papers, the findings
    are discussed and critically synthesized as follows: a) Employing quantitative
    research methods. A major research opportunity can be deduced from Fig. 10(a)
    and Fig. 10(c). From Fig. 10(a), only a handful of research papers have attempted
    to use quantitative approaches to address L-IoT issues. It is while Fig. 10(c)
    reveals that quantitative approaches have attracted a lot of interest compared
    to the decreasing trend of qualitative approaches. Quantitative research is confirmatory,
    while qualitative research is exploratory in nature [184]. So, based on the research
    done in this paper, since the applicability and usefulness of the IoT in relation
    to the logistics concept is undeniable [262], it is time to switch from the exploratory
    research to the conformity one to address L-IoT issues. b) Focusing on mathematical
    approaches for optimally modeling and designing IoT-based systems. Although Tu
    et al. [283] and Tu et al. [285] have taken effective steps to use mathematical
    optimization in IoT-based production logistics, further efforts are still needed.
    Because since mathematical optimization techniques evaluate only a few designs,
    they can improve IoT performance not only in terms of logistic decision making
    but in all its applications by reducing the computational time of achieving optimal
    design [140, [528], [529], [530]]. And that is why the use of optimization approaches
    has become more acceptable, especially in recent years [531]. In this regard,
    the combination of IoT technology with data access networks, GIS, combinatorial
    optimization, and electrical engineering to improve urban management systems has
    been practically studied in [532]. And Yaghmaee Moghaddam et al. [533] and Golpîra
    and Bahramara [39] have optimized energy consumption by using cloud-based optimization
    approaches. However, research on the integration of mathematical modeling and
    optimization approaches in L-IoT and the development of user-friendly decision
    support systems with the ability to use these models is still very rare. Thus,
    how to build IoT-based decision support systems as well as mathematical models
    to optimally support the L-IoT, and how to solve models have become important
    potentials for future research. c) Developing tools to deal with sources of uncertainty.
    Working and investing in the IoT can, on the one hand, be difficult and fraught
    with technical uncertainty and high risk, which should be addressed to increase
    its trustworthiness and acceptability [506], especially in RFID-based pharmaceutical
    logistics [534]. The IoT, on the other hand, can reduce risk and uncertainty by
    monitoring and managing misjudgment resulting from uncertainty [82, 535]. Therefore,
    the development of methods and tools to manage this contradiction can be good
    research potential in both investment and operation phases. In this regard, due
    to the seriousness of uncertainty, more attention to robust optimization techniques
    seems more reasonable than other mathematical optimization approaches. d) Using
    a case-based research strategy. The other major research opportunity can be conducted
    from Fig. 10(b) and Fig. 10(d). Fig. 10(d) shows the significant growth of case-based
    approaches compared to the very small growth of data-driven methods to address
    L-IoT. Notwithstanding, Fig. 10(b) shows that there is currently less emphasis
    on case-based approaches than on data-based methods. This is while in dealing
    with new topics, the use of real cases is better than the development of conceptual
    research [183]. Thus, future research is required to assess the system in practice.
    e) Developing a generic mechanism for case adaption. Although a general architecture
    is proposed in this paper for an L-IoT network, there is no generic mechanism
    for case adaptation. This may be because case adaptation can be a very complex
    process in attempting to derive modification rules [536] in such a fast-changing
    pull (customer-driven) network [536]. Therefore, developing a general mechanism
    that can be used almost unchanged for almost all logistics applications could
    be a potential opportunity for future research. In this regard, the development
    of diverse, integrated, and effective hardware facilities that enable L-IoT implementation
    can be helpful. f) Focusing on continuous event systems. Continuous events, unlike
    discrete events in which an event occurs at a particular time, include events
    that last at least for some amount of time [8]. Reviewing the literature shows
    that answering how and why questions on L-IoT in continuous event systems, such
    as a cold chain or continuous-flow manufacturing, still needs more effort from
    both academicians and practitioners. Because existing architectures do not process
    continuous event flows efficiently [537]. g) Working on better data processing
    tools. The big data generated from the IoT devices, which should be aggregated
    and analyzed in real-time, make the traditional data processing methods inapplicable
    for the L-IoT. Further, due to the different data formats and different applications,
    the RFID and WSNs need different data processing methods for data filtering, aggregation,
    and other data processing. Therefore, it is necessary to do research on information
    access format, data storage format, data processing methods, and mechanisms of
    security control. In this regard, although there are challenges when applying
    AI for decision-making based on big data [538], recent advances in the IoT and
    AI have provided opportunities to take advantage of their combined approaches
    [539]. In addition, since ML allows data processing algorithms and approaches
    to be applied on large-scale systems, it can be applied in IoT device computing,
    AI, and logistics terminal management, etc. [153, 540] as in the petrochemical
    industries [541] and smart cities [542]. h) Focusing on the cost-efficiency of
    the L-IoT. The cost of connecting to the IoT terminal [543], [544], [545] may
    not be important for large businesses, but it is a big deal for Small and Medium-sized
    Enterprises (SMEs). It is while its development is heavily subject to its influence
    on SMEs that are considered the economic backbone of many countries [546]. This
    may make the cost issue more critical for L-IoT. Because it needs to install large-scale
    infrastructures, such as sensors and computers in every container, vehicle, and
    warehouse, and to hire qualified managers and educate employees [547]. So, working
    on the development of cost-effective L-IoT can be a good potential for future
    research. i) Defining the role of government. Given the cost of planning and implementing
    the IoT in logistics, the role of government legislation to encourage industries
    and services, despite its importance, has received little attention [548]. How
    to standardize the L-IoT and how to encourage on-line marketing and trading based
    on the IoT technology can then be the future directions for researchers in the
    field of L-IoT. Legislation, standardization, and governmental support become
    even more important in such industries as postal logistics that are more vulnerable
    to information and communication technology upgrades and improvements. j) Focusing
    on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)/ Electronic-waste (E-waste)
    management. The IoT, while increasing E-waste, is also a good tool for managing
    E-waste [549]. Thus, with a growing interest in using IoT technology, E-waste
    management will become more important in the future [550]. Thus, research works
    on reverse logistics and closed-loop SC of E-waste, which have been reviewed in
    [551], may be a good potential for future research. In this regard, EPCs can allow
    the involvement of various agents of a reverse logistics network for information
    sharing [552]. In the meantime, moving towards smart and expert infrastructures
    for identification, tracing, proper separation, on-time collection, and recovery
    of E-waste may be an interesting direction for future research [553]. k) Integrating
    electric vehicles, smart grids, and IoT technologies, using renewable energy resources
    towards green smart transportation. Road transport is one of the main energy consumers
    and causes many environmental pollution issues [554]. Although electric vehicles,
    which are playing an important role in the intelligent transportation system [555],
    have been introduced to deal with this issue, uncertainty [556] and lack of efficient
    and intelligent charge scheduling process are big challenges in their use [557,
    558]. In this regard, good integration of smart grids equipped with sensors, meters,
    and renewable energies through Microgrids and electric vehicles with IoT technology
    may facilitate intelligent transportation and further enhance greenness and sustainability.
    Thus, it may become a good potential for further research. l) Moving towards further
    integration of the IoT technology in railway logistics systems. Automated Guided
    Vehicles (AGVs) can enhance the safety and efficiency of objects and cargo transportation
    [559, 560]. By this means, doing research on flexible and intelligent IoT-based
    railway logistics using WiFi telecommunication, automated conveying, intelligent
    sorting, etc. may be an opportunity for further development of railway logistics
    based on IoT technology. Establishing an IoT-based railway transport information
    management, monitoring, and emergency command systems can also be the other potential
    for future research in the field of railway logistics systems. In this way, establishing
    a good technical architecture of this type of logistics, which is in connection
    with the basic IoT layers, can be of interest, especially for practitioners. Declaration

    1. Introduction Irrigation is critical to sustain agricultural production in dry
    or semi-dry climates and maintain the economy of these regions (Stubbs 2016, US
    GAO 2019). Irrigation systems include gravity, sprinkler, and micro-irrigation
    systems (figure 1), and among these, sprinkler irrigation systems, mainly center
    pivots, are used in ∼55% of the U.S. total irrigated lands (USDA 2017, US GAO
    2019) (figure 1). For example, in 2015, 38% of corn and 25% of soybean production
    in the U.S. was produced with center pivots irrigation systems (Smidt et al 2019).
    Center pivot irrigation systems were invented by a farmer Frank Zybach in 1940
    and patented 12 years later (Zybach 1952). In general, these systems have water
    that is pumped from the center of the field to overhead nozzles of different sizes
    located along a long pipe that rotates in a circular pattern and used to irrigate
    large fields. In the U.S., these irrigation systems were quickly adopted and used
    to irrigate row crops. Zoom In Zoom Out Reset image size Figure 1. (a) Spatial

    Efficient irrigation is essential to achieve sustainability of food production
    and regional water security (Lobell et al 2008, Griggs et al 2014, Grafton et
    al 2018, Li et al 2020). However, currently, producers determine the irrigation
    timing and amount of center pivots largely based on their personal experience
    and weather information. According to a survey, >75% of irrigation scheduling
    methods used by U.S. producers are based on rule-of-thumb procedures that include
    crop calendars, visual observation, and ''what the neighbors are doing?'' (USDA
    2017). Fewer than 25% of irrigation scheduling methods are science- and technology-based.
    Decisions based on rule-of-thumb methods could lead to over- or under-irrigation.
    Over-irrigation may raise concerns related to water scarcity and environmental
    sustainability. For example, the extensive irrigated areas in Kansas, California,
    and Arkansas (figure 1) have resulted in large groundwater level declines in the
    High Plains, Central Valley, and Mississippi Embayment aquifers, respectively
    (Marston et al 2015, McGuire 2017, US GAO 2019). Over-irrigation using groundwater
    may further increase soil salinity and sodicity in areas with shallow groundwater
    tables and excessive evaporation losses, which threatens soil health of these
    regions (Hillel 2000, Tanji 2002). Over-irrigation can also result in leaching
    and runoff of nutrient-enriched water, causing contamination to ground water (Power
    and Schepers 1989, Exner et al 2014). Conversely, under-irrigation does not sufficiently
    alleviate crop water stress, which usually leads to both yield and economic loss
    for producers. Compared with rule-of-thumb methods, science- and technology-based
    irrigation scheduling methods may increase crop profits and reduce environmental
    impacts by minimizing crop water stress. Precision irrigation usually requires
    real-time information about soil water supply and crop water demand to determine
    optimal irrigation timing and varying amount in space, in order to reach predefined
    objectives such as the maximization of crop yield, resource use efficiency, or
    profitability (Sadler et al 2005, Smith 2011, US GAO 2019). Our study here will
    focus on discussing irrigation decision making tools for the majority of irrigation
    systems in the U.S., i.e. ''standard center pivots'', where irrigation timing
    and amount are uniform across a field. In recent decades, some studies have reviewed
    specific aspects of precision irrigation decision-support systems, such as soil-based
    and/or plant-based irrigation scheduling methods and applications of remote sensing
    data and wireless technologies (Jones 2004, Fernández and Cuevas 2010, Pardossi
    and Incrocci 2011, Zaks and Kucharik 2011, Ha et al 2013, Haule and Michael 2014,
    Kansara et al 2015, Ihuoma and Madramootoo 2017, Foster et al 2019, Lakhwani et
    al 2019, Pathak et al 2019, Evett et al 2020, Gu et al 2020). However, few studies
    have provided holistic reviews and perspective of integrating different components
    of precision irrigation decision-support systems. With extensive progresses made
    in precision irrigation in both academia and industry, there is a lack of comprehensive
    reviews on existing challenges and opportunities. This paper reviews recent advances
    and challenges, and envisions opportunities in precision irrigation decision-support
    systems for standard center pivots. We surveyed precision irrigation research
    from peer-reviewed literature, land-grant university extension and industry products,
    and U.S. patents. We identified challenges in data, decision-making approaches
    and criteria, and products used in current precision irrigation decision-support
    systems in this survey. We then proposed possible opportunities to address the
    corresponding challenges and bridge the gap between research and practice for
    precision irrigation decision-support systems, which we envision should be scalable,
    economical, reliable, and easy-to-use for producers. Although the survey is focused
    on the center pivot irrigation systems in the U.S, most of our review can be generally
    applied to different other types of irrigation systems at the global scale. 2.

    used in precision irrigation Data represents the basis of any precision management
    system. Multi-source data, including in-situ measurements, remotely sensing data,
    and gridded weather/climate/soil data (figure 2), are used for precision irrigation.
    in-situ sensors, e.g. soil/canopy temperature/weather sensors, can provide data
    with high accuracy but sometimes are expensive and labor-intensive to deploy those
    sensors. Soil sensors provide measurements of soil volumetric water content, water
    potential, salinity, and/or soil temperature, such as time-domain and frequency-domain
    reflectometer, capacitance probe, resistance probe, tensiometers, or cosmic-ray
    neutron sensor (Robinson et al 2003, Vaz et al 2013). The temperature sensors
    mainly are the infrared thermometer sensor, which can observe canopy or soil surface
    temperature. Weather sensors, largely deployed as weather stations, measure multiple
    meteorological variables, such as air temperature and humidity, solar radiation,
    wind speed and direction, barometric pressure, and precipitation. Producers have
    options to establish their own weather stations, but the cost is high and the
    current adoption is very low. On the other hand, public weather stations in the
    existing networks, such as National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration managed
    by National Climate Data Center and state networks (e.g. mesonets) are usually
    not dense enough, often leading to tens of km or further away from a targeted
    irrigated field (Sassenrath et al 2013, Mun et al 2015). Zoom In Zoom Out Reset

    Remote sensing data from satellites, airborne sensors, and unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAVs) mainly characterize canopy conditions, such as vegetation indices, leaf
    area index (LAI), and canopy temperature (Guan et al 2016, Urban et al 2018, Kimm
    et al 2020b), and hydrological conditions, such as evapotranspiration (ET), rainfall,
    and soil moisture (Qiu et al 2016, Peng et al 2017, Guan et al 2018). Unlike in-situ
    data, satellite data provide information across space and time for large-scale
    applications. However, existing satellite technology has limited spatial and/or
    temporal resolutions for precision irrigation. For example, MODIS is in low-medium
    spatial (250 m–1 km) and daily temporal resolution; whereas, Landsat is in medium-high
    spatial resolution (30–60 m) but low temporal resolution (∼8 d). By contrast,
    airborne sensors and UAVs can provide data at higher spatial resolutions, e.g.
    ∼0.1 m, but require geometric and radiometric calibration, certified operators,
    and complex data processing, and thus they are usually cost-prohibitive. So far
    the most relevant remote sensing data for irrigation is ET, and there are various
    remote sensing-based ET models, e.g. atmosphere-land exchange inverse (ALEXI)
    (Anderson et al 2004), backward-averaged iterative two-source surface temperature
    and energy balance solution (BAITSSS) (Dhungel et al 2016), breathing earth system
    simulator (BESS) (Jiang and Ryu 2016), mapping evapotranspiration with internalized
    calibration (METRIC) (Allen et al 2007b), surface energy balance algorithm for
    land (SEBAL) (Bastiaanssen et al 1998), and their pros and cons have been reviewed
    in recent work (Zhang et al 2016, Jiang et al 2020a). Finally, gridded weather/climate/soil
    data, such as NLDAS (Xia et al 2012), PUMET (Pan et al 2016), PRISM (Daly and
    Taylor 2001), DayMET (Thornton et al 2018), and SSURGO (NRCS 2017), are usually
    used as the forcing or parameters of land surface models to analyze the impact
    of irrigation (Devanand et al 2019, Xu et al 2019). Gridded weather/climate data
    can provide large-scale information, but usually have a coarse spatial resolution
    (>250 m) and cannot meet the field-level resolution and low latency requirements
    necessary for precision irrigation decision-support systems. 2.3. Decision-making
    approaches and criteria used in current precision irrigation decision-support
    systems The major decision-making approaches for irrigation timing primarily depend
    on soil- and plant-based metrics (Elwin 1997, Jones 2004). Soil-based metrics
    determine irrigation timing based on soil moisture or soil moisture-derived metrics,
    such as maximum allowable depletion (MAD), which indicates the percentage of the
    available water capacity to which crops should be subjected. MAD is the most widely
    used precision irrigation decision-making method (Panda et al 2004, Lehmann et
    al 2013). Plant-based metrics mainly determine irrigation timing based on plant
    conditions, such as plant water conditions (e.g. leaf water potential) and/or
    canopy temperature, e.g. crop water stress index (CWSI) and integrated CWSI (iCWSI)
    (Jones 2004, Girona et al 2006). Leaf water potential, a direct measure of plant
    water status in terms of plant hydraulics, has been used by agronomists/consultants
    for the irrigation of high value crops, but this approach can be over-costly and
    unscalable for row crop (Jones 2004, Girona et al 2006). The CWSI and iCWSI provide
    irrigation-trigger information through the cooling effect due to plant transpiration,
    based on the normalized function of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature
    difference between canopy and air (Idso et al 1981, Jackson et al 1981, DeJonge
    et al 2015, O''Shaughnessy et al 2015). The most widely adopted approach to determine
    how much water to apply is based on root-zone soil moisture. Given that soil moisture
    sensors are not available in most cases, the irrigation amount can be determined
    using soil water balance through two types of methods: the process-based models
    and statistical/machine learning models. Process-based models, including crop
    models, e.g. APSIM, AquaCrop, DSSAT, EPIC, Hybrid-Maize (Hammer et al 2002, Steduto
    et al 2009, Rosenzweig et al 2014, Peng et al 2020), hydrological models, e.g.
    SWAT (Chen et al 2018), and land surface models, e.g. Noah-MP, CLM, JULES, PALMS
    (Best et al 2011, Niu et al 2011, Yang et al 2011, Booker et al 2015, Peng et
    al 2018), can be used to simulate water balance and surface biophysical processes
    based on physical mechanisms with inputs of weather, soil, and/or satellite-based
    vegetation information. Statistical/machine learning models usually use empirical
    approaches to calculate soil water content and crop water use to determine the
    irrigation amount, and these empirical models require rich historical data to
    train and test the models to make them useful (Goldstein et al 2018). Furthermore,
    daily ET reports is also widely used for irrigation scheduling based on the estimation
    of daily crop water use (Lascano 2000, Lascano and van Bavel 2007, USDA 2017).
    2.4. Existing products developed for precision irrigation decision support Based
    on the multi-source data, decision-making approaches and criteria used in precision
    irrigation, many products have been developed to provide precision irrigation
    decision support for producers. We have listed some examples of precision irrigation
    decision support products from the U.S. land-grant universities and industries
    (tables 1 and 2). The combination of reference ET (ETo), crop coefficient (Kc),
    and soil water stress coefficient (Ks) is the most widely used empirical method
    to estimate crop water use, i.e. ET = ETo Kc Ks. There are many approaches to
    calculate ETo, reference ET for a short crop with a height of 0.12 m (similar
    to grass), using meteorological data, such as FAO Penman–Monteith method (Allen
    et al 1998, Walter et al 2000, Allen 2009). The majority of products incorporate
    crop water use (i.e. ET) to soil water balance to infer soil moisture for irrigation
    scheduling, such as METRIC ET, WISE, and CropManage. Besides, some products can
    also provide irrigation scheduling with lead time of a few days with weather forecasts,
    such as CornWater and SoyWater developed by University of Nebraska–Lincoln. 3.
    Challenges and opportunities for precision irrigation decision-support systems
    Based on current precision irrigation research, we identified four critical challenge
    areas and corresponding opportunities (figure 2) to improve precision irrigation
    decision-support systems for the center pivots in the U.S.: (a) data availability
    and scalability; (b) quantification of plant water stress; (c) model uncertainties
    and constraints; and (d) producers'' participation and motivation. With these
    challenges and opportunities, our proposed precision irrigation decision-support
    system for center pivots, which includes three components: data acquisition, modeling
    and analytics, and decision-making support (figure 3), should be scalable, economical,
    reliable, and easy-to-use for producers. Zoom In Zoom Out Reset image size Figure

    Data availability and scalability One major challenge regarding data need for
    precision irrigation is the lack of field-level resolution and high-accuracy data
    for scaled-up applications. Here we first reviewed the challenges of different
    existing approaches, and then discussed the opportunities to obtain scalable and
    high-accuracy data that can be acquired in every field at large regions for precision
    irrigation. 3.1.1. Challenges Here we identify three challenges from in-situ,
    satellite-based vegetation, and satellite-based ET and soil moisture data in data
    availability and scalability (figure 2). 3.1.1.1. In-situ data Existing in-situ
    sensors in the market are generally expensive or at least not sufficiently cheap
    to enable wide adoption. They also typically need to be installed and removed
    before and after the growing season for row-crops, resulting in extra labor costs.
    Though in-situ sensors usually provide high-quality measurements, these measurements
    are from a single point and thus often have limitations in capturing spatial heterogeneity
    of a whole field (Geesing et al 2004, Dong et al 2013, Irmak et al 2014, Rudnick
    et al 2015, Vuran et al 2018). Large public in-situ networks are available to
    provide long-term datasets from the National Soil Moisture Network and state mesonets,
    but these network stations are usually deployed in natural landscapes, away from
    crop fields, thus they have to rely on interpolation for precision irrigation
    but with significant uncertainty (Mauget and Leiker 2010). 3.1.1.2. Satellite-based
    vegetation data To enable precision irrigation decision, field-level resolution
    and high frequency are needed for remote sensing data. However, conventional satellite-based
    datasets on vegetation conditions, e.g. LAI and land surface temperature (LST),
    cannot fulfill high resolutions in space and time simultaneously; and some satellite-derived
    products have inherent limitations, such as insufficient accuracy and significant
    time latency (table 3). These drawbacks limit their applications to provide real-time
    and field-resolution data to determine irrigation scheduling for precision irrigation.

    Beck et al (2019) 3.1.1.3. Satellite-based ET and soil moisture data Continuous
    real-time estimation of ET and soil moisture, which indicate crop water use and
    soil water supply for crops in irrigation decision-making tools, remains a major
    challenge at fine scales with high accuracy for precision irrigation. Current
    operational soil moisture products only have coarse resolutions and could not
    fulfill the field-level irrigation needs; to make them useful, they need to be
    downscaled to high resolutions in both space and time, which adds large uncertainties
    (table 3). Specifically, current satellite-based soil moisture products based
    on passive microwave remote sensing are still limited to coarse resolutions (e.g.
    >10 kms in SMAP L3 and SMOS L3 products) and are only sensitive to shallow soil
    depth (<0.05 m) (Entekhabi et al 2010, Chan et al 2016); the above limitations
    make these data not useful for field-scale precision irrigation. The existing
    operational ET data either has coarse resolutions or not effective under cloudy
    days. For example, ALEXI/DisALEXI and METRIC ET products are based on energy balance
    approaches, which retrieve clear-sky ET from satellite-observed LST and fill ET
    gaps for cloudy-sky days, and thus are considerably affected by atmospheric conditions,
    thus limiting its practical uses (Allen et al 2007a, Cammalleri et al 2013, Li
    et al 2017, Anderson et al 2018, Ma et al 2018). 3.1.2. Opportunities 3.1.2.1.
    In-situ data First, continuous development of soil moisture sensor is needed to
    reduce the cost while achieve the robust performance (Montzka et al 2020). Second,
    more in-situ measurements from low-cost sensors can be combined to fill in the
    critical data gap for essential plant and environmental conditions. For example,
    in-situ LAI measurements, along with some other environmental variables, such
    as air temperature and humidity, now can be acquired from low-cost sensors; these
    measurements can provide significant constraints to improve ET estimations for
    irrigation scheduling. Economic cameras, such as PhenoCam, point-and-shoot cameras
    and smartphones, and spectral reflectance sensors, have been deployed to track
    vegetation phenology, such as LAI, and productivity (Ryu et al 2010, 2012, Francone
    et al 2014, Richardson et al 2018, Yan et al 2019). Furthermore, recent advances
    in microcomputers and microcontrollers have improved the ability to intelligently
    integrate low-cost sensors and provide a comprehensive solution for crop growth
    monitoring (Kim et al 2019). Third, some mobile sensors may also contribute to
    fill the gaps of spatial and temporal sampling, such as putting the roving cosmic-ray
    neutron sensors on trucks to sample soil moisture at a regional scale (Franz et
    al 2015, Schrön et al 2018). Additionally, new technologies, such as 5G networks,
    Internet of Things (IoT), Long Range communication devices, and edge computing,
    can further speed up the development of wireless sensing networks (WSNs), which
    can possibly make it less expensive and easier to provide scalable in-situ data
    for precision irrigation. 3.1.2.2. Satellite-based vegetation data For remote
    sensing data for vegetation conditions, improved satellite technologies/algorithms
    and data fusion methods (figures 2 and 3) can help to provide high spatial-temporal
    resolution products directly. Notably, satellite datasets with high resolutions
    in both space and time, e.g. daily, 3 m resolution Planet Labs data, are emerging
    and becoming available; though whether these data can be commercially viable for
    irrigation products is still unclear. Alternatively, satellite fusion algorithms,
    such as the SaTellite dAta IntegRation (STAIR) fusion method (figure 4) (Luo et
    al 2018, 2020), have been developed to fuse various satellite data together, e.g.
    Landsat, MODIS, and Sentinel-2, to enable the operational and real-time generation
    of a 10–30 m, daily and cloud-/gap-free data product for surface reflectance,
    which has significantly advanced the field-scale and real-time monitoring of crop
    conditions (Jiang et al 2020a, Kimm et al 2020b). Zoom In Zoom Out Reset image

    image High-resolution image 3.1.2.3. Satellite-based ET and soil moisture data
    High-resolution and operational ET and soil moisture products, once become available,
    can enable precision irrigation scheduling at the field level and low costs without
    in-situ sensors. Notable, the recently developed BESS-STAIR ET product, generated
    by a satellite-driven water-carbon-energy coupled biophysical model BESS combined
    with the STAIR fusion data, not only has a high spatial-temporal resolution (daily,
    30 m) under all-sky conditions, but also has demonstrated a high performance in
    estimating field-level ET when benchmarked with 12 eddy-covariance flux sites
    across the U.S. Corn Belt (figure 5) (Jiang et al 2020a). It indicates that BESS-STAIR
    ET has potential for applications in field-level precision irrigation, and also
    has scalability to regional and global scales. Besides, high-resolution LST products
    could also be incorporated into the BESS model as constraints to improve BESS-STAIR
    ET''s performance in near future. Some other existing programs, such as OpenET
    (Hall et al 2020), also have plans to offer satellite-based ET data, but unless
    real-time and field-level ET data can be provided, the promise to resolve precision
    irrigation cannot be fulfilled. Zoom In Zoom Out Reset image size Figure 5. BESS-STAIR

    High-resolution image For field-scale soil moisture, leveraging recent advances
    in mobile proximal sensing, high-resolution satellite remote sensing and downscaling,
    model-data fusion, ground sensing networks, machine learning and data mining techniques
    may provide promising solutions. Several proximal sensing techniques (Babaeian
    et al 2019), such as cosmic ray neutron sensing, can be powerful in mapping field-scale
    soil moisture when mounted on mobile platforms (Franz et al 2015, Schrön et al
    2018). Higher resolution soil moisture estimation can also be achieved through
    synergic use of both active and passive microwave remote sensing (Das et al 2019)
    or spatial downscaling (Peng et al 2017). Field-scale soil moisture simulation
    can also be improved with model-data fusion. Soil moisture is highly connected
    with some other land surface state and flux variables, such as ET and LST. The
    recently developed satellite-based 30 m BESS-STAIR ET (Jiang et al 2020a), ECOSTRESS-based
    ET (Anderson et al 2020) and LST (Hook and Hulley 2019) can be used to constrain
    the hydrological models through model-data fusion methods and thus to better infer
    field-scale soil moisture. The soil parameters in the hydrological models, which
    are an important source of uncertainty in field-scale soil moisture simulation,
    can also be estimated through model-data fusions methods when proper field-scale
    measurements are available. With emerging technologies like WSNs and IoTs (Kiani
    and Seyyedabbasi 2018), more ground-based soil moisture observations will become
    available (Quiring et al 2016), which provides an opportunity for data-driven
    prediction of soil moisture. State-of-the-art data mining techniques based on
    a network of coevolving time series (Cai et al 2015, Hairi et al 2019) can simultaneously
    capture the structural topology and temporal dynamics of multiple time series
    for the temporal and spatial patterns of soil moisture and its correlation with
    other variables. Meanwhile, the emerging physics-guided machine learning approaches
    (de Bézenac et al 2019, Reichstein et al 2019, Yang et al 2019), which can integrate
    hyper-resolution hydrological modeling with advanced machine learning algorithms,
    may also shed light on field-scale soil moisture estimation. 3.2. Quantification
    of plant water stress A fundamental question about precision irrigation is ''what
    is plant water stress and how to quantify it?''. Answering this question requires
    us to fully consider the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum (SPAC). Only after this
    question is answered, optimal methods could be developed around the correct concepts.
    3.2.1. Challenges ''Plant water stress'' is a critical concept to indicate the
    water shortage status of plants, based on which we can create irrigation triggering
    rules. There are various definitions of ''plant water stress'', for example, based
    on soil moisture and/or plant conditions, including canopy temperature and/or
    leaf water potential (Jones 1990, 2004, 2007, Rodríguez-Iturbe and Porporato 2005,
    Möller et al 2007). 3.2.1.1. Soil-based concepts Soil-based metrics are the most
    widely used methods for irrigation decision-making, such as MAD (see tables 1
    and 2, figures 6(d) and 8(e)). These metrics are based on the available water
    in the root-zone for root water uptake to indicate plant water stress. It is worth
    noting that these soil-based metrics largely only reflect water supply and they
    do not consider atmospheric water demand. Since agricultural drought in the U.S.
    Corn Belt is both driven by soil water deficit and atmospheric dryness characterized
    by high VPD (Lobell et al 2014, Zhou et al 2020, Kimm et al 2020a), it could be
    inappropriate to quantify plant water stress solely based on soil moisture. Zoom

    (ecosys). (a) CWP: canopy water potential; (b) CWSI: crop water stress index;

    MAD: maximum allowable depletion. Download figure: Standard image High-resolution
    image 3.2.1.2. Plant-based concepts Canopy temperature and leaf water potential
    are often used for irrigation management (figures 6(a), (e) and 8(a), (b)). Canopy
    temperature reflects plant water stress indirectly through canopy energy balance,
    such that a reduction of ET leads to reduced evaporative cooling, and thus higher
    canopy temperature given the same net energy (Idso et al 1981, Jackson et al 1981,
    DeJonge et al 2015, O''Shaughnessy et al 2015). However, canopy temperature derived
    metrics, such as CWSI and iCWSI, which can be measured from proximal, airborne,
    or satellite thermal sensors at the canopy scale, contain non-negligible uncertainty
    due to the empirical calculation methods, and are also prone to weather conditions,
    i.e. no observations during cloudy days for satellite products. The empirical
    calculation methods usually use the empirical upper and lower limits of the temperature
    difference between canopy and air to estimate CWSI and iCWSI based on the standardized
    temperature difference, resulting in irreducible uncertainty and error. Leaf water
    potential, a more rigorous measure of plant water stress based on plant hydraulics,
    can indicate plant''s internal water stress directly, but it is relatively cumbersome
    and labor-intensive to measure (Jones 2004, Girona et al 2006). The traditional
    measurements of leaf water potential via pressure chambers are reliable but require
    destructive leaf sampling and could be time-consuming (Boyer 1967, Ritchie and
    Hinckley 1975, Turner 1988), while the psychrometric methods (Richards and Ogata
    1958, Barrs 1964, Pérez et al 2011) are non-destructive but expensive and require
    sophisticated equipment and high level of technical skill. Thus, economically
    it is not viable and scalable to use these methods for row crops, which have much
    lower value than fruit and vegetables. 3.2.2. Opportunities We interpret ''plant
    water stress'' as a joint contribution of soil water supply (i.e. root-zone soil
    moisture) and atmospheric water demand (i.e. VPD), mediated by plant physiological
    regulations (Rigden et al 2020, Kimm et al 2020a) (figure 3). Both low soil moisture
    and high VPD can lead to plant water stress, and different plants may have different
    physiological responses and water use strategies (Sinclair et al 1984, Sinclair
    2005, 2012, Katul et al 2012). Thus, plant water stress should be defined and
    quantified holistically based on the interplay between soil water supply, atmospheric
    water demand, and plant physiological regulations, i.e. SPAC concept, for irrigation
    scheduling. We propose three definitions based on transpiration, plant hydraulics,
    and stomatal conductance (figures 2 and 6). 3.2.2.1. Transpiration We can define
    ''plant water stress'' from the perspective of transpiration (figure 6(c)). As
    transpiration can be limited by soil water deficit and/or downregulated stomatal
    conductance due to atmospheric aridity, actual transpiration (Tr) is achieved
    as the minimum of atmospheric water demand and soil water supply (Sinclair et
    al 1984, Sinclair 2012), with the former defined as transpiration when soil moisture
    is non-limiting with the same vegetation conditions, i.e. reference transpiration,
    Tr_ref, and the latter defined as root water uptake given limited soil moisture.
    Thus, the ratio of Tr (with plant water stress) and Tr_ref (without plant water
    stress) can be used to indicate plant water stress, here we define it as transpiration
    stress index (TSI) (figure 6(c)). However, in practice it is difficult to obtain
    direct measurements of Tr and Tr_ref. Though there are multiple ET partitioning
    approaches that can separate evaporation and Tr, such as process-based models
    (Stoy et al 2019), energy balance (Kool et al 2016), remote sensing products (Talsma
    et al 2018), or geochemical signatures (Al-Oqaili et al 2020), these methods contain
    relatively large uncertainties, which limits the accurate calculation of TSI in
    real-world applications. Alternatively, we could use the ratio of actual ET and
    reference ET (ETo), i.e. evaporative stress index (ESI) (Anderson et al 2011),
    as an approximation of TSI to indicate plant water stress for precision irrigation
    (figure 6(c)). ESI, which has been extensively used to quantify agricultural drought
    in long-term baseline conditions (Anderson et al 2011, 2016), can be derived from
    remote sensing, e.g. ECOSTRESS ESI_PT-JPL (Fisher et al 2020) and BESS-STAIR ET
    (Jiang et al 2020a), and/or process-based models. 3.2.2.2. Leaf/stem water potential
    We also can define ''plant water stress'' using leaf/stem water potential based
    on plant hydraulics (figure 6(e)). Plant hydraulics is the fundamental theory
    that connects soil water supply and atmospheric water demand (Dixon and Joly 1895,
    Tyree 1997, 2003, Taiz and Zeiger 2006, Stroock et al 2014), and can realistically
    represent the path of water flow from the soil through the plant substrate to
    the atmosphere driven by the potential gradient (Anderegg 2015). When plant water
    stress is caused by soil water deficit and atmospheric aridity, either independently
    or collectively, a substantial drop in leaf/stem water potential can be observed,
    and consequently with a reduction in sap flow. Thus, leaf and stem water potentials
    can be used as metrics to quantify plant water stress (figure 6(e)). However,
    measurements of leaf and stem water potentials are labor-intensive and expensive
    to use for precision irrigation. Thus, accurately modeling plant hydraulic control
    and water transport in the SPAC to estimate plant hydraulic traits, e.g. leaf/stem/root
    water potential and hydraulic conductance, becomes the key to the quantification
    of plant water stress in practice. To manage the complexities of plant hydraulic
    models, some highly uncertain parameters can potentially be constrained using
    various measurements through data-model fusion approaches (referred to section
    3.3), and some processes can also be simplified for crops, e.g. neglecting plant
    water storage (Salomón et al 2017), to enable efficient and scalable adoption
    of this method. 3.2.2.3. Stomatal conductance (Gs) We can also define ''plant
    water stress'' in terms of Gs (figures 6(b), 7 and 8), which reflects the physiological
    regulation of the uptake of atmospheric CO2 for photosynthesis and water loss
    through transpiration (Ball et al 1987, Medlyn et al 2011). Stomatal regulations
    are co-regulated by water supply (soil moisture) and demand (VPD) (figure 6(b)
    and the co-regulation pattern in figure 7) (Lin et al 2018, Kimm et al 2020a).
    Gs decreases with VPD given a certain soil moisture, and increases with soil moisture
    given a certain VPD (figure 7). Besides, the strong relationship between CWP,
    CWSI, ESI, TSI, MAD and Gs indicates that different plant water stress metrics
    (CWP, CWSI, ESI, TSI, MAD) all reflect the information of Gs (figure 8). Thus,
    stomatal conductance is the most effective indicator of plant water stress based
    on the co-regulation from soil moisture and VPD. However, quantifying ''plant
    water stress'' in terms of Gs is difficult, since we do not have a direct measure
    of actual Gs in practice at the canopy level—we can only do it at the leaf level.
    Thus, the above approach may have to rely on either process-based models or observation
    derived proxies, such as inversed Penman–Monteith equation and semi-empirical
    Gs models (Ball et al 1987, Allen et al 1998, Leinonen et al 2006, Damour et al
    2010, Medlyn et al 2011, Gago et al 2016, Buckley 2017, Kimm et al 2020a). The
    effectiveness of the above modeling or proxy approaches remains to be investigated,
    but the promise lies in leveraging scalable field-level measurements (e.g. from
    novel satellite products, see section 3.1.2) with models through data-model fusion
    approaches to estimate Gs and then make irrigation decision guidance. Zoom In

    High-resolution image 3.3. Model uncertainties and constraints With the data availability
    and ''plant water stress'' definitions clarified, process-based models and/or
    statistical/machine learning models can be used to simulate the SPAC system for
    irrigation scheduling. Both two types of models can involve significant uncertainties
    if not properly used, thus data-model fusion methods should be used to constrain
    models at each individual field, using field-scale measurements (figure 2). 3.3.1.
    Challenges 3.3.1.1. Process-based models Uncertainties of the process-based models
    (referred to section 2.3) can come from model inputs, parameters, and structures.
    Beven and Freer (2001) and Liu and Gupta (2007) have provided some detailed discussions
    on these aspects. Here we only discuss our unique perspective related to two major
    challenges. The first challenge is that scalable precision irrigation through
    process-based models requires us to have accurate simulations at each individual
    field in large regions. Process-based models usually can be calibrated at fields
    with rich data. Many practitioners assume that a model that has been calibrated
    at one or a few locations can be applied directly to other random sites. However,
    this approach in general does not work. The reasons are two-folds: first, when
    applying a model to a new site, many site-specific input data is not available,
    such as management practices and soil characteristics, which can lead to large
    errors in the simulations. Second, there are some site-specific model parameters
    remaining unknown and using predefined values may lead to large uncertainties.
    To possibly resolve this issue, we need to calibrate the process-based models
    at each individual field. The challenge thus is how to get the required field-level
    measurements for the calibration at each individual field. Computation burden
    also exists when we want to constrain each individual field using the process-based
    models. The second challenge is the under-represented or missed critical processes
    in the current models. One typical example is the linear/nonlinear response functions
    of Gs to soil moisture used in many current land surface models, such as in NOAH-MP
    model (Niu et al 2011), JULES model (Best et al 2011), and CTESSEL model (Boussetta
    et al 2013). These linear/nonlinear soil moisture-based water stress functions
    only consider soil water supply but ignore atmospheric water demand, thus these
    models have been found to overestimate soil moisture impacts on Gs, thus overestimated
    loss of ET with decreasing soil moisture (Ukkola et al 2016, Lei et al 2018).
    Few models consider the complicated interaction between surface water and groundwater,
    which is critical for the conjunctive use of these two sources for optimal irrigation
    in regions with active surface water and groundwater interactions (Singh et al
    2016). Besides, ignoring these active interactions may also lead to large uncertainties
    of the subsurface hydrological conditions. 3.3.1.2. Statistical/machine learning
    models The first challenge is that statistical/machine learning models are usually
    seen as ''black boxes'', which lack the physical mechanisms related to water cycle
    and irrigation (Torres et al 2011, Goumopoulos et al 2014, Navarro-Hellín et al
    2016, Romero et al 2018). It is difficult to trace the highly variable hydrological
    and vegetation conditions using ''black boxes'' machine learning algorithms. Another
    challenge is the data scarcity for the training of statistical/machine learning
    models at every individual field. The statistical/machine learning models can
    be trained at data-rich fields, while they cannot be extrapolated to other fields
    due to the lack of generality (Goldstein et al 2018, Romero et al 2018). 3.3.2.
    Opportunities 3.3.2.1. Process-based models Regarding the first challenge, process-based
    models should be constrained at each individual field by integrating the field-level
    measurements into data-model fusion methods for scalability. From the perspective
    of data, field-level measurements can be acquired by economic sensors and/or satellite
    remote sensing (see section 3.1.2). Advanced satellite remote sensing technologies
    nowadays can accurately estimate crop conditions (e.g. LAI and GPP) (Wu et al
    2020, Jiang et al 2020b, Kimm et al 2020b) and hydrological conditions (e.g. ET)
    (Jiang et al 2020a), making field-level information available. From the perspective
    of model, sensitive analysis should be applied first to screen out the most sensitive
    model parameters. Then, the most sensitive parameters need to be constrained for
    each individual field using field-level measurements (Yang et al 2020). There
    are many data-model fusion methods that can be used to integrate data and model
    for model constrains at each individual field, including calibration (e.g. Bayesian
    inference) and/or data assimilation. Detailed applications of these methods are
    referred to Houska et al (2014) and Liu and Gupta (2007). Regarding the computational
    cost, surrogate models, based on machine learning methods, can be applied to improve
    the calibration efficiency (Wang et al 2014, Zhang et al 2017). Regarding the
    second challenge of the under-represented or missed critical processes, we envision
    the following opportunities for model. Improved quantification of plant water
    stress following the supply-demand concept and hydraulic functions (referred to
    section 3.2.2) should be incorporated into the process-based models to replace
    the original soil moisture-based water stress functions. The interactions between
    surface water and groundwater should also be incorporated into the process-based
    models at regions where the groundwater level is shallow and consequently active
    interactions happen. It can not only improve the simulation of subsurface hydrological
    conditions for precision irrigation with possible subsurface measurements from
    low-cost subsurface sensors, but also can contribute to the sustainable irrigation
    with the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater (Wu et al 2016). 3.3.2.2.
    Statistical/machine learning models The nature of ''black boxes'' can be potentially
    resolved by the emerging physics-guided statistical/machine learning models. Physics-guided
    statistical/machine learning models mainly incorporate some physical laws, such
    as water and energy balance, into original ''black boxes'' to improve the traceability
    and prediction performance (de Bézenac et al 2019, Reichstein et al 2019, Yang
    et al 2019) (figure 3). For the limitation of data scarcity for model training,
    the growth of rich data from in-situ sensors and remote sensing (e.g. satellites,
    airborne sensors, and UAVs) can effectively enhance the training of statistical/machine
    learning models (see section 3.1.2). Besides, integrating process-based models
    with statistical/machine learning models will also help alleviate the limitation
    of data scarcity (Shen 2018, Shen et al 2018). 3.4. Producers'' participation
    and motivation Now following the discussion of data, mechanisms, and modeling
    in precision irrigation, we focus on the producers'' participation and motivation
    that is needed to promote precision irrigation decision-support systems. According
    to USDA in 2017, producers'' adoption rate of precision irrigation decision-support
    systems was less than 25%, and their adoption decision is largely depended on
    whether the expected benefits outweighed the adoption costs (USDA 2017, US GAO
    2019). 3.4.1. Challenges Producers have low confidence in precision irrigation
    decision-support systems, and also have concerns in data privacy (Cox 1996). It
    is generally recognized that there are three challenges to the producers'' participation
    and motivation (figure 2). 3.4.1.1. Impractical and unreliable tools Many of the
    existing precision irrigation tools lack the proper user interface and are difficult
    to use, leading to poor user experience (Mir and Quadri 2009). Furthermore, the
    accuracy underlying these tools are in general low, and thus producers are reluctant
    to use them (Cox 1996, Mir and Quadri 2009, US GAO 2019). Besides, most current
    precision irrigation decision-support systems assume that producers follow the
    recommended irrigation decisions strictly for each recommended irrigation event,
    and give producers no flexibility on the recommended irrigation timing (US GAO
    2019). 3.4.1.2. Limited access to information Producers in general have limited
    access to information on the development of new precision irrigation decision-support
    systems. The tools developed by land-grant university extensions are mainly applied
    in experimental fields for research, rather than for practical applications; while
    those from industries are promoted to large-scale producers, rather than those
    with medium to small-sized farms. Besides, there is limited expertise to help
    producers to set up and maintain the precision irrigation decision-support systems
    (Mir and Quadri 2009, US GAO 2019). 3.4.1.3. Limited market-based incentives for
    water conservation There is limited reliance on economic instruments, such as
    water pricing, water trading, and caps on water use, for managing water scarcity
    (Moore 1991, Olmstead and Stavins 2009). Additionally, sustained investments have
    not been made in governance and adequate institutional capacity to manage conflicts
    and adapt to changing conditions. The establishment of water markets could encourage
    water conservation, increase the value of water and induce public and private
    investments in irrigation efficiency (Rosegrant et al 1995, Johansson et al 2002).
    3.4.2. Opportunities Regarding the low confidence from producers on precision
    irrigation decision-support systems, three types of measures could be used to
    increase the producers'' adoption rate (figure 2). 3.4.2.1. Easy-to-use tools
    with flexibility Accuracy and easy-to-use are the basic features affecting the
    adoption rate of precision irrigation tools (Keil et al 1995, Mir and Quadri 2009).
    Use of these tools can be validated using some historical extreme weather events
    (such as drought), and the performance can be shown to producers (figure 3). Besides,
    tools should be provided with easy-to-use interfaces. Additionally, dynamic decision-making
    in precision irrigation tools can provide some flexibility for producers. For
    example, multiple solutions of irrigation timing (the gray region in figure 3)
    can be recommended together, and producers can select the favored one or decide
    not to irrigate. If producers decide not to irrigate, the new and updated irrigation
    scheduling should be provided rapidly based on updated soil and plant conditions.
    The frequent interactions between producers and these tools can give producers
    more flexibility and improve the accuracy of irrigation scheduling. 3.4.2.2. Farm
    policies for promotion The government can develop farm policies to promote precision
    irrigation decision-support systems. For example, the government can provide more
    education and training about these systems and their impact on water sustainability
    through extension and partnerships with private companies. Incentives can also
    be provided to the tool developers to encourage them to deliver technologies and/or
    perform as consultants to provide the support for the tool users (producers).
    Subsidies can also be provided for early adopters, i.e. higher risk tolerance,
    to encourage producers to adopt precision irrigation decision-support systems.
    3.4.2.3. Market-based water institutions Additionally, market-based water institutions,
    such as water markets with caps on water withdrawals and the ability to trade
    water across users, will provide incentives for adopting technologies that increase
    resource use efficiency (Garrick et al 2020). Subsidies to reduce the upfront
    costs of precision technologies can also promote adoption, particularly if producers
    have high discount rates. Enhanced resource use efficiency can however create
    financial incentives to increase economic return; thus, market-based solutions
    in favor of precision irrigation systems should be promised as a joint effort
    of governments, industry, and producers. 3.4.2.4. Extension to the existing center
    pivots Except for the above three types of measures, producers can also add telemetry
    to allow remote control or automatic control of the center pivots (figure 3).
    Producers can receive alerts by e-mail and/or text messages about decision-making
    information and any potential problems online. With the above suggested opportunities,
    precision irrigation decision-support systems can be promoted to producers with
    the existing standard center pivots. 4. Concluding remarks This systematic review
    focuses on precision irrigation research, identifies critical challenges and opportunities
    in four areas, which can be treated as the research directions of precision irrigation
    decision-support systems in the future, thus bridging the gap between research
    and practice. With more efforts in these research directions, our envisioned precision
    irrigation decision-support system (figure 3) can be applied universally and cost-effectively
    using the recent advanced technologies at each individual field in large regions.
    (a)   Data availability and scalability. High spatial-temporal-resolution satellite
    fusion products and low-cost sensor networks are emerging and should be used to
    scale up the adoption of precision irrigation decision-support systems. (b)   Quantification
    of plant water stress. Mechanistic quantification of ''plant water stress'' is
    suggested as triggers to improve irrigation decision, by explicitly considering
    the interaction between soil water supply, atmospheric water demand, and plant
    physiological regulation. (c)   Model uncertainties and constraints. The process-based
    and statistical/machine learning models should be constrained at each individual
    field using field-scale measurements and data-model fusion methods to investigate
    plant water relations for scalable precision irrigation. (d)   Producers'' participation
    and motivation: Easy-to-use tools should be developed with flexibility, and governments''
    financial incentives and support should also be increased to improve adoption
    rates of new irrigation technologies. Acknowledgments We acknowledge the support

  description: It is increasingly recognized that water scarcity, rather than a lack
    of arable land, will be the major constraint to increase agricultural production
    over the next few decades. Therefore, water represents a unique agricultural asset
    to drive agricultural sustainability. However, its planning, management and usage
    are often influenced by a mix of interdependent economic, engineering, social,
    hydrologic, environmental, and even political factors. Such a complex interdependency
    suggests that a sociotechnical approach to water resources management, a subject
    of the field of Hydroinformatics, represents a viable path forward to achieve
    sustainable agriculture. Thus, this paper presents an overview of the intersection
    between hydroinformatics and agriculture to introduce a new research field called
    agricultural hydroinformatics. In addition, it proposes a general conceptual framework
    taking into account the distinctive features associated with the sociotechnical
    dimension of hydroinformatics when applied in agriculture. The framework is designed
    to serve as a stepping-stone to achieve, not only integrated water resources management,
    but also agricultural sustainability transitions in general. Using examples from
    agricultural water development to horticultural and livestock farming, the paper
    highlights facets of the framework applicability as a new paradigm on data flows/sources
    consideration, and information and simulation models engineering as well as integration
    for a holistic approach to water resources management in agriculture. Finally,
    it discusses opportunities and challenges associated with the implementation of
    agricultural hydroinformatics and the development of new research areas needed
    to achieve the full potential of this emerging framework. These areas include,
    for example, sensor deployment and development, signal processing, information
    modeling and storage, artificial intelligence, and new kind of simulation model
    development approaches.

    1. Introduction The ever-growing world population and the rapidly approaching
    planetary boundaries have led to widespread discussion and consensus on the urgent
    need for the field of agriculture to gear toward sustainability-oriented initiatives
    (Giovannucci et al., 2012; Herrero and Thornton, 2013; FAO, 2017; Pretty et al.,
    2018). The objective is to reduce, avoid or redress environmental impacts and
    lessen the intense competition for input resources such as land, water, energy,
    and nutrients caused by conventional practices (Garnett et al., 2013; Jägermeyr
    et al., 2016; Kamilaris et al., 2017; Pretty et al., 2018; Calicioglu et al.,
    2019). Consequently, a variety of approaches (e.g., “ecological intensification,”
    “agroecological intensification,” and “sustainable intensification”) and technologies
    (e.g., “Precision Agriculture”) promoting transitions to sustainable practices
    have emerged. We argue that all these concepts can be summarized in the following
    common denominator: “a blend of technological, social, and institutional innovations
    at different scales around a common agricultural asset, resource, or subsystem
    represents a pivot to underpin sustainability transitions in agriculture.” Sustainability
    transitions is a social and technical (sociotechnical) concept defined as a set
    of “long-term, multi-dimensional, and fundamental transformation processes through
    which [well]-established [organizations] shift to more sustainable modes of production
    and consumption” (Markard et al., 2012). This definition implies that the application
    of the concept in agriculture presents some serious challenges. A first challenge
    is the need for a genuine participation and interaction of both established and
    innovative stakeholders or organizations. Second, within and between (established)
    organizations, the interactions/relations between individuals and (agricultural)
    technologies and tools existing at a certain level often differ considerably from
    those employed at other levels. In other words, established stakeholders and organizations
    are often sociotechnically stratified (Abbott, 1999; Ingram, 2015). Third, the
    identification and contribution of all other concerned stakeholders are required
    to ensure that both social and non-social expectations are met (Cunge and Erlich,
    1999; Rousseau et al., 2005; Abbott and Vojinovic, 2010a,b, 2014). Last but not
    least, it is a multi-disciplinary exercise involving a comprehensive knowledge
    of the different subsystems and subdomains in agriculture (Killham, 2011; Zomorodian
    et al., 2018; Al-Jawad et al., 2019). This challenge, in turn, leads to the first
    challenge mentioned above. Thus, the implementation of the sustainability transitions
    concept in agriculture can be thought as a continuous, and even iterative and
    circular, process of engaging all concerned stakeholders around the same common
    agricultural asset, resource, or subsystem discussed above. Water is a unique
    agricultural input that connects, is affected by (quantitatively and qualitatively)
    and affects all agricultural subsystems (Zhu et al., 2019). Its use and management
    are often influenced by a mix of highly complex economic, engineering, social,
    hydrologic, environmental, and even political factors (Zomorodian et al., 2018;
    Bjornlund and Bjornlund, 2019). These influences are expected to become more challenging
    to cope with in light of the anticipated increase in agricultural water demand
    due to climate change impacts and global population growth. Furthermore, the conflicting
    behavior, preferences, and goals of water stakeholders further complicate the
    management of available water resources (Walker et al., 2015; Zomorodian et al.,
    2018). However, despite the challenges imposed by the water stakeholders ecosystem,
    roughly half of the total agricultural water use is lost somewhere between the
    point of abstraction and the crop, and thus, not effectively used (Knox et al.,
    2012). In this same vein, water scarcity, rather than a lack of arable land, will
    be the major constraint to increase agricultural production over the next few
    decades (Watkins, 2006; Hanjra and Qureshi, 2010). Therefore, water represents
    the abovementioned common agricultural asset/resource to underpin agricultural
    sustainability transitions. It is unarguably the most critical resource to achieve
    sustainable agriculture (Chartzoulakis and Bertaki, 2015). Sustainable agriculture
    is often seen as an umbrella term for knowledge-intensive systems that require,
    beyond the application of domain knowledge, a new kind of knowledge (El Bilali
    and Allahyari, 2018). This latter is the knowledge of how to apply domain knowledge
    in new or unprecedented ways, i.e., a metaknowledge. In a context of using water
    resources as pivot to achieve agricultural sustainability, the common denominator
    we identified above, this metaknowledge is known as Hydroinformatics (Abbott,
    1999). This discipline has emerged to deliver unprecedented results in situations
    where stakeholders engagement/mobilization around water resources planning and
    management are most needed, and environmental stakes are high. A landmark example
    of the significance of this discipline in mobilizing stakeholders is the social
    breakthrough achieved by applying hydroinformatics tools from design to finish
    of the bridge and tunnel connection between Denmark and Sweden (the Oresund Project;
    Thorkilsen and Dynesen, 2001). In this project, hydroinformatics, through the
    use of technologies of persuasion to communicate complex decision problems, was
    significantly successful in adequately informing politicians, responsible authorities,
    and ordinary citizens about the project, empowering, and persuading them as well
    to act as trusted stakeholders. Another related example has been introduced by
    Abdullaev and Rakhmatullaev (2014) to demonstrate the practical application of
    hydroinformatics in supporting the implementation of the concept of “Integrated
    Water Resources Management” (IWRM; GWP, 2000; Furlong et al., 2015) across diverse
    institutional settings in Central Asia. Several efficiency-based techniques and
    approaches aligned with the knowledge management function and the sociotechnical
    dimension of hydroinformatics have been proposed and applied to address the problem
    of agricultural water resources sustainability. These include: the IWRM concept
    (GWP, 2000; Furlong et al., 2015); the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater
    resources (Singh, 2014); novel irrigation management systems (Sandler et al.,
    2004; Evans and Sadler, 2008; Gumiere et al., 2014; Pelletier et al., 2015; Vanderleest
    et al., 2016; Caron et al., 2017; Bjornlund and Bjornlund, 2019); and minimization
    of food waste and losses (Kummu et al., 2012; Pretty et al., 2018; Bjornlund and
    Bjornlund, 2019; among others). An efficiency-promoting paradigm with a focus
    on water management includes Precision Irrigation (PI; Perea et al., 2018) for
    crops and aquaculture, and Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) for dairy, egg, and
    meat production (Fournel et al., 2017). PI and PLF have emerged to make intensive
    use of information and communication technologies for spatio-temporal data collection
    and processing in support of improved farm productivity, and cost-effectiveness,
    sustainability of operations and environmental quality. They entail that farms
    (livestock, crops, aquaculture, etc.) are continuously monitored, and the collected
    data mined using integrated modeling approaches (e.g., water application models,
    biophysical simulation models, and empirical models) to make decisions and ensure
    favorable production conditions (Fournel et al., 2017; Perea et al., 2018). Using
    water resources as a pivot, these knowledge-intensive techniques represent an
    application for the data-mining-for-knowledge-discovery line of development of
    hydroinformatics (Abbott, 1999). Thus, with its (meta)knowledge-producing and
    management function, hydroinformatics represents a viable path forward to achieve
    smart, i.e., sustainable agriculture (Allahyari, 2009). Although water resources
    productivity or efficiency represents a cornerstone to achieve agricultural sustainability,
    it is not a panacea (Wichelns, 2014; Pretty et al., 2018). In this regard, substitution-based
    approaches consisting mainly of changes in consumption behaviors have been proposed
    (van Huis and Oonincx, 2017; Pretty et al., 2018; Bjornlund and Bjornlund, 2019).
    These approaches require the application of the technologies of persuasion, a
    subset of hydroinformatics'' technologies, to change individuals'' inner world
    and achieve behavioral changes (Abbott, 1999; Thorkilsen and Dynesen, 2001). This
    suggests that the inherent quantitative way of working of hydroinformatics must
    be complemented by its qualitative way of working (Vojinovic and Abbott, 2017).
    Thereby, hydroinformatics represents a prospective enabler of stakeholders engagement
    to achieve sustainable agriculture. It is exactly this persuasive knowledge-management
    purpose that Abbott (1999) had anticipated, and hence, must be fulfilled by hydroinformatics
    in order to realize its full sociotechnical potential, particularly in sustainable
    agriculture (DiSalvo et al., 2010; El Bilali and Allahyari, 2018). This non-exhaustive
    overview of the interplay between agriculture and hydroinformatics highlights
    the anticipated role and relevance of the discipline proposed herein. This paper,
    thus, introduces agricultural hydroinformatics as a new interdisciplinary field
    of research. In addition, it proposes a general conceptual framework taking into
    account the distinctive features associated with the sociotechnical dimension
    of hydroinformatics when applied in agriculture. It exemplifies the quantitative
    and qualitative interdependencies necessary to support the development of sociotechnical
    environments in which hydroinformatics-enabling social “transmutations” necessary
    to achieve agricultural sustainability can be catalyzed. It underlies the social
    and technical “threads” to be woven together in order to extend from a hydroinformatics
    of the quantities into a hydroinformatics of the qualities (i.e., subjective experiences,
    perceptions; Vojinovic and Abbott, 2017), a necessary condition to unleash the
    potential of the application of hydroinformatics in agriculture. The paper is
    organized as follows: section 2 is dedicated to the definition and roles of the
    discipline and provides rationales for the proposed framework; section 3 discusses
    the applicability of the framework using examples from agricultural water development
    projects in horticultural farming. The objective of this section is not to demonstrate
    the applicability of the framework, but only to propose a blueprint on how to
    develop it; section 4 discusses opportunities and challenges associated with the
    implementation of agricultural hydroinformatics; and section 5, before summarizing
    and concluding, discusses the development of new research areas to achieve the
    full potential of this emerging framework. 2. Agricultural Hydroinformatics: Conceptual
    Framework, Definitions, and Roles Owing to the inevitable and complex interactions
    between water and the agricultural subsystems, hydroinformatics combines, coordinates
    and interplays with several scientific fields of study and practices when applied
    in agriculture. This synergy gives rise to a multi-purpose conceptual framework
    that captures the wholeness and inter-dependencies necessary to conduct holistic
    agricultural water systems studies and modeling. 2.1. The Conceptual Framework
    A first factor that highlights the synergy between hydroinformatics and existing
    disciplines in agriculture is water over-extraction for growing purposes (i.e.,
    at the operational level), because of its two-faced (beneficial and detrimental)
    impacts. Some implications include, for example: (i) land subsidence (Deng et
    al., 2018) which is a subject of geology; (ii) potential loss of livelihoods and
    ecosystems due to flooding risks, water scarcity and, thus, food security which
    are subjects of hydrology, hydraulics, ecology, economics, and sociology; (iii)
    the implementation of water governance institutions along with water rights and
    water conflicts resolution which are subjects of legal sciences. The resulting
    impacts and changes of these implications often in turn generate new social and
    technical developments that characterize the circular nature of hydroinformatics
    in supporting decisions that improve society (Vojinovic and Abbott, 2017; Makropoulos
    and Savić, 2019). A second factor is water stress at the farm level as it is regarded
    as the greatest abiotic inhibitor of agricultural yield (Ciais et al., 2005; Gumiere
    et al., 2020). Such a factor has potentially destructive impacts on plant phenotypes
    such as growth, yield, efficiency and resistance (Houle et al., 2010) and livestock
    phenotypes such as feed intake, body mass, and milk production (Chedid et al.,
    2014; Sharma et al., 2015). Consequently, agricultural hydroinformatics may have
    a role to play in phenomics research (Houle et al., 2010; Furbank and Tester,
    2011) and potentially in genomics research as well (Chaves et al., 2003; Tuberosa
    and Salvi, 2006). This role may be further extended into new gene-based crop and
    livestock models of interactions between genotypes, growth environments, and farmers''
    management decisions and practices to improve farm performance (Antle et al.,
    2017). Furthermore, water stress also influences the physiology of both plants
    (e.g., photosynthetic activity) and livestock (Osakabe et al., 2014; Fournel et
    al., 2017). Last but not least, pest-management regimes (pest management science)
    and waste management practices in agriculture are known to have consequences on
    water quality with implications on water stress (Sims and Wolf, 1994; Larson et
    al., 1997; Burkholder et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2008). The overviewed synergy
    between fields of studies and practices embodies the sociotechnical nature of
    the application of hydroinformatics in agriculture and, accordingly, it sets the
    basis for the generic conceptual framework depicted in Figure 1. Together, the
    components of the framework exemplify the wholeness and inter-dependencies necessary
    to conduct agricultural systems studies and modeling. Such an endeavor requires
    the weaving of the naturalistic perspective (i.e., clearly defined quantities)
    and the hydro-social perspective (subjective/phenomenological in nature) of water
    resources management (Biswas and Dune, 1971; Walker et al., 2015; Vojinovic et
    al., 2016; Vojinovic and Abbott, 2017; Zomorodian et al., 2018; Ženko and Menga,
    2019). As such, the framework accounts for those aspects of water resources management
    that may not at all be expressed in numerical and/or monetary terms (Vojinovic
    and Van Teeffelen, 2007; Ten Veldhuis, 2011; Walker et al., 2015; Vojinovic et
    al., 2016). Thus, it exemplifies an anchor or starting point for extending from
    the rather narrow techno-centric approach of hydroinformatics toward a broader
    hydroinformatics of the qualities (Vojinovic and Abbott, 2017). In doing so, the
    potential of hydroinformatics in its scope and reach will be unleashed. figure
    1 Figure 1. Agricultural hydroinformatics and interacting entities as a conceptual
    framework. The framework also offers the opportunity to delineate the scope of
    future sociotechnological development for agricultural hydroinformatics. In this
    regard, it can be viewed as: (a) the data flows inventory necessary when conducting
    sustainable water resources management in agriculture, and (b) a discipline-delineated
    approach for the engineering of information and simulation models development
    and integration in agriculture. These two facets confirm the multi-purpose nature
    of the framework. The framework is amenable to capture, for example, the underlying
    data infrastructure needed to support the Plants in silico vision (Zhu et al.,
    2016), as well as the multi-scale crop modeling framework for climate change adaptation
    assessment as proposed by Peng et al. (2020). In these and similar contexts, agricultural
    hydroinformatics is expected to evolve with additional links to other fields of
    study and the development of new classes of tools and technologies. Accordingly,
    it may develop to (a) move the frontiers of the subfield currently known as AgInformatics
    or Agroinformatics (Gupta, 2009; De Montis et al., 2017; Gustafson et al., 2017)
    and (b) carry in its own right the sociotechnical implications of agricultural
    systems, an important aspect that is overlooked in the literature on agroinformatics
    (Sørensen et al., 2010; Lokuge et al., 2016; De Montis et al., 2017; Gustafson
    et al., 2017). 2.2. Definitions of Agricultural Hydroinformatics In light of the
    proposed framework, agricultural hydroinformatics can be intrinsically defined
    as “the production and use of knowledge from data flows relevant to the understanding
    and management of water in agriculture, together with interactions with, transformation
    by, and impacts on surrounding environments (e.g., plants, soil, animals, people)
    and vice versa”. However, the agriculture sector represents a typical example
    of a technology ecosystem within which several technologies interact and influence
    one another''s evolution. In such an ecosystem, agricultural hydroinformatics
    as a technology itself will interact with other technologies (e.g., farm machinery)
    either directly (e.g., usage and integration of data from agro-equipment) or indirectly
    (e.g., modeling of agro-equipment impacts on water). We have identified many components
    of the ecosystem, often referred to as reverse salient in the literature on sociology
    of technology (Hughes, 1987), that fails to deliver an acceptable level of technological
    capabilities to facilitate the integration and evolution of hydroinformatics therein.
    Therefore, we further define agricultural hydroinformatics as “the technology
    that should identify, support and promote corrective measures, and ultimately
    apply those (if necessary) capable of enhancing the performance delivery of the
    ecosystem of technologies as a whole.” 2.3. Anticipated Roles of Agricultural
    Hydroinformatics In light of the second definition presented above, hydroinformatics,
    when integrated in the agricultural technology ecosystem, will impose both physical
    and digital constraints on the design, functionalities, characteristics of the
    ecosystem itself and respond to similar constraints that will contribute to the
    whole ecosystem evolution. This suggests that agricultural hydroinformatics carries
    the responsibility to define what we call, using an object-oriented software engineering
    metaphor, a set of role types as part of a role model that describes the functionalities
    of and collaborations between its inner and outer components in the technology
    ecosystem. This metaphor triggers the idea that agricultural hydroinformatics
    will hold an evolutionary influence on the other technologies it interacts with.
    Therefore, using social media parlance, agricultural hydroinformatics is a technology
    influencer and role model. Overall, it can be regarded as a blueprint for implementation
    and adoption of information and communication technologies in agriculture. Last
    but not least, agricultural hydroinformatics may play a unique role in the definition
    of control and response variables based on local water systems conditions in support
    of the scientific roadmap toward the redefinition of the water planetary boundary
    concept as proposed by Gleeson et al. (2020). For instance, five of the six proposed
    new water planetary sub-boundaries (e.g., soil moisture, precipitation, evapotranspiration,
    groundwater) have direct connections with water management in agriculture. 3.
    Applicability of the Proposed Framework The proposed framework embodies a certain
    degree of generality that makes it amenable to transcend both spatial (field,
    farm, watershed, regional, national, and global) and temporal (from the planning
    stage to food distribution stage) scales of food modeling and production systems.
    Therefore, it is suitable to be used in a wide range of agricultural development
    situations beyond connections between agro-economic and water engineering development
    and its socioeconomic impacts. We have identified at least three preponderant
    use cases for which the framework can be applied to support and guide sustainable
    agricultural development. They are: (i) data and information modeling, (ii) agricultural
    systems simulation and modeling, and (iii) engineering of simulation models source
    codes. We need to reiterate that the objective of this section is not to demonstrate
    the applicability of the framework, but only to propose a blueprint on how to
    develop it. However, the applicability will be exemplified through the detailed
    discussion of real-world case studies. To better guide the discussion, especially
    on the data and information modeling, we must introduce a use case in the form
    of a complex situation where the majority, if not all, the components of the framework
    can be at play simultaneously. Such a use case must draw on prior practical situations
    that involve the tasks of water management for various (large-scale) purposes
    and at different spatial scales. Similar to the Oresund Project discussed before,
    this project to be selected as an example must also involve political and environmental
    stakeholders. Accordingly, it must address concerns, expectations, and requirements
    of a range of both formal and informal groups. In addition, it would do more justice
    to the utility of the framework to use at least a project that may have involved
    spatio-temporal sustainability-related simulations to persuade stakeholders during
    the planning stage through the project approval process and construction completion
    phase. The Brazilian Rio Sao Francisco transbasin diversion project (de Andrade
    et al., 2011), owing to its unique socioeconomic, hydrologic and geologic context,
    is a particular project that fits well the stated criteria. It evolved under strict
    environmental laws; it required socially and environmentally conscious and participative
    stakeholders; it was designed to supply water to the most water-scarce area of
    the country with only 3.3% of water resources, but 29% of the national population;
    and it went through a tribulated approval process mostly due to a lack of solid
    technical plans, and public consensus about its potential benefits (de Andrade
    et al., 2011). In addition, agricultural water demand accounted for the largest
    percentage of the total demand (Maneta et al., 2009; Roman, 2017). Last but not
    least, the project has attracted the attention of a large community of both national
    and international researchers, making it a highly studied and adequately documented
    case. 3.1. Data and Information Modeling In data and information modeling scenarios,
    the first step is to examine which component (s) of the proposed framework (Figure
    1) is relevant. To determine this, the type of questions to be asked is for example:
    what kind of both quantitative and qualitative data or variables should be considered?
    The answer to this question would lead to an inventory of variables pertaining
    to each relevant component of the framework. This is the starting point to determine
    data flows consideration for a particular agricultural water management scenario
    using the proposed framework. If we consider the legal sciences component, the
    answer to this question is that the data model may include, for example, entities
    associated with description of laws or legal frameworks established to govern
    or constrain the operation and management of water development projects, as well
    as description of water governance institutions. We present a preliminary example
    in Figure 2 with sufficient details depicting how some of the framework components
    can be used to develop information models for agriculture-related water development
    projects and farm management. We acknowledge that the example is non-exhaustive
    in the sense that it does not present a complete data model that includes all
    the components of the framework. This is also not the main objective of the paper.
    Therefore, instead of introducing a whole new information model, we tap into the
    Observations Data Model (ODM2; Horsburgh et al., 2016), a water-focused data model
    that has caught the attention of the agricultural research community (Janssen
    et al., 2017). It has been developed as a general information model to integrate
    both in situ sensors data, and ex-situ analyses results data, two situations that
    are common in the agriculture domain. It has also been successfully applied to
    four different disciplines (hydrology, rock geochemistry, soil geochemistry, and
    biogeochemistry) to meet field and laboratory data management needs (Hsu et al.,
    2017; Horsburgh et al., 2019). figure 2 Figure 2. Example of data model schema
    conceptualized based off the agricultural hydroinformatics framework and the ODM2
    developed by Horsburgh et al. (2016). It depicts four components of the proposed
    framework with related table definitions that may be used in developing a data
    model. The identifier field for each tuple (row) in the tables ends with the string
    “ID” with or without the symbol. The example data model shows how some of the
    project attributes such as construction costs, distance of transfer and annual
    volume of water transferred (Shumilova et al., 2018) can be represented in the
    envisioned data model. The consideration of this simple metadata set is important
    for several reasons. First and foremost, there is no dedicated and maintained
    database on water transfer projects, particularly with irrigation as a purpose
    (Shumilova et al., 2018). Second, one can capitalize on the data flows from the
    proposed framework to include food traceability information as part of the data
    model by linking food chains to water supply sources. Thus, the information model
    can be extended to support more accurate and detailed embedded or virtual water
    (D''Odorico et al., 2010; Konar et al., 2011; MacDonald et al., 2015) and water
    footprint (Hoekstra, 2017) profiles. This is a growingly accepted factor to be
    accounted for in sustainable resource-use decision-making processes (Zipper et
    al., 2020). In addition, the hydraulics component may include time series of flow
    rate and diverted flow rate. Although not presented in the example, the data model
    may contain provision to record the characteristics of both the donor and receiving
    basins under the hydraulics component of the framework. A many-to-many donor-receiver
    relationship must be maintained as well to enable the ability of a donor basin
    to supply more than one receiver basin and vice versa. The purposes of the project
    (e.g., agriculture, mining, steelworks, domestic supply), a determinant factor
    in assessing economic impacts of water development projects (Xiao et al., 2019),
    may as well be included in the data model (e.g., as a controlled-vocabularies-based
    entity; see ConstructionPurposesCV and ProjectDescription entities in Figure 2).
    Transboundary water development projects, such as the Brazilian Rio Sao Francisco
    transbasin and the Oresund Project, are often significant sources of water disputes
    and legal challenges (Thorkilsen and Dynesen, 2001; de Andrade et al., 2011; De
    Stefano et al., 2017). This suggests the need for the relationship shown between
    the hydraulics and legal sciences components in Figure 2. The latter component
    is presumed to contain mostly qualitative variables which are often associated
    with a set of weights or scores to quantify their importance (Vojinovic et al.,
    2016). Therefore, for the purpose of the example, we introduce an entity named
    CausesOfConflictCV, an entity to host controlled vocabularies describing causes
    of water conflict. A similar score-based variable approach was used to develop
    the Basins at Risk (BAR) scale that aims to systematically assess the process
    of international water conflict resolution (Wolf et al., 2003). Another example
    is the Water Events Scale (WES; Bernauer et al., 2012) depicting the intensity
    and impact of domestic cooperative and conflicting water-related events. The BAR
    and WES scales may also be included in the form of controlled vocabularies as
    entities of the legal sciences component. Similarly, the hydrology component may
    contain hydro-meteorological variables recorded as time series. To not delve into
    the details of fully documenting hydrological data, we show how entities under
    the hydrology component, i.e., observational data derived from both sensors and
    specimens, can be described and juxtaposed to entities already defined in the
    ODM2. In Figure 2, we show an example of entity (WaterTableDepth) that has its
    additional characteristics defined in the ODM2. This extension of our example
    data model to ODM2 is achieved through the ODM2Core.SamplingFeatures entity, used
    to store the physical characteristics of the river basins which include spatially
    referenced data. This juxtaposition requires slight modifications in the ODM2
    Core schema, such as the elimination of tables such as ODM2Core.Variables and
    the update of others such as the ODM2Core.SamplingFeatures table (see rows highlighted
    in blue in Figure 2) which serves as the point of connection. Although groundwater
    is not directly withdrawn in the donor basin, for such a large-scale project,
    subsidence rates may be monitored in the donor basin. Accordingly, the geology
    component may be used to record measured subsidence rates and geologic characteristics
    of the donor and receiver basin. The description of such a variable would follow
    the same structure defined for the variables under the hydrology component as
    in Figure 2, i.e., the use of variable names as controlled vocabularies (e.g.,
    water table depth, land subsidence) for the entity name. The sociology component
    can be modeled as a set of entities representing relevant qualitative and quantitative
    variables. There is a systematic gap in the literature on the qualitative entities
    that should be considered. However, we draw from the literature on the field of
    socio-hydrology that aims to investigate the co-evolution and dynamics of social-water
    systems (Sivapalan et al., 2012). Research work on this subject (Elshafei et al.,
    2014; Kandasamy et al., 2014; van Emmerik et al., 2014; Kotir et al., 2016) suggest
    that the dynamics of the population is a quantitative variable that should be
    included. Therefore, we include an entity with attributes relevant to represent
    this phenomenon in Figure 2. The different types of social/behavioral responses
    (e.g., contractive, expansive, accommodating) and benefits of stakeholders/actors
    as well as impacts (Biswas and Dune, 1971; Abdullaev and Mollinga, 2010; Wheeler
    et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2015; Walker et al., 2015; Vojinovic et al., 2016; Srinivasan
    et al., 2017; Vojinovic and Abbott, 2017; Zomorodian et al., 2018; Ženko and Menga,
    2019) at both the donor and receiver basins should be considered. Figure 2 shows
    an entity named BehavioralResponses with parameters describing how behavioral
    responses from each group of actors can be represented in the information model.
    The responses can be further segmented into classes (Neutral, Low, Medium, High)
    according to their level of significance or relative importance, which can themselves
    be standardized terms. This entity or the sociology component can also be extended
    to account for changes in behavioral responses and interactions through time or
    adjusted to consider the need of the pluralistic water research concept (PWR;
    Evers et al., 2017). The discussed model for inter-basin water transfer projects
    may be extended to integrate a farm-level and field-level data model. Again, the
    field ProjectID can be used to link this data model to the example shown in Figure
    2. Such a model may adapt, mimic, and extend, for example, the ODM2 discussed
    above. Depending on the type of farm, the data model may contain provision to
    record farm machinery operation information and accordingly may integrate entities
    for a Farm Machinery Management Information System (FMMIS; Fountas et al., 2015b).
    Ultimately, it may be extended to integrate components of a Farm Management Information
    System (FMIS; Fountas et al., 2015a). In addition, this data model may also contain
    description to record waste management practices, pest management practices, soil
    properties and water status (soil science component) through the ODM extension,
    phenomic data including crop water status (phenomics component) and ultimately
    genomic data (genomics component). For livestock farming, Fournel et al. (2017)
    provide a list of environmental, physiological and behavioral variables for farm-level
    data and they fall under the phenomics component and meteorology which we assume
    is part of the hydrology component of the proposed framework. The current trend
    in agriculture is toward more complex, technologically-enabled farm production
    systems with increasing control and supervision (Lindblom et al., 2017; Wolfert
    et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2020). With the ideas presented in this section, we
    bring forth the vision to treat agricultural production as a sociotechnical phenomenon
    and promote a sociotechnical-system approach to data and information models development
    as epitomized by the proposed framework. The discussed data model, due to its
    holistic nature, may be called a Sustainability-oriented Agricultural Data Model
    (SADaM). As highlighted above, agricultural hydroinformatics, in its role as a
    technology influencer, bears the responsibility to build on and adapt existing
    progress and proven best practices in information modeling such as the ODM2 to
    deliver a fully-fledged data model. This task constitutes a first and foremost
    step toward building a strong foundation for new and more profound changes in
    the agricultural sector. As a consequence, we anticipate and discuss below the
    development of more advanced data acquisition systems and tools/middleware enabling
    direct data and metadata streaming to database systems implementing the SADaM
    information model. Our attempt to represent qualitative variables as part of the
    information model example in Figure 2 highlights an outstanding gap in the literature
    on socio-hydrology. This is the need for the development of a common nomenclature
    and controlled vocabularies to represent qualitative processes such as attitudes
    of stakeholders toward water availability or scarcity. Well-known efforts such
    as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), World Meteorological Organization (WMO),
    and the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences,
    Inc. (CUAHSI) are of very little or no relevance. Nevertheless, Wheeler et al.
    (2013) lay the groundwork for such future research effort on this subject. The
    development of such a data model also involves the need to capture not only the
    semantics of each component, but also the lineage relationships between the processes
    and the resulting outputs as part of the metadata development processes. This
    may ultimately lead to a specialized ontology integrating the elements and relationships
    in the proposed framework. This effort may build on prior ontology-development
    effort as this practice has been promoted and is widely implemented by the hydroinformatics
    community (Abbott, 1999; Islam and Piasecki, 2006; Beran and Piasecki, 2009; Garrido
    et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013; Brodaric and Hahmann, 2014; Yu et al., 2015; Brodaric
    et al., 2016). 3.2. Agricultural Systems Simulations Models Development We have
    discussed how the proposed framework can be applied to develop linked data models
    through a discipline-delineated entities approach whereby variables are arranged
    under their corresponding component of the framework. The same approach can be
    adopted to architect agricultural systems simulation models. The first step is
    to identify the target processes to be simulated. These can be crop yields, water
    use, or demand and evapotranspiration rate. The second step is then to identify
    the relevant variables (raw or processed data) and new or existing models that
    output the relevant variables (data products) for the identified target processes.
    For example, the simulation of crop water demands (hydraulics component) requires
    a model (hydrology component) to estimate the potential evapotranspiration rate
    (data product). A more complex example can be the simulation of crop growth (phenomics
    component) response to water and nutrients. This requires a water budget model
    (hydrology component), nutrients budget model (soil science component), nutrients
    transport model (soil science component), infiltration and runoff models (hydrology
    component). The identified models fall under a certain component (e.g., hydrology)
    but are able to pull data (raw, processed, aggregated, model results) from any
    component with the relevant data. Thus, simulation models of various complexity
    level can be built on top of and tap into a database that implements the data
    model discussed above. In such a data system and simulation model configuration,
    the new model results can be saved back to the data system with its provenance
    information (e.g., Rousseau et al., 2000). We present in Figure 3 the four-layer
    skeleton of such a system in the form of a multi-layer Artificial Neural Networks
    architecture for knowledge workflows engineering. It shows the relationships between:
    (a) first layer: raw data (e.g., temperature from sensors), (b) second layer:
    processed data from the previous layer (e.g., minimum and maximum daily temperatures),
    (c) third layer: simple models (e.g., evapotranspiration) that use data from either
    of the first two layers or from both of them, and (d) fourth layer: complex physical
    models (e.g., Hydrus; Simunek et al., 1999; AquaCrop; Vanuytrecht et al., 2014;
    AquaCrop open-source version; Foster et al., 2017) that, for example, suggest
    the amount of water to apply for irrigation or quantify crop yield response to
    water. This last layer may also include data-driven models (e.g., machine learning
    models) similar to the example reported by Gumiere et al. (2020) and can pull
    data from any combination of the three layers on top. figure 3 Figure 3. Architecture
    of the envisioned knowledge workflow management of agricultural hydroinformatics.
    The versatility of the framework confers to agricultural hydroinformatics the
    ability to promote sustainability through water management-centric practices.
    These practices are in turn supported by a sociotechnical-system approach built
    on information and simulation models. We, therefore, envision an agricultural
    simulation system or environment that boosts reproducibility of research through
    systematic and formal records of the relationships among raw data, the processes
    that produce results and the results themselves as highlighted by Pasquier et
    al. (2017). This feature of the framework makes it particularly well-suited to
    support the delivery of integrated modeling structures for complex agricultural
    systems using, for example, the system dynamics method (e.g., see Berthiaume et
    al., 2005). This method has gained grounds in a broad spectrum of applications,
    primarily when water resources and agricultural production systems sustainability
    objectives are pursued (Walters et al., 2016; Zomorodian et al., 2018). It subdivides
    a system into an interconnected series of flows (inputs and outputs) and stocks
    (reservoirs) affecting one another through a feedback mechanism, thereby providing
    decision-makers with possible consequences of system perturbations (Zomorodian
    et al., 2018). A preliminary example of the application of the system dynamics
    approach to simulate agricultural production systems (crop and livestock) sustainability
    by Walters et al. (2016) demonstrates that five (5) clusters of flows and stocks
    (Economics, Crop Production, Livestock Production, Environmental Quality, and
    Social Quality) are reflected in our proposed framework. 3.3. Simulation Models
    Source Codes Engineering The framework brings forth the ability to guide the engineering
    of simulation models source codes. In line with the new architecture of the Decision
    Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) cropping system model presented
    in Jones et al. (2003), the framework imposes a modular structure in which components
    separate along scientific discipline lines; it is structured to allow easy replacement
    or addition of components or sub-components, and enable greater cooperation in
    interdisciplinary research and in the application of knowledge to solve problems
    at all levels. In addition, it promotes the granularity of simulation models development
    by supporting the generation of source codes incrementally through the combination
    of atomically-defined model algorithm blocks. A block can be developed to comply
    with the Single Responsibility Principle or Separation of Concerns of software
    engineering (Martin, 2002) and thus, is responsible for a single task (e.g., computation
    of hourly averages). An anticipated benefit is that a block of source codes responsible
    to compute a specific data product within or for a model can be developed under
    one component of the framework and reused under any other component of the framework.
    Thus, from a software engineering point of view, a block of codes may be designed
    to serve as a single channel to output a specific time series from the database
    or data product from a model to any component or any model within a component
    of the framework. 4. Opportunities and Challenges for Agricultural Hydroinformatics
    Although the agricultural domain is well-stratified with its techniques and approaches
    for knowledge generation and consumption, we anticipate that hydroinformatics
    will find many not-currently-apparent opportunities to underpin social, institutional,
    and technological innovations around water resources management toward agricultural
    sustainability. We anticipate that more opportunities will occur when, for example,
    the agricultural hydroinformaticist explores the business and phenomenological
    dimensions of hydroinformatics. In line with this “entrepreneurial” endeavor,
    Kamilaris et al. (2017) call for the creation of radically new services to promote,
    for example, the practices and benefits of (big) data collection and analysis
    in agriculture. Next, we highlight opportunities and challenges to accelerate
    social and technological transformations through the application of hydroinformatics
    in agriculture. 4.1. High-Performance Data Acquisition Systems Development The
    complexity of a data management system that implements the information model discussed
    here will evidently require more automation and capabilities from data acquisition
    systems. In this regard, a best practice we have learned through experience is
    that the development in data acquisition systems must take place after the data
    management planning phase. This constitutes the main reason why we introduce the
    discussion on data and information modeling first. The primary rationale for such
    order is that when data acquisition devices/systems are designed and developed
    with no consideration of the (digital) constraints imposed by a data management
    system that prioritizes data standardization, they tend to obey what we may call
    the “data logging rules or philosophy.” This implies that the devices or data
    acquisition systems (i.e., current dataloggers and sensors) simply collect and
    operate on data values. In other words, they have no formal support for metadata
    annotations, a critically important feature to reduce the manual data-to-metadata-mapping
    effort on data managers (when data standardization is adopted) and increase the
    useability and value of the data. Furthermore, the configuration process (e.g.,
    programming) of those devices often allows the user or operator to influence the
    data production process. This influence occurs through tasks that are as simple
    as allowing the operator to set names for variables being measured. This is an
    outlet for all three types of heterogeneities (schematic, semantic, syntactic)
    in the collected data. As pointed out by Kruize et al. (2013), it usually results
    in substantial manual and cognitive efforts to preprocess and harmonize the collected
    data. In addition, it becomes more complicated to annotate the data with corresponding
    metadata. These shortcomings are also present in data acquisition systems used
    in the agricultural sector. A review of the literature reveals that current (farms)
    field data acquisition systems are not designed to be, and thus, are not considered
    as an integral part of FMISs (see Nikkilä et al., 2010; Kaloxylos et al., 2012;
    Kruize et al., 2013; Zia et al., 2013; Fountas et al., 2015a; López-Riquelme et
    al., 2017; Paraforos et al., 2017; for examples of FMIS building blocks). Such
    a technical deficiency or schism may explain why data acquisition and management,
    for on-farm decision support, research and policy decision-making purposes, is
    recognized as the most pressing limitations of agricultural systems models (Capalbo
    et al., 2017; Jones et al., 2017). In the context of precision agriculture, which
    is a growingly accepted practice to achieve sustainability, these limitations
    are mainly attributed to the heterogeneities of the collected and available datasets
    (Nikkilä et al., 2010; Wolfert et al., 2017). Two widely cited reasons are that
    the data flows involved originate from various instruments and technologies (Fournel
    et al., 2017; El Bilali and Allahyari, 2018), and from several (sub)disciplines
    and sources (Capalbo et al., 2017; Janssen et al., 2017). Therefore, the development
    of more advanced technologies for data acquisition that resolve schematic, semantic
    and syntactic heterogeneities is another area wherein the impacts of hydroinformatics
    is most needed. The hydroinformatics community has made significant development
    in this area with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, low-cost,
    and open-source software and hardware (e.g., Wong and Kerkez, 2016; Horsburgh
    et al., 2019). Although in some hydroinformatics case studies, the devices automatically
    ingest the collected data to a standardized data management system, they still
    adopt the data logging philosophy, reveling an opportunity for agricultural hydroinformatics
    to introduce some new technologies using new approaches. Below, we introduced
    characteristics of potential data acquisition systems that are more suitable to
    close existing gaps toward a more integrated farm sensing and FMIS. A potential
    innovative solution that could get at least three birds with one stone is a new
    generation (second generation with respect to data loggers) of sensing systems
    for both point-based and spatial monitoring designed to be deployed in the field
    with a (minimum) knowledge base of the object being monitored, in addition to
    user-defined deployment-context metadata. Celicourt et al. (2020) have created
    a preliminary prototype of such system mainly to cope with the data management
    issues previously mentioned. An immediate and first benefit is that the devices
    (for point-based and geospatial observations) could work autonomously and in synergy
    to make decisions in the field. Second, they can themselves be programmed or configured
    to automatically create new metadata and/or derive metadata from original deployment-context
    metadata and document the decisions made. Subsequently, the documented decision
    along with farm field statuses may ultimately be submitted via some Application
    Programming Interfaces (APIs) to the backend of a cyberinfrastructure. Third,
    the devices may be also designed to output human and machine-readable data in
    standardized formats such as WaterML (Almoradie et al., 2013). A prototype of
    this second generation of data acquisition system may simply consist in a Soil
    Matric Tension (SMT) sensor along with other relevant sensors attached to a microcomputer
    (e.g., Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black) or microcontroller (e.g., Arduino), but
    with onboard deployment-context information as highlighted in the aforementioned
    ODM version 2.0 example, in addition to farm characteristics. The knowledge base
    can contain information that is as minimal as the root zone tension range of −4
    to −7.5 kPa and water table depth range of 500–600 mm (Vanderleest et al., 2016)
    for cranberry productivity optimization, for example. In situations where an irrigation
    event occurs in a specific field, the data acquisition system can be programmed
    to automatically generate the data and metadata necessary (e.g., water volume,
    duration, soil matric potential, weather conditions, field or bed identifier,
    etc.) to document such event according to a relevant agri-food standard. The file
    may be downloaded on-site, or the content can be encoded and transmitted to a
    web server where it is accessible to a FMIS. This latter may, in turn, formats
    and shares the received information using the same standard format. This generation
    of sensing devices (front-end) can be integrated in a feedback loop with crops
    and livestock models (backend of a cyberinfrastructure) to assess the inevitable
    gap between experimental results and field implementation and take on-the-fly
    corrective measures. Thorkilsen and Dynesen (2001) implemented a feedback monitoring
    programme with a similar mechanism in the context of the aforementioned Oresund
    project which was quite effective in ensuring the fulfillment of environmental
    objectives and design criteria during and after the project construction phase.
    A third and more futuristic generation of farm monitoring systems include those
    based on artificial intelligence techniques (e.g., computer vision, natural language
    processing) along with other relevant techniques to automatically determine relevant
    information about the farm fields (e.g., geospatial extent, type of crop, growth
    stage, crop statuses) being monitored. Contrary to the second generation previously
    mentioned, this one would be capable of generating nearly all of the necessary
    metadata (auto-generated metadata) needed to document the collected information
    including geographic positions of the sensors or all components of overall sensing
    system. Such a system would require a new kind of “built-in” metadata that is
    relevant to help, in a first stage, the interpretation of the auto-generated metadata,
    and in a second stage, the collected data. As an example, such a third-generation
    field-data acquisition system may consist of a SMT sensor that automatically reports
    its deployment depth (e.g., 250 mm) as a piece of metadata. This SMT sensor may
    rely on either a patched depth sensor (assuming in prototyping stage) or an integrated
    one (e.g., using Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) technology) that behaves
    as multi-parameter sensor. In this situation, the depth sensor has its own, preferably
    built-in, metadata (e.g., accuracy, variable, unit, etc.) that describes the depth
    measurement for the SMT sensor. The SMT sensor also has a similar set of, preferably
    built-in, metadata. In this example, the interpretation of the SMT sensor data
    involves the knowledge of: (a) the sensor metadata itself, (b) the auto-generated
    metadata by the depth sensor and (c) the metadata of the depth sensor. This last
    set of metadata is a new kind of data that bears the potential to help in understanding
    the first two sets (a, b) of metadata and is, therefore, a “meta-metadata” or
    “super-metadata” or “root metadata.” The SMT sensor may be further retrofitted
    with a GPS device and an accelerometer to automatically report its deployment
    position (latitude, longitude, and/or altitude). This would further simplify the
    metadata provision process and allows automatic management (commissioning and
    decommissioning) of the sensor. In this case, the characteristics of the GPS device
    and accelerometer would serve as additional super-metadata for the SMT sensor.
    Although the hydroinformatics community has not dealt with the management of this
    new kind of metadata before, the experiences developed therein in terms of metadata
    management and ontology development may guide the path forward, as this concept
    is applied to data and information modeling. The ideas presented above set agricultural
    hydroinformatics in a position to help address the major lag time in systems to
    exploit new advances in data, information and communication technology (Berger
    and Hovav, 2013; Fountas et al., 2015a; Antle et al., 2017; Janssen et al., 2017).
    Consequently, recent efforts to improve and accelerate the rate of agricultural
    innovation and meeting the growing global need for food and fiber have been limited
    by the need for improved data, models and knowledge products (Fountas et al.,
    2015a; Capalbo et al., 2017; Jones et al., 2017). The ideas presented here as
    possible pathways for new sensing systems for farm monitoring are intended to
    alleviate the usability problems and the requirements for farmers to manually
    input data that they are not familiar with. These two obstacles are identified
    as important limiting factors to the adoption of FMIS (Alvarez and Nuthall, 2006;
    Nikkilä et al., 2010; Kruize et al., 2013). 4.2. Novel Approaches to Simulation
    Models Development and Integration A common limitation of most crop and environmental
    models is that the model is distributed solely as a compiled software package
    (Foster et al., 2017). Furthermore, Jones et al. (2017) acknowledge that major
    advances are needed to achieve the next generation of simulation models that move
    beyond the inclusion of economic and sustainability issues to meet, for example,
    the agenda of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). In line with this vision, our
    proposed framework promotes the level of flexibility in terms of modeling approach,
    models implementation and modularity, types of models, and models-integration
    extent needed to tackle the complexity of agricultural systems modeling. To this
    end, the development of open web-based computational infrastructures or tools
    ecosystems that support the creation of models source codes through the combination
    of atomically-defined models components or subsystems components may be handy.
    To facilitate model integration, such a tool ecosystem may be designed to automatically
    encapsulate the generated source codes for each model within the structure of
    a chosen modeling framework (e.g., OpenMI; Gregersen et al., 2007). Although the
    implementation process can be quite a complex task to achieve a resulting set
    of coupled models that is as simple as the prescriptive sociohydrology framework
    presented by Elshafei et al. (2014), it would be instrumental in delivering truly
    reusable, modular and highly granular models. Such an infrastructure bears the
    potential to be transformed into a new kind of decision-support system which is
    that of the creation of integrated agricultural models and even DSS, thus a meta-DSS.
    Last but not least, it may be further extended to enable the generation of the
    resulting models in different programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C, C++, Python)
    using the Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) concept (Noonan, 1985). This is another
    opportunity for agricultural hydroinformatics to play its role of a technology
    influencer. 4.3. Innovative Technologies Adoption We have hitherto identified
    a number of avenues to overcome challenges pertaining mostly to improvement in
    agricultural data quality and management along with model implementation and a
    new kind of DSS to facilitate models integration. However, these challenges represent
    quite a narrow view of the challenges ecosystem to achieve agricultural sustainability
    and meet future demands for food and fiber. Here, we aim to move the horizon a
    little further to include those related to innovations adoption with a focus on
    precision agriculture, which is our paradigm of interest. Adoption challenges
    are preponderant as they represent serious barriers toward practical applications,
    improvement, adaptation, and maturation of innovations to empower farmers of all
    classes as genuine stakeholders. The objective is on-farm inputs optimization
    to achieve lower food production costs and food prices, higher inputs productivity,
    environmental sustainability, food security, and safety. Despite the experienced
    and potential benefits of precision agricultural technologies (PATs), including
    profitability and productivity (Capalbo et al., 2017; Griffin et al., 2017; El
    Bilali and Allahyari, 2018), their adoption is still limited in farming practice.
    This can be seen as a particular case of the more general problems of adoption
    and diffusion of new technologies or products that also occur outside the agricultural
    domain studied by Moore (1991) as the chasm theory. In the agriculture domain,
    a major impediment to adoption is the lack of technology delivery mechanism (Zhang
    et al., 2002) that often hinders the perceived benefits and usability to justify
    upfront investments in new technologies. This stumbling factor is often attributed
    to the implementation problem of FMISs incorporating support for farm managers
    to implement decisions (McCown, 2002; Rossi et al., 2014; Lindblom et al., 2017).
    They fail to capture the “tacit” knowledge and practical needs of farmers and
    are, therefore, not adapted to the trade-offs and high complexity that characterize
    farmers'' decision making processes (Lindblom et al., 2017). This results in what
    McCown et al. (2009) called the relevance gap, a discrepancy between scientific
    knowledge implemented in agricultural decision support systems (AgriDSS) and practical
    needs and experience-based knowledge of farmers. The relevance gap indicates that
    the sociotechnological nature of AgriDSS has not been (adequately) captured over
    the last 30 years of research and development (Lindblom et al., 2017). It is also
    supporting the evidence that the transformation in the role of farmers, agricultural
    technologists, and scientists from knowers to consumers of knowledge, whereby
    the latter becomes a kind of product to be consumed through socioinstitutional
    arrangements, has yet to occur. Such a transformation has been instrumental to
    the success of hydroinformatics as it is applied to water systems (Thorkilsen
    and Dynesen, 2001; Abdullaev and Rakhmatullaev, 2014) and it is now an essential
    aspect of the discipline (Vojinovic and Abbott, 2017). It is also a precondition
    for agriculture to enter the postmodern era and for agricultural hydroinformatics
    to become a postmodern technology that transforms farmers'' behaviors toward water
    management practices in particular and agricultural production practices in general.
    The relevance gap is driving a growing interest in the adoption of sociotechnical
    approaches to agricultural technologies in general and (big) data management and
    DSS development in particular by integrating stakeholders in the development process
    (Rossi et al., 2014; Fountas et al., 2015a; Janssen et al., 2017; Jones et al.,
    2017; Lundström and Lindblom, 2018; Rose et al., 2018a,b; Gutiérrez et al., 2019;
    Jakku et al., 2019; Rupnik et al., 2019). Such approaches are implemented through
    a number of so-called sustainability theoretical and conceptual frameworks that
    include the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP), the social practice theory discussed
    by Jakku et al. (2019) and the Agricultural Innovation Systems (AIS) approach
    introduced by Kilelu et al. (2013). However, the efforts appear to be at an infancy
    stage. Nevertheless, this convergence in development approaches toward what we
    can call the hydroinformatics ways of working further justify its relevance to
    agriculture. It presents an opportunity for agricultural hydroinformatics to promote
    and accelerate the adoption of existing and future technologies in agriculture
    to deliver better decisions. That is the kind of situation therein Abbott and
    Jonoski (2001) anticipated hydroinformatics could play a vital role in producing
    and consuming conjunctive (social and technical) knowledge that relates water-dependent
    soil-cultural practices and plant cultivation practices in new ways to promote
    justifiable productivity. To this end, they have proposed a three-part conceptual
    framework representing a generic hydroinformatics knowledge self-management system
    for knowledge-intensive applications such as precision agriculture and aquaculture,
    health care services. Kaloxylos et al.''s (2012) view of future Farm Management
    Systems shares some similarities with the proposed system. However, Abbott and
    Jonoski (2001) acknowledge that the realization of a corresponding prototype represents
    the greatest sociotechnical challenge of hydroinformatics due to socioinstitutional
    arrangements it may require. The current trend toward the conceptualization of
    water systems as cyber-physical infrastructures (Makropoulos and Savić, 2019)
    is another convergence point between ongoing developments on water systems management
    and (precision) agriculture. This concept offers the opportunity to develop an
    integrated data infrastructure and drive real-time operational decisions along
    with predictive capabilities to improve farm-level management and water systems
    operations (Wolfert et al., 2014, 2017; Capalbo et al., 2017). However, the volume
    and variety of data involved in precision agriculture, acceptedly named “big data,”
    are far more complex than those in water systems. Cyber-physical configurations
    enabled by the IoT paradigm and Cloud Computing technologies hold an opportunity
    to transform the entire food supply chain into smart webs of connected, context-sensitive,
    uniquely-identifiable, remotely-controlled things that are context-sensitive and
    can be identified and controlled remotely (Wolfert et al., 2014). Furthermore,
    these configurations can be viewed as an extension of either of the two generations
    of data acquisition systems proposed above. They set the stage for a more advanced
    farm management technology ecosystem enabling end-to-end support for the FAIR
    (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles (Wilkinson et
    al., 2016) and also the implementation of the Digital Twin concept (Ding et al.,
    2019). The practical implementation or, at the very least, a prototype of these
    configurations is indeed challenging (Wolfert et al., 2014, 2017), but a lean
    and agile prototyping approach can shed enough light to move the development forward
    while opening up pathways to many opportunities. From a technical point of view,
    implementations with a focus on “big data” management may play a preponderant
    role in engineering the aforementioned whole-system data model (SADaM) as the
    “big data” paradigm hauls a growing emphasis on metadata for data provenance (Janssen
    et al., 2017; Wolfert et al., 2017; Coble et al., 2018). From a socioinstitutional
    point of view, the adoption of the “big data” approach will certainly highlight
    factors and conditions that may influence the uptake of these new approaches to
    farm management. The complexity of repatriating and processing large private and
    public datasets is perceived as a possible cause of the deceiving adoption of
    precision agriculture technologies (Lawes and Robertson, 2011). In this regard,
    Wolfert et al. (2017) noticed significant shifts in roles and power relations
    among different players composing the agricultural “big data” landscape. But,
    this landscape, as described, does not hitherto contain any knowledge provider
    in the “hydroinformatics” sense as defined by Abbott and Jonoski (2001); Abbott
    and Vojinovic (2010a). Nevertheless, owing to the entwined nature of knowledge
    and power, we anticipate the growing dynamics in those power relations will mutate
    into the Michel Foucault''s problematics of “power/knowledge” structures. Fortunately,
    the three-part conceptual framework by Abbott and Jonoski (2001), discussed earlier
    on, has been proposed to specifically invert these structures through an inversion
    in knowledge relations. Realizing a smoothly-working prototype of this proposed
    example will certainly bring around many business opportunities which is a basic
    tenet of hydroinformatics (Abbott, 1999; Abbott and Jonoski, 2001). Beyond the
    relevance gap, a specific, but determinant, component of stakeholders engagement
    that remains a serious stumbling factor to the theoretical and conceptual frameworks
    mentioned above when applied in agri-food sustainability transitions is the penetration
    of innovative knowledge into the mainstream agricultural regime (Ingram, 2015).
    For instance, the most prominent transition framework applied on agricultural
    sociotechnical transitions, namely Multi-Level Perspective (Rip and Kemp, 1998;
    Geels, 2010), suffers from a variety of inadequacies highlighted in Hassink et
    al. (2018) and Ingram (2015). Consequently, it is increasingly being complemented
    with other frameworks focusing on human-related and social factors (El Bilali,
    2018) which is a symptom of the inaptitude of the broad range of existing frameworks
    to effectively tackle agricultural sustainability transitions. From a hydroinformatics
    stand-point, we are tempted to consider this strong resistance of mainstream agricultural
    regime to niche knowledge as a situation embodying the same problematics of “power/knowledge”
    mentioned above. Accordingly, for having overcome resistance in organizations
    strongly stratified (again, in the sociotechnical sense) as highlighted with two
    examples in the introduction, hydroinformatics is in a unique position to “crack”
    mainstream agricultural regime strata, by analogy to the hydraulic fracturing
    technique for natural gas extraction. In this regard, Abbott (1999) suggested
    that the problem be tackled through (and we quote) “the provision of knowledge
    to very many persons over electronic networks [sociotechnical environments], and
    [more importantly, the provision] of capabilities for people to express their
    fears, concerns and aspirations over these same networks, and thence to interact
    and organize themselves.” Thus, this is a further opportunity for agricultural
    hydroinformatics to play an underpinning role in facilitating the creation of
    sociotechnical environments in which the transformations or transitions necessary
    to achieve sustainable agricultural systems can be catalyzed. 4.4. Streamlined
    Agricultural Knowledge Management Workflows The data heterogeneity problem in
    data sources discussed above has led to a number of scattered standards development
    efforts, including data management standards and data vocabularies (White et al.,
    2013), field devices communication (e.g., CANbus, ModBus; Suprem et al., 2013;
    Ojha et al., 2015), and thesaurus- and ontology-based developments (Janssen et
    al., 2017; Kamilaris et al., 2017). However, a superficial examination of some
    of them reveals that they suffer from several shortcomings, including incompleteness
    and inadequate description of variable names (e.g., use of abbreviations) and
    physical units which increases the mental workload necessary to work with them.
    Data heterogeneity resolution at the cyber-infrastructure level is a particular
    area wherein the hydroinformatics community has made significant practical advances
    (Horsburgh et al., 2008, 2016; Beran and Piasecki, 2009; Abdullaev and Rakhmatullaev,
    2014). A major example is the CUAHSI''s Hydrologic Information System (HIS), developed
    as a cyberinfrastructure to support the management and dissemination of fixed-point
    field observations (Horsburgh et al., 2008). The system has seen widespread adoption
    in enabling the interoperability of observations through the development and standardized
    use of the ODM discussed above. Thus, data heterogeneity resolution at both the
    instrumentation and cyber-infrastructure levels represents the last piece of the
    opportunities puzzle for hydroinformatics to fully play its role of a technology
    influencer. In this context, agricultural hydroinformatics is a prime candidate
    to develop fully streamlined agricultural knowledge management workflows that
    adhere to the architecture presented in Figure 3. Such an architecture represents
    an instance of the anticipated knowledge chain concept in the form of a set of
    linked steps by which data are processed into information, knowledge and finally
    wisdom as used in decision-making processes discussed by Janssen et al. (2017).
    We highlight that special attention needs to be paid to the treatment of the units
    in knowledge management workflows, which may further complicate the integration
    of datasets. Celicourt and Piasecki (2016) have already developed a unit-of-measurements
    management and conversion tool named “HydroUnits” based on the units Controlled
    Vocabularies developed by CUAHSI. Thus, we are aware of the deficiencies and opportunities
    to improve this existing set of units. The improvement would include, for example,
    compliance with the Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM) to achieve greater
    interoperability (Schadow and McDonald, 2013). In addition, the CUAHSI units certainly
    need to be revised and augmented to become what we may call “AgroUnits.” This
    latter may ultimately serve to improve the deficiencies of existing ontologies
    used in agriculture. The development of agricultural knowledge management workflows
    would be an important step toward the next generation of FMIS as water resources
    management support is identified as a key bottleneck that hinders farm efficiency
    (Kruize et al., 2013). In addition, it creates the opportunity to incorporate
    support for whole-farm-system data provenance capture and preservation, in addition
    to traceability along the whole food system chain. This holds the benefits of
    helping companies, governments, and farmers in the food chain to make informed
    decisions (Janssen et al., 2017). 5. Summary and Conclusion Agricultural production
    sustainability has become a critical, but challenging approach to meet food demands
    of the growing global population. This requires major transformations in agricultural
    practices through technological, social, and institutional innovations. Water
    resources planning, management and usage at the field, farm, river basin, regional,
    and national scales represent a pivotal strategy to underpin these transformations.
    In this context, we have introduced a blueprint for a new interdisciplinary field
    of research in agriculture named agricultural hydroinformatics. It is intended
    to employ hydroinformatics approaches to promote a holistic approach to agricultural
    water and knowledge management by considering the economic, engineering, social,
    hydrologic, environmental, and even political factors that influence agricultural
    water resources planning, management, and usage. Furthermore, it must foster adoption
    of technologies as a path forward to achieve sustainable agriculture in light
    of the anticipated increase in agricultural water demand due to climate change
    impacts and global population growth. We have introduced a new general conceptual
    framework that stems from the particularities of the sociotechnical dimension
    of using hydroinformatics in agriculture. The framework is designed to support,
    not only integrated agricultural resources and assets management, but also agricultural
    sustainability in general. It can also be used as a simple tool to gauge the degree
    of integration of (agricultural) water resources management programs or initiatives
    as it depicts the components (e.g., soil, water, land, crop, people) that may
    need to be considered. It also enables the development of an entirely integrated
    but discipline-delineated knowledge management workflows for agricultural production
    consisting of raw data, metadata-annotated data, storage and dissemination, models,
    and decision support system. We acknowledge that this blueprint for the proposed
    framework is freshly introduced and therefore, it has not yet been vetted by the
    hydroinformatics and agricultural research communities. Although it is developed
    to be as generic as possible, we believe it may evolve in many ways and under
    many circumstances. For example, the framework may evolve by integrating new fields
    of research, disciplines and practices as they emerge. The introduction of new
    fields and practices may lead to splitting a component or aggregation of two or
    more components of the framework. Sociohydrology is a typical example of an emerging
    field of research that may lead to some transformations of the framework. These
    anticipated mutations, therefore, will give rise to more specialized as well as
    more mature and either more specialized or more generic versions of the framework.
    Multidisciplinary forms of intra- and inter-universities collaborative efforts
    as well as development of new curricula to train agricultural hydroinformaticists
    will play an important role in paving the way for this new field of research and
    framework to gain momentum. This is challenging, as the topics to be covered may
    range from information and decision theories to social sciences to legal sciences
    to ethics and philosophy of science; to name but a few. These initiatives will
    serve as a ground work for agricultural hydroinformatics to make a more significant
    impact in driving agricultural sustainability transitions. Some major development
    must also occur in various technology-related research areas through collaboration
    between universities, research centers and technology companies applying the business
    dimension of hydroinformatics. These include, for example, the development of
    self-managed in-situ sensors, farm machinery and unmanned automated vehicles (UAVs)
    systems that are easy to deploy and require as little human intervention as possible.
    An important aspect of this self-management capability includes, for example,
    the embedding of artificial intelligence algorithms to enable sensing and control
    systems to perform and record automated signal and data quality control procedures.
    Another aspect is the automated management of both raw and processed data through
    the development of standardized data models with provision for sufficient ancillary
    information to facilitate data interpretation, retrieval and integration. A third
    and critical aspect is the involvement of stakeholders including farmers throughout
    the research and development processes to tackle the knowledge and technology
    relevance issue and facilitate the adoption of resulting technologies. The phenomenological
    dimension of hydroinformatics will play a significant role here. This latter aspect
    may be instrumental in gauging the level of system intelligence needed at the
    farm level and the cloud level. Lastly, the transformation in the role of farmers,
    agricultural technologists, and scientists from knowers to consumers of knowledge
    represents a milestone for agriculture to enter the postmodern era and for agricultural
    hydroinformatics to become a postmodern technology. Therefore, research and development
    efforts must be conjugated toward a knowledge self-management system prototype
    as described in the paper to reverse the growing power/knowledge relationships
    related to innovative technologies adoption, and concepts such as big data and
    knowledge-intensive agriculture. This would be a turning point toward the co-creation
    of knowledge to the benefits of all categories of farmers. It is when these ideas
    are turned into practical applications through the establishment of appropriate
    and adequate sociotechnical arrangements, as well as the provision of personalized
    and customized services with tangible benefits, that agricultural hydroinformatics
    will fully play its role as a blueprint for the adoption of information technologies
    in agriculture to the benefit of all farmers. Data Availability Statement The

    higher resolution multi-band SR data provides an important path for improved agricultural
    monitoring at sub-field scales. A previously developed Data Mining Sharpener (DMS)

    a modified version of the DMS approach that employs a relaxed box size for energy
    conservation (EC). Sharpening experiments were conducted over three study sites
    in California, and results were evaluated visually and quantitatively against
    LST data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) flights and from Landsat 8. Over
    the three sites, the modified DMS technique showed improved sharpening accuracy
    over the standard DMS for both ECOSTRESS and VIIRS, suggesting the effectiveness
    of relaxing EC box in relieving misalignment-induced errors. To achieve reasonable
    accuracy while minimizing loss of spatial detail due to the EC box size increase,
    an optimal EC box size of 180–270 m was identified for ECOSTRESS and about 780
    m for VIIRS data based on experiments from the three sites. Results from this

    Mining SharpenerEvapotranspiration 1. Introduction Thermal satellite data have
    been widely used for ecological and hydrological studies from local to global
    scales (Kustas and Anderson, 2009). Land surface temperature (LST) estimated from
    thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing imagery, a key parameter in energy balance
    modeling at the land-atmosphere interface, has been used for a variety of environmental
    applications, including surface energy flux mapping (Anderson et al., 2008; Anderson
    et al., 2007; Anderson et al., 2004b; Kustas et al., 2004; Kustas et al., 2003;
    Norman et al., 2003), evapotranspiration (ET) and soil moisture estimation (Allen
    et al., 2011; Allen et al., 2007; Anderson et al., 2012; Torres-Rua et al., 2016;
    Trezza et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2017b; Yang et al., 2018). Accurate estimation
    of LST is vital to understanding various environmental processes that are facilitated
    by frequent LST observations with fine spatial resolution. For instance, sub-field-scale
    ET retrievals at 30-m resolution in near-daily repetition have proven valuable
    in routine monitoring of agricultural water use and vegetation stress (Anderson
    et al., 2018; Anderson et al., 2012; Knipper et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2017).
    The spatial resolution of TIR bands from thermal sensors tends to be coarser than
    the surface reflectance (SR) data including visible, near-infrared and shortwave
    infrared (VSWIR) bands from shortwave sensors on the same platform. Sharpening
    thermal data to a higher spatial resolution by taking advantage of SR data provides
    a useful and effective way to add spatial detail to the LST information and data
    products derived from LST. In the case of ET mapping, thermal sharpening serves
    to better confine higher evaporative fluxes within crop field boundaries, improving
    estimates of field-scale water use. Numerous thermal sharpening approaches have
    been developed in recent years. One class of sharpening algorithms takes advantage
    of the empirical relationship between vegetation indices (e.g., Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI)) and LST through traditional linear or nonlinear regression
    techniques, such as the TsHARP algorithm proposed by Kustas et al. (2003) and
    further refined by using fractional vegetation cover rather than NDVI to sharpen
    LST (Agam et al., 2007b). The two approaches have been widely used in a number
    of studies (Agam et al., 2007a, Agam et al., 2008; Anderson et al., 2004b; Cammalleri
    et al., 2008). Besides vegetation, other factors (e.g., land cover type, soil
    moisture and topography) also play a role in impacting the spatial pattern of
    LST, motivating a large number of studies that tried to improve thermal sharpening
    accuracy by integrating indices including land-use data (Bonafoni, 2016; Lillo
    et al., 2018; Nichol, 2009; Yang et al., 2017c), photosynthetically active vegetation
    cover (Liu et al., 2018; Merlin et al., 2010), emissivity (Inamdar and French,
    2009; Inamdar et al., 2008; Jeganathan et al., 2011), digital elevation model
    (DEM) data (Hutengs and Vohland, 2016), and albedo (Dominguez et al., 2011) into
    the sharpening process. These studies suggest that the incorporation of predictors
    besides NDVI and vegetation cover has the potential to improve the sharpening
    accuracy over complex landscapes. The aforementioned sharpening methods are conceptually
    similar; that is, building empirical relationships between LST and predictors
    coming from one or a combination of indices (e.g., NDVI) generated from spectral
    bands or biophysical parameters (e.g., emissivity and albedo). These techniques
    require adjustment of the predictor variables to obtain optimal sharpening results
    over different landscapes, inhibiting the flexibility of their use for global
    applications. To extend the validity domain of thermal sharpening approaches,
    a number of statistical and machine learning tools have recently been adopted
    to characterize the regression relationship between LST and SR data, including
    kriging (Mukherjee et al., 2015; Pereira et al., 2018), random forest (Hutengs
    and Vohland, 2016; Lillo et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2017c), neural network (Bindhu
    et al., 2013) and support vector machines (SVM) (Kaheil et al., 2008; Liu et al.,
    2018). Among them, Gao et al. (2012) developed a Data Mining Sharpener (DMS) based
    on a multivariate regression tree method (cubist), which has shown its effectiveness
    in sharpening of Landsat LST and been widely used in many applications (Anderson
    et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018). DMS is a data-driven approach that sharpens
    the TIR data by establishing multivariate regressions that directly utilize reflectance
    data from all available shortwave bands. DMS shows improved performance over the
    NDVI-based TsHARP algorithm for Landsat LST sharpening (Gao et al., 2012). In
    addition, DMS does not require any pre-defined relationship and other higher-order
    products or parameters (e.g., NDVI) as inputs, allowing flexibility for integration
    into an operational data production system. DMS and most other sharpening approaches
    have typically been tested using thermal and SR data or derived higher-order products
    collected from the same satellite platform, thereby increasing the spatial resolution
    but not the temporal resolution of the LST data. In contrast, thermal sharpening
    involving multi-source data can produce LST data with higher combined temporal
    frequency, allowing improved monitoring of rapidly changing surface conditions.
    For instance, medium-resolution sensors such as the Landsat 8 Operational Land
    Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) package (Roy et al., 2014) provide
    both VSWIR and TIR images at spatial resolutions of 30 m and 100 m, respectively
    (Table 1). Thermal sharpening of Landsat LST to 30 m using Landsat SR data has
    been used in many studies to improve the spatial resolution of evapotranspiration
    (ET) mapping (Anderson et al., 2012). However, the temporal frequency of Landsat
    image acquisition (16 days with a single platform) can be limiting for robust
    ET monitoring, particularly in regions of persistent cloud cover (Yang et al.,
    2017a). The Sentinel-2a and -2b satellites provide SR data at 10–20 m spatial
    resolution and 10-day (or 5-day combined) revisit period; however, Sentinel-2
    does not collect TIR data (Table 1). The Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS)
    dataset provides a unified collection of SR data acquired by Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2
    and provided as three products: S10 (Sentinel-2 10 m), S30 (Sentinel-2 30 m) and
    L30 (Landsat-8 30 m) (Claverie et al., 2018). The high temporal resolution of
    HLS makes it attractive for thermal sharpening on LST data from other satellite
    platforms. For example, NASA''s recently launched ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal
    Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) provides TIR bands with around
    70-m spatial resolution and an average of 4-day revisit frequency (Table 1) but
    does not collect VSWIR data (Fisher et al., 2015; Hulley et al., 2017). The Visible
    Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) that was launched in 2011 provides TIR
    data at 375-m resolution (I5 band) on a near-daily basis. The availability of
    these additional TIR data sources, along with the HLS SR dataset, holds a great
    potential to generate 30-m LST products with high combined temporal frequency.

    can present new challenges resulting from sensor differences in geo-referencing,
    acquisition date/time and data quality. Few studies have investigated the performance
    of thermal sharpening utilizing multi-platform data and the impact from the mentioned
    difficulties (Bisquert et al., 2016; Cammalleri et al., 2008; Guzinski and Nieto,
    2019; Pereira et al., 2018). While the DMS has shown good skill for sharpening
    using Landsat platform data (Gao et al., 2012), its utility for thermal sharpening
    based on data from multi-platforms remains unclear. Recently, a Python implementation
    of DMS (pyDMS) has been released by Guzinski and Nieto (2019) in Github, widely
    increasing its exposure to the community for a wide range of applications including
    multi-sensor ET mapping using Sentinel-2 and 3 data. However, issues that may
    exist in the application of DMS to muti-platform data may be mishandled by less
    experienced users. Improved understanding of the DMS performance for multi-platform
    data is urgently needed to expand utility in operational applications. In this
    study, we evaluate the capability of the DMS approach for thermal sharpening across
    platforms and explore ways to reduce the impacts of differences in TIR-SR geolocation
    accuracy. Thermal data from ECOSTRESS and VIIRS over target sites in California
    were sharpened to 30-m resolution using HLS SR data and compared to reference
    images from Landsat 8 and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) acquisitions. First, typical
    ECOSTRESS/VIIRS TIR misalignments with respect to the SR data are quantified,
    and then a modified DMS is proposed to relieve the influence of these misalignments.
    We also investigate the impact on sharpening performance of different methods
    for resampling the swath TIR data provided by ECOSTRESS and VIIRS to the SR grid,
    which has been shown to affect sharpening results (Allen et al., 2008; Chen et
    al., 2014; Singh Rawat et al., 2019; Sismanidis et al., 2017). Section 2 gives
    a brief description of the standard DMS algorithm and the proposed modified version.
    Section 3 describes the study area and data preparation. The results and discussion
    are provided in 4 Results, 5 Discussion, respectively, followed by the conclusions
    in Section 6. 2. Modeling approach 2.1. Data Mining Sharpener (DMS) The Data Mining
    Sharpener (DMS) algorithm proposed by Gao et al. (2012) is implemented via the
    following four steps. First, the SR images are aggregated to the native TIR spatial
    resolution and a sample of relatively homogeneous pixels are selected from the
    coarse-resolution SR and TIR images. Homogeneity is defined based on the sub-pixel
    coefficient of variation (CV) in the SR data, which is expressed as follows: where
    n is the total number of spectral bands, and μi and σi represent the mean and
    standard deviation of the fine spatial resolution pixels within each coarse resolution
    pixel in band i. We use the threshold cv < 0.1 to select coarse-resolution samples
    for Landsat and ECOSTRESS LST sharpening, while a larger threshold, cv < 0.2,
    is used for VIIRS due to the coarser native pixel size. Second, the homogenous
    SR and TIR samples at coarse resolution are used to train and build a cubist regression
    tree. Next, this regression tree is applied to the SR images at their native resolution
    to estimate LST at fine pixel resolution. The final step aggregates the sharpened
    LST at fine resolution to the TIR band resolution and computes the differences
    (residuals) from the raw LST map at its original coarse resolution. The residuals
    are redistributed over the fine-scale LST map, either uniformly or smoothly using
    bilinear interpolation. This step is aimed at enforcing energy conservation (EC)
    within the sharpening process. For brevity, we call this step EC. Gao et al. (2012)
    used two models - a global and a local model - to select samples for regression
    tree training. The global model trains a regression tree for sharpening using
    samples selected from the entire image. The local model trains the local regression
    tree using samples within a local moving window. Each local window overlaps with
    surrounding windows to avoid artificial effects at the window boundary. The local
    model tends to have overall better performance than the global model (Chen et
    al., 2012; Gao et al., 2012; Jeganathan et al., 2011; Zakšek and Oštir, 2012).
    However, the local model may have lower prediction accuracy for some outlier features
    that are not well represented within the smaller moving window. Thus a combined
    model, taking advantage of both global and local modeling approaches, was proposed
    (Gao et al., 2012). It should be noted that the local model demands more computing
    time than the global model and results depend on the complexity of the area and
    moving window size. For simplicity and a more consistent comparison across data
    sources, this paper only uses the global modeling approach. More details can be
    found in Gao et al. (2012). The cubist regression tree method has an optional
    boosting-like procedure called committees that determine the number of iterative
    model trees that are created in sequence. A new model tree is created using adjusted
    training set outcomes from the last tree. The final model prediction is the average
    of each model tree prediction. While the committee approach increases computing
    time, we found it was helpful in eliminating some anomalous behavior (see the
    specified area in Fig. 1a for example). Therefore, in this study, we use five
    committees for ECOSTRESS and VIIRS LST sharpening which produced improved results
    (Fig. 1b). Download : Download high-res image (322KB) Download : Download full-size

    composite of Landsat 8 SR data. The anomalous feature highlighted in (a) is removed
    through the use of five committees in (b). (For interpretation of the references
    to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of
    this article.) 2.2. Modifications to the DMS approach The DMS algorithm has been
    successfully applied in thermal sharpening using TIR and SR data from the same
    sensor, collected at the same time and well co-registered. As previously discussed,
    LST and SR data from different sensors might not be geometrically consistent in
    terms of precise registration and orthorectification, leading to some degree of
    mismatch between the two datasets. An example is shown in Fig. 2 in which we use
    the standard DMS algorithm to sharpen both Landsat 8 and ECOSTRESS LST using Landsat
    8 SR data. It is clearly seen that, for many locations, the sharpened ECOSTRESS
    LST shows significantly blurrier boundaries than the sharpened Landsat 8 LST.
    These “shift artifacts” are attributed in part to the image misalignment between
    Landsat 8 and ECOSTRESS. Download : Download high-res image (849KB) Download :

    39°38′N) of LST (°C) at 30 m resolution using the standard DMS algorithm for (a)
    Landsat 8 and (b) ECOSTRESS. Both used the same Landsat 8 SR to sharpen the LST
    images. The mismatch (shift) between ECOSTRESS and Landsat caused blurring effects
    after applying the energy conservation process using a 90-m EC box in (b). In
    the standard DMS approach, a homogeneous pixel at coarse resolution is determined
    based on the sub-pixel CV using fine resolution pixels within the coarse cell.
    For Landsat 8 LST sharpening, 3 × 3 30 m resolution SR pixels were used to determine
    a homogeneous LST pixel (100 m resolution). In the modified version, a homogeneous
    pixel is computed using an extended area (±1 pixel) to reduce the effect of misalignment.
    For example, ECOSTRESS and VIIRS LST sharpening uses 5 × 5 and 15 × 15 30 m resolution
    pixels to determine a homogeneous LST pixel and then averages the central 3 ×
    3 and 13 × 13 pixels to generate LST-SR samples, respectively. The stricter rule
    ensures that only large homogeneous pixels are used in building regression trees.
    The extended sampling window is expected to help reduce the co-registration errors.
    The EC process in the standard DMS approach conserves energy at the native thermal
    band pixel scale, maximizing the propagation of spatial TIR information into the
    sharpened image. In this paper, we propose to use a relaxed EC box size, that
    is, to aggregate both the original and sharpened fine-resolution LST to a resolution
    coarser than the nominal native TIR resolution before computing the residuals.
    The relaxing of EC box size is expected to help relieve the co-registration errors
    or the shift effect by increasing the area of overlap between the TIR and SR information
    within the EC box. For co-registration differences (shifts) ranging from 30 m
    to 150 m, the change of the overlapped area with respect to EC box size is shown
    in Fig. 3. For example, given a relative shift of 30 m (in both dimensions) between
    TIR and SR data layers, an EC box of 90 m will contain 44% overlap of consistent
    area, while an EC box of 180 m or 270 m will provide 69% or 79% overlapped area
    respectively as highlighted in Fig. 4. The use of a larger EC box size results
    in a larger overlapped area, which is expected to provide a greater relief from
    the co-registration errors. However, the increase of EC box size may also lead
    to spatial thermal information loss in the sharpened image. In addition, the value
    added by increasing the EC box size begins to asymptote at some level, as highlighted
    in Fig. 3. Consequently, an appropriate EC box size will balance the need to accommodate
    misregistration while preserving thermal information content in the sharpened
    image. This paper aims to explore the response of sharpening accuracy to EC box
    size, which will provide insights on determining an optimal EC box size for different
    sensors with different geolocation accuracies. The DMS approach has been revised
    to take the EC box size as an input variable. Download : Download high-res image

    and analyses 3.1. Study area and datasets The standard and modified DMS approaches
    were tested over domains including three study sites within California, USA, that
    are part of the USDA-ARS Grape Remote Sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration
    eXperiment (GRAPEX) (Kustas et al., 2018). As illustrated in Fig. 5, the three
    GRAPEX sites are Sierra Loma vineyard near Lodi, California in Sacramento County,
    Barrelli vineyard near Cloverdale, California, and Ripperdan vineyard near Madera,
    California. The land cover types in three areas are mainly irrigated vineyards
    surrounded by irrigated orchards, unirrigated pastures and grasslands, and in
    combination they sample a significant north-south climate and vegetation gradient
    due to variations in temperature, vapor pressure and precipitation. Download :

    Loma, Barrelli and Ripperdan sites in California, USA. To facilitate intercomparison,
    for each site we identified dates with same-day overpasses of Landsat 8, ECOSTRESS
    and VIIRS, with a focus on the period of available ECOSTRESS imagery in 2018 (August–September).
    Given prior demonstrated utility of DMS with Landsat data (Anderson et al., 2018;
    Knipper et al., 2019), sharpened 30-m Landsat 8 LST images, where available, serve
    as the baseline for evaluating DMS performance with ECOSTRESS and VIIRS. Landsat
    sharpening represents a best-case scenario, where both TIR and SR data are collected
    simultaneously from the same platform and are well co-registered, and the sharpening
    ratio (factor of 3) is relatively small. The Sierra Loma and Barrelli sites had
    same-day overpasses on 04 August and 11 August 2018, respectively (Table 2). However,
    at Ripperdan only Landsat 7 was available for dates with same-day overpasses of
    ECOSTRESS and VIIRS in 2018. In that case, we used Sentinel-2 SR data for sharpening
    to avoid scan-line corrector gap issues in Landsat 7. At this site, very high-resolution
    imagery collected via unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from the Utah State University
    AggieAir UAV Research Group (https://uwrl.usu.edu/aggieair/) is available for
    05 August 2018 when good-quality ECOSTRESS and VIIRS LST data are also available,
    providing an opportunity to evaluate thermally sharpened images directly at the
    30-m scale. Table 2. Three study sites and the corresponding SR and TIR data used

    products were downloaded from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Explorer
    (http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) for the Sierra Loma and Barrelli sites (WRS-2
    path 44 and row 33, and path 45 and row 33, respectively). These SR data were
    used to sharpen Landsat, ECOSTRESS and VIIRS TIR data on the same-day overpass
    dates. For the Ripperdan site, Sentinel-2 SR data, S30 (Tile 11SKA) product from
    the NASA Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) project (http://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/),
    were used instead to sharpen ECOSTRESS and VIIRS LST. Landsat 8 at-sensor brightness
    temperature observations (resampled to 30-m resolution using the cubic convolution
    method) downloaded from USGS were atmospherically corrected via MODTRAN (Berk
    et al., 1987) following procedures developed for the Landsat Collection 2 standard
    LST product (Cook et al., 2014) and using input atmospheric profiles from the
    Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2;
    Rienecker et al., 2011). ECOSTRESS Level 2 Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity
    products collected from Jet Propulsion Laboratory are atmospherically corrected
    with the Radiative Transfer for TOVS algorithm (RTTOVS; Saunders et al., 2018)
    with atmospheric profiles from the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version
    5 (GEOS-5) reanalysis product (Bosilovich et al., 2008). VIIRS I5 at-sensor brightness
    temperature observations (resampled to a 0.004 degree resolution using bilinear
    interpolation) were downloaded from NASA LANCE and atmospherically corrected using
    a single channel inversion (Price, 1983) based on atmospheric profiles of temperature
    and moisture from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis V2 (Saha et al., 2014).
    Radiometrically and geometrically calibrated ECOSTRESS LST and VIIRS TIR swath
    data products over the three sites were gridded to the same spatial grid (30 m,
    UTM projection) as the Landsat 8/HLS (S30) SR data prior to sharpening to avoid
    artificial pixel misalignments when cutting them to the same size. Tests regarding
    swath gridding methods are described in Section 3.2 with results shown in Section
    4.4.1. During the sharpening process, the resampled 30-m LST was first aggregated
    to approximately native resolution for training LST-SR relationship, to 90 m for
    Landsat and ECOSTRESS and 390 m for VIIRS. UAV LST over the Ripperdan site was
    collected from flights performed at an elevation 400 m (~1300 ft) above ground
    level and completed within 20 mins to ensure the changes of surface temperature
    in time is less than 0.5 K (restriction is based on patterns found from ground
    temperature measurements). The on-board instrumentation includes the custom 12MP
    Red-Green-Blue and NIR optical sensors, and a radiometrically calibrated thermal
    camera (model 9640-P) from Infrared Cameras Incorporated (ICI; https://infraredcameras.com/),
    which were integrated into a UAV payload by the AggieAir UAV Research Group. Thermal
    images were processed using Agisoft software (https://www.agisoft.com/downloads/user-manuals/)
    under the Average Blending mode during Texture generation. The resulted thermal
    image and emissivity were not corrected for atmospheric effects due to the lack
    of local emissivity values for vineyards and soil, while estimation of emissivity
    for thermal sensors at a small pixel scale (submeter) remains an active area of
    research (Torres-Rua et al., 2019; Torres-Rua et al., 2020). For the Sierra Loma
    and Barrelli sites, sharpened ECOSTRESS and VIIRS LST were compared to sharpened
    Landsat 8 LST data. For Ripperdan, UAV data on 5 August were collected at both
    10:44 AM (typical Landsat time) and 12:34 PM (solar noon); the latter with an
    acerage of ~1 mile2 was selected for comparison, being closer to the ECOSTRESS
    and VIIRS overpass times (Torres-Rua et al., 2018). The UAV LST data were also
    projected to the same projection system and resampled to 30 m resolution to facilitate
    the comparison with sharpened results. All the SR and TIR data used in sharpening
    tests and the corresponding acquisition date, overpass time, view angle and nominal
    resolution are summarized in Table 2. While Landsat scenes are constrained to
    view angles of <7°, the ECOSTRESS and VIIRS swaths extend to ~25° and ~56°, respectively,
    with potential impacts on effective resolution and sharpening performance. Anderson
    et al. (2020, in review) note degradation in ECOSTRESS resolution beyond ~20°.
    The sub-swath scenes used here, however, were all collected at view angles <17°
    and do not show significant visual impacts of resolution degradation. Compared
    to VIIRS predecessors, an important design feature of VIIRS is constrained off-nadir
    pixel growth (Cao et al., 2013; Schueler et al., 2013; Wolfe et al., 2013). Specifically,
    VIIRS restricts the pixel to at most two-fold (2:1) growth from nadir to edge-of-scan
    (~56° off-nadir). Although the view angle on DOY 216 over Sierra Loma site is
    relatively large (40°) and there is some degradation of VIIRS pixel size (up to
    ~600 m), the use of a relaxed EC box size in our thermal sharpening is expected
    to relieve the impact of this issue. Prior to sharpening, pixels contaminated
    by forest fires and smoke plumes, clouds and cloud shadows at all sites were excluded
    using the QA band generated from the CFMask algorithm (Zhu and Woodcock, 2012)
    for Landsat/HLS-S30, L2 Cloud mask for ECOSTRESS, and the cloud mask associated
    with the fire product (375-m I-band) for VIIRS. Within the Barrelli domain, ocean
    pixels were additionally masked out, leading to a greatly reduced number of pixels
    for sharpening. Therefore, the threshold cv is set as 0.15 for Landsat and ECOSTRESS
    and 0.25 for VIIRS LST sharpening respectively over the Barrelli domain. With
    these thresholds we obtain approximately 252,254 (36.5% of all pixels) and 14,491
    (40.3%) samples for training cubist regression trees for Landsat/ECOSTRESS LST
    sharpening and VIIRS LST sharpening, respectively. Similarly, we obtain 723,267–1,284,785
    (37.8%–50.2%) samples for Landsat/ECOSTRESS sharpening and 35,671–79,656 (47.8%–50.8%)
    samples for VIIRS sharpening over the Sierra Loma and Ripperdan domain. For both
    Landsat 8 and HLS (S30), SR data from six VSWIR bands (Blue, Green, Red, NIR (B8A
    for S30), SWIR 1 and SWIR 2) bands were employed to sharpen TIR LST data. Surface
    reflectance has been shown to aggregate linearly by simple areal averaging (Anderson
    et al., 2004a), while TIR data are more appropriately aggregated according to
    the fourth power of Stephan–Boltzmann law (Agam et al., 2007b). For LST aggregation,
    LST was first converted to radiance following Stephan–Boltzmann law, the radiances
    were averaged to the target coarse resolution and then converted back to temperature
    fields. Linear aggregation of LST without considering the Stephan-Boltzmann law
    was also employed in previous studies (Merlin et al., 2010) and only small differences
    were obtained between the two aggregations (Liu et al., 2006). In DMS sharpening,
    we employed the Stephan–Boltzmann law for LST aggregation. 3.2. Swath TIR data
    gridding methods ECOSTRESS L2 LST and VIIRS 375 m TIR data are both provided in
    swath format and need to be gridded and resampled to the SR grid prior to sharpening.
    Studies have demonstrated that the proper combination of gridding/resampling and
    sharpening techniques can improve sharpening results (Chen et al., 2014; Singh
    Rawat et al., 2019; Sismanidis et al., 2017). Allen et al. (2008) suggested the
    use of the nearest neighbor (NN) method for LST resampling, which allows the identification
    of locations of the original thermal pixels. However, for thermal sharpening involving
    multi-sensor data, image co-registration errors between the VSWIR and thermal
    bands may reduce the reliability of the NN method. Bilinear interpolation is another
    widely used resampling approach for gridding thermal images to VSWIR image scale
    for sharpening (Anderson et al., 2004b). This approach may help to relieve geolocation
    errors induced by image misalignments because it incorporates adjacent pixels
    for resampling. Given these considerations, we evaluated the feasibility of both
    NN and bilinear interpolations in resampling VIIRS LST in conjunction with the
    DMS sharpening approach. The method with the better performance was then selected
    for further use. VIIRS was used for this test because the scale difference between
    the native (375 m) and target (30 m) image for VIIRS is much larger than that
    of ECOSTRESS. The difference in resampling strategies therefore has a larger impact
    on gridding and sharpening results for VIIRS LST than for ECOSTRESS LST. 3.3.
    Experiment design The primary goal of this study is to examine the utility of
    the standard and modified DMS algorithm for thermal sharpening based on multi-source
    data and to identify optimal EC box sizes for operational applications. To achieve
    this goal, we conducted a series of registration and sharpening experiments. We
    first quantified misregistration errors for the selected ECOSTRESS and VIIRS LST
    scenes relative to the Landsat 8/ HLS (S30) SR data. We employed five spatial
    subsets for each study site that include a variety of landscape structures and
    vegetation cover classes to have a good representation of land types. For each
    subset, the LST grid was shifted N-S and E-W in 30-m increments over a range of
    ±5 and 13 pixels for ECOSTRESS and VIIRS, respectively. For each shift, we computed
    the correlation coefficient (CC) between LST and NDVI computed from the red and
    NIR SR data. The magnitude of the shift vector associated with the maximum CC
    was defined as the nominal image misalignment. In the next step, we conducted
    two types of simulated sharpening experiments, emulating idealized ECOSTRESS and
    VIIRS sharpening, by using SR and LST data from Landsat 8. In the simulated-ECOSTRESS
    case, the Landsat 8 LST at native resolution (comparable to ECOSTRESS native resolution)
    were shifted relative to the SR images in varying magnitudes encompassing the
    typical misalignment identified in the first step. To simulate misalignments between
    VIIRS LST and Landsat 8 SR images, the Landsat 8 LST images were first resampled
    to 390 m (comparable to VIIRS native resolution) and then shifted by varying increments.
    The shifted LST images in both cases were sharpened to 30-m resolution and compared
    with the 30-m reference LST that was sharpened from the original (unshifted) Landsat
    LST. The aggregated and shifted Landsat LST data at ~390-m scale (VIIRS simulation)
    were also sharpened to 90-m resolution and compared with unsharpened Landsat LST
    for an evaluation at the Landsat native scale. The simulated experiments help
    us to understand the impact of the image misalignment on sharpening in the absence
    of other factors (e.g., differences in overpass time and view angle). The experiments
    were conducted over the Sierra Loma site. Finally, we conducted actual sharpening
    experiments over the three target sites (Sierra Loma, Barrelli and Ripperdan),
    refining ECOSTRESS/VIIRS LST images to 30-m resolution using Landsat/ HLS (S30)
    SR data. In comparison with the simulated sharpening, differences in LST/SR image
    characteristics (e.g., overpass time and view angle) among sensors and the intrinsic
    geolocation errors for ECOSTRESS and VIIRS can affect the results. For the Sierra
    Loma and Barrelli sites, SR data were obtained from Landsat 8 and the sharpened
    30-m ECOSTRESS and VIIRS LST were evaluated against sharpened 30-m Landsat 8 LST.
    In addition, VIIRS LST was also sharpened to 90-m resolution for a direct comparison
    with the Landsat 8 LST without sharpening (~100 m native resolution). For the
    Ripperdan site, the HLS S30 product was used to sharpen ECOSTRESS/ VIIRS LST due
    to the lack of Landsat 8 SR data. The aggregated 30-m UAV LST was used as a reference
    to evaluate the sharpened results at this site. 3.4. Evaluation metrics Sharpening
    results from the modified DMS technique were evaluated both visually and quantitatively.
    An essential motivation of the modified DMS approach with a relaxed EC box size
    is to help relieve impacts of registration errors on the sharpened image, such
    as blurriness at boundaries and discontinuities shown in the example in Fig. 2.
    This both improves the visual fidelity of the sharpened image as well as the spatial
    correspondence with surface reflectance-based inputs to land-surface modeling
    systems. Therefore, visual comparisons between sharpened and reference LST imagery
    play an important role in our evaluation, providing a qualitative understanding
    of the sharpening accuracy and potential artifacts. Along with visual comparisons,
    we rely on the quantitative evaluation to help determine an optimal EC box size
    that jointly minimizes the impacts of registration errors (reducing blurry boundaries)
    while maximizing information content (fidelity to the unsharpened image) in the
    sharpened image. For quantitative evaluation, we used statistical metrics including
    correlation coefficient (CC) and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE)
    (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) to assess the spectral similarity between sharpened
    and reference LST. CC is not sensitive to systematic errors, so it is not heavily
    impacted by large systematic over- or underprediction. Unlike CC, NSE is sensitive
    to dispersions of data (Krause et al., 2005; Legates and McCabe Jr, 1999). As
    complements to CC and NSE, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error
    (RMSE) were used to quantify the difference between sharpened and reference LST
    data, which includes both systematic and unsystematic errors. RMSE is relatively
    more sensitive to the variability of errors than MAE. RMSE can be divided into
    Systematic Root Mean Square Error (RMSEs) and Unsystematic Root Mean Square Error
    (RMSEu), as defined in Eq. (1) (Willmott et al., 1985): (1a) (1b) (1c) where Pi
    and Oi represent sharpened and reference LST value at location i, N is the number
    of total pixels in the LST image, and is the ordinary least square estimate of
    Pi derived from the regression of P on O. RMSEs estimates the model''s linear
    (i.e., systematic) error while RMSEu evaluates the amount of the discrepancy that
    comes from randomness or other error sources. Unless the sharpened ECOSTRESS or
    VIIRS LST images are collected at the same time as the reference LST images (Landsat
    or UAV), which rarely occurs for cases employing multiple sensor data, the diurnal
    changes in LST can lead to systematic discrepancies that are real and cannot be
    corrected for by the sharpening process. For most cases, we rely primarily on
    CC or RMSEu, in which the impact from diurnal LST changes can be largely eliminated.
    To ensure that the sharpening process does not strongly alter the LST map at its
    native scale, an additional fidelity metric is also introduced. Fidelity is evaluated
    by the RMSE between the unsharpened LST map and the sharpened map reaggregated
    to native resolution. Optimal sharpening parameters will tend to both maximize
    CC with the reference LST image and minimize the lack of fidelity with respect
    to the original LST image. 4. Results 4.1. Typical sensor image misalignment For
    sharpening involving multi-sensor data, image misalignment between TIR and VSWIR
    datasets due to differences in geolocation accuracy is a key reason for the use
    of a relaxed EC box size. To assess expected misregistration errors between ECOSTRESS/VIIRS
    and Landsat 8/ HLS (S30), we evaluated correlations between LST and shifted NDVI
    over the three study sites for a range of inter-image 30-m shifts. To better sample
    different landscape structures, we employed five spatial subsets for each study
    site that include a variety of landscapes and landcover types. Shifts ranged between
    −5 and 5 pixels in both x and y for ECOSTRESS and − 13 to 13 for VIIRS considering
    their differences in spatial resolutions. The CC between NDVI and LST was then
    computed after each shift, and the shift corresponding to the maximum CC was regarded
    as the optimal shift or nominal image misalignment. For both ECOSTRESS and VIIRS
    data over the three sites, it was found that the identified misalignment varied
    among the different subsets, suggesting spatial heterogeneity in geolocation accuracy
    difference. Consequently, the optimal shift identified in this study may only
    represent the ‘average’ misalignment of the entire scene, so we also report the
    range in identified shifts. The range of the magnitude of the shifts for the ECOSTRESS
    data is 30–67 m (46 m on average), 0–42 m (26 m), and 42–67 m (54 m), for Sierra
    Loma, Barrelli and Ripperdan respectively – nominally 30–90 m in terms of integral
    30-m Landsat pixel units. For VIIRS data, the magnitude of the shifts over the
    three sites ranges from 60 to 95 m (75 m), 67–150 m (102 m), and 95–134 m (115
    m), respectively – nominally 60–150 m. These expected errors will have ramifications
    for the selection of sensor-specific EC box size. For reference, the spatial co-registration
    error between Landsat and Sentinel-2 data is around 15 m for the 30-m products
    (L30 and S30) of HLS (Claverie et al., 2018). The geolocation accuracy at nadir
    of ECOSTRESS is on the order of 50 m (Smyth and Leprince, 2018) and that of VIIRS
    is on the order of 85 m (Cao et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017; Wolfe et al., 2012).
    4.2. Landsat sharpening with simulated shifts The capability of the standard DMS
    approach for sharpening Landsat LST to 30 m has been assessed over various land
    cover types (Gao et al., 2012). The sharpened 30-m LST shows reasonable accuracy
    and structure and has been widely applied to field-scale ET and crop yield mapping
    (Anderson et al., 2012; Knipper et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2017). Therefore, this
    30-m LST, representing an optimal DMS sharpened result, is used here as a reference
    in investigating the impact of the relaxed EC box size on sharpening using misaligned
    images in attempts to reduce artifacts as evident in Fig. 2. Aggregated Landsat
    LST serves as a proxy for ECOSTRESS and VIIRS thermal imagery with known registration
    errors. 4.2.1. Simulated ECOSTRESS experiment In this experiment, the Landsat
    8 LST images at native resolution (100 m; close to ECOSTRESS resolution) were
    artificially shifted with respect to the SR images by 30 to 150 m in the northwest
    (NW) and southeast (SE) directions. The LST images were then sharpened to 30-m
    resolution using a set of EC box sizes ranging from 90 m to 1530 m with a 90-m
    interval, where the 90-m EC box size refers to the standard DMS method. The sharpened
    results were visually and quantitatively compared with the reference LST (i.e.,
    unshifted Landsat 8 LST sharpened to 30-m). The sharpening results were similar
    for shifts toward the NW and SE based on quantitative metrics; therefore, only
    results from the SE shifts are illustrated (Fig. 6). Download : Download high-res

    (e) RMSE between the sharpened LST reaggregated to 90 m and the unsharpened Landsat
    LST as a function of EC box size and without EC (labelled as ‘<no EC>’). As shown
    in Fig. 6, the sharpening test with the smallest image shift results in the highest
    accuracy and fidelity, highlighting the undermining effect of sensor misalignment
    on thermal sharpening. For tests with image shifts of 30 and 60 m, the sharpening
    accuracy shows a declining trend with EC box size, and the highest accuracy is
    achieved using the smallest EC box size of 90 m, close to the native resolution
    of the LST imagery. However, this trend changes as the image shift increases to
    90 m or larger. In these tests, relaxing the EC box size from 90 to 180 m – as
    in the modified DMS approach – produced improved sharpening results. This upward
    trend slows and eventually reverses as EC box size continues to increase, indicating
    diminishing returns in relieving the shift-induced misregistration. This may be
    attributed to 1) loss of high spatial frequency LST information as the sharpened
    image increasingly reflects the SR image content and 2) the fact that the increase
    of the area of overlapped LST and SR information gradually becomes marginal as
    seen in the trends shown in Fig. 3. Factor 1 is quantified by the fidelity metric
    in Fig. 6e. The use of EC boxes with increasing size will generally degrade the
    fidelity of the sharpened LST image at the native resolution scale, while sharpening
    without imposing EC process may lead to large errors (Fig. 6e). In combination,
    these indicators narrow the selection of an optimal EC box size. Based on the
    quantitative metrics, the optimal EC box sizes for 90-, 120-, 150-m image shifts
    are around 270–360 m, 360–540 m, 540–630 m, respectively. Larger misalignment
    errors require a larger EC box size to obtain the optimal performance. The sharpening
    simulation tests suggest that the overlapped area should reach around 45–55% (as
    shown in Fig. 4) to obtain optimal sharpening results. Fig. 7 demonstrates the
    impacts of the EC box size relaxation in sharpening an LST image with an artificial
    shift of (4, −4) pixels/ (120,−120) m in the SE direction. Compared to the reference
    sharpened LST image (Fig. 7b), the misregistered image sharpened using a 90-m
    EC box has blurry edges and bleeding of structure across sharp field boundaries
    (Fig. 7c). In contrast, the use of a 270-m EC box substantially reduces these
    effects (Fig. 7d). Absolute differences between sharpened and reference images
    show that the 90-m EC box produced large residuals around object edges, while
    residuals are smaller and more diffused when using a 270-m EC box (Fig. 7g-h).

    legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) It should
    be noted that, for the simulated experiment, the artificial image shift (co-registration
    error) is the only factor impacting the performance of the modified DMS approach.
    In contrast, for real sharpening experiments involving multi-sensor data, other
    factors including acquisition time differences between sensors also play a role.
    It is reasonable to hypothesize that the effect of image misalignment in real
    LST images will be larger than in the simulated experiments. For ECOSTRESS, the
    90-m shift in Fig. 6 encompasses the maximum displacement measured in Section
    4.1, suggesting an optimal EC box size of approximately 270 m for ECOSTRESS LST
    sharpening. 4.2.2. Simulated VIIRS experiment In this experiment, the Landsat
    8 LST images were first aggregated to 390 m (close to VIIRS native resolution).
    We followed a similar strategy to the simulated ECOSTRESS experiment in Section
    4.2.1 but employing a different set of image shifts and EC box sizes due to the
    image resolution difference. In this case we aritificially shifted the aggregated
    LST images by 60 to 180 m in the SE direction. The shifted LST images were sharpened
    to 30 m with the EC box sizes ranging from 390 m to 3900 m with a 390-m interval,
    where 390-m EC box size indicates the standard DMS method. The sharpened 30-m
    LST from unshifted Landsat 8 LST was used as reference to evaluate the sharpened
    images with artificial shifts. As shown in Fig. 8, results similar to the simulated
    ECOSTRESS experiment are obtained in this sharpening exercise. The maximum magnitude
    of displacement between VIIRS LST and Landsat SR estimated over the three study
    sites was 150 m (Section 4.1), suggesting an optimal EC box size for VIIRS sharpening
    of approximately 780 m. Download : Download high-res image (885KB) Download :

    a final set of VIIRS simulations by sharpening the 360-m aggregated Landsat LST
    to 90-m resolution for a range of EC box sizes and using unsharpened 90-m Landsat
    LST as the reference. The results (not shown) are similar to those in Fig. 8,
    and confirm the selection of 780 m as the optimal EC size for the simulated VIIRS
    sharpening. In the following sections, we investigate the performance of the modified
    DMS using multi-sensor data. 4.3. ECOSTRESS LST sharpening DMS sharpening experiments
    were conducted with real ECOSTRESS LST data collected over the Sierra Loma and
    Barrelli sites on 04 August 2018 and 11 August 2018, respectively. With Landsat
    8 SR data as inputs, the ECOSTRESS LST was sharpened to 30-m resolution with a
    set of EC box sizes ranging from 90 to 810 m with an interval of 90 m. The Landsat
    8 LST data were also sharpened to 30-m resolution and used as reference for evaluating
    the sharpened 30-m ECOSTRESS LST. The sharpening tests were conducted over the
    whole Landsat scene while four quantitative measures were calculated over a 12
    × 12 km subset area centered on the GRAPEX instrumented vineyards at the Sierra
    Loma and Barrelli sites, respectively. The modified DMS technique was also evaluated
    over the Ripperdan site on 05 August 2018 using the same set of EC box size as
    at the Sierra Loma and Barrelli sites but using HLS (S30) SR as inputs. UAV airborne
    LST data collected over a 4.38 × 2.55 km area of the Ripperdan site were used
    as reference to evaluate the sharpening results. For evaluation purposes, the
    0.6-m UAV LST image was aggregated to 30 m. Fig. 9 illustrates sharpening performance
    in terms of four quantitative metrics: CC, NSE, MAE, and RMSE. We use varying
    ranges in the y-axes for the three sites to better highlight the variations of
    metrics. For the three study sites, the sharpening accuracy based on these metrics
    shows a relatively large increase as the EC box size increases from 90 m, indicating
    an enhanced performance of the modified DMS approach over the standard DMS in
    which the EC process was carried out at near native resolution scale (90 m). The
    overall behavior in performance metrics in Fig. 9 is similar to that of simulated
    experiments (Fig. 6) with shifts of 90 m, encompassing the maximum displacement
    identified in Section 4.1. This suggests that factors in addition to a linear
    shift are impacting the combined ECOSTRESS-Landsat sharpening in these cases,
    and the simulations in Fig. 6 represent a best-case misalignment scenario with
    same-platform datasets. Additional factors may include non-linear, spatially variable
    shifts (warping), differences in time-of-day and surface illumination, and differences
    in view angle. At large values of EC box size, the positive benefits of relaxing
    EC box size asymptote similar to the simulated experiment in Fig. 6 and the response
    of overlapped area to the EC box size in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res

    MAE and (d) RMSE between the sharpened 30-m Landsat 8 LST (reference) and 30-m
    ECOSTRESS LST with EC box size (m) over the Sierra Loma, Barrelli, and Ripperdan
    sites. In comparison with the simulated experiment, the trends of sharpening accuracy
    with respect to EC box size in ECOSTRESS LST sharpening shows larger fluctuations,
    particularly at the Barrelli site which is characterized by significant topographic
    variability and attendant sensitivity to sun and view angle in both the thermal
    and reflectance bands. These fluctuations may also be linked to systematic LST
    differences between the ECOSTRESS and Landsat 8/UAV data due to overpass time
    difference and variable response among land covers with distinct thermal properties.
    CC shows lower fluctuations than other metrics because it is less sensitive to
    systematic LST differences resulting from diurnal changes and thus may be more
    reliable in evaluating the DMS algorithm. In addition to the fluctuations, the
    magnitude of improvement of sharpening accuracy in terms of the four quantitative
    metrics for these real ECOSTRESS sharpening experiments (Fig. 9) is less significant
    than in the simulated experiment (Fig. 6), which represents a best-case scenario
    with scene-wide uniform shift and simultaneous TIR and VSWIR acquisition. Spatially
    varying shifts and differences in acquisition time in ECOSTRESS/Landsat imagery
    add noise that serves to reduce the realized improvement. Furthermore, it should
    be noted that the sub-scenes over which these statistics are computed, while heterogeneous
    and rich in structure, are dominated really by fields and natural vegetation patches
    that are internally homogeneous. The change of EC box size will have less impact
    on the sharpening results in these homogeneous patches compared to regions of
    discontinuity (e.g., field boundaries), which comprise a relatively small proportions
    of the statistical domains. The RMSE statistics average the results from all areas
    and understate the significance of the improvements of the modified DMS approach.
    Still, the trends in the statistical metrics can be used in combination with visual
    evaluations to determine the optimal EC box size, as will be discussed in detail
    later. The following subsections show visual examples of sharpening results at
    the three test sites and discuss unique site-specific features of DMS performance.
    4.3.1. Sierra Loma site Fig. 10 shows a visual comparison of sharpened ECOSTRESS
    LST images over the Sierra Loma subset area using different EC box sizes with
    the reference sharpened Landsat LST image. While absolute temperature range differs
    between the Landsat and ECOSTRESS images due to different overpass times (accommodated
    by the greyscale stretch), the spatial patterns in the surface temperature fields
    are comparable between the two systems. The increasing clarity in sharpened ECOSTRESS
    LST images (Fig. 10c-i) demonstrates the effectiveness of the DMS technique for
    improving spatial detail and compatibility between sensors (Fig. 10b). Using the
    sharpened Landsat 8 LST (Fig. 10b) as reference, EC box sizes larger than 90 m
    result in much clearer field boundaries in the ECOSTRESS LST sharpening, as well
    as larger temperature contrast across the scene. Pixel-to-pixel scatterplots of
    sharpened ECOSTRESS LST vs. reference LST are shown in Fig. 11 for the subset
    area in Fig. 10. Scatter reduces around the best-fit regression line and correlation
    improves with EC box size up to about 450 m, as demonstrated in Fig. 9. The offset
    above the one-to-one line reflects systematic time-of-day-induced differences
    between the two LST fields and is expected. Download : Download high-res image

    are stretched to match LST contrast between sensors (Landsat: 25–55°C; ECOSTRESS:

    Note, however, that by increasing the EC box size we are effectively forcing sharpened
    LST structure to resemble more and more the SR patterns, albeit using data-driven
    regressions developed near the native LST resolution. While the sharpened images
    may “look better” visually with large EC boxes, we may lose important LST signals
    in areas where the LST-SR relationship is atypical. The EC residuals in these
    discrepant areas can convey valuable information, for example recent irrigation
    or management activity (Anderson et al., 2004b). The goal is to select a nominal
    EC size that jointly minimizes impacts of registration errors while maximizing
    information content in the sharpened thermal image. This choice is exemplified
    in the Sierra Loma subset region highlighted in Fig. 12, zooming in on a 6 × 6
    km (200 × 200 30-m pixels) patch of irrigated agricultural land, specifically
    focusing on the fields indicated by a black box in the center of the scene. For
    the vegetated field (upper patch), a 90-m EC box allowed some bleeding of high
    LST from the adjacent bare field (lower patch) due to image misalignment. This
    bleeding is alleviated with larger boxes, with diminishing returns beyond 270
    m. The correction afforded at that scale has important implications for the further
    use of sharpened LST for hydrological applications (e.g., evapotranspiration and
    crop water demand estimates) at sub-field to field scales. Download : Download

    of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
    web version of this article.) 4.3.2. Barrelli site In comparison with Sierra Loma,
    the Barrelli site shows larger fluctuations in performance metrics in response
    to EC box size (Fig. 9). This is due in part to the smaller sample size used in
    sharpening resulting from the masking of ocean and smoke plume pixels. In addition,
    the large proportion of mountainous areas in the Barrelli scene will introduce
    variability due to the complex interactions between terrain shadowing and sensor
    overpass time differences. Visual comparisons of reference and sharpened thermal
    images from Barrelli are illustrated in Fig. 13. Consistent with the Sierra Loma
    site, the original unsharpened LST (Fig. 13c) in Barrelli is much blurrier than
    the sharpened LST (Fig. 13d-i). Similar to the results based on quantitative metrics
    (Fig. 9), the visual comparison illustrates the benefits of relaxing EC box size
    beyond 90 m, in this case particularly in capturing the textures in the mountains.
    As with Sierra Loma (Fig. 10, Fig. 12), EC box sizes above 180–270 m do not significantly
    improve visual clarity. Download : Download high-res image (3MB) Download : Download

    the GRAPEX vineyard sites (Fig. 14). While the UAV image extent is significantly
    smaller than the sharpened Landsat reference scenes used for evaluation at Sierra
    Loma and Barrelli, the 0.6 m native resolution of the thermal data affords direct
    assessment of thermal structures at 30 m. The lower correlations and higher RMSE
    and MAE at Ripperdan compared to the other sites, reported in Fig. 9, are partially
    due to the smaller sample size used to compute the statistics. In addition, differences
    in sensors and LST retrieval between the UAV and satellite datasets may contribute
    additional noise (Torres-Rua et al., 2019). For example, the lack of atmospheric
    correction to the UAV may account in part for the systematic underestimation of
    LST in comparison to ECOSTRESS data (Fig. 14b-c). RMSE is also inflated due to
    diurnal changes in surface temperature between the acquisition time of the UAV
    airborne data (12:34 PM, PST) and ECOSTRESS data (2:03 PM, PST). The unsystematic
    component of RMSE (RMSEu) is more comparable between sites (1.46–1.79 K; 1.24–1.32
    K; 1.51–1.57 K over Ripperdan, Sierra Loma and Barrelli, respectively), suggesting
    a relatively large systematic RMSE that is very likely the primary reason for
    the negative NSE (not seen in the other two sites). Download : Download high-res

    colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
    article.) Fig. 14b-i provides a visual comparison of reference UAV LST imagery
    over Ripperdan and sharpened ECOSTRESS LST fields for EC box size ranging from
    90 to 540 m with an interval of 90 m. For EC box sizes of 180 m and larger, temperature
    patterns more completely fill the field boundaries. For example, in the subset
    area indicated by the left-most black box (Fig. 14a), the LST image sharpened
    with a 90-m EC box (Fig. 14d) shows little temperature contrast between fields
    with denser (the left patch) and sparser vegetation (the right two patches). These
    contrasting thermal conditions seen in the UAV image are better defined at field
    scale with larger EC boxes (Fig. 14e-i). As discussed in Section 4.3.1, excessively
    large EC box sizes may lead to loss of signal in features where the LST-SR relationship
    is atypical, and a reduced fidelity to the unsharpened LST. Residual maps, showing
    the differences between the sharpened and unsharpened ECOSTRESS LST at the 90-m
    pixel scale demonstrate the loss of fidelity with larger EC box size (Fig. 14j-o).
    In the subset area highlighted by the lower-right black box (Fig. 14a), the left-most
    field (vegetated) patch has a higher temperature in the unsharpened ECOSTRESS
    LST image than the two fields on the right (Fig. 14c). For EC boxes of 360 m and
    higher, this temperature contrast reverses in the sharpened images. This is highlighted
    by the increasing residuals in Fig. 14l-o. The constrast between unsharpened and
    sharpened image in these fields suggest that the impact of atypical LST-SR relationship
    may be amplified when the EC box size is large. 4.3.4. Site summary Based on the
    collective sharpening results and analysis over the Sierra Loma, Barrelli, and
    Ripperdan sites, we recommend using an EC box size of 180–270 m for the ECOSTRESS
    LST sharpening. There are a few reasons for this choice. 1) The use of a relaxed
    EC box size of 180–270 m improves the sharpening accuracy over the use of 90 m
    (around the native resolution of ECOSTRESS). 2) The sharpening accuracy after
    270 m gradually becomes insignificant with increased fluctuations and sometimes
    turns into a downward trend. 3) The relaxation of the EC box can lead to loss
    of spatial thermal detail, especially for large EC box sizes. 4.4. VIIRS LST sharpening
    4.4.1. Selection of resampling strategy Using the Sierra Loma site as a case study,
    we employed both NN and bilinear interpolation to resample the 375-m VIIRS swath
    LST data to the 30-m SR grid to study the impacts of gridding method on DMS sharpening.
    The relative performance of the two approaches was evaluated by comparing gridded
    unsharpened VIIRS LST against Landsat LST data in terms of CC and RMSEu. In addition,
    the gridded VIIRS LST data were also sharpened to 30-m resolution with both 390-m
    and 780-m EC box sizes and compared with sharpened Landsat LST. We selected two
    400 × 400 subsets with different spatial patterns for the evaluation. Fig. 15
    indicates that the bilinear interpolation approach outperformed the NN approach
    for both the unsharpened and DMS sharpened cases, resulting in higher CC and lower
    RMSEu for both subsets. Relaxing the VIIRS EC box size from 390 to 780 m further
    improved statistical metrics. Based on these results, we adopted bilinear interpolation
    for LST swath resampling for use in the modified DMS approach. However, it should
    be noted that these experiments only represent a limited case, and more tests
    may be needed to identify which gridding/resampling approach is more generally
    suitable. In addition, it may be that these results are specific to the modified
    DMS approach, while other sharpening algorithms may benefit from a different gridding
    methodology. Download : Download high-res image (343KB) Download : Download full-size

    Loma scene. 4.4.2. Sharpening evaluation Evaluation of VIIRS LST sharpening using
    the modified DMS algorithm was conducted over the three study sites on the same
    dates as used in the ECOSTRESS analysis. The maximum image misalignment between
    VIIRS and Landsat 8/ HLS (S30) data was found in Section 4.1 to be around 150
    m, larger than that for ECOSTRESS (70 m). Therefore, based on the results from
    the simulated experiments, the optimal EC box size for VIIRS LST sharpening should
    be larger than that for ECOSTRESS. Considering the native resolution of VIIRS
    (375 m) and the larger registration errors, the range of EC box size used for
    testing VIIRS LST sharpening was set from 390 m to 3120 m with an interval of
    390 m (integer multiples of the Landsat 30-m resolution). The four quantitative
    measures of VIIRS sharpening accuracy for the prescribed set of EC box sizes are
    shown in Fig. 16. Over the Sierra Loma site, the experiment with a relaxed EC
    box size of 780 m produced an improved performance in comparison with a 390-m
    EC box based on the four metrics, consistent with sharpening via simulated-VIIRS
    LST (Fig. 8). As the EC box size continues to increase from 780 m, CC broadly
    indicates decreased sharpening accuracy. While the other three metrics point to
    increased accuracy, the change rate is relatively small. In general, 780 m appears
    to be a good candidate for the optimal EC box size. Another set of experiments
    with EC box size ranging from 450 to 720 m with a 90-m interval (figure not shown)
    did not identify a box size with CC or other performance metrics superior to the
    780-m case, confirming to the selection of 780 m as the optimal EC size. Download

    scale requires that both Landsat 8 and VIIRS LST are sharpened using the same
    30 m Landsat 8 SR. To assess results independent of Landsat sharpening, another
    set of experiments was also conducted to sharpen the VIIRS LST to 90 m resolution
    over the Sierra Loma and Barrelli sites using Landsat 8 data at the native 100
    m resolution as the reference. The results at 90 m (Fig. 17) are similar to those
    at 30 m (Fig. 16), and the same optimal EC box size (780 m) is identified. Download

    and sharpened VIIRS LST over a 12 × 12 km subarea in the Sierra Loma scene is
    provided in Fig. 18. The sharpening results using an EC box size near the native
    resolution of VIIRS (390 m) produced LST imagery with clear field boundaries in
    comparison, similar to the reference LST imagery (Fig. 18b). This is in contrast
    to ECOSTRESS LST sharpening in which the use of near-native resolution (90 m)
    for EC box size produced LST imagery with blurry field boundaries. This is because
    the scale gap between VIIRS LST and Landsat SR (375 m to 30 m) is much larger
    than that for the ECOSTRESS case (70 m to 30 m), whereas the maximum image misalignment
    is more comparable (150 m for VIIRS and 70 m for ECOSTRESS). For VIIRS LST sharpening,
    EC at the native spatial resolution is adequately large to produce imagery with
    clear field boundaries. The 780-m EC box case better reproduces some small-scale
    features in the Landsat LST map, such as the hot bare field just west of the center.
    Therefore, and considering the statistical metrics in Fig. 16, a good candidate
    for the optimal EC box size can be 780 m. Similar results were confirmed over
    the Barrelli and Ripperdan sites (not shown). Download : Download high-res image

    of multi-source LST from ECOSTRESS, VIIRS, and Landsat provides an important path
    to improving the characterization of field-scale temporal variation in LST in
    comparison with using Landsat alone, facilitating frequent monitoring of land
    surface conditions for many applications. However, differences in spatial resolution
    between these satellite platforms do not allow easy stacking of multi-source LST
    data. The employment of the DMS algorithm in this study overcomes this difficulty
    by sharpening LST from different sources to a common spatial resolution. Based
    on the identified optimal EC box size for both ECOSTRESS (270 m) and VIIRS (780
    m) in previous sections, we selected another subset area from the Sierra Loma
    and Barrelli domains (no Landsat for Ripperdan site) to visually demonstrate the
    ability of DMS to generate stackable LST fields from multiple thermal data sources.
    Fig. 19 shows comparisons between unsharpened and sharpened images for Landsat,
    ECOSTRESS and VIIRS over the two subset areas. The sharpening process brings the
    thermal images from all three sensors to a similar level of detail; however, we
    can see that the retrieval of detail is not perfect. In the Barrelli subset area,
    for example, there are some fields with higher temperatures in the northeast corner
    (highlighted in a black box) of Landsat and ECOSTRESS LST that are not apparent
    in VIIRS LST. These high-temperature features are at significantly subpixel scale
    within the unsharpened VIIRS image but are well captured by Landsat and ECOSTRESS
    at native resolution. It is very likely that these temperature anomalies are not
    well-related to SR and cannot be well reconstructed through the EC process in
    VIIRS LST sharpening. Still, the spatial textures in the three sharpened images
    are in general comparable and can be reasonably assembled into a stackable time
    series. Download : Download high-res image (3MB) Download : Download full-size

    5. Discussion In this study, we investigate the performance of multi-sensor data
    sharpening using TIR and SR data from the same date – a best-case scenario for
    sharpening, because the surface conditions have likely not changed significantly
    between band acquisition. For ECOSTRESS, there will be TIR acquisitions on dates
    when there is no commensurate VSWIR image acquisition (e.g., between Landsat and
    Sentinel-2 overpasses). While SR data from the closest overpass can be used, this
    can create challenges and add noise to the high-resolution LST reconstruction.
    Abrupt changes in surface conditions (e.g., irrigation, harvesting, deforestation,
    etc.) between sensor overpasses can corrupt the LST-SR relationship derived in
    DMS for LST sharpening. Even non-abrupt changes (e.g., rapid vegetation biomass
    accumulation during the growing season) can introduce errors in the sharpening
    process. The EC procedure adopted in the DMS approach can, to some extent, relieve
    the negative impact of these disturbances by adjusting the sharpened LST relative
    to the raw LST. Future work employing data from different dates is needed to further
    understand the algorithm performance. The accuracy of LST sharpening ultimately
    depends on the underlying LST-SR model. Even if the SR and LST are acquired on
    the same day, the LST-SR relationship may not be able to capture all variabilities,
    particularly over areas with significant topography. The influence of topographic
    shadow changes induced by the interaction between complex terrains and sensor
    overpass time differences on LST-SR relationship can be spatially heterogeneous
    and thus contaminate the sharpening results at the scene scale. For example, the
    sharpening accuracy in the Barrelli site shows considerable fluctuations in response
    to EC size changes, which may be linked to the contaminating effect of the complex
    terrain and overpass time differences (10:51 am for Landsat, 12:04 pm for ECOSTRESS
    and 1:30 pm for VIIRS). To improve the sharpening, incorporation of more spectral
    band observations may be a useful path because it allows more information to characterize
    the LST-SR relationship. For instance, the three red-edge bands from the Sentinel-2
    satellite that have not been used in this study are good candidates to be employed
    in future work and may have potential to improve sharpening results. In addition,
    a more advanced machine learning approach such as deep learning algorithms may
    improve the LST-SR model. This is important especially for a coarse resolution
    sensor such as VIIRS since LST spatial details mainly come from the LST-SR model.
    The threshold of cv, an important parameter in building the LST-SR model, determines
    the relative homogeneity of an LST-SR sample at LST spatial resolution. In this
    study, we used cv threshold of 0.1 for Landsat and ECOSTRESS and 0.2 for VIIRS.
    A different cv threshold may be needed for other sensors for selecting sufficient
    and relatively homogeneous samples. Relaxing the EC size is a remedy for the misalignment
    between TIR and SWIR sensors from different satellite platforms. A better co-registration
    between sensors is needed for further improving LST sharpening. 6. Conclusion
    In this study, the DMS approach, which has shown good performance for thermal
    sharpening based on data from a single platform, was employed to sharpen ECOSTRESS
    and VIIRS LST images using SR data from HLS products over three selected sites
    (Sierra Loma, Barrelli and Ripperdan site) in California. A modification to the
    standard DMS approach was investigated to address potential misregistration between
    SR and LST images collected on different platforms; namely, the relaxation of
    the spatial scale at which sharpened and unsharpened LST images are forced to
    match via the energy conservation step. Based on shift experiments maximizing
    the correlation between NDVI and LST fields, typical subscene-scale misregistration
    between the ECOSTRESS and Landsat 8/HLS (S30) data used in this study was determined
    to be around 30–70 m and approximately 60–150 m for the VIIRS data. Results from
    the sharpening experiments demonstrate the superiority of modified DMS over standard
    DMS, suggesting the effectiveness of relaxing sampling window and EC box in reducing
    impacts due to the co-registration error among different satellites. Other factors
    (e.g., overpass time and data quality differences) that might impact the sharpening
    results were also discussed. The results from these experiments suggest five committees
    for cubist regression tree training, a 5 × 5/ 15 × 15 window for sampling process
    and an optimal EC box size of 180–270 m/ 780 m for ECOSTRESS/ VIIRS LST sharpening
    are reasonably good candidates for future applications. This study improves our
    understanding of the capability of the thermal sharpening approach in handling
    multi-source data and provides solutions to deal with the challenge facing such
    sharpening. The development of an operational DMS framework that can be applied
    routinely to HLS, ECOSTRESS and VIIRS data over a variety of landscapes is in
    progress. Future work will be aimed at using these multi-source LST images to
    generate evapotranspiration estimates with high temporal frequency and at sub-field
    spatial resolutions, for applications in monitoring of crop water use and stress.

    technology 1. Introduction Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of smart things
    that share information over the internet. The smart things are used to deploy
    in a different environment to capture the information, and some events are triggered.
    The applications of IoT is a smart city, smart home, Intelligent transportation
    system, agriculture, hospital, supply chain system, earthquake detection, a smart
    grid system. As per CISCO estimated, the IoT devices connected will be 50 billion
    at the end of 2020. The grown of IoT devices is rapidly changing as it crosses
    the total world population. The data generated by the IoT devices are enormous.
    In traditional IoT, architecture is three types physical, network, and application
    layer. In the physical layer, devices are embedded with some technology which
    way they sense the environment and also able to connect in wired or wireless to
    the other device. Like in the smart home system fridge can place an order automatically
    to the registered retailer whenever the fruits chamber empty it, and notification
    will be sent to the home users. The similarity in smart hospital patients can
    monitor in an emergency through sensors and corresponding computing devices. As
    the sensors are low-end devices, less computation power, and have heterogeneous
    properties. Implementation of IoT comes with lots of challenges. The standardization,
    interoperability, data storage, processing, trust management, identity, confidentiality,
    integrity, availability, security, and privacy are some of the open challenges
    in various IoT applications [1]. The IoT is one of the most emerging technologies
    in the last decade and its uses in numerous applications area. Security and privacy
    are still challenges in many applications area. Some research work addressing
    security and privacy issue in IoT is already done. But as the new technology comes,
    which can address so of the security issue in IoT. So in this work, authors have
    identified three leading technologies like ML, Blockchain, and AI, which address
    different security issues. 1.1. Objective and contribution The main objective
    of this survey is to find out the security and privacy challenges that exist in
    IoT applications. The authors also identified some emerging technology that can
    address security issues present in the system. Here the main goal is to find the
    research challenges and corresponding solution approach in IoT security. The following
    are the contribution of the paper: • The paper explained the IoT architecture
    and its enabling technology with challenges. • The security issues in the IoT
    system are identified as in-depth layer-wise. • An extensive survey on similar
    technologies like machine learning, artificial intelligence, and Blockchain technology
    integration with IoT security are performed. • The research challenges and corresponding
    solution approach with emerging technology (ML, AI, Blockchain) are also explained.
    1.2. Paper organization The rest of the paper organized as in Section 2 related
    work of security and privacy issues of IoT are identified, and comparison was
    also made. The IoT architecture details and associated technology are described
    in Section 3. The security issues are explained in Section 4. The different security
    issues address in IoT applications using Machine Learning, Artificial intelligence,
    and Blockchain technology are explained in detail in Sections 5–7 sequentially.
    An analysis of the entire survey and future challenges are summarized in Section
    8. The paper concludes with a summary of the work done in Section 9. 2. Related
    work The authors explain the underlying system architecture and security issues
    in paper[2]. Previously some works related to a security issue in IoT applications,
    infrastructure are already done. In Table 1, a summary of some of the survey works
    is mentioned. Although several works already exist in this regard from different
    perspectives, for implementation purposes, there is no such study done. So in
    this survey, authors have identified the recent emerging technology (ML, AI, Blockchain),
    which can be addressed security issues in IoT. Some of the work integration with
    recent technology and IoT has already been done. In this survey, the authors tried
    to give the details about the insight of that technology how it will solve security
    challenges in IoT. This will helps the reader to understand the IoT infrastructure
    creation and implementing it securely. Table 1. Related surveys work on IoT security.

    found that machine learning, Blockchain, and Artificial intelligence are the current
    solution approach to solve the Security issue in IoT. 3. Internet of things (IoT)
    infrastructure,protocol, application Internet of Things (IoT) has lots of potentials
    to apply in different real-time applications. It integrates sensors, smart devices,
    radiofrequency identification (RFID), and the Internet to build an intelligent
    system. As per Goldman Sachs estimated 28 billion smart things would be connected
    to a different network by 2020. The growth of IoT in the last decade in such a
    way that it incorporates everything from sensors to cloud computing intermediate
    with fog/edge computing. The IoT has different types of a network like a distributed,
    ubiquitous, grid, and vehicular. The applications of IoT made a huge impact in
    day to day life like sensors deploy in the patient body to monitoring in critical
    condition, monitoring gas leakage in smart kitchen, agriculture field, smart car
    parking, smart transportation, tracking goods details in supply chain system using
    sensors in the vehicle. The sensors are resource constraint devices connected
    through wired or wirelessly across heterogeneous networks. The IoT networks are
    possessed different security, privacy, and vulnerable to the attacker. 3.1. IoT
    infrastructure IoT application consists of different smart things that collect,
    process, compute and communicate with other smart things. IoT has three layers
    physical, network, and application layer. Recently industries are developed many
    things which are embedded with intelligent things. As shown in Fig. 1 IoT infrastructure
    consists of not only sensors, but it also integrates with some emerging technology.
    The IoT application is based on either IoT-Cloud or IoT-Fog-Cloud. The security
    issue like data privacy [13], machine to machine communication [14], real-time
    monitoring [15] and IoT testbed [16] are need to be addressed for efficient IoT
    applications. The architecture of IoT may be centralized, distributed, decentralized
    structure. In IoT application processing and computing in real-time is one of
    the most challenging issues. Cloud computing provides more storage and assures
    security to the data. But recently, most of the real-time monitoring IoT application
    demand processing and computing in the edge of the network. So that quick action
    can be taken like monitoring the health condition of the serious patient, fire
    detection. When processing and computing are done on the edge of the network using
    fog devices, it becomes more vulnerable to the attacker as their devices are lightweight
    device traditional security is not applicable. During analytic data, a technique
    like a machine learning is recently used to make the IoT system more intelligent
    and independent to make a decision. The different smart devices are connected
    to make an application using some standard protocols. The security issue exists
    in IoT infrastructure, which needs to be addressed to build trust among end-users
    and make the system temper-proof. The data interoperability [17] in the IoT system
    works using an intelligent algorithm. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    1. Internet of things infrastructure. 3.2. Standard protocol The basic IoT architecture
    is a four layer network. Each of these layer consists of some standard protocol
    as shown in Table 2. Table 2. Protocols & attacks on IoT layers. Protocols & possible
    attacks in IoT layers Layer Protocol name Possible security attack Application
    MQTT, CoAP, REST, AMQP Repudiation Attack, DDoS Attack, HTTP Flood Attack, SQL
    Injection Attack, Cross-Site Scripting, Parameter Tampering, Slowloris Attack
    Transport TCP, UDP, DCCP, SCTP, RSVP, QUIC SYN Flood, Smruf Attack,Injection Attack,
    Mitnick Attack, Opt-ack Attack Network CLNS, DDP, EIGRP, ICMP, IGMP, IPsec, IPv4,
    IPv6, OSPF, RIM IP Address Spoofing, DoS Attack, Black Hole Attack, Worm Hole
    Attack, Byzantine Attack, Resource Consumption Attack. Pysical DSL, ISDN, IDA,
    USB, Bluetooth, CAN, Ethernet Access Control Attack, Physical damage 0r Destruction,
    Disconnection of Physical Links 3.2.1. MQTT MQTT stands for transportation of
    MQ Telemetry. It is a straightforward and lightweight messaging protocol for publishing
    / subscribe, designed for restricted devices and low bandwidth, high latency,
    or unreliable networks. The design principles are to minimize the requirements
    for network bandwidth and device resources while also trying to ensure reliability
    and some degree of delivery assurance. These principles also result in making
    the protocol ideal for the emerging world of low end connected devices “machine-to-machine”
    (M2 M) or “Internet of Things.” 3.2.2. CoAP Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP),
    as defined in RFC 7252, is a specialized Internet Application Protocol for restricted
    devices. It allows those restricted devices called “nodes” to use similar protocols
    to communicate with the broader Internet. CoAP is designed to be used by devices
    on the same network. 3.2.3. REST REST stands for State Transfer Member. REST is
    an architecture based on web standards and uses the HTTP protocol. It revolves
    around resources where each element is a resource, and a resource is accessed
    using standard HTTP methods through a specific interface. Roy Fielding introduced
    REST in 2000. A REST server offers access to resources in REST architecture, and
    REST user accesses and modifies resources. Here, URIs / global IDs classify each
    asset. REST uses a variety of representations to describe a resource such as text,
    JSON, XML. 3.2.4. AMQP An open standard for transferring business messages between
    applications or organizations is the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).
    It connects systems, feeds business processes with the information they need,
    and transmits the instructions that achieve their goals reliably forward. 3.2.5.
    TCP Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection-oriented communications
    protocol that provides the facility to exchange messages in a network between
    computer devices. 3.2.6. UDP A Transport Layer protocol is the User Datagram Protocol
    (UDP). UDP is part of the Internet Protocol suite, known as UDP / IP. Like TCP,
    this protocol is unstable and unconnected. There is thus no need to create a link
    before transferring data. 3.2.7. DCCP DCCP provides a way for congestion-control
    mechanisms to be accessed without having to implement them at the application
    layer. It allows flow-based semiconducting, as in the Transmission Control Protocol
    (TCP), but does not provide reliable delivery on-order. Sequenced transmission
    across multiple streams is not possible in DCCP, as in the Stream Control Transmission
    Protocol (SCTP). A DCCP link requires both the network acknowledgment and data
    traffic. Acknowledgments notify a sender that their packets have arrived and whether
    they have been labeled with an Explicit Notification of Congestion (ECN). 3.2.8.
    SCTP The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a computer networking
    communication protocol that operates at the transportation layer and serves a
    similar role to the popular TCP and UDP protocols. It is defined in RFC 4960 by
    IETF.SCTP incorporates some of the features of both UDP and TCP: it is message-oriented
    like UDP and ensures secure, in-sequence congestion-controlled transmission of
    messages like TCP. It differs from those protocols by providing multi-homing and
    redundant paths to increase resilience and reliability. 3.2.9. RSVP The Resource
    Reservation Protocol (RSVP) is a transport layer [1] protocol designed to use
    the distributed infrastructure model to reserve resources across a network. RSVP
    works over an IPv4 or IPv6 and sets up resource reservations for multicast or
    unicast data flows, initiated by the recipient. It does not transmit data from
    applications but is similar to a control protocol, such as the Internet Control
    Message Protocol (ICMP) or the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). RSVP
    is set out in RFC 2205. 3.2.10. QUIC QUIC (pronounced’ quick’) is a general-purpose
    network layer protocol initially designed by Google’s Jim Roskind, introduced
    and deployed in 2012, publicly announced in 2013 as an extended experiment and
    defined by the IETF. While still an Internet-Draft, more than half of all Chrome
    web browser connections to Google’s servers use QUIC.[citation needed] Most other
    web browsers don’t follow the protocol. 3.2.11. CLNS Connectionless mode Network
    Service (CLNS) or simply Connectionless Network Service is an OSI Network Layer
    datagram service that does not require a circuit to be set up before data is transmitted,
    and routes messages to their destinations independently of any other messages.
    CLNS is not an Internet service but offers features similar to those offered by
    the Internet Protocol (IP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) in an OSI Network
    environment. 3.2.12. DDP Distributed Data Protocol (or DDP) is a client-server
    protocol designed to query and update a server-side database and to synchronize
    such updates between clients. It uses a messaging pattern for publish-subscribe.
    The Meteor JavaScript application was developed for use. 3.2.13. ICMP Connectionless-mode
    Network Service (CLNS) or simply Connectionless Network Service is an OSI Network
    Layer datagram service that does not allow a circuit to be set up before data
    is transmitted and routes messages to their destinations independently of any
    other messages. As such, it is a best-effort rather than a “reliable” delivery
    service. CLNS is not an Internet service but offers features similar to those
    offered by the Internet Protocol (IP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) in an OSI
    Network environment. 3.2.14. DSI Digital Serial Interface (DSI) is a protocol
    for regulating lighting (initially electrical ballast) in buildings. It is based
    on Manchester-coded 8-bit protocol, 1200 baud data rate, 1 start bit, 8 data bits
    (dim value), 4 stop bits, and is the basis for the more advanced Digital Addressable
    Lighting Interface (DALI) protocol. The technology uses a single byte (0–255 or
    0x00-0xFF) to communicate the lighting level. DSI was the first use of digital
    communication to control lighting and was the precursor to DALI. 3.2.15. ISDN
    Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a set of communication standards
    for simultaneous digital transmission of voice, video, data, and other network
    services over the traditional circuits of the public switched telephone network.
    The key feature of ISDN is that it integrates speech and data on the same lines,
    adding features that were not available in the classic telephone system. In the
    emergency mode of IoT devices, the ISDN facility can be useful. 3.3. Application
    IoT applications are nowadays developed in many fields. The development of many
    open-source platforms like Azure IoT Suite, IBM Watson, Amazon Web Services (AWS),
    Oracle IoT, Kaa, Bevywise IoT platform used for industrial IoT, IoTIFY cloud-based
    platform used to build scalable IoT applications. Most of the opensource platform
    is enabled with AI and ML technology for intelligent processing and computing
    the information. The manufacture of smart devices that can read, process, and
    computing the things makes the IoT as one of the emerging fields. There are many
    application areas where IoT is used, as shown in Fig. 2. In these eight different
    application fields, IoT has already made an impact on enhancing and increasing
    the efficiency of the system. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Internet
    of things applications. 3.3.1. Smart home The IoT makes the traditional home system
    into an intelligent one. The refrigerator, smart television, security camera,
    gas sensors, temperature sensor, light system all can sense the home environment,
    communicate and connect to the internet through wired or wireless. Even the refrigerator
    can place an order to the registered retail shop and give notification to the
    user. Due to the development of smart things, the living standard becomes more
    comfortable. In paper [18], authors design a smart home system based on IoT technology.
    Using technology like IoT and Fog computing home converted into an intelligent
    home system where monitoring of the home can be done remotely as well as processing
    can be done instantly. The authentication of devices is essential to prevent unwanted
    access to the IoT network. The authors in Satapathy et al. [19] and Panda et al.
    [20] proposed different authentication schemes for a smart home network. Still,
    some security issues [21], are exist in IoT based smart home systems. 3.3.2. Smart
    hospital Since the development of IoT patient monitoring in real-time is possible
    with the use of sensors and fog/edge computing, the paper [22], authors have proposed
    an IoT-cloud based framework for data collection in the healthcare system. Similarly,
    in Moosavi et al. [23], authors performed the authentication and authorization
    of the smart devices in the healthcare system. In the healthcare system, privacy
    is one of the main issues, so proper security and privacy protocol need to be
    developed to secure the system. 3.3.3. Smart city The ever-growing city has lots
    of problems like traffic management, waste management, waste management, and environmental
    management. The city needs a solution to monitor and control the problem exist.
    In papers [24], [25], authors explained the challenges that exist in implementing
    smart cities and done a survey in detail about how IoT can solve an existing problem.
    Using IoT and associated technology, a smart city can be developed to enhance
    the living standard of the city, maintaining the security and privacy issue of
    the citizen. 3.3.4. Smart transportation In recent times traffic is one of the
    major problems in a city. The intelligent transportation system is the need of
    the hour. The IoT enables vehicles can collect information from the roadside unit
    and process to get the details about journey path, time, and traffic details.
    Some of the research work [26], [27] addressed the smart transportation issue
    using IoT. In paper [28], the authors proposed the IoT-ITS system for the transportation
    system. The authors in Dey et al. [29] proposed a “Magtrack” to detect condition
    of the road surface using in-build mobile sensors and machine learning concepts.
    3.3.5. Smart grid The smart grid is one of the application areas of IoT, where
    a grid system can be made automation using IoT. The electric power generation
    and distribution among consumers can be monitor in real-time. The cybersecurity
    solution approach [30] is explained in detail. The architecture of the IoT-Cloud
    based system proposed by the authors in paper [31]. The efficient, economical
    and distribution can be improved using the IoT technology in the smart grid system.
    3.3.6. Supply chain system The IoT smart devices, once used in a supply chain
    management system, can fundamentally change the traditional way to monitor the
    transport system. By using the IoT technique, the material is easily located,
    their current condition, packing details, and it is easy to track how goods are
    a move through the supply chain. It increases to maintain the demand-supply of
    good, easy to monitor the material movement, real-time tracking, efficient storage,
    energy efficient [32], and distribution. The authors in Li et al. [33], explained
    how tracking and tracing could be done in real-time using the IoT system. Similarly,
    in paper [34], [35] authors, discussed the IoT based architecture and risk management
    in the supply chain system. In paper [34], authors have proposed artificial intelligent
    integration with IoT for the retail shop supply chain system. 3.3.7. Smart retails
    The retail sector also using IoT services along with artificial intelligent[36]
    to enhance productivity, improve store operation, and to take the decision in
    real-time to manage the inventory system. 3.3.8. Agriculture Agriculture is one
    of the promising application areas in IoT. In a smart agriculture system by deploying
    the sensors to monitor the soil quality, water management, crop growing condition,
    etc. which improve the farming efficiency by reducing time and cost. In real-time,
    a user can monitor all details from the remote locations. In paper [37], [38]
    authors proposed smart irrigation using machine learning and IoT to enhance farming.
    similarly, in paper [39], [40], smart water management and weather conditions
    in the agriculture system are explained in detail. Likewise, in paper [41], [42],
    smart agriculture system integration with IoT technologies is explained in detail.
    As some of the work already done in the field of agriculture, still some security
    issues exist like mobility, infrastructure, and secure processing of the collected
    data. 4. Security attacks in internet of things In Table 3 some common Internet
    of Things attacks in the different layer is shown along with the current research
    work done on the corresponding attacks types. Table 3. The different security
    attacks in IoT. Different attacks cases and relevant research papers Empty Cell
    Attacks type Paper IoT Attacks Jamming attacks [43] DoS attacks [44] Intrusion
    detection System [45] Malicious node [46] Power analysis attack [47], [48] Internal
    attacks [49] Access control [50] Wormhole attack [51] Side channel security [52]
    Distributed Dos [53] Man in the Middle attack [54] Active attacks [55] Routing
    attacks [56] Sybil attacks [57], [58] Deceptive attack [59] Spoofing [60] Buffer
    overflow attack [61] Impersonation attack [62] Jamming attack is a subset of DoS
    attacks where the attacker tries to affect the communication channel in paper
    [43] authors also explained the details about the jamming attacks. Dos attack
    is one of the common attack used in IoT applications. Most of the IoT devices
    are a low-end device which is vulnerable to the attacker. The attacker gets under
    the data traffic stream through device connection or infrastructure. Denial of
    service (DoS) attacks, consists of a huge volume of network packets, targeting
    the node present in the application causes service interrupt in real-time [44].
    Intrusion detection system(IDS) is the process in which network traffic is control
    by the attacker. There are some types of IDS attacks, like misuse detection, anomaly
    detection, Host-based IDS, and Network-based IDS. The authors in paper [45] described
    the IDS attacks in IoT network. Malicious node attack is possible in a distributed
    IoT network due to the heterogeneous nature of the smart devices. The identify
    the genius node or fake node in the network is a challenging one. In paper [46]
    authors proposed a perception and K-mean to build the trust among the node and
    detect the malicious node. Power analysis attack and its corresponding solution
    approach are explained in papers [47], [48]. This attack is mainly made to gain
    the computational power of the nodes so that the basic cryptographic algorithm
    is not possible to execute. In an IoT network, privacy also needs to be maintained
    to build trust among the node. Internal attack in paper [49] and Access control
    attack in paper [50] are discussed in details. Wormhole attack is taken place
    at the 6LoWPAN layer, where the attacker makes a tunnel between two nodes that
    are connected [51]. The Side channel security attack in cloud-based IoT application
    along with the security challenges are explained in paper [52]. Similarly, Distributed
    Dos attack is the process where the server is unreachable so that smart nodes
    in the network can not get the services it desires to get [53]. Man-in-the-middle
    attack, where the attacker relays the message or change the message during the
    transmission in the insecure channel, explained in Li et al. [54] IoT-Fog network.
    Active attacks is explained in Zhang et al. [55] and its corresponding solution
    in the physical layer of the IoT network. There are different types of active
    attacks possible in IoT, where attackers make changes in the target node. The
    authors in Raoof et al. [56] explained the Routing attacks in routing protocol
    lossy network based on IoT application. The Sybil attack is one most common types
    of attack in IoT. The authors in Zhang et al. [57] and Mishra et al. [58] study
    the phases of Sybil attacks and their countermeasures in the internet of things.
    The Deceptive attack in La et al. [59] and Spoofing attack in Zhang et al. [60]
    authors have addressed the corresponding attacks and their security analysis in
    the internet of things applications. The Buffer overflow attacks is the process
    of writing the program in a block of memory where the memory space is insufficient.
    The A IoT network, when nodes execute the different programs in the deices for
    processing or computation purpose attackers, can capture that and perform memory
    overflow attack. The detecting buffer overflow attack and providing appropriate
    security design in explained in Xu et al. [61]. In a large IoT network where heterogeneous
    devices are connected and communicate with each other. The trust is one of the
    major issues in the network. The Impersonation [62] attacks where a fake node
    behaves like a genius node in the network and tries to gain the information from
    other nodes. This is one of the most challenging issues in IoT applications where
    smart devices are heterogeneous and low-end devices. 5. Security issue address
    using machine learning The machine learning is a technique to perform computational
    intelligently. The model needs to design and test using different learning methods.
    Figs. 3 and 4 describe the basic principle of machine learning functionality and
    integration with IoT applications. As discussed in Section 3.3 application of
    the Internet of Things is many. Some of the application requirement is decision
    should be taken before the actual event occurs. For example, predicting the fire
    in a kitchen or any industrial area and alarm the sound to prevent the fire. This
    could be possible if machine learning technologies are used in IoT applications.
    Also, it needs to address the security issue present in the IoT system ta make
    the system tamper-proof. An efficient framework [63] is required to process and
    compute the huge data collection using a machine learning technique. In paper
    [64], authors review the security issue associated when applying machine learning
    in a smart grid application. In paper [65], [66] authors address the intrusion
    detection in IoT application. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The

    to monitor security in Mobile IoT using Big data processing and ML. [64] 2019
    Application of ML methods on big data generated in the smart grid to extract useful
    information and to detect and protect the data from cyber-security threats. [65]
    2019 Review on Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) in an IoT environment
    using ML algorithms. [66] 2019 The authors proposed, a 3-layer Intrusion Detection
    System (IDS) using a supervised learning method of ML to distinguish between malicious
    or benign network activity and to detect network-based cyber-attacks such as DoS,
    MITM/Spoofing, Replay, and Reconnaissance and also to detect a multi-stage attack
    on IoT networks. [67] 2017 Proposed a physical-layer authentication (PLA) scheme
    based on extreme learning machine (ELM)with a 2-dimensional measure space to ameliorate
    spoofing detection accuracy. [68] 2017 Proposed an ML-based malicious app detection
    tool that uses naive Bayesian, J48 decision tree as a classifier model to detect
    malicious applications instantaneously in Android devices. [69] 2018 Implemented
    an autonomous and adaptive detection mechanisms using ML and software-defined
    networking (SDN) for their IoT security framework to deal with the problem of
    erratic behavior and heterogeneity of IoT systems. [70] 2018 Presented the different
    ML methods that can be applied to the data generated in the IoT system based environments
    like Smart cities to pull out the higher-level information if it. Table 5. Machine
    learning apply on different IoT security. Reference Years Contribution [71] 2018
    The proposed a reliable, scalable, and robust Swarm Intelligence (SI)-based IoT
    system to overcome the problem of dynamic and heterogeneity behavior of IoT systems.
    [72] 2018 The authors presented a Dense Random Neural Networks (RNN) based deep-learning
    technique by analyzing the traffic flow exchange in IoT gateways. To detect the
    network attacks online such as TCP SYN attack, which is a variety of denial-of-service
    (DoS) attacks. [73] 2018 The authors proposed a robust real-time distributed fog-based
    attack detection framework for IoT, which relies on a fog computing paradigm and
    a newly proposed ELM-based Semi-supervised Fuzzy C-Means (ESFCM). Extreme Learning
    Machine (ELM) algorithm provides good generalization performance at a faster detection
    rate, and semi-supervised Fuzzy C-Means method handles the labeled data issue
    in IoT. [74] 2018 The proposed a new darknet analysis method to find the traffic
    patterns of a specific scanning attack i.e., TCP SYN packets due to the majority
    of darknet packets using the association rule learning. [75] 2018 The authors
    proposed a novel algorithm for quantifiable intelligent trust assessment model
    to overcome the issue of potential discrimination. The data analytics is done
    over delicate information such as locations, interests, and activities, using
    the SVM model of ML. This process generates exact and inherent trust values for
    probable actors. It helps in determining whether an incoming interaction is trustworthy
    or not, based on several trusts features corresponding to an IoT environment.
    Table 6. Machine learning apply on different IoT security. Reference Years Contribution
    [76] 2018 The authors proposed a system for real-time monitoring of the health
    parameters to detect bombs nearby and to predict the warzone environment. Using
    various sensors to collect the data, network infrastructure like LoRaWAN and ZigBee

    for Intrusion detection system using Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) for SDN
    based IoT. [78] 2019 The authors proposed a robust prediction model for real-life
    mobile phone data of individual users using a rule-based machine learning classification
    technique, i.e., decision tree on the noise-free quality dataset. Naive Bayes
    classifier and Laplace estimator are used to improving the prediction accuracy
    of the model by removing the noisy instances in the data. [79] 2019 Proposed an

    of various ML models such as Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine
    (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

    The innovation of smart devices having sensing and acting capability makes the
    IoT system usability in widely. As the numbers of devices are connected to the
    network are huge, which generate a large volume of data. To process and perform
    computation is a challenging task in an IoT environment. So Artificial intelligence
    comes as a rescue along with some other emerging technology to address the security
    issue in IoT. As shown in Fig. 5, IoT and AI can combine to improve the analysis
    of the system, improve operational efficiency, and improve the accuracy rate.
    The authors in Ghosh et al. [82] explained that AI could help IoT huge volume,
    unstructured data, heterogeneous data to compute in real-time, which makes the
    system realistic. The authors propose the large margin cosine estimation (LMCE)
    technique in this paper [83] to detect the adversary in IoT enable environments.

    and its associated attributes. The smart contract [88] are self executable program
    used to implement the business logic in the network. The Blockchain network uses
    different consensus algorithm [89] to meet the consensus among the nodes. The
    details Blockchain architecture and application areas are explained in paper [90]
    by the authors. The authors in paper [91], [92] described the mechanism and related
    work on IoT security along with Blockchain as a solution approach.The authors
    have proposed a secure framework for the internet of things applications based
    on a distributed Blockchain system in Satapathy et al. [93]. The use of Blockchain
    technology in IoT is briefly given in paper [94] by the authors. The many IoT
    security challenges and corresponding Blockchain solutions, along with the implementation
    challenges, are review by the authors in paper [95]. In Table 7, Table 8, Table

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Reviewing procedure tree diagram.
    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed

    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Vigneault (2016) In-field obstacle detection Christiansen et al. (2016) 4.1. Monitoring
    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    by uncertainty and constant technological changes. The productive sectors that
    are more digitized tend to improve their productivity faster than those that are
    less digitized. Irrigation farming communities have benefited for many years from
    the use of information and communications technology (ICT), which allows them
    to improve the current agricultural development, facilitate the fulfillment of
    daily tasks, and convert farms into efficient and sustainable production systems.
    The use of these new technologies not only enables the digital transformation
    process demanded by the sector, but also supports irrigation communities and other
    farming groups with tools for analysis and prediction, improving optimization.
    The digital transformation and continuous technological advances that are currently
    occurring, e.g., the Internet of Things (IoT) [1], big data, cloud computing [2],
    artificial intelligence, and aerial images [3] to name a few, are providing the
    agricultural sector with new tools that help determine the real needs of farms
    and improve their efficiency. Specifically, the use of the IoT has changed the
    traditional paradigm regarding access to and the management of sensors and actuators,
    making all objects accessible through the Internet, and transferring the management
    and integration of information and real knowledge into the digital world [4].
    This transformation has produced improvements compared to the techniques traditionally
    used [5], allowing new mechanisms to help in the management of farms. These advantages
    are mainly focused on the following: Problem detection: The implementation of
    new technologies such as satellite images, variable application algorithms, drones,
    high-tech sensors, mobile applications, and GPS guides, allowing for the assessment
    of crop status and the detection of problems (improper fertilizer use, water stress,
    changing weather conditions, and pest monitoring) before they start to interfere
    with crop  performance; Productivity improvement: The sensorization of crops allows
    for the establishment of patterns of planting and fertilization depending on factors
    such as the type of seeds and soil conditions, to improve crop production levels;
    Improvement in decision making: By analyzing and monitoring agronomic parameters,
    crop water needs, and precipitation forecasts, it is possible to identify which
    areas of land need more water and schedule irrigation to vary the volume of water
    applied without imposing water stress on the crop; Behaviour analysis: As a result
    of continuous crop monitoring and the analysis of the relationships among different
    elements, such as yield, energy efficiency, and the agricultural practices used,
    the most beneficial actions and those that must be eliminated or modified can
    be identified. Motivated by the digital transformation, the agricultural sector
    is providing its farms with new devices and services (sensors, actuators, weather
    information, drones, and satellite images) that allow for the optimization of
    the resources, to improve productivity and simultaneously reduce the impact on
    the environment. For the digital transformation of the agricultural sector, a
    common integration framework is needed that unifies the entire dataset, so that
    new services are generated according to the needs of the sector. The data generated
    by the farms are crucial and have to be part of a unique semantic model that organizes
    and evaluates all the data collected. At the European level, an open initiative,
    FIWARE [6], offers a framework using a set of standard and open Application Programming
    Interfaces (APIs) based on Next Generation Service Interface (NGSI), promoted
    by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), or Next Generation Service Interfaces with
    Linked Data (NGSI-LD) [7], promoted by ETSI Industry Specification Group for Context
    Information Management (ETSI ISG CIM), to define a universal set of standards
    based on the contextual management of the data. Therefore, adhering the standards
    and abandoning the code and proprietary technologies can contribute to improving
    the competitiveness of the agricultural sector. In a world where everything is
    connected, isolated solutions have no place. By contrast, interoperability must
    be the cornerstone feature that all solutions adopt, thus contributing to a more
    productive environment where information is exchanged for a greater good. The
    proposed solution is a platform that allows for the integration of different suppliers’
    devices, and implements standards and open interfaces and data models based on
    NGSI-LD. Additionally, the platform exploits the stored information to analyze,
    in real time, the factors associated with the production process, the evolution
    of the crops, and the optimal use of water for irrigation. The core features the
    platform are as follows: Scalability and flexibility:The platform, instead of
    being locked to a single provider, is up to date with protocols, technologies,
    and features that vary rapidly. It is network-independent and can be integrated
    to work with all vital technological systems; Interoperable: The platform offers
    a wide range of IoT agents that facilitate the connection with devices that use
    standardized IoT protocols, such as Lightweight Machine to Machine (LWM2M) over
    Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), or
    UltraLight (UL) over HTTP/MQTT, with the possibility of using parameterizing agents
    to integrate any other type of future protocols. At the application level, the
    platform is open to integration with other third-party platforms using both API
    and data model based on NGSI-LD. Semantic enrichment: The use of the data model
    to homogenize the management of the different elements that are part of a farm;
    Efficiency and competitiveness: The model allows precise and timely decisions
    to be made in terms of management and agricultural processes. The ability to automatically
    document the health status of the crop or natural resources provides an efficient
    and effective diagnosis technique for managers. The remainder of this paper is
    structured as follows: In Section 2, the proposed solution is introduced, detailing
    the most unique elements. Section 3 outlines the deployment in a community of
    irrigators. Section 4 shows the evaluation of the system at different levels of
    implementation and the results obtained. Finally, in Section 5, the conclusion
    and new proposals based in these results are described. 1.1. Information Models
    Applied to Agriculture The data collected by all connected devices are characterized
    by scalability, heterogeneity, and  dynamism: Scalability: Millions of sensors
    continuously generating large amounts of information; Heterogeneity: There is
    a wide variety of sensors; Dynamism: The high speed of generation produced the
    need to generate data models that allow for better use and dissemination of the
    information from these devices. Given the above factors, interoperability mechanisms
    must be generated that allow for the integration of different devices, applications,
    or platforms to filter the vast amounts of information that many systems are producing
    [8]. The shared data models are useful as they are essential resources that improve
    the communication, knowledge recovery, and interoperability of information systems
    to develop better applications for the agri-food sector [9]. Today, different
    data models are available; many of them were developed by the organizations in
    charge of developing their standards. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) data
    models are used primarily in geosciences and environmental domains, including
    the SensorThings API, based on the Observations and Measurements (O&M) data model
    (OGC/ISO 19156:2011), which transforms the numerous unconnected IoT systems into
    a fully connected platform where complex tasks can be performed and synchronized.
    The Open Connectivity Foundation specifies data models based on vertical industries
    such as the automotive, healthcare, industrial, and smart home sectors. The World
    Wide Web Consortium Thing Description provides some vocabularies to describe real
    things but does not focus much on the data. Other vocabularies, such as those
    offered by the INSPIRE directive [10], define the rules on the interoperability
    of spatial data sets and their associated services; these are mandatory. Currently,
    some resources speed up the data modeling of a specific location or sector. In
    the field of agriculture, Drury et al. [11] presented different types of tools
    to help us develop this task: Controlled vocabulary (a set of preselected terms
    or words for a specific domain): An example is AGROVOC vocabulary, promoted by
    the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and available
    in multiple languages. Miscellaneous ontologies: Crop Ontology, AgroPortal, Dairy
    Farming Ontology (DFO), AgOnt, CIARD Ring, and Vest. Data exchange standards:
    AgriOpenLink, AgroXML, and AgroRDF; specific ontologies: SSN (for sensor discovery)
    and Cotton Ontology (diseases and pests that affect cotton). The basis of many
    decisions is the uniformity of architectures, and ETSI ISG CIM provides the correct
    interfaces (006 V1.1.1 (2019-07)) and context information management (CIM) and
    allows for the unified representation of the information through next generation
    service interfaces with linked data (NGSI-LD) [12]. This reduces the time and
    resources required for the management of daily tasks and for the improvement of
    the productivity and benefits. A diverse range of ontological models are available
    for the IoT, developed with different objectives [13,14] that describe various
    areas, such as Fiesta-IoT ontology, which reuses the results of projects and current
    EU strategies in semantic web technologies, such as OpenIoT, DUL, VITAL, Spitfire,
    IoT-O, IoT-A, IoT-Lite, and Sensei. One recent ontology, which is promoted by
    the ETSI SmartM2M Technical Committee, is the Smart Appliances REFerence (SAREF)
    ontology, a shared model of consensus that facilitates the matching of existing
    assets in the smart appliances domain and allows for the separation and recombination
    of different parts of the ontology according to specific needs. For the agricultural
    field, the SAREF4AGRI version [15] was created to provide services for animal
    husbandry, intelligent irrigation, and the integration of multiple data sources
    to provide support services for decision making. Some models are promoted by public
    administrations, such as the standardized water management model applied to irrigation
    model (MEGA) [16], an initiative of the Ministry of Agriculture of Spain, included
    in the ISO 21622 standard and managed by TRAGSA Group. The purpose of MEGA is
    to establish a standardized model that, when applied to irrigation, allows for
    interoperability between different systems that coexist in the same facility and
    thus to efficiently manage irrigation water use. The introduction of the standardized
    model improves how the irrigation schedules and the requirements of the control
    systems are specified, establishing a clear separation between decision making
    and execution. 1.2. IoT Solutions in the Agricultural Sector Multiple problems
    exist in the domain of agriculture, such as irrigation, the application of pesticides
    and fertilizers, and the monitoring of crops, land, and livestock. Different researchers
    are working to provide the best possible solutions: Improvements in productivity:
    Through the sensorization of crops to provide values in real time, the farmer
    can apply irrigation, pesticides, and fertilizers only when they are needed. For
    example, Araby et al. [17] proposed the integration of the IoT and machine learning
    to predict diseases in horticultural crops before they appear, allowing the farmer
    to apply the necessary defense mechanisms, thus improving productivity and reducing
    the use of pesticides. Trilles et al. [18] presented a low-cost sensor-equipped
    platform, SEenviro, which applies a disease model for alert management in vineyards;
    Detection of undetected problems: Using satellite images or drones, harmful agronomic
    factors, previously untreated, can be detected and mapped in crops using remote-sensing
    techniques. For example, De Rango et al. [19] monitored crops using the images
    provided by a drone to see if they had parasites and to decide if subsequent treatment
    was necessary, representing a new technique for the coordination and control of
    the drone fleet in precision agriculture (PA); Monitoring the behavior of plants:
    Through the use of artificial intelligence to analyze the entire dataset obtained
    from crops to make future predictions, the PLANTAE platform [20] is a system capable
    of managing the agricultural process and simultaneously using machine-learning
    techniques to detect possible diseases in plants. Other works, such as that of
    Choudhury et al. [21], monitored the behavior of plants to avoid pests and diseases.
    Through the use of a mobile applications, farmers report events that improve the
    models of diseases used; Efficient water management: Crop water adjustments should
    avoid water stress. Riquelme et al. [22] showed how the use of cloud services
    involving the FIWARE platform allows for the improvement of the management of
    water used for irrigation in areas with water deficits. Another project to be
    considered, also based on FIWARE, is the SWAMP platform [23]. Its primary objective
    is to develop innovative methods based on the IoT for the intelligent management
    of irrigation water, using the semantic characteristics provided by a context
    engine based on the SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) Event Processing
    Architecture; Improvement in greenhouse management: By monitoring its different
    components, Zamora- Izquierdo et al. [24] proposed a flexible platform capable
    of meeting the needs of hydroponic crops in a greenhouse with complete recirculation.
    For this FIWARE-based deployment, Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) communications
    were used, with NGSIs being used as a means to represent the information. Somov
    et al. [25] constructed a system to monitor both the conditions established in
    a greenhouse and the behavior of plants for the prediction of the growth rate
    of tomatoes in different environments. IoT platforms can be considered the backbone
    of any industrial sector that wants to provide its activity with a smart component.
    These platforms collect and store data in a distributed database for the filtering,
    analysis, calculation, decision making, management, translation, and visualization
    of data in new services. Several analyses of the different types of platforms
    for the integration of IoT services and their characteristics can be found, such
    as that provided by Silva et al. [26], although a results comparison is difficult
    because of the lack of standardization. 2. Proposed System This article proposes
    an open and interoperable platform for irrigation community management. The platform,
    based on standard and open interfaces and protocols, allows for the integration
    of heterogeneous information sources as well as interoperability with other third-party
    solutions for exchanging and exploiting this information. Additionally, this platform
    exploits the stored information to analyze, in real time, the factors associated
    with the production process, the evolution of crops, and the optimal use of water
    for irrigation. 2.1. Proposed Data Model As a result of the lack of the compatibility
    necessary to manage the large amount of data generated by the agricultural sector,
    agricultural managers must be provided with standardized information models that
    permit farmers to make the best possible decisions, allowing them to take advantage
    of the available data and knowledge. Therefore, a data model is proposed here
    that fits the functional requirements of the users. The proposed data model is
    based on interviews with farmers, responsible technicians, and farm managers about
    the useful and necessary information that should be managed on a farm. The existing
    models are too specialized; although they cover the information that needs to
    be managed, their implementation is time-consuming. Therefore, we decided to develop
    a new model that would meet the needs of our users. Conceptually, the model presented
    is based on the proposed by FIWARE harmonized data models [27], specifically,
    the AgriFood model that includes requirements for irrigation and crop control.
    The model was constructed as an agile tool to respond to the requirements farmers
    allowing them to characterize the plots, reduce the hydric needs of the crops,
    and control the soil and water quality and the associated atmospheric conditions.
    This first version of the model focuses on the efficient management of the crop
    plots and all the included elements, as can be seen in the class diagram in Figure
    1. Figure 1. Specific data model for agricultural plot management. The proposed
    data model focuses on the management of crop plots represented by the AgriPlot
    entity, which is part of an agricultural holding, represented by the AgriExploitation
    entity. The plot is characterized by four pillars that allow it to be uniquely
    defined: Devices, represented by AgriDevice, are the devices that provide information
    to the plot and are classified based on the parameters studied: AgriDSoil, those
    that obtain soil values (soil moisture probes, temperature and soil dissolution);
    AgriPlant, those that measure the evolution of the crop (leaf/trunk diameter,
    stem water potential, and dendrometers); and AgriAtmosphere, which are the devices
    that record the atmospheric conditions (temperature, humidity, radiation, and
    wind speed). These data are used to optimize agricultural decisions; Water, represented
    by AgriWater, indicates the type of water used and the parameters that affect
    irrigation. AgriAnalysis manages the water analysis conducted at different points
    of the water distribution network of the farm. These analyses are usually necessary
    for fertilization and irrigation, since they describe the quality and quantity
    of nutrients carried by the water; Soil, represented by AgriSoil, indicates the
    type of soil present in the plot. This entity can be more detailed by indicating
    the AgriHorizon, which includes the different characteristics of the layers (horizons)
    that define the ground; Cultivation, represented by AgriCrop, defines the crop
    and the variety, AgriVariety, with which the plot is associated. The crop is determined
    by the different phenological phases that determine its growth; AgriPhenology
    provides the crop coefficients and their duration over time. The phenology is
    determined by the variety of the crop and the climatic zone, AgriZone since the
    zone influences the optimal climatic conditions for the development of the crops.
    Another feature to be considered is the Aerial Images management, represented
    by the AgriScene entity, including images or scenes from any satellite or drone;
    these scenes are composed of bands, AgriBand, of different wavelengths. In turn,
    these bands can generate derivative products, AgriProduct, after processing, such
    as mosaics (adding two or more adjacent scenes) or indices of vegetation or water,
    useful for detecting problems in the fields. The main feature of the IoT-based
    interoperability mechanisms is the possibility of exchanging information homogeneously
    in different systems or applications. One of the elements that enables this continuous
    exchange of information is the use of data models. To acquire more significant
    value, the specific vocabulary of the sector must be unified, which is defined
    by the set of attributes that compose the entities and their relationships [28].
    As NGSI-LD allows us to link data from other vocabularies or ontologies, we added
    a level of interoperability to the model. For these reasons, the use of information
    models is considered beneficial to allow for the integration of any device or
    characteristic element of the study sector. In Section 3.2, an instantiation of
    this model is provided using NGSI-LD. The advantages of the use of NGSI-LD concerning
    NGSI are as follows: The information model is based on graphs and focuses on information.
    The concept of Relation appears. Entities can have properties and relations. Instances
    of each of the entities can be the object of the properties or relationships;
    All data types in NGSI-LD can be associated with unique Uniform Resource Identifier
    (URI) corresponding to well-established semantic identifiers; It allows one to
    make references to vocabularies: all terms are defined unequivocally. This allows
    users to refer to their information definitions; The model and query language
    is more constrained; The use of JSON-LD allows us to operate with linked data
    to unify vocabularies; There were syntactic differences: the metadata dictionary
    is no longer needed, GeoProperty is used instead of geo:json, JSON-LD @context
    is included, TemporalProperty is used instead of DateTime, and an “object” field
    is used to encode the relation target. 2.2. System Architecture Since the new
    IoT devices and the new communications technologies provide the user with faster
    and more efficient communication, we propose an affordable platform, independent
    of the provider and interoperable, as the cornerstone for all connections between
    applications/services and the irrigation elements. In this way, we offer a common
    framework so that applications can interact with any aspect that is part of a
    farm in a similar way, while being able to act on any device or controller using
    the same set of instructions, thus allowing for greater interoperability between
    different manufacturers or services. The architecture of the platform proposed
    in this paper is depicted in Figure 2. It has a layered modular form ranging from
    the deployment of sensors and the monitoring of techniques for data extraction
    to the intelligent processing of data. Each of these layers is based on open and
    standard initiatives, such as the one provided by the FIWARE community [29] or
    the ETSI ISG CIM group. Figure 2. General vision of the proposed architecture.
    The first layer, Device and Data Acquisition, represents the different sources
    of information that form the system; these include sensors, actuators, open information
    available on the Internet, and databases with updated information of interest.
    These devices employ different communication technologies to transmit information
    to an IoT Backend module formed by IoT Agents. This module acts as an intermediary
    with the second layer and transforms information unidirectionally or bidirectionally
    (in the case of actuators), allowing the IoT devices to interact with the platform.
    A specific module is required because of the restrictions imposed by the modules
    on the processing capacity, memory, and even the available power to these devices.
    These restrictions usually prevent them from using heavy protocols at the application
    level, so they use lightweight protocols such as CoAP or MQTT or integrate other
    solutions such as LoRa and Sigfox to perform communications with the different
    devices through Ethernet or mobile networks (e.g., GPRS/3G/4G/NB-IoT/5G). As such,
    the IoT backend module component acts as an intermediary by translating the information
    sent through these protocols to the interface made available by the broker through
    NGSI-LD. The second layer, Information Management, contains software components
    in charge of data storage, processing, and distribution. The distributed infrastructure
    is composed of servers in the cloud that work together to manage massive amounts
    of data and make them available to the upper layer. The NGSI-LD interface is used
    to send data updates and receive notifications about data changes. Figure 3 presents
    an example of how the information provided by an IoT gateway, which implements
    JSON over MQTT, is integrated into the platform. Figure 3. Data model from Internet
    of Things (IoT) level to applications. The element chosen was the device that
    analyses the water at the exit of the wastewater treatment plant and determines
    the levels of turbidity and ph of the water. Once the entity is created in the
    broker using the NGSI-LD data model, consumers can retrieve this information following
    two different approaches: query or subscription. The core of this platform is
    the NGSI-LD broker. It is an information broker that exposes an HTTP REST API
    based on NGSI-LD for both registration and consultation, as well as a subscription/
    notification approach. This is the second point where interoperability is a significant
    aspect. The use of NGSI-LD provides various possible interactions with third-party
    platforms in both directions. One of these solutions that has been integrated
    into the platform through the development of a connector is MEGA [16]. The MEGA
    standard (ISO 21622) provides guidelines for the implementation of a standardized
    model applied to irrigation that improves the specification of irrigation schedules
    and the control of the system requirements. Within this management layer, the
    stored information of each entity is overwritten, with only the current state
    being kept; the information is stored in a nonrelational database, MongoDB. This
    database contains data referring to infrastructure and information flow, as well
    as information about users and organizations. All this information is modeled
    using data models that allow for the unification of data structures using standards
    and also ensure the generality necessary for the subsequent extensibility. The
    last layer, Service, serves as an interface between users and the central layer
    to offer different solutions to the problems that are generated in an agricultural
    operation, such as water management, irrigation planning, data analytics, and
    monitoring of environmental parameters. The incorporation of other modules allows
    us to provide our solution with more capabilities due to the possibility of integrating
    new components through connectors with NGSI-LD. The NGSI-LD interface is used
    to send data updates and receive notifications about data changes. A change in
    the configuration parameters triggers control actions that are managed by subsystems
    at the user level. As a result of the use of specific connectors, the information
    is consulted or notified to higher modules that are in charge of propagating it
    for other interests, such as historical information, large-scale data management,
    or integration with geographic information systems (GIS). For this purpose, a
    representational state transfer interface (REST) is used, which applies NGSI-LD
    for communication between the final applications and the analysis modules. 3.
    Case Study in an Irrigation Community This section validates our data model and
    the architecture of the platform. It was implemented in an irrigation community
    where different systems, such as supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA),
    GIS systems, and sensors from different manufacturers, were integrated by the
    platform. 3.1. Scenario Irrigation communities are corporations attached to basin
    organizations, which are responsible for the management of the shared use of public
    common water. To this end, they relied on automatons and specific irrigation systems
    for years, which were tightly coupled, allowing for full interaction between the
    devices and the software, but avoiding any other possibility of interacting with
    third-party devices and software applications. The Miraflores irrigation community
    is located in the municipality of Jumilla (Murcia) [30] in the Segura river basin
    and has almost 1000 community members. The area comprises about 1330 ha of agricultural
    land, mostly devoted to woody crops and irrigated by localized irrigation. The
    main crops produced are fruit trees, especially pear, peach, and apricot. The
    community uses surface water, 3.8 hm 3 annually, and water from the Jumilla sewage
    plant, 1.5 hm 3 annually. This treatment plant delivers the reclaimed water at
    its exit, from where the community drives the available flows to six interconnected
    regulation rafts, with a total capacity of 1 hm 3 . The distribution network conducts
    water from the rafts to the various irrigated farms, equipped with automatic flow
    control counters and setpoints, ensuring an average allocation of 4025 m 3 /ha/year/farm
    . One of the main problems to be solved is the integration of the different technological
    elements (SCADA, drawing software, independent sensors, and third-party services)
    that provide information to the community in a single control point. The data
    from SCADA that are integrated into the platform are shown in Table 1. The results
    derived from the water analysis conducted at least twice a month were also integrated
    into the platform. Table 1. Type of facilities from supervisory control and data
    acquisition (SCADA) that are integrated into the platform and the associated variables.
    3.2. Equipment and Implementation Figure 4 shows the general scheme that was followed
    to address the deployment of the platform. The first step was to channel water
    from the headwater reservoir, with its corresponding water analyses, to the agricultural
    plots. The plot is one of the key elements of the system. All the devices needed
    for its definition are integrated using dataloggers and IoT connectors. Through
    this process, SCADA data and the sensors that interact with the plot (soil moisture
    sensors, agricultural weather station, and hydrants) are integrated into the systems.
    The information is transferred to the data model for later visualization (using
    mobile or web applications) and analysis by the users of the irrigation community.
    Figure 4. Layout of the case study. The deployment involved the installation of
    controllers for monitoring, and remote control in outdoor environments were provided
    by Odin Solutions [31]. The cost of implementing the platform was reduced due
    to the open source feature of the platform. This feature decreased the budget
    needed for dataloggers managing different devices or sensors in the platform.
    In this instance, the cost of the chosen datalogger, IPex12, has an average price
    of around 600 euros (including configuration and installation) and varies according
    to the number of sensors integrated into the system. The main characteristics
    of IPex12 are: 32-bit CPU and 4 MB of memory expandable with microSD, Ethernet,
    USB, CAN, 3xRS232, 1xRS485, and 12 I/O ports, which can be configured by software
    as digital or analogue input/outputs. It supports Third-generation Networks (3G),
    IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LowPAN), Sigfox, Narrow
    Band IoT (NB IoT), and LoRA. Each IPex12 is able to manage eight additional slaves
    I/O boards using CAN. The controllers are configured effortlessly through their
    web server, which permits us to configure tasks independently from the MQTT commands
    received from the cloud computing layer. IPex12 is specially designed for outdoor
    settings such as the agricultural scenarios, since it is provided with water-
    and dust-proof enclosure. It is provided with a battery and a solar panel. The
    dataloggers have the ability to monitor sensor readings of soil conductivity,
    soil moisture, soil temperature, water meter readings, and meteorological parameters,
    among others, and to operate the solenoid valves to control the irrigation system.
    The cloud server is a PowerEdge R7515 Server, with an AMD EPYC 7402 2.80 GHz,
    32 GB of RAM, and two solid state drives (SSD) of 480 GB each. It also runs the
    Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Server and LibVirt/KVM. A single virtual machine was used here
    for the global broker, data saving, big data processes, and to host management
    with web services. The virtual machine uses 28 GB of memory and 400 GB of hard
    disk capacity. A good performance is possible at the moment, but given the flexibility
    of our architecture, more resources could be added by modifying or moving virtual
    images. Once the different modules that form the platform were configured, the
    entities were defined in the broker so that their subscriptions could be made
    later. The broker manages subscriptions to the creation or changes of entities.
    All these changes are stored in MongoDB, a nonrelational JSON-LD object-based
    database, to provide fast and flexible access to information. The speed of processing
    is fundamental because, otherwise, a bottleneck is created that would slow down
    the rest of the  implementations. To improve the data of the irrigation plots,
    the data model proposed in Section 2.1 was used according to the needs proposed
    by the users of the irrigation community. A model instantiation was constructed
    through NGSI-LD of an apricot tree plot where a soil moisture sensor was installed.
    The soil moisture sensor is listed in Listing 1 and the crop is defined in Listing
    2. Listing 1. Next generation service interfaces with linked data (NGSI-LD) example
    representing an AgriDevice. Listing 2. NGSI-LD example representing an AgriCrop.
    After defining the crop sown in the plot and the devices that help to improve
    irrigation management to improve production, we detailed the characteristics that
    define the plot. In Listing 3, the parameters necessary for the calculation of
    the water needs of the crop were observed, including plantation frame (density),
    emitter flow (flowRate), number of emitters (emitters), and tree crown diameter
    (diameter). Listing 3. NGSI-LD example representing an AgriPlot with related entities.
    4. Evaluation and Validation This section describes the validation of the platform
    in a community of irrigators from three different perspectives. The tests were
    conducted under a controlled environment with the equipment described in Section
    3.2. 4.1. Information Broker Evaluation The main element of the platform is a
    NGSI-LD broker, which is responsible for storing all the information as well as
    processing the different queries, answers, subscriptions, and the management of
    the information providers. For this reason, an analysis was performed by selecting
    the following metrics: CPU usage, memory consumed, and response times, according
    to the operations performed. Firstly, different execution tests were conducted
    to check the platform ability to perform the changes without losing the quality
    of service. The tests were performed with the same type of requests, checking
    their response time in terms of both CPU and RAM. All tests were based on a one-minute
    execution varying the number of simultaneous communications or connections with
    which it was performed. Figure 5 shows the results of the tests of the behavior
    of the processor and the memory. Figure 5. Evaluation of platform scalability.
    Figure 5a shows that the CPU requirements increased by around 20% in the first
    intervals (2, 4, and 8 threads). From this moment on and up to 1024 threads, the
    CPU remained stable with average values close to 90%. Figure 5b shows that the
    behavior in the use of the RAM remains practically stable from the beginning to
    the end without altering the consumed resources. The increase in the use of the
    RAM during the tests performed varied between 5% and 9%, values that are considered
    optimal. The behaviour of the platform was evaluated based on the information
    distribution characteristic that the broker had acquired. To this end, the response
    time obtained after performing various operations on the different broker operating
    modes is analyzed; Table 2 shows the most significant values obtained in the tests.
    The graphs shown in Figure 6 show the times for the different modes: entity management,
    subscription management, and context provider control. Figure 6. Response time
    for operations with different operating methods. Table 2. Average response times
    (ms) for each type of operation and mode. The publication/subscription model enables
    the reduction of the number of queries because it is not necessary to make periodic
    queries to receive updates to the data stored on the platform. The creation time
    is longer since it has to be adjusted to the proposed data model; The management
    of external context suppliers is a process that speeds up access to the information,
    making the process more transparent for the final client. The broker’s mission
    is to act as a proxy between the client and the context provider. For this reason,
    search and consultation times are shorter compared with the rest of the operations.
    4.2. Evaluation of Platform Usage This section provides an evaluation of the response
    times of the platform based on the three layers that form its architecture. Figure
    7 shows the times obtained for the system after the execution of 100 requests.
    Figure 7a shows the notification times at its two levels: at MQTT level (MQTT
    broker notifies the IoT Agent) and at NGSI-LD broker level. The times of the Information
    Management Layer are longer, with an average of 21.69 s, since all the semantic
    enrichment provided by the use of the data model is performed in the database
    (MongoDB). However, in exchange for this increase in time, it is possible to have
    all the relevant information of the irrigation community homogenized and integrated
    into a single point. Figure 7b shows the system’s capabilities in terms of performance
    management. The graph shows that if the device is connected, the response time
    is less than if it is not; the average response time of 31.18 ms is considered
    low. Figure 7. Response time according to the layers that form the platform. 4.3.
    Use of the Platform at the Agricultural Level Data interoperability is of critical
    importance. Here, the proposed solution (data model and platform) provides the
    necessary data translation mechanisms by combining the use of a data model together
    with standardized solutions, such as those provided through NGSI-LD. This proposal
    enables the integration of multiple systems/devices or data sources, resulting
    in an open and interoperable data integration model according to the changing
    requirements of farms. The use of data models contributes to obtaining performance
    indicators, decision making, and sharing data with different farms. Figure 8 shows
    the evolution of irrigation before the platform was installed. The analysis of
    the data revealed the irregularity of the irrigation system. To have a continuous
    and homogeneous irrigation system, we deemed it necessary to define irrigation
    thresholds provided by the agricultural technicians. As the field capacity and
    the wilt point determine the maximum and minimum limits of the soil humidity that
    can be used by the crops, we concluded that the amount of water between these
    two values is the functional water or humidity available to the plant. Once the
    community technicians defined the limits for the crops, tests were conducted on
    an apricot tree plot to evaluate the irrigation efficiency: the first as soon
    as the platform was deployed (between March and April), and another after improving
    the irrigation programming based on the results of the first test (between June
    and July). Figure 8. Evolution of the humidity of an apricot crop based on set
    water levels. Once the first test was analyzed, Figure 8, we found that during
    irrigation, two critical zones were generated, A and B, with extreme peaks that
    were outside the recommended limits, indicating that water use was not efficient,
    thus a scarce resource was being wasted. Zone A indicates that root asphyxiation
    was produced (a limitation of the capacity of the plants to breathe through the
    roots) in the crop by excess water; Zone B indicates that the plant does not have
    ability to supply itself with water, consequently reducing the quality of the
    production of the crop. Once the maximum and minimum thresholds are set, rules
    can be defined for efficient irrigation. When the thresholds are exceeded or not
    reached, the platform generates notifications to users through the mobile application.
    These rules can also be associated with the activation of digital inputs for the
    start-up of any device that improves irrigation efficiency. As a result of the
    use of the platform and the analysis of the data obtained, and with the help of
    an agricultural technician, the relevant irrigation limits are established or
    adjusted. In addition, other useful parameters can be established, such as the
    root network, the type of soil, or the disposition of the probes. Once the irrigation
    programming was changed, Figure 9 shows that the irrigation was efficiently applied.
    The water contributions and vertical column are in line with the humidity curves,
    showing stable and uniform sharing. By controlling the hydrants and applying filters
    based on the limits set, irrigation was controlled to maintain the humidity within
    the desired parameters, or to inform of possible alerts to activate programmed
    irrigation to avoid a reduction in production. Figure 9. Evolution of efficient
    irrigation, comparing soil moisture and water contribution by the hydrant. The
    versatility of the platform is stressed by the ability to export selected data
    for further processing or study, as shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9 using the export
    to CSV option. 5. Conclusions This work demonstrated the importance of interoperability
    in the field of agriculture, water management, and irrigation systems. Herein,
    an interoperable and open platform is presented which is capable of integrating
    heterogeneous data sources at the IoT level to aid and improve the decision making
    in a community of irrigators. The platform enables the integration of controllers
    and sensors from different manufacturers, and thus represents a unique access
    point for all this information. As such, improving the techniques used in the
    agricultural sector is possible, thereby sustainably obtaining higher economic,
    environmental, and social yields. As a result of its interoperable nature, the
    platform can be combined with other systems to expand its range of services. The
    interoperability aspect was tested in a real-world context where successful integration
    with other systems already deployed in the facilities of the irrigation community
    was possible thanks to this characteristic. The platform integrates different
    protocols at the IoT level, such as MQTT, CoAP, LoRa, SigFox, and HTTP. They transport
    the information following different data formats. Nevertheless, a set of them
    promote interoperability, such as Lightweight Machine to Machine (LWM2M), JSON,
    and UltraLight. These representation formats were adopted by the presented platform
    as to facilitate its integration into IoT devices, making use of this technology.
    The agents of the IoT backend of our platform perform the adaptation of this information
    to the NGSI-LD interface and data model. After analyzing the obtained results
    in the community of irrigators, the following conclusions were obtained: A homogeneous
    data model was proposed that meets the specific needs of agriculture, such as
    efficient water management. This model was validated on the platform using an
    NGSI-LD broker. The application of this model in an irrigation community provides
    its managers with the capacity to manage the agronomic information and its relationship
    with the devices that provide information to improve irrigation water; The platform
    was validated using metrics to check its behavior. Firstly, the scalability of
    the main component, the NGSI-LD broker, was analyzed based on the average use
    of the CPU (83.21%) and memory (56.39%). At the latency level, measures were recorded
    on the most relevant operations of the broker, highlighting among them the average
    time, 510.28 ms, of the creation of a context provider. The platform was validated
    as a whole, showing the time delay from the moment the device receives the information
    and when it is received by the platform (2.97 s); and from the moment the action
    is performed (31.17 ms); At the user level, the platform was validated in several
    apricot tree plots, improving the management of the water used. This improvement
    was achieved because of the definition of optimal irrigation thresholds for each
    crop and by generating filter notifications that, under certain conditions, allow
    the hydrants to be adjusted, thus enabling efficient water use. In the future,
    the speed of computing and latency should be compared by replicating the platform
    in edge computing with current cloud computing to detect which one provides better
    performance and response times. One of these involves the processing of satellite
    images. At the plot level, this feature will monitor the main characteristics
    of the crop with applications based on remote sensors. This new attribute will
    focus on the diagnosis, management, and control of irrigation. Currently, this
    feature uses images of the Sentinel 2 satellite, which is more focused on agricultural
    issues, but soon the PAZ satellite (the first Spanish radar earth observation
    satellite, which is included within the National Earth Observation Programme)
    will be used. Another future line of research is the development of a data analysis
    module that will allow us to cross check and analyze the history of the data acquired.
    This will generate better results in agricultural management, increase productivity,
    and reduce expenses, such as by reducing the consumption of water, nutrients,
    and phytosanitary products. Author Contributions Conceptualisation, J.A.L.-M.,

  explanation: 'The study discussed here is about automating data processing systems
    for real-time irrigation management. This research introduces a system based on
    containerization for scalable and autonomous deployment and cloud computing capabilities.
    The focus of the point on which you require this research is about utilizing containerization
    technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, etc.


    To address this, the paper proposes a modular framework for data processing at
    the edge, aiming to provide a foundation for other solutions. Using a pipeline
    approach, services can be modified and extended easily, ensuring compatibility
    with various devices and reducing the likelihood of errors.


    The research employs ZMQ as the communication backbone, utilizing its asynchronous
    messaging capabilities. It also leverages MQTT for communication between devices,
    and Terraform in combination with Kubernetes ensures consistent infrastructure
    management. In addition, using a RESTful API allows for data retrieval from devices
    that do not support MQTT.


    The proposed framework is significant for several reasons. First, it is modular,
    allowing for easy modification of pipeline steps. This modularity is critical
    in the context of edge computing, where the variety of devices and use cases requires
    a high degree of customization.


    Second, the framework is designed for scalability and autonomy. The use of containerization
    technologies like Docker and Kubernetes enables the deployment of data processing
    services on a cluster of machines, ensuring high availability and resilience.
    Containerization also simplifies the management and scaling of these services,
    making it easier to adapt to changing workloads.


    Third, the framework incorporates a data format unification mechanism. This is
    important in edge computing, where data can be collected from a variety of devices
    using different data formats. The framework ensures that all data is converted
    to a standardized format before being processed, which simplifies the development
    of data processing pipelines.'

  explanation: "The study used Landsat imagery to generate a dataset of wildfires\
    \ in the tundra region of Canada spanning more than three decades. It increased\
    \ the known previously burned area by 30%. The researchers employed a three-step\
    \ workflow, starting with the identification of candidate fire detections based\
    \ on four criteria derived from existing fire perimeters within the area. These\
    \ candidates were inspected visually and re-mapped at a finer resolution if confirmed.\
    \ \n\nSeveral spectral indices and Random Forest methods were employed to identify\
    \ changes in fire indices between pre- and post-fire imagery. This approach allowed\
    \ them to reduce false positives and produce a commission error-free dataset."
  extract_1: We used existing NBAC fire perimeters from within the study area to settle
    on the thresholds outlined below.
  extract_2: Candidate fires that met all four criteria were exported as vectors from
    GEE at 90 m spatial resolution (Figure 3).

  explanation: The provided paper offers a detailed exploration and evaluation of
    Crew, a framework for serverless data processing that leverages co-design practices
    to address the inherent tensions between data processing and serverless platform
    constraints. The evaluation compares Crew against Spark, analyzing their performance
    characteristics and resource utilization in the context of TPC-H benchmark queries.
    The findings highlight Crew's competitive performance, resource efficiency, and
    ability to adapt to the specific needs of data processing tasks.

    ad-hoc data processing, especially in on-prem deployments. With the right storage
    backends, scale and performance can be increased to fit the needs of each use-case,
    especially in cloud settings. The design of CREW enables highly elastic scaling,
    fitting the needs of each processing step to the data while allowing data analysts
    to control cost by setting fixed budgets.

  explanation: The concept of inference delivery networks (IDNs) is a network of computing
    nodes that work together to fulfill ML inference requests while achieving the
    best possible balance between latency and accuracy. The authors of this article
    have developed an algorithm called INFIDA, which is responsible for allocating
    ML models across IDN nodes in a way that aims to minimize the overall cost of
    the system. INFIDA’s design allows it to operate in a decentralized manner, without
    requiring global knowledge of either the allocation state or of incoming requests.

  extract_1: The main differences between containerisation technologies on Cloud and
    HPC systems are in terms of security and the types of workloads. The HPC applications
    tend to require more resources as to not only CPUs, but also the amount of memory
    and network speed. HPC communities have, therefore, developed sophisticated workload
    managers to leverage hardware resources and optimise application scheduling. Since
    the typical applications on Cloud differ significantly from those in HPC centres
    with respect to the sizes, execution time and requirements of the availability
    of hardware resources [16], the management systems on Cloud are evolved to include
    architectures different from those on HPC systems.
  extract_2: CHARLIECLOUD CHARLIECLOUD [28] runs containers without privileged operations
    or daemons. Charlicloud can convert a Docker image into a tar file and unpacks
    it on the HPC nodes. Installation of Charliecloud does not require root permission.
    Such non-intrusive mechanisms are ideal for HPC systems. Charliecloud is considered
    to be secure against shenanigans, such as chroot escape, bypass of file and directory
    permission, privileged ports bound to all host IP addresses or UID set to an unmapped
    UID [15]. MPI is supported by Charliecloud. Injecting host files into images is
    used by Charliecloud to solve library compatibility issues, such as GPU libraries
    that may be tied to specific kernel versions.

    automotive embedded Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems have
    been used to enhance vehicle performance and enrich people’s driving experience,
    increasing the panel of software features within them. However, even though until
    now automakers have kept up with the innovation pace in terms of the functionalities
    that have been offered to passengers, the majority of automakers’ efforts have
    concentrated on bringing in these new functionalities by adding an unceasingly
    larger set of ECUs. All of this has been done without evolving any of the embedded
    software architecture consequently, due to budgetary constraints, legislative
    limitations, retro-compatibility problems, and a lack of awareness of the trending
    IT innovation. This unbalanced progress has then led to a substantial increase
    in in-vehicle architectural complexity, which has become a major concern for automakers
    nowadays as it makes the vehicle repairing process more complex, decreases software
    traceability and clashes with the objective of having higher business flexibility,
    modularity, and dynamicity within the vehicles. In this paper, we are going to
    go through literature, both academic and industrial, and propose a comprehensive
    study into automotive system transformation. We begin by giving a detailed analysis
    of the causes of evolution under five axes - i.e., society, business, industry,
    application, and technical. Then, we discuss the convergence of cars and software
    life cycles and propose a three-layered analysis of automotive ICT systems consisting
    of architecture design, software pipelines, and run-time management. Finally,

  explanation: This research paper proposes a holistic framework for data fusion in

    quality and data fusion evaluation processes. The data quality process is based

    ingestion, storage, pre-processing, analysis, and visualization or execution of
    actions, building upon the well-known Enhanced X-DLC (EX-DLC) data management
    process. The proposed data fusion evaluation process is based on international

    using verification and validation techniques.

  key_findings: '- Data diversity and heterogeneity may hinder the development of
    healthcare systems.

    - Data fusion is often taken for granted and its implementation is delegated to
    low-level programmers or database administrators.

    - Poor implementation of data fusion hinders many other key data processes, including
    data analytics, for taking appropriate actions and offering an appropriate support
    to users and environment needs.

    - Despite this, data fusion is often taken for granted and its implementation
    is delegated to low-level programmers or database administrators.

    - Several issues make data fusion a challenging task. Most of its unsolved issues
    and challenges are related to data or data source quality, the definition of a
    data fusion process and evaluating the data fusion carried out.'
  limitations: '- None of the data fusion approaches included in the proposal consider
    the time and frequency of the data collection.

    - The quality of the fused data can vary over time due to changes in the data
    quality issues, data sources, fusion methods, and fusion techniques. The proposed
    framework does not include a mechanism to evaluate these changes.

    - The framework was only applied to a healthcare case study, so its applicability
    to other domains is not ensured.'

  explanation: The paper examines the application of machine learning algorithms to
    automate IoT systems for real-time structural health monitoring (SHM). The paper
    proposes a system leveraging the capabilities of digital twins (DTs) and describes
    it using a hierarchical structure, incorporating DTs at the component, plant,
    and cluster levels. The hierarchical structure enables granular monitoring and
    flexibility in system design. To ensure interoperability and standardization,
    the paper advocates for the adoption of the extended ML 4.0 data model, specifying
    properties and service functions crucial for SHM applications. In addition, the
    paper introduces an event system for real-time monitoring, allowing for proactive
    notification whenever new strain values are measured. The system is implemented
    using a prototype involving a cantilever beam, demonstrating its practicality.

      via systems to clusters into SHM systems. Furthermore, we detail a prototypical
      implementation of the conceptually developed framework, demonstrating a structural
      component and its corresponding Digital Twin. Here, real-time capable deformation
      and strain-based monitoring of the structure are achieved, showcasing the practical
      applicability of the proposed framework.
    extract_2: 'Based on these observations, we propose an organizational scheme to
      describe structural–mechanical objects from individual components to clusters
      based on hierarchical DTs. Additionally, we present the conceptual framework
      for integrating DTs into IoT-based SHM systems, addressing data security and
      interoperability. The remaining parts of the paper are structured as follows:
      Section 2 reviews published SHM applications with a focus on the employed networking
      infrastructures, as well as existing organizational schemes in SHM systems.
      In Section 3, we propose an organizational scheme of IoT-based SHM systems and
      the respective conceptual framework. Finally, a proof-of-concept implementation
      will be demonstrated in Section 4 to monitor the operational of an exemplary
      cantilever via an app in near real time. Section 5 discusses the extension possibilities
      of the prototypical application using our methodological approach. Section 6

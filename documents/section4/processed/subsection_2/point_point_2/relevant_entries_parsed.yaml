  explanation: The purpose of this study is to develop a system for automating the
    processes of data collection, processing, and provisioning for real-time irrigation
    management. This system takes a proactive approach to irrigation, predicting future
    irrigation needs and automatically allocating resources based on these predictions.
    The system is designed to be scalable to large-scale irrigation systems, and it
    is expected to improve water use efficiency and reduce water waste.

  key_findings: The system is based on a proactive approach to irrigation, predicting
    future irrigation needs and automatically allocating resources based on these
    predictions.
  limitations: The paper does not provide any specific data on the performance of
    the system in terms of water use efficiency or water waste reduction. Additionally,
    the system has not been tested in a real-world setting, so its scalability and
    effectiveness in practice are unknown.
  main_objective: To develop a system for automating the processes of data collection,
    processing, and provisioning for real-time irrigation management.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is relevant to the point being made in the literature
    review because it presents a new system for automating the processes of data collection,
    processing, and provisioning for real-time irrigation management. This system
    has the potential to improve water use efficiency and reduce water waste, which
    are important goals for sustainable agriculture.

  explanation: 'The work presented in this paper proposes an architecture for accurate
    monitoring of custom metrics for service-based cloud applications, which will
    be used for automatic provisioning and scaling of compute resources in cloud environments,
    while addressing services in very challenging scenarios such as VANETs. The system
    is composed of six main components: Service Apps, Metrics Server, Prometheus Monitor,
    Prometheus Kubernetes Adapter, Kubernetes Metrics API and HPA. The Service Apps
    represent services or compositions of services that will be monitored and scaled
    according to memory and CPU usage.'

  key_findings: 1. The proposed monitoring system is able to accurately monitor custom
    metrics for service-based cloud applications. 2. The system can be used to automatically
    provision and scale compute resources in cloud environments. 3. The system is
    effective in challenging environments such as VANETs, where resources are often
    scarce and the workload is highly dynamic.
  limitations: 1. The system relies on a centralized monitoring service, which could
    be a single point of failure.2. The system does not currently support live migration
    of virtual machines, which could lead to service disruption during scaling operations.
  main_objective: To design and implement a monitoring system for microservices, containers
    and container clusters that autonomously predicts load variations and resource
    scarcity, and is capable of making new resources available in order to ensure
    the continuity of the process without interruptions.
  relevance_evaluation: The proposed monitoring system is highly relevant to the specific
    point being made in the literature review. The system provides a comprehensive
    and accurate way to monitor custom metrics for service-based cloud applications,
    which is essential for enabling automated provisioning and scaling of compute
    resources. This capability is particularly important in challenging environments
    such as VANETs, where resources are often scarce and the workload is highly dynamic.
    The system also provides a number of features that make it easy to use and integrate
    with existing cloud platforms. Overall, the proposed system is a valuable addition
    to the literature on automated resource management for cloud applications.

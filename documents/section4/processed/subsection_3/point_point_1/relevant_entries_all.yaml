    Abstract: The objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive overview
    of the recent ad-

    vancements in the use of deep learning (DL) in the agricultural sector. The author
    conducted a

    review of studies published between 2016 and 2022 to highlight the various applications
    of DL in

    agriculture, which include counting fruits, managing water, crop management, soil
    management,

    weed detection, seed classiﬁcation, yield prediction, disease detection, and harvesting.
    The author

    found that DL’s ability to learn from large datasets has great promise for the
    transformation of the

    agriculture industry, but there are challenges, such as the difﬁculty of compiling
    datasets, the cost of

    computational power, and the shortage of DL experts. The author aimed to address
    these challenges

    by presenting his survey as a resource for future research and development regarding
    the use of DL

    in agriculture.

    1. Introduction

    In the contemporary era of globalization, the role and contributions of agriculture
    are

    crucially important. Over the years, agriculture has suffered from different challenges
    in

    fulﬁlling the ever-increasing needs of the world population, which has increased
    by twofold

    in the past ﬁve decades. There are different predictions for this unprecedented
    growth

    in the population, which is likely to reach approximately 9 billion people in
    the world

    by 2050 [1]. In addition, the estimates show an increase in the number of people
    living

    within urban areas, along with a signiﬁcant drop in the percentage of the population
    who

    are retired or working [1,2]. This means that agricultural productivity around
    the world

    must be increased considerably, and there is a need for a human labor force. To
    address

    this sort of problem, technologies such as tractors were introduced into agriculture
    over a

    century ago. At present, mechanical technology is showing an incredible evolution,
    and

    a signiﬁcant number of technologies are available. Existing technologies, such
    as remote

    sensing [3], robotic platforms [4], and the Internet of Things (IoT) [2], have
    recently become

    widespread in industry, particularly in the agricultural sector, leading to the
    phenomenon

    of smart and efﬁcient farming [5,6]. Schmidhuber (2015) states that deep learning
    (DL) is a

    modern approach that is successfully being utilized as part of various machine-learning

    techniques [7]. It is comparable to artiﬁcial neutral networks (ANNs) but with
    enhanced

    learning capabilities; therefore, it has higher accuracy [8]. In recent years,
    DL technologies,

    such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), recurrent neutral networks (RNNs),
    and

    convolutional neutral networks (CNNs), have been widely implemented and investigated

    in different ﬁelds of research, including farming and agriculture. Agriculturalists
    and

    researchers often use different software systems without assessing the mechanisms
    and

    ideas of the techniques, such as GANs, RNNs, and CNNs, that are usually applied
    in DL

    algorithms. There are various sub-categories of DL algorithms, including deep
    convo-

    lutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), very deep convolutional networks

    (VGGNets), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks; therefore, understanding
    these

    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 540

    2 of 22

    sub-categories of DL algorithms is important for understanding common DL algorithms
    [9].

    According to Kamilaris and Prenafeta [10], DL is a modern and recent technique
    and

    system for data analysis and image processing with signiﬁcant potential and promising

    results [10]. DL has been successfully used in different domains and has recently
    entered

    the agriculture ﬁeld. Additionally, it has the potential to address complex problems
    more

    efﬁciently and quickly due to the use of complex models that enable massive parallelization.

    These multifaceted models used in DL are likely to increase classiﬁcation accuracy
    and

    limit faults in regression problems, but only if there are sufﬁciently large databases
    that can

    be used to explain such problems.

    The authors of [11] argued that DL using drone technology is signiﬁcant for agriculture

    and farming as it provides a convenient way to monitor, assess, and scan crops
    through the

    use of high-quality and high-resolution images [11]. Such technology aids in recognizing

    advancements in ﬁelds and assessing quality. For example, with the help of images

    provided by drone technology, agriculturalists and farmers can determine whether
    crops

    are fully ready for harvesting. DL, along with machine-learning (ML) techniques,
    can help

    farmers understand the nature of the soil, thus aiding them in making timely decisions

    regarding farming. DL is also applied to assess how nutrients and water are to
    be managed

    and to make decisions about the suitable time for cropping and harvesting. Yields
    are

    higher and more efﬁcient and the return on investment (ROI) for crops can be projected,

    considering the margin and cost in the market [12]. In addition, the efﬁciency
    of DL is

    recognized because it has been observed to outclass conventional methods, such
    as support

    vector machines (SVMs), random forest (RF) algorithms, and ANNs. Several technologies

    are being used together with DL to enhance performance in prediction and classiﬁcation

    related to agricultural problems. The RNN and LSTM models have memory and time

    dimensions. As a result, they can be used to project animal and plant growth based
    on

    recorded data, evaluate water needs, and determine crop yield using the mining
    time

    dimensions and memory function [13,14]. They can also be utilized to estimate
    plant

    and animal growth based on previously recorded data to evaluate fruit yields or
    water

    requirements. Ren et al. [15], for example, used both models to forecast various
    phenomena

    and climate changes. Using hyperspectral images and infrared thermal imaging to
    provide

    data and information is the right direction for the prompt detection of diseases
    in crops.

    With the subsequent exponential growth in this ﬁeld, it is necessary to provide
    an up-to-date

    review of the recent literature focusing on innovative research techniques implementing

    DL for agriculture. Hence, this study focused on providing an overview of the
    recent

    advancements linked to DL in the agricultural sector. The study aimed to describe
    the

    use of DL in agriculture; in particular, with respect to counting fruits, managing
    water,

    crop management, soil management, weed detection, seed classiﬁcation, yield prediction,

    disease detection, and harvesting. The adoption of technology in the agriculture
    sector

    during the recent period has signiﬁcantly transformed and assisted farming and
    crop

    cultivation. However, DL has been noted to have added efﬁciency to agriculture,
    which

    has motivated researchers to investigate how it can be helpful in farming and
    harvesting

    and in yield predictions.

    This paper is categorized in the following way: Section 2 presents the research
    method-

    ology. Section 3 provides a literature review by highlighting a brief history
    of the topic.

    Section 4 highlights the importance of DL in the agriculture sector. Section 5
    discusses DL

    tools that can be used for model development. In addition, the same section describes
    the

    usage, purpose, signiﬁcance, and implementation of DL in the agriculture sector.
    Section 6

    provides the results and a discussion, drawing on previous studies that have discussed

    deep learning. Section 7 presents the overall conclusion of the study, together
    with some

    ideas for future research directions.

    3. Literature Review

    3.1. Deep Learning

    Agriculture faces many challenges due to the increase in demand and the presence

    of fewer workers in the ﬁelds. In this context, smart farming can be used to address

    issues such as food security, sustainability, productivity, and environmental
    impact [16].

    As is known, agriculture plays a vital role in the global economy [17]. This is
    because

    it ensures food security for countries, and most companies rely on it for their
    external

    trade. In the world today, most home appliances, travel means, and other commonly

    used services are becoming automated through the adoption of artiﬁcial intelligence
    (AI);

    thus, farming practices should too, since they are the backbone of a country.
    Achieving

    understanding and making quick responses with the help of data provided by continuous

    monitoring, measuring, and analysis of different physical aspects and phenomena
    would be

    helpful to overcome the complex, multivariate, and unpredictable challenges of
    agricultural

    ecosystems [18]. This would require the analysis of huge amounts of agricultural
    data

    and the use of new information and communication technologies (ICTs) and would
    be

    necessary for both small-scale farms and large-scale ecosystem monitoring [19].
    It could

    be achieved using DL with a large network. DL is basically an aspect of machine
    learning

    that aims to build neural networks that can analytically learn by simulating the
    human

    brain. It acts like the human brain in that it works by reading data, such as
    pictures, videos,

    text, and sounds. With its continued development, DL has already been implemented
    in

    various complex tasks, such as image segmentation, image recognition, natural
    language

    processing, object detection, and image classiﬁcation [18]. However, DL requires
    a huge

    dataset since the quality of the DL results entirely depends on the size of the
    dataset, and

    the model tends to learn from that data and then respond accordingly. Some computer
    and

    industrial advancements, such as image processing, IoT technologies, robotics,
    machine

    learning, deep learning, and computer vision, are very useful in the agricultural
    industry

    and even for local farmers. High-quality image processing makes AI based on drone

    technology a very helpful asset for farmers, since they can identify the progress
    of the crops

    and determine whether they are ready to harvest or not while sitting in one place
    rather

    than having to move long distances. This has been achieved just AI and a drone
    system;

    one can only imagine how beneﬁcial it would be to implement DL in agriculture
    [18].

    Figure 2 lists numerous advantages of using DL in agriculture. With the current

    increase in the population, there has also been an increase in the demand for
    agricultural

    goods [18]. The implementation of DL and other automation components could greatly

    beneﬁt production outcomes, reduce the chances of ripening, reduce production
    costs,

    and increase income due to the increased production. Moreover, it would also make

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 540

    4 of 22

    it possible to forecast climatic changes—for instance, if there is an incoming
    rainstorm,

    cyclone, etc.—so that the farmers could be ready and prepare before a disaster.

    Figure 2. Deep learning applications in agriculture [18].

    3.2. Agriculture before Deep Learning

    Traditional agriculture was the main method of farming before the adoption of
    sci-

    entiﬁc advancements in agricultural industries. Traditional agriculture mainly
    involves

    the extensive use of traditional tools and organic fertilizers, indigenous knowledge
    of land

    use and natural resources, cultural beliefs, etc. [19]. Another way to describe
    it could be

    as the “primitive style” or “early style” of farming and food production. The
    traditional

    method of farming affects the environment in many ways, such as through the depletion
    of

    soil nutrients. For instance, slash and burn practices in traditional agriculture
    were one

    reason for decreased soil organic matter. Another problem caused by traditional
    farming

    was deforestation, as most deforestation has taken place in tropical rainforests
    to make

    space for other agricultural activities. Another signiﬁcant issue relating to
    soil erosion is

    the removal of topsoil by water or wind. This topsoil is the most fertile, and
    it may take

    decades to replenish it once it is removed [19].

    Agroforestry, crop rotation, intercropping, polycultures, and water harvesting
    are

    some of the most common types of traditional farming practices. The traditional
    farming

    method of constructing grain storage structures provided an incredible moisture-proof

    environment for grain storage. Compared to today’s colossal warehouses, these
    small

    structures were cheap to fabricate and maintain. However, many different pesticides
    were

    used to keep the grains safe during storage periods, which later resulted in very
    bad effects

    on the environment [20]. The implementation of technology and the investment of
    huge

    sums of money in agricultural industries have helped to control other diseases,
    thereby

    making the amount of money spent worthwhile.

    3.3. Deep Learning Architecture

    Several nonlinear transformations are used to model higher-level abstractions
    in

    data, and these are the foundations of DL [21]. One of the main beneﬁts of DL
    is the

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 540

    5 of 22

    automatic extraction of features from raw data or feature learning. Producing
    features

    from lower-level components yields features in higher-level components [22]. Recurrent

    neural networks (RNNs) and CNNs are two types of DL networks that are often used

    in agriculture.

    3.3.1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

    The CNN is a type of DL algorithm [23] composed of multiple convolutional layers,

    pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Two of the most common applications
    for CNNs

    are the recognition of handwritten characters and image processing. In the domain
    of

    computer vision, CNNs have been used for a variety of tasks, including object
    detection,

    image classiﬁcation, voice recognition, image fragmentation, medical image analysis,
    and

    text and video processing. Convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers
    are the

    typical architectural components of a CNN [24]. Figure 3 depicts the architecture
    of a CNN,

    and brief descriptions of each layer are provided below.

    Figure 3. Convolutional neural network architecture.

    In a CNN, the convolutional layer is the most fundamental and signiﬁcant. It stores
    all

    of the images’ distinguishing characteristics while making it possible to limit
    the amount of

    data that must be simultaneously processed. Then, pooling enables a CNN to aggregate
    all

    the different dimensions of an image and recognize the object, even if its form
    is distorted or

    it is positioned at an angle. Thus, the number of learnable features in the model
    is reduced,

    helping to address the overﬁtting issue. Pooling can be accomplished in a variety
    of ways,

    including average pooling, maximum pooling, and stochastic pooling. The fully
    connected

    layer is the ﬁnal layer, which is used to feed the neural network [24].

    3.3.2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

    An RNN is a type of neural network model capable of performing exceptionally

    well in fundamental tasks such as machine translation, language modeling, and
    speech

    recognition [25]. Unlike traditional neural networks, RNNs use the network’s sequential

    information. This feature is essential in many applications because the data sequence’s

    inherent structure contains valuable information that can be extracted from it.
    Figure 4

    depicts the fundamental structure of a recurrent neural network [25].

    4. Signiﬁcance of Deep Learning in Agriculture

    4.1. Counting of Fruit

    Counting fruit is an essential task for growers because it makes it possible to
    estimate

    the yield, which can be helpful in the management of yards. According to [26],
    counting

    fruit using automated fruit detection and algorithms can optimize agriculture
    production

    and help in managing the harvest process effectively. For automated fruit counting
    and

    detection, the authors provided a method that uses a pipeline for the DL algorithms

    consisting of part 0, part 1, part 2, and part 3. In part 0, the algorithms learn
    ground

    truths. They use the Bob detection neural network in part 1 and count the fruit
    through the

    neural network in part 2. In part 3, the linear regression is run for the ﬁnal
    count [26]. The

    authors of [27] proposed automatic yield estimation using robotic agricultural
    techniques

    to improve the manual counting of fruit. The authors used Inception-ResNet to
    achieve a

    high accuracy ratio with a lower computational cost as a deep simulated learning
    technique.

    The signiﬁcance of the technique proposed in [27] is that it does not require
    thousands of

    images to train the neural networks. Instead, the network can be trained with
    synthetic

    images to test the authenticity of images, achieving an accuracy rate of 91%.
    This novel

    DL method can facilitate farmers’ abilities to efﬁciently count fruit and make
    decisions

    with great precision [27]. Similarly, the authors of [28] trained a Fast R-CNN
    DL model

    to detect, count, and predict the right size for citrus fruit. The authors also
    used the long

    short-term memory detection method to calculate the number of fruit on each tree,
    as

    shown in Figure 5. Hence, DL methods, such as automated yield detection, DL simulation,

    and Fast R-CNN, can be helpful in the counting of fruit. Table 1 presents the
    most recent

    methods for counting fruits.

    4.2. Management of Water

    Water is an essential natural resource for agriculture that needs recycling for
    the

    continued and sustainable development of agriculture. The authors of [39] stated
    that

    water is essential for agriculture production but the chemicals from industries
    and the

    wastewater from daily usage increase water pollution. Therefore, the agriculture
    ﬁeld

    needs a DL technique to protect agriculture from water pollution. The authors
    of [39]

    proposed a near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy method that can be used to assess
    water

    demand, protection, and recycling. The NIR system is used as one layer along with
    an

    improved convolutional neural network (CNN) layer that employs decision tree analysis

    to depict informative data helpful for making decisions relevant to water management.

    The authors of [40] posited that agriculture is the backbone of the economy in
    India and

    requires water as a signiﬁcant resource. Traditional irrigation methods waste
    water due to

    excessive water use and unplanned water management. Therefore, the authors provided

    an integrative approach that uses DL methods to improve the irrigation system
    in India’s

    agriculture (see Figure 6). The system consists of sensors that detect the soil’s
    humidity

    and predict the irrigation needs of the soil. The authors of [41] stated that
    water is a critical

    resource for which evapotranspiration assessment is very beneﬁcial. Evapotranspiration

    assessment uses DL techniques to predict upcoming water needs and to provide clues
    that

    can be helpful for real-time irrigation management. Thus, DL techniques can help
    farmers

    precisely manage their irrigation systems.

    Figure 6. Deep learning approach for water management [40].

    4.3. Crop Management

    The signiﬁcance of DL frameworks is increasing in crop management, a subﬁeld of

    agriculture. The authors of [42] asserted that DL technology is beneﬁcial for
    crop planting.

    Crop planting is the ﬁrst step in crop production and needs to be managed efﬁciently
    to

    increase crop production. The authors discussed the various DL crop planting techniques,

    including ViSeed, which has been used for soybean production; Fast R-CNN, which
    has

    been used to count and measure the stalks of sorghum plants; CNN, which has been
    used

    for the identiﬁcation of localized features of roots and shoots; and VGG-16, which
    has

    been used for categorization of crops and weeds. According to the authors of [43],
    there

    are different types of deep learning networks that can be used for crop prediction.
    These

    different types include ANNs, for which the regression method and crop species
    and images

    and climatic and soil properties can be used to predict wheat, barley, sugarcane,
    sunﬂower,

    and potato crop production. Other DL techniques discussed in [43] include two-layered

    DNN LSTM, which has been used to predict tomato, soybean, and corn crop production

    using the regression method, a vegetative index, environmental characteristics,
    and soil.

    In addition, the authors of [44] stated that intelligence plays a crucial role
    in precisely

    managing crops. The authors introduced the CropDeep approach, which classiﬁes
    and

    detects different classes of crops. CropDeep provides crop management services
    through

    cameras and models; it classiﬁes crops and provides analysis that is helpful for
    decision

    making and includes real-world challenges; e.g., weather uncertainty (see Figure
    7). Table 2

    presents the most recent methods for crop management.

    4.4. Soil Management

    Soil management refers to the practices, operations, and treatments that protect
    soil

    and increase an agricultural ﬁeld’s production. The authors of [50] stated that
    DL techniques

    can help manage soil moisture. According to the authors, developing a mathematical
    model

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 540

    9 of 22

    is difﬁcult for soil moisture, so the accuracy, predictions, and generalization
    of existing

    models could be improved. The authors improved the DL regression model by ﬁtting
    it

    with large datasets, making it possible to precisely determine soil moisture.

    The authors of [51] proposed that agriculture has been an essential aspect of
    the lives of

    human beings since even before civilization. Soil yield plays a key role in crop
    production

    and efﬁcient agriculture. Therefore, the authors discussed how implementing the
    Keras

    API in Python can help protect soil from herbicide toxicity while also retaining
    moisture.

    Moreover, using a ﬁrst-order agriculture simulator that employs discrete time,
    the Richard

    equation can help determine the precise moisture level in soil [52]. The authors
    explained

    that using an agriculture simulator can help in obtaining aerial images with a
    particular soil

    moisture information dataset. The dataset was analyzed using seven methods, including

    constant prediction baseline, SVM, and NN, which showed that using a CNN could
    reduce

    water consumption by 52% [52]. Thus, the authors showed that DL techniques can
    help

    maintain soil moisture.

    4.5. Weed Detection

    Weeds are undesirable plants that can reduce crop production. DL techniques can

    help detect weeds. According to [51], a “weed” is a plant that grows in an unfavorable

    environment. They have negative effects on crop production because they compete
    with

    plants for water, sunlight, and soil minerals. Weed detection can be undertaken
    by using

    DL techniques, such as ﬁrst-order agriculture simulation with Richard’s equation.
    This

    approach reduces the use of weedicides, thus protecting the soil from toxicity
    and ensuring

    the plants achieve suitable production yields. In addition, the authors of [53]
    raised the

    concern that the production and utilization of herbicides have made weeds resistant
    to

    these herbicides. Therefore, developing precision techniques to detect weeds is
    important

    to increase crop production. Researchers have discussed the revolution in computing

    technology and how it can help in better understanding weed biology and ecology.
    DL is

    the most helpful technique, as it aids in categorizing weeds in crop categories
    and getting

    rid of them. In a similar context, the authors of [54] found that DL techniques,
    such as

    classiﬁcation SVMs and CNNs, can reduce the burden on farmers. The techniques
    can help

    farmers detect weeds. The authors described various weed detection and categorization

    techniques. In such techniques, the camera ﬁrst takes images of weeds and then
    uses a gray-

    level occurrence matrix to identify homogeneity among the images. The color identiﬁed

    through the hue saturation value (HSV) describes the mellowness of the weeds,
    as shown

    in Figure 8. Hence, DL techniques are helpful for weed detection, reducing the
    burden on

    farmers and increasing crop yield.

    4.6. Seed Classiﬁcation

    In the agriculture sector, crop production strongly relies on seeds. According
    to [55],

    seeds are a signiﬁcant part of crop production, without which production and harvesting

    of crops are impossible. The increased level of population growth has put pressure
    on

    agriculture growth due to the precision needed when identifying and classifying
    seeds.

    The authors proposed a CNN to increase the efﬁciency of the classiﬁcation of seeds.
    In this

    technique, the methods used included decayed learning points.

    4.7. Classiﬁcation of Plant Diseases

    Plants can produce decreased crop yields due to the presence of fungi, microbes,
    and

    bacteria. If the disease is not diagnosed in time, it can cause signiﬁcant economic
    losses

    for farmers. The pathogen-killing pesticides that are used to restore crop functionality

    and remove pests come at a high cost. Excessive use of pesticides is detrimental
    to the

    environment and can disrupt the water and soil cycles [56]. As plant diseases
    stunt growth,

    identifying them in their early stages is essential. DL models have been applied
    in the

    process of recognizing and categorizing various plant diseases. Several DL architectures

    have been proposed to improve detection accuracy [57]. In [58], the authors proposed
    a

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 540

    10 of 22

    method for identifying and categorizing banana diseases based on a CNN. The proposed

    model processes pictures of leaves to help farmers detect two banana diseases
    (sigatoka

    and speckle) quickly. In addition, the authors of [59] used AlexNet to accurately
    classify

    plant diseases based on leaf images. The DL hybrid model described in [60] identiﬁed

    and categorized diseases that affect sunﬂowers, such as Verticillium wilt, Phoma
    rot,

    downy mildew, and Alternaria leaf rot. The authors of [61] developed a mobile
    app that

    utilizes machine learning to diagnose diseases that affect plant leaves. The app
    can classify

    38 different diseases. The authors amassed 96,206 images, including both healthy
    and

    diseased plant leaf specimens, for training, testing, and validation of the model.
    In [62], the

    authors proposed a pre-trained, transfer-learning deep neural network model that
    could

    predict crop disease by learning leaf characteristics from input data. They extensively

    investigated different DL and CNN topologies, such as ResNet, MobileNet, Wide
    ResNet,

    and DenseNet. The result showed that the proposed method was superior in terms
    of

    accuracy and memory to previous methods in the literature. Another CNN-based method

    for detecting, classifying, and identifying plant diseases was proposed in [63].
    The accuracy

    for the identiﬁcation of 13 different plant diseases ranged from 91 to 98%. Furthermore,
    the

    proposed model was able to distinguish between unhealthy and healthy leaves, as
    well as

    their backgrounds. Using 500 different leaf images, the authors of [64] proposed
    a model

    based on an SVM classiﬁer. The proposed model could accurately identify plant
    diseases,

    achieving an accuracy of 94%. Table 3 presents the most recent methods for classifying

    plant diseases.

    4.8. Yield Prediction

    It is essential to focus on and carefully manage yield predictions for each crop.
    Agri-

    cultural machine-learning and DL algorithms are primarily concerned with crop
    yield

    prediction. They inform the farmer about whether the crop is ready for cultivation
    and

    predict when it will be [73]. Manjula et al. [74] proposed a model based on an
    RF classiﬁer

    that could predict millet crop yield with an accuracy of 99.74%. The prediction
    of crop

    yield is notoriously difﬁcult due to the presence of numerous complex factors.
    For example,

    high-dimensional marker data are required to represent genotype information, consisting

    of the data for millions of markers for each individual plant. The ﬁnal effect
    of the genetic

    markers must be estimated because it is affected by numerous environmental conditions

    and ﬁeld management techniques. Recently, a variety of machine-learning models,
    includ-

    ing association rule mining, ANNs, decision trees, and multivariate regression,
    have been

    applied in the ﬁeld of crop yield prediction. The most notable characteristic
    of ML and DL

    may be that the output is treated as an implicit function of the input variables
    and may be

    a highly nonlinear and complex function [75].

    Extensive research has been conducted on crop yield prediction. Liu et al. [76]
    em-

    ployed a neural network with one hidden layer for the prediction of corn yield
    using input

    data on weather, soil, and management. In the same context, Drummond et al. [76]
    worked

    on predicting crop yield by using neural networks, projection pursuit regression,
    and

    stepwise multiple linear regression. As a result, they found that both regression
    methods

    were outperformed by the neural network method. In addition, Marko et al. [76]
    predicted

    the crop yields of different soybean varieties by using weighted histogram regression.
    They

    obtained better performance than the conventional regression algorithms.

    4.9. Disease Detection

    In the agricultural ﬁeld, one major threat to farmers is crop disease. With the
    devel-

    opments in the ﬁelds of AI and DL and their implementation in agricultural industries,

    crop disease detection has become one of the easiest processes. Before the adoption
    of

    advanced technology in agriculture, the detection of diseases in crops at an early
    stage was

    a time-consuming and tedious task that had to be performed manually [77]. Plant
    disease

    not only affects plant growth and the population but also seriously affects the
    economy

    of countries. Hence, it is essential to adopt automatic and accurate techniques
    for the

    prediction and detection of plant disease severity for disease management and
    food safety

    and to predict losses in returns. In most developing countries, farmers are usually
    required

    to travel huge distances to contact experts, which can consume huge amounts of
    money

    and time [76]. This could be handled by developing a robust and easy-to-use plant
    or crop

    disease detection system, which would require many sample images of crops that
    have

    diseases that could be uploaded to the cloud, and the system could run on IoT
    devices, such

    as smartphones and tablet PCs with appropriate computational capabilities. Some
    work

    has been done in order to tackle this issue of crop diseases. Nikhil Patil et
    al. [78] proposed

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 540

    12 of 22

    a crop disease detection system using a CNN. The system achieved an accuracy rate
    of 89%

    compared to the traditional crop disease detection system. Hence, when it comes
    to image

    processing, CNN systems can be relied upon due to the fact that they are widely
    used in

    agricultural research. Most DL applications in agriculture can be categorized
    as plant or

    crop classiﬁcation, which is important for disaster monitoring, robotic harvesting,
    pest

    control, and yield prediction. Plant and crop disease recognition models are mostly
    based

    on pattern recognition and leaf images [78]. Hence, DL and AI models could automatically

    determine which plants are diseased and send alerts to the farmer for early action.
    Figure 9

    shows an example of how DL and AI can detect plant diseases.

    Figure 9. Plant disease detection [79].

    5. Application of Deep-Learning Models in Agriculture

    According to [80], there are different points of view about the creation of DL
    tools

    for model development. Python tools are used to emphasize the concept of saliency
    in

    images. Saliency is typically deﬁned by unique features, including pixels, or
    the resolution

    of the image in visual processing. Another DL tool is the gradient explanation
    technique,

    which employs the gradient-based attribution method. In this method, each gradient

    quantiﬁes each of the input dimensions that can change the predictions around
    the input.

    The integrated gradient is a gradient-based attribution that allows predictions
    to be formed

    by a deep neural network. It is created via attributions related to the network’s
    input

    features [81]. Deep label-speciﬁc feature (DeepLIFT) is another tool designed
    to ensure

    the accuracy of deep neural network predictions. It is also known as the gradient
    + input

    method, and it is used to enhance the gradient with the input signal. It has quite
    a few

    advantages over gradient-based methods, especially when it is implemented into
    models

    that are usually trained with natural images and genomics data [82]. Typically,
    activation

    of each neuron takes place with reference to the contribution scores calculated
    by the

    system. These calculations are based on comparisons between various outputs and
    a

    certain benchmarked output and the differences in the inputs from their reference
    inputs.

    Another model is guided backpropagation, also known as guided saliency, which
    is a

    type of deconvolution approach. This tool and approach is often employed in a
    range of

    network structures, such as in max pooling in CNNs [83]. The purpose is to substitute
    the

    max-pooling layers with a convolutional layer. Similarly, the authors of [84]
    claim that

    deconvolution is a technique for visualizing CNNs that uses quite similar aspects,
    such as

    deconvolutional networks. Furthermore, the authors of [85] proposed class activation
    maps

    (CAMs) for the identiﬁcation of images. With this tool, analysts may inspect a
    particular

    image and then its speciﬁc parts or pixels are used to form the ﬁnal output. In
    other

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 540

    13 of 22

    words, CAMs are used to study the discriminative regions of an image, as with
    a CNN. A

    ﬁnal softmax-loss layer is formed after obtaining the weighted sum of the vector.
    Finally,

    layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) is a tool for decomposing nonlinear classiﬁers
    that

    aims to improve DL interpretability [86]. It is based on deep neural networks
    formed by

    propagating predictions backward, fulﬁlling the requirement for the conservation
    property.

    All the abovementioned DL tools are currently available for model development.

    According to [87], the deep neural network (DNN) can be employed using a CNN for

    the assessment of the quality of seeds in agriculture. The model can be used to
    study the

    quality of seeds in soybean pods, along with the sorting of haploid seeds. Assessments

    of the shape, phenotypic expression, and embryonic pose are undertaken [88]. CNNs

    have also been used in the classiﬁcation plant seedlings into 12 species. Furthermore,
    the

    authors of [89] used an image analysis technique to create a principal component
    analysis

    (PCA) that can be used to place seeds in different clusters in a cost- and time-effective

    manner. The authors of [90] claimed that DL algorithms, such as Inspection-v3,
    VGG-16,

    and VGG-19, are more efﬁcient in citrus plant disease detection than other innovations.

    In [91], the authors claimed that DL methods aid in the identiﬁcation of plant
    diseases

    from individual lesions and spots. This makes it possible to focus on other aspects
    rather

    than only considering the entire leaf in disease detection. This DL application
    is good

    at detecting multiple diseases on the same leaf and provides 12% greater accuracy.
    DL

    methods can also be used to identify various plant diseases [92]. The authors
    of [93]

    claimed that apple leaf and fruit diseases can be detected using a CNN model,
    implying

    that the use of DL models for disease detection is quite effective. There are
    also harvesting

    techniques that use DL. The authors of [94] formed a shot-detector (YOLO) algorithm
    for

    on-tree fruit detection and used the BBox-Label-Tool to label images. Likewise,
    two deep

    learning models were utilized for images of pears and apples fruits, and it was
    found that

    the deep learning models were quite effective for harvesting purposes. The authors
    of [95]

    revealed that having a robust DL model can be helpful in the harvesting process,
    as it

    showed promising results due to its employment of bio-inspired features. As shown
    by

    these studies, DL is becoming one of the most useful techniques and models in
    harvesting

    since it employs mature features in comparison to other agricultural techniques.
    This recent

    survey also shows that CNNs have promising results in agriculture and increase
    efﬁciency.

    In other words, CNNs have increased accuracy and improved learning capacities
    when DL

    mechanisms are employed in agriculture.

    6. Results and Discussions

    The ﬁndings from the studies show that DL mechanisms have helped farmers in

    different areas of agricultural production. These include counting fruit, management

    of water, crop management, soil management, weed detection, seed classiﬁcation,
    yield

    prediction, disease detection, and even harvesting. A summary of the key ﬁndings
    is

    presented in Table 4.

    The key ﬁndings from the literature review show that there are various ways in
    which

    DL has beneﬁted the agriculture industry. Agriculture faces numerous barriers
    as a result of

    increased demand and fewer workers in the sector. However, the implementation
    of smart

    farming can help address issues such as productivity, environmental impact, food
    security,

    and sustainability and increase the efﬁciency of agricultural production [16].
    Agriculture,

    as is well-known, plays an important part in the global economy [17] as it ensures
    food

    security for regions and is used by the majority of businesses for external commerce.
    The

    implementation of deep-learning methods has helped the agricultural sector grow
    and

    develop, employing the latest prediction analyses and tools. There are various
    tools that

    have been used by scholars to prove the efﬁciency of deep-learning methods in
    agriculture.

    According to [18], the size of the dataset used for deep-learning methods may
    determine

    the quality of the results. The accuracy of the results obtained using deep learning
    in

    agricultural production and processes may lead to improved decisions. Traditional
    farming

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 540

    15 of 22

    practices result in a wide range of environmental consequences, including soil
    nutrient

    depletion. Deforestation is another issue produced by traditional farming, as
    most defor-

    estation has occurred in tropical rainforests to make room for other agricultural
    activities.

    Soil erosion, which occurs as a result of the erosion of topsoil by water or wind,
    is another

    issue associated with traditional farming. This topsoil is the most productive
    portion of the

    soil and, once removed, it can take decades to restore it [19]. This implies that
    traditional

    agricultural production methods are insufﬁcient to promote the efﬁciency of the
    sector.

    Agriculture must become more brilliant and progressive in order to meet future
    demands

    and utilize emerging technologies, such as deep learning, remote sensors, and
    distributed

    computing [98]. The current study’s key ﬁndings highlight that the use of various
    DL tools

    in agriculture has improved farming outcomes and production. According to [95],
    the

    real parameters for agriculture are now obtained through cutting-edge technology
    and DL

    mechanisms. DL methods have proven their ability to increase efﬁciency in agriculture,

    showing improved results and accuracy in all domains. Despite the employment of
    DL

    mechanisms in agriculture, it was identiﬁed that there are also certain challenges
    that

    accompany the use of this technology, such as dataset creation, the time required
    to train

    staff, and having skilled labor to increase production. Furthermore, system development

    and hardware maintenance, as well as the deployment of large models and software
    on

    small devices, such as mobile phones, may have an impact on system efﬁciency [99].
    More-

    over, developing awareness among staff members when DL methods are employed is

    also challenging in agriculture. According to [100], transfer learning is a technique
    that

    can be employed to minimize the emerging challenges that may arise when employing

    deep learning in agriculture. It is typically used to address problems when there
    is a

    small dataset and minimal time is required to test the accuracy of the model.
    As shown

    in [101,102], AI is useful to minimize the challenges affecting agricultural production
    when

    DL and robotics are used. In the same context, automated machine learning (AutoML)
    is

    another technique that helps increase agriculture production through innovation.
    When

    DL methods are employed in agricultural production mechanisms, AutoML can be use-

    ful to minimize the challenges. Thus, the literature shows that DL methods have
    been

    extremely useful in increasing production in the agricultural sector. However,
    in order

    to minimize the challenges that come with employing DL techniques, it is important
    to

    consider employing other emerging technologies, such as robotics, the Internet
    of Things,

    and distributed computing.

    It was found that most DL-based farming techniques use very simple algorithms
    and

    network structures. The primary cause of this is that the combination of deep
    learning and

    precision agriculture is still in its infancy. The lack of collaboration between
    the computer-

    science and agriculture communities is also a contributing factor. Table 1 shows
    that many

    of the deep-learning algorithms tested had an accuracy of 90% or more with some
    datasets,

    but it should be noted that these results are not generalizable. The accuracy
    and speed

    of these networks typically fall short of the benchmarks when they are employed
    with

    other datasets or a real farmland environment. This is mainly due to the fact
    that the

    complexity, quality, and quantities of agricultural datasets are still very different
    from

    actual farmland environments. Many novel approaches have been proposed to lessen

    the reliance of DL models on agricultural datasets, including transfer learning
    [103,104],

    few-shot learning [105,106], graph convolutional networks [107], and semi-supervised

    learning [108]. However, their entire performances are still unavailable. Only
    a few

    recent studies have focused on tailoring deep-learning algorithms and neural network

    architectures to the needs of agricultural applications. Some studies, for instance,
    have

    aimed to ﬁnd the most effective ways to optimize the parameters used in DL models.

    Enhancing DL algorithms and frameworks has been the focus of other research. With
    the

    aim of large-scale dense semantic segmentation of weeds using aerial images, the
    authors

    of [109,110] presented WeedMap and WeedNet. They made changes to the decoder that

    allowed them to use a modiﬁed version of the VGG16 architecture in place of the
    original

    encoder. Jiao et al. [111] created an anchor-free convolutional neural network
    (AF-RCNN)

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 540

    to achieve a balance between speed and accuracy in deep-learning algorithms applied

    to the detection of multiclass agricultural pests. To improve recognition accuracy
    in leaf

    disease detection, the authors of [112] utilized convolutional neural networks
    (CNNs) and

    pre-trained models to identify plant diseases. The study focused on ﬁne-tuning
    popular

    pre-trained models, such as DenseNet-121, ResNet-50, VGG-16, and Inception V4,
    using

    the PlantVillage dataset, which contains 54,305 images of plant diseases in 38
    classes. The

    performance of the models was evaluated through various metrics. The results showed
    that

    DenseNet-121 achieved the highest classiﬁcation accuracy of 99.81%, outperforming
    other

    state-of-the-art models. In the same context, the authors of [113] proposed a
    new method for

    data augmentation utilizing generative adversarial networks (GANs) for tomato
    leaf disease

    recognition. By utilizing deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs)
    to

    augment the original images and GoogLeNet as the input, the proposed model was
    able to

    achieve the top average identiﬁcation accuracy of 94.33%. The model was further
    improved

    by adjusting the hyper-parameters, modifying the architecture of the convolutional
    neural

    networks, and experimenting with different GANs. The use of DCGAN to augment

    the dataset not only increased its size but also improved its diversity, leading
    to better

    generalization of the recognition model. In addition, the authors of [114] proposed
    the use

    of a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) to augment an original

    dataset and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) in the task of regression
    by

    utilizing the DCGAN to generate synthetic images that were realistic enough to
    be included

    in the training set. They employed a two-stage scheme where the baseline CNN,
    trained

    with the original dataset, was utilized to predict the regression vectors for
    each image

    generated by the DCGAN. These regression vectors served as the ground truth for
    the

    augmented dataset, enabling the CNN to make more accurate predictions.

    7. Future Challenges and Opportunities in the Agricultural Domain

    Deep learning has the potential to revolutionize the agricultural industry by
    enabling

    more efﬁcient crop production, precision agriculture, and improved crop monitoring
    and

    forecasting. However, there are several challenges that need to be addressed to
    fully

    realize the potential of deep learning in agriculture. One major challenge is
    the lack of

    high-quality labeled data in the ﬁeld of agriculture. This can be addressed by
    developing

    new data collection methods and creating large labeled datasets that can be used
    to train

    deep-learning models [114]. Another challenge is the high computational cost associated

    with deep learning, which can make it difﬁcult to implement these models in resource-

    constrained environments, such as rural areas [115].

    Additionally, there is a need for deep-learning models in agriculture to attain
    robust-

    ness and adaptability to different environments, crop types, imaging conditions,
    and sensor

    modalities. This requires the development of models that can be generalized well
    across

    different scenarios and are robust to variations in the data [116,117]. Furthermore,
    as the

    data in the agricultural domain is often incomplete, noisy, or corrupted, there
    is a need for

    methods that can handle missing or incomplete data [118]. In recent years, research
    on

    robust deep-learning techniques, such as robust optimization, adversarial training
    [118],

    and meta-learning [119,120], has been undertaken to address this challenge, but
    more

    research is still needed in this area.

    Another important challenge is the need for deep-learning models in agriculture

    to be interpretable and explainable, as this is essential for decision making
    and to gain

    trust from stakeholders. There is a growing interest in developing methods that
    can

    provide insight into the inner workings of deep-learning models, such as explainable
    AI

    techniques—for instance, Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME)
    [121]

    and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) [122]—and interpretable deep learning—for

    instance, decision trees and rule-based systems [123]. Moreover, the integration
    of multiple

    modalities of data, such as image, sensor, and weather data, is crucial to improving
    the

    performance of deep-learning models in agriculture. There is a need for multistream
    neural

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 540

    17 of 22

    networks, such as those based on attention [124], that can handle multiple modalities
    of

    data and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the agricultural system.

    Few-shot learning is a form of machine learning that allows models to be generalized
    to

    previously unseen classes with a small number of examples. This is beneﬁcial in
    agriculture,

    as it allows such models to learn more quickly and accurately from a limited amount
    of

    data. Furthermore, it is more data-efﬁcient, meaning that fewer data points are
    required to

    train the model [125].

    In conclusion, deep learning has the potential to revolutionize the agricultural
    industry,

    but there are several areas that need to be addressed to fully realize its potential.
    These

    include the need for robustness, interpretability, integration of multiple modalities
    of data,

    and few-shot learning. Further research in these areas is crucial to overcoming
    these

    challenges and fully harnessing the power of deep learning in agriculture.

    8. Conclusions and Future Work

    The primary aim of the present study was to provide an overview of the recent
    ad-

    vancements linked to DL in the agricultural sector. This study employed a comprehensive

    review of approaches linked to agricultural DL, including disease detection, yield
    predic-

    tion, and weed prediction, in studies published between 2016 and early 2022. The
    key

    ﬁndings of this paper indicated that a range of DL tools, employed for counting
    fruit,

    managing water, crop management, soil management, weed detection, seed classiﬁcation,

    yield prediction, disease detection, and even harvesting, have been identiﬁed.
    It was also

    revealed that, despite the employment of DL processes in agriculture, there are
    certain

    obstacles that come with the use of this technology. It involves difﬁculties such
    as the

    compilation of datasets, the time necessary for staff training, and the presence
    of DL experts

    to ensure high production. Furthermore, system development and hardware requirements,

    as well as the deployment of large models and software on small devices, such
    as smart-

    phones, may have impacts on system efﬁciency. Thus, it can be concluded that,
    with the

    support of the most recent prediction analyses and tools, the application of DL
    methods

    has assisted the agriculture industry in growing and developing. It can be noted
    that DL

    has great potential in the ﬁeld of agriculture. However, the high cost of hardware
    and

    software makes its application very limited. Therefore, there is a need to work
    on research

    and development around cost-effective DL methods in the future to enhance large-scale

    applications. Furthermore, DL methods are limited in terms of accuracy and effectiveness.

    Thus, more research is needed in this direction to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness
    of

    DL methods.

    The availability of computational capacity is yet another barrier that inhibits
    the

    implementation of DL in agriculture. The training of models necessitates ever-increasing

    amounts of computing resources due to the growing number of datasets, as well
    as the

    increasing complexity of deep-learning neural networks. It is very important that
    the

    performance of graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs)

    continues to improve, as this is a very important accelerator for the widespread
    popularity

    of deep learning. In addition, the development of DL has been sped up by the availability
    of

    cloud computing services, such as the Google Cloud Platform, offered by private
    businesses.

    However, because of stringent requirements regarding computation capacity, current
    uses

    of DL in agriculture are typically ofﬂine. This means that the collection and
    analysis of

    images of farmland is undertaken in an asynchronous manner. Consequently, companies

    have paid some attention to this issue.

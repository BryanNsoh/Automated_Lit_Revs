  explanation: The authors performed a review of the recent advancements in deep learning
    (DL) and its applications in the agricultural sector. They also provided a succinct
    yet detailed explanation of deploying ML models for real-time data processing
    and inference in irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of
    data quality and preprocessing, containerization, and the deployment of machine
    learning (ML) models for real-time data processing and inference. They also highlighted
    the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of
    components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

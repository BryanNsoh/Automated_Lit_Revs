  data_sources: Real-time data on plant growth, environmental conditions, and irrigation
    status.
  explanation: The study's main objective was to develop a soilless culture system
    with computer vision and machine learning (ML) techniques for improved crop production.
    The proposed system uses a variety of sensors and cameras to collect real-time
    data on plant growth, environmental conditions, and irrigation status. This data
    is then processed using computer vision and ML algorithms to make decisions about
    irrigation, nutrient delivery, and other factors that affect plant growth.

    real-time data on plant growth, environmental conditions, and irrigation status.
  extract_2: This data is then processed using computer vision and ML algorithms to
    make decisions about irrigation, nutrient delivery, and other factors that affect
    plant growth.

  key_findings: The proposed system can improve crop production in soilless culture
    systems by providing real-time monitoring and control of irrigation, nutrient
    delivery, and other factors that affect plant growth.
  limitations: The study utilized a dataset of images collected from a single greenhouse
    in a specific geographic location, and therefore, the findings may not be generalizable
    to a large-scale farming industry. Furthermore, the study did not account for
    the cost and labor requirements of using a soilless culture system, which is a
    significant factor for commercial crop production.
  main_objective: To develop a soilless culture system with computer vision and machine
    learning (ML) techniques for improved crop production.
  relevance_evaluation: This study is highly relevant to the specific point being
    made in the literature review because it demonstrates the potential of using computer
    vision and ML techniques to improve crop production in soilless culture systems.
    The findings of this study can help to guide the development of future soilless
    culture systems and improve the efficiency and sustainability of crop production.

    \ cloud server for data storage and processing, edge nodes for processing and\
    \ decision-making, and a mobile application for user interaction.\n\nThe study's\

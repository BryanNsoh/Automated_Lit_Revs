    SECTION I. Introduction Sensor fusion involves combining data from several sensors
    to obtain better information for perception. Humans and animals process multiple
    sensory data to reason and act and the same principle is applied in multi-sensor
    data fusion. Multi-sensor fusion combines data from different sensors into a common
    representation format [1], [2]. In developing robotic systems, multi-sensor fusion
    plays a crucial role since interaction with the environment is instrumental in
    successful execution of the task. Significant applications of multi-sensor fusion
    can be found in applications such as mobile robots [2]–[5], defense systems (such
    as target tracking [2], [6]–[8]), medicine [9], [10], transportation systems [11],
    [12] and industry [13]–[15]. The motivation for sensor fusion is discussed in
    section II. Section III describes the various types of sensor fusion proposed
    in literature. The various topologies and models for sensor fusion is covered
    in sections IV and V. Sections VI, VII provide an overview of signal and decision
    level fusion. SECTION II. Motivation The main goal of multi-sensor fusion is to
    achieve better operation of the system using the collective information from all
    sensors. This is also referred to as the synergistic effect [16]–[18]. Combining
    the data from a single sensor at different time intervals can also produce this
    effect [18]. In order to have better spatial and temporal coverage multiple sensors
    can be used. Also, with multiple sensors there is increased estimation accuracy
    and fault-tolerance [18]. SECTION III. Sensor Fusion Categories Depending upon
    the sensor configuration, there are three main categories of sensor fusion: Complementary,
    Competitive and Co-operative [19]. These are described below as follows: A. Complementary
    In this method, each sensor provides data about different aspects or attributes
    of the environment. By combining the data from each of the sensors we can arrive
    at a more global view of the environment or situation. Since there is no dependency
    between the sensors combining the data is relatively easy [19], [20]. B. Competitive
    In this method, as the name suggests, several sensors measure the same or similar
    attributes. The data from several sensors is used to determine the overall value
    for the attribute under measurement. The measurements are taken independently
    and can also include measurements at different time instants for a single sensor.
    This method is useful in fault tolerant architectures to provide increased reliability
    of the measurement [19], [20]. C. Co-Operative When the data from two or more
    independent sensors in the system is required to derive information, then co-operative
    sensor networks are used since a sensor individually cannot give the required
    information regarding the environment. A common example is stereoscopic vision
    [19], [20]. Several other types of sensor networks exist such as corroborative,
    concordant, redundant etc [18]. Most of them are derived from the above mentioned
    sensor fusion categories. Dasarthy [21], [22] classified sensor fusion types depending
    upon the input/output characteristics. Figure 1 [21], shows the various sensor
    fusion types. Only a few combinations are allowed in Dasarthy''s scheme for the
    inputs and outputs. Fig. 1. Dasarthy''s classification of multi-sensor fusion
    [21]. Show All SECTION IV. Sensor Fusion Topologies There are different topologies
    namely, Centralized, Decentralized and Hybrid [18], [20], [23], [24]. Each of
    these is described as follows: A. Centralized Architecture In this architecture,
    a single node handles the fusion process. The sensors undergo preprocessing before
    they are sent to the central node for the fusion process to take place. Figure
    2 shows a typical centralized architecture [18], [20]. B. Decentralized Architecture
    In this architecture, each of the sensor processes data at its node and there
    is no need for a global or central node. Since the information is processed individually
    at the node, it is used in applications that are large and widespread such as
    huge automated plants, spacecraft health monitoring etc. [20]. Figure 3 shows
    a typical decentralized architecture [18], [20]. C. Hierarchical Architecture
    This architecture is a combination of both centralized and distributed type. When
    there are constraints on the system such as a requirement of less computational
    workload or limitations on the communication bandwidth, distributed scheme can
    be enabled. Centralized fusion can be used when higher accuracy is necessary [20],
    [23]. A simple comparison between the centralized and decentralized topologies
    is shown below in Table I [18], [20]. SECTION V. Multi Sensor Fusion Models The
    application that uses the sensor fusion plays a vital role in determining the
    type of architecture. Hence there is no specific model or architecture that is
    definitive for all applications [25]–[27]. In this section, the two most widely
    used architectures namely, the JDL Fusion architecture and the Waterfall Fusion
    Process Model are discussed. A. Jdl Fusion Architecture JDL stands for the US
    Joint Directors of Laboratories that was established under the guidance of Department
    of Defense and was proposed in 1985. The JDL model is functionality dependent
    and can be customized depending on the application. Varieties of applications
    from sensor networks to human robot interface can be implemented using this model
    [20]. Fig. 2. Centralized topology [23]. Show All Fig. 3. Decentralized topology
    [23]. Show All Table I. Centralized and decentralized topologies [18], [20] The
    model uses five levels for data processing and a database. These components can
    communicate through a bus interface [20], [24], [26]. The JDL model is shown in
    Figure 4 [24], [26]. These levels could be executed sequentially or concurrently
    during the application. Sources, in the JDL model can consist of sensor data or
    data given by the user such as user input, reference data or geographical data.
    The Man-Machine Interaction block, as the name suggests, enables the user to interact
    with the system through user command, reports etc. Furthermore, this block helps
    in providing alert messages and could use multimedia tools such as displays, sounds
    etc. to achieve communication with the user. The Source Pre-Processing also referred
    to as Level 0, performs pre-screening of data and then allocates it to the appropriate
    process [24], [26]. In the Object Refinement or Level 1, the following operations
    are performed namely, alignment of data using frame transformation, data association,
    tracking and estimation of the current and future position of the object. Also,
    Level 1 can be considered to be composed of kinematic and identity fusion [20].
    In kinematic fusion, the velocity, acceleration of the object is determined. In
    identity fusion, the type of the object such as aircraft or missile is determined
    using parametric estimation [20], [24]. After processing the data from Level 1,
    based on the situation the contextual relationship is determined between the event
    and the object under observation. This process of refinement is called as Situation
    Refinement or Level 2. Depending on the a priori data and the future situation
    prediction inferences are drawn in Level 3 or Threat Refinement. The inferences
    are used to identify the vulnerabilities and the opportunities for the operation.
    This level uses game theoretic techniques [24]. Process Refinement or Level 4
    deals with monitoring the system performance (handles real time constraints) and
    sensor allocation to satisfy mission objectives and goals. This level does not
    perform data processing operations and uses sensor management techniques [20],
    [24], [26]. The Database Management System helps monitor, update, add and provide
    information to the fusion process [20], [24], [26]. Although the JDL model helps
    in basic understanding of the sensor fusion process it is data centric and hence
    hard to extend or reuse the applications based on this model. It is abstract and
    interpretation could be difficult [24], [26]. Table II [24] highlights the summary
    of various components used in JDL model. Fig. 4. JDL fusion model [24], [26].
    Show All Table II. Summary of JDL process components [24]. B. Waterfall Fusion
    Process Model The Waterfall fusion process model (WFFM) deals with the low level
    processing of data and is shown in Figure 5 [24], [28]. The Waterfall model has
    a lot of common features as the JDL model. The processing stages of the Waterfall
    models relate to the levels of the JDL model [24], [26], [28] and the comparison
    is shown in Table III. However, similar to the JDL model the Waterfall fusion
    model is abstract and doesn''t have feedback between the stages. It is an acyclic
    model. The modified WFFM is described in [20] that provides for some feedback
    between the stages. This modified model is action oriented and has the provision
    for control loop action or feedback loop as shown in Figure 6 [20]. Several other
    fusion models exist such as the Omnibus model [29], Boyd or OODA model [30], LAAS
    Architecture [31]. Fig. 5. Waterfall fusion process model [28]. Show All Fig.
    6. Modified waterfall fusion model [20]. Show All Table III. JDL and waterfall
    fusion models [24], [26], [28] SECTION VI. Signal Level Fusion In signal level
    fusion, data from multiple sources (sensors) are combined to obtain better quality
    data and higher understanding of the environment being observed. Signal level
    fusion often has either or both of the following goals: Obtain a higher quality
    version of the input signals i.e. higher signal to noise ratio [32]. Sensor measurements
    from several sensors which have same physical properties are combined to determine
    the parameter being measured, more accurately [18]. This minimizes and sometimes
    eliminates any uncertainty or inaccurate predictions caused by measurements from
    faulty sensors, measurement noise and state noise. F or instance, readings from
    multiple temperature sensors in close proximity in a given space can be used for
    this kind of fusion. Obtain a feature or mid-level information about the system
    that a single measuring node cannot reveal. A feature is the first stage in understanding
    the state of the environment that helps the system in formulating a decision.
    Heterogeneous sensors are often employed for this process. For instance, signals
    from radar and images from camera are used in target recognition [24]. For sensor
    data to undergo signal level fusion, it is essential to condition the signals
    in the signal preprocessing phase. The signals have to be in a common representation
    format [18]. The stages involved in this process, as shown in Figure 7, include
    but not limited to: Signal alignment, normalization and scaling [18]. There are
    several methods by which signal level fusion can be achieved. The choice of method
    depends on various factors like the scenario and type of application, type of
    data or signal, relationship between the data or the state representation of the
    system. Fig. 7. Common representation format functions [18]. Show All The following
    are some of the commonly used signal fusion methodologies: A. Weighted Averaging
    Signal fusion can be achieved by taking an average of the various sensor signals
    measuring a particular parameter of the environment. If signals from some sensors
    can be trusted more than the other, a higher weight is assigned to that sensor
    to increase its contribution towards the fused signal. The confidence level is
    a function of variance of the sensor signal. [32] x fused = ∑ i=0 n w i x i (1)
    View Source where, wi = f(variance) B. Kalman Filter The Kalman filter method
    is a common adaptive method of sensor fusion to remove redundancy in the system
    and to predict the state of the system. This is a linear model and the current
    state of the system is dependent on the previous state. The system is represented
    by the following state-space model: x(k)=F x(k−1)+B u+G w z(k)=H x(k)+v View Source
    where, x: state vector, F: state transition matrix, B: Input transition matrix,
    u: Input vector, G: Process noise transition matrix, w: process noise vector,
    H: Measurement matrix, v: measurement noise vector. The covariance matrices of
    wand v are Q(k) and R(k) respectively. There are two phases of state estimation
    with Kalman filter: Predict Phase x ^ k =A  x ^ k−1 +B  u k (2) P k =A  P k−1  A
    T (3) View Source Update Phase K k = P k C T (C P k C T +R ) −1 x ^ k = x ^ k
    + K k ( z k −C x ^ k ) P k =(1− K k C) P k (4) (5) (6) View Source where, P: estimation
    covariance, K: Kalman gain In the update or correction phase, the estimate from
    the predict phase is updated with the observation. If there are two sensors and
    both of them sending data simultaneously, then Z = [z1, z2]. If the sensors are
    sending data one after the other, then the reading from first sensor can be used
    as a priori information before observation from second sensor is used to update
    the prediction. [32] C. Track to Track Fusion Track to track fusion methodology
    has local tracks generated by distinct local sensors. Then at a central node the
    tracks are fused as shown in Figure 8 [33]. The local track can be individual
    Kalman filter nodes that provide state estimation at the local track level. These
    states are then fused into a state vector that has combined information from all
    the local sensor nodes. Sometimes, this new estimate is sent as feedback to the
    local sensor nodes. The new state estimate is obtained by the following formula
    [33]. X ^ k|k = x ^ 1 k|k + [ P 1 k|k − P 12 k|k I P 1 k|k + P 2 k|k + P 12 k|k
    + P 21 k|k ] −1 ( x ^ 2 k|k − x ^ 1 k|k ) (7) View Source where, P m k|k is the
    error covariance matrix of the corresponding state estimation x ∧ m k|k . P 12
    k|k is the cross covariance matrix of the two state vectors where P 12 k|k =(
    P 12 k|k ) T . P 12klk is defined by the following equation: P 12  k|k =(1− K
    1 k H 1 k ) F k−1 P 12 k−1|k−1 F r k−1 (1− K 2 k H 2 k ) +(1− K 1 k H 1 k μ k−1
    Q k−1 G T k−1 (1− K 2 k H 2 k ) T (8) View Source This configuration can be extended
    for multiple sensors. A modified track-to-track fusion and three fusion algorithm
    are explained in detail in [33]. There are other ways to define the track fusion
    algorithm such as taking confidence weighted averaging of the tracks based on
    variance [33]. D. Neural Networks An artificial neural network consists of interconnection
    of processing nodes called neurons. There is a pattern of interconnection between
    the neuronal layers that are weighted and the learning process that updates these
    weights. Data fusion models can be established using neural networks such that
    neurons and interconnecting weights are assigned based on the relationship between
    the multi-sensor data input and the signal output. The neural networks can be
    multilayer feed-forward or recurrent type. [34] Unlike Kalman filters, neural
    networks offer non-linear transfer functions and parallel processing capabilities.
    This can help in performing image fusion. Figure 9 shows a basic structure of
    three layer neural network with nonlinear mapping. Fig. 8. Track to track fusion
    architecture [33]. Show All Fig. 9. Neural network structure for sensor fusion
    [34]. Show All The fused output is a combination of input signal and corresponding
    weights calculated by the equation [34]: y= ∑ i=0 n w i x i (9) View Source where,
    wi is the weight; Xi is the sensor data. Several fusion methodologies are used
    and depending on the input and outputs required the stages in the model can perform
    either signal, feature or decision level fusion. These methods are either used
    as standalone or can be combined with aforementioned signal fusion methods. The
    probabilistic approach for sensor fusion includes the use of joint probability
    distributions and Gaussian distributions [38]. Other fusion methods include Bayesian,
    least-squares for feature extraction [39] and some statistical approaches. [18],
    [32], [40]. In [35]–[37] the authors explain various approaches for modeling sensor
    fusion architecture using neural networks. SECTION VII. Decision Level Fusion
    Also known as Symbol level fusion, the decision level fusion combines several
    sub-decisions or features to yield a final or higher decision that can be used
    to take an action. Symbol could be an input decision. In this case, fusion of
    symbolic information insists the use of reasoning and inference while handling
    uncertainty. Symbol level fusion increases the confidence or truth value and is
    considered as decision fusion [41], [42]. Identity and Knowledge based methods
    form the two categories of decision fusion [20], [42]. Table IV [20], [42] lists
    few of the decision fusion methods or Al techniques for each category. One of
    the most widely used decision or inference method is Dempster-Shafer theory (D-S
    theory). This method is very useful for human-robot interaction based applications
    [41], [42], [45], [46]. We describe in detail the D-S theory in the following
    sub-section followed by a comparison with Bayesian inference which is another
    widely used decision fusion technique. A. Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence D-S
    theory is a generalization of the probability theory [41], [43]–[45]. In this
    method, a frame of discernment Ω is defined which is set of elementary hypotheses:
    Ω={ a i },i=1,…,n (10) View Source Table IV. Decision fusion models [20], [42]
    The sum of the mass function of all hypotheses is one. Belief function is used
    to express inaccurate beliefs. Mass values are assigned to the elements of the
    power set 2 Ω of the frame of discernment which hold the following properties:
    belief(null)=0 View Source belief (hypothesis) = Sum of all mass functions for
    all evidence to support the proposition. The confidence interval is upper-bounded
    by the plausibility value to include all observations that don''t rule out the
    proposition supported by the corresponding belief function. In order to combine
    two mass functions m1 and m2 the Dempster-Shafer theory defines the following
    rule [43], [44]: m 1 ⊕ m 2 (∅)=0 m 1 ⊕ m 2 (H)= ∑ X∩Y=H m 1 (X) m 2 (Y) 1− ∑ X∩Y=∅
    m 1 (X) m 2 (Y) (11) (12) View Source B. Dempster-Shafer and Bayesian Fusion Comparison
    Although both these methods are widely used in inference engines there are few
    differences between them [42], [46]. The main difference being the concept of
    support and plausibility to define uncertainty limits in Dempster-Shafer [42]–[44]
    which is not found in Bayesian inference. D-S theory is an evidential reasoning
    method where belief masses can be assigned to elements and sets, and on sets of
    sets [42]. Capturing ignorance or uncertainty is another strong feature of evidential
    reasoning methods which is not achievable in probabilistic methods. It is not
    necessary to have a prori probabilities and data is provided only at the time
    when sensor reads them [42], [46] during observation. Dempster-Shafer theory of
    evidence finds widespread use in human-robot interactive (HRI) applications. A
    review of a few applications of HRI can be found in [47]. By using the power set
    as the frame of discernment beliefs can well represented. However, when the set
    is continuous the number of subsets cannot be measured and hence this is a significant
    limitation that is found in evidential reasoning methods [41], [42] that work
    well with discrete sets. In our current research, we are working on a sensor fusion
    framework for robotic vehicle navigation in an unknown terrain. The framework
    is similar to waterfall fusion model and uses track to track fusion and Dempster-Shafer
    theory of evidence for signal and decision level fusions. SECTION VIII. Conclusion
    In this paper a brief overview of the various concepts of multi-sensor fusion

    the methods used to achieve each of them. Authors Figures References Citations

    the problem of discovering anomalies in a large-scale network based on the data
    fusion of heterogeneous monitors is considered. We present a classification of
    anomaly detection algorithms based on data fusion, and motivated by this classification,
    the operational principles and characteristics of two different representative
    approaches, one based on the Demster-Shafer theory of evidence and one based on
    principal component analysis, are described. The detection effectiveness of these
    strategies are evaluated and compared under different attack scenarios, based
    on both real data and simulations. Our study and corresponding numerical results
    revealed that in principle the conditions under which they operate efficiently
    are complementary, and therefore could be used effectively in an integrated way

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Athens, Greece SECTION 1. Introduction One
    of the main challenges in security management of large scale high speed networks
    is the detection of suspicious anomalies in network traffic patterns due to Distributed
    Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks or worm propagation [1] [2]. Network anomaly
    detection is one of the most frequently suggested methods for detecting network
    abuse. Anomaly detection can be uniformly applied in order to detect network attacks,
    even in cases where novel attacks are present and the nature of the intrusion
    is unknown [3]. Usually network anomaly detection methodologies rely on the analysis
    of network traffic and the characterization of the dynamic statistical properties
    of traffic normality, in order to accurately and timely detect network anomalies.
    Anomaly detection is based on the concept that perturbations of normal behavior
    suggest the presence of anomalies, faults, attacks, etc. The goal of this paper
    is twofold: firstly, it provides a review and classification of data fusion algorithms
    inspired from the taxonomy presented in [4] but addressing specifically the problem
    of anomaly detection; and secondly, it focuses on the study and evaluation of
    two representative anomaly detection techniques, one based on the Dempster-Shafer
    theory of evidence and one based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Among
    the main objectives of this work is not only to evaluate the detection effectiveness
    of each one of these methodologies, but also to identify and study the conditions
    under which they operate efficiently. The remaining of this paper is organized
    as follows. In section 2 we present a classification of some widely used anomaly
    detection approaches. Then, in section 3 we present the operational principles
    of two different representative data fusion algorithms, while in section 4 their
    performances under different attack scenarios are evaluated and compared based
    on real experiments and simulations. Finally section 5 concludes the paper. SECTION
    2. Data Fusion Algorithm Classification Multisensor data fusion, or distributed
    sensing, is a relatively new engineering discipline used to combine data from
    multiple and diverse sensors and sources in order to make inferences about events,
    activities, and situations [5]. These systems are often compared to the human
    cognitive process where the brain fuses sensory information from the various sensory
    organs, evaluates situations, makes decisions, and directs action. Among the most
    common examples where such systems have been developed and widely used, are military
    systems for threat assessment and weather forecast systems. Generally, data fusion
    is a process performed on multi-source data towards detection, association, correlation,
    estimation and combination of several data streams into one with a higher level
    of abstraction and greater meaningfulness. In the following we present a classification
    and brief description of some widely used methods, motivated by the taxonomy that
    was originally proposed by Hall [4]. However our presentation and arguments are
    specifically targeted towards anomaly detection. 2.1. Physical Models Physical
    models attempt to create an accurate model of the observed environment and make
    appropriate estimations, by matching predicted (modeled) data to actual observations.
    Included in this category are also methods that try to decompose the observed
    object (the network or a network element, such as a link) in descriptive components
    (or “primitives”). Such a method is M3L [6] (described in more detail in section
    3.1) that relies on PCA approach to decompose the network state in primitives
    (i.e. Principal Components) that capture the important interrelations and traffic
    patterns among network elements and therefore create a model of the monitored
    network 2.2. Parametric Classification The algorithms that belong to this category
    make a direct mapping of parametric data to the classification space (e.g. the
    state of the system). These may be further divided into statistically based algorithms,
    such as Bayesian Inference and/or the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) methodologies, and
    information theoretic techniques such as neural networks and entropy based methods.
    Bayesian Inference computes the probability of an observation given the assumption
    of an a priori hypothesis. Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence is a mathematical
    theory of evidence [7] based on belief functions and plausible reasoning, which
    is used to combine separate pieces of information (evidence) to calculate the
    probability of an event. In [8], D-S has been thoroughly tested for anomaly detection
    in an operational university campus network. Adaptive Neural Networks provide
    an interesting and generic method that does not assume a model for the observed
    system, but bases its output on the successful training of its nodes (neurons)
    using training data. The different kinds of neural networks differ in the number
    of nodes and layers used, as well as the processing function that is performed
    in each node. These methods have been used in the context of Intrusion Detection
    Systems but require training data that are representative of the normal traffic
    data, which in general are quite hard to gather or generate [9]. Finally, entropy
    based methods use the concept of information entropy to describe the inherent
    randomness of a communication system. The entropy measure reflects and quantifies
    the information in a generalized “message” on the basis of its probability of
    occurrence. The basic idea is that frequent “messages” are of low entropy value
    and rare messages have greater value. In [10] the authors have developed an entropy-based
    approach that determines and reports entropy contents of traffic parameters such
    as IP addresses. Changes in the entropy content indicate a massive network event.
    2.3. Cognitive Algorithms Members of the third category, namely the cognitive
    based algorithms, try to mimic the human brain cognitive process for object identification.
    Two representative approaches that belong to this class are: expert systems and
    techniques based on fuzzy set theory. Expert systems consist of a knowledge base
    that represents the knowledge of some “field expert” usually in a production rule
    form. This knowledge can be facts, algorithms, heuristics etc. Expert systems
    have been widely used for Intrusion Detection purposes. For example, NIDES [11]
    has a rule database that employs expert rules to characterize known intrusive
    activity represented in activity logs, and raises alarms as matches are identified
    between the observed activity logs and the rule encodings. Fuzzy set theory is
    the fundamental theory that supports fuzzy logic, which is in turn used as an
    alternative to logical reasoning. In fuzzy logic, a statement is not just true
    or false but is rather a proposition with an associated value between 0, that
    represents a completely false proposition, and 1 - completely true (this is the
    membership value to the truthfulness set) [12]. SECTION 3. Representative algorithms
    description 3.1. M3L: a network-wide anomaly detection PCA-based approach The
    objective of Multi-Metric-Multi-Link PCA-based method [6] is to provide a methodology
    of fusing and combining data of heterogeneous monitors spread throughout the network.
    This is achieved by applying a PCA-based approach simultaneously on several metrics
    of one or more links. Principal Component Analysis aims at the reduction of the
    dimensionality of a data set in which there are a large number of interrelated
    variables, while retaining as much as possible of the variation present in the
    data set [13]. The extracted non-correlated components are called Principal Components
    (PCs) and are estimated from the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix or the
    correlation matrix of the original variables. The overall procedure of this method
    may be divided into two different parts: the offline analysis, that creates a
    model of the normal traffic, and the real time analysis that detects anomalies
    by comparing the current (actual) with the modeled traffic patterns. The input
    of the offline analysis is a data set that contains only normal traffic. During
    the offline analysis, PCA is applied on this data set and then the first few most
    important derived Principal Components (PCs) are selected. Their number depends
    on the network and the number of metrics per link, and it represents the number
    of PCs required for capturing the percentage of variance that the system needs
    to model normal traffic. The output of the offline analysis is the PCs to be used
    in the Subspace Method. The goal of the Subspace Method is to divide current traffic
    data in two different spaces: one containing traffic considered normal ( y norm
    ) and resembles to the modeled traffic patterns and one containing the residual
    ( y res ) . In general, anomalies tend to result in great variations in the residual,
    since they present different characteristics from the modeled traffic. When an
    anomaly occurs, the residual vector presents great variation in some of its variables
    and the system detects the network path containing the anomaly by selecting these
    variables. The interested reader may refer to [6] for a more detailed description
    of PCA-based anomaly detection strategies. 3.2. D-S based anomaly detection Dempster-Shafer''s
    Theory of Evidence can be considered an extension of Bayesian inference. The goal
    of D-S is to infer the true system state without having an explicit model of the
    system, based only on some observations that can be considered as hints (with
    some uncertainty) towards some system states. Based on these observations D-S
    calculates two functions: Belief Bel(H) and Plausibility Pl(H) , where H is the
    hypothesis for the current state. Generally we can characterize Bel(H) as a quantitative
    measure of all our supportive evidence and Pl(H) as a measure of how compatible
    our evidence is with H in terms of doubt. The true belief in the hypothesis for
    the current system state lies in the interval between. Our degree of ignorance
    is represented by the difference Bel(H)−Pl(H) . Theory of Evidence makes the distinction
    between uncertainty and ignorance, so it is a very useful way to reason with uncertainty
    based on incomplete and possibly contradictory information extracted from a stochastic
    environment. It does not need “a priori” knowledge or probability distributions
    on the possible system states like the Bayesian approach and as such it is mostly
    useful when we do not have a model of our system. Theory of Evidence has a definite
    advantage in a vague and unknown environment especially when compared to other
    inference processes like first order logic that assumes complete and consistent
    knowledge exhibits monotonicity, or probability theory that requires knowledge
    in terms of probability distributions and exhibits non-monotonicity. The main
    disadvantage of Dempster-Shafer''s theory is the assumption that the evidence
    is statistically independent from each other, since sources of information are
    often linked with some sort of dependence. The interested reader may refer to
    [8] for a detailed discussion about the application of D-S theory in network anomaly
    detection. SECTION 4. Performance Evaluation 4.1. Network Topology and experiments
    In this section the performances of the two representative anomaly detection techniques
    - D-S and M3L techniques - described in section 3, are evaluated and compared
    under various attack scenarios. The results and corresponding observations presented
    in this section are based on real data collected from an operational campus network.
    Specifically, we monitored the link between the National Technical University
    of Athens (NTUA) and the Greek Research and Technology Network (GRNET), which
    connects the university campus with the Internet. This link has an average traffic
    of 700–800Mbit/sec. It contains a rich network traffic mix, that carries standard
    network services like web, mail, ftp and p2p application traffic. In our study,
    in order to evaluate the D-S algorithm we defined four possible states for the
    network: NORMAL, SYN-attack, ICMP-flood and UDP-flood. For the application of
    the D-S algorithm we used the following metrics: UDP packets in/out ratio, ICMP
    packets out/in ratio, TCP-SYN in/TCP-FIN out ratio. In order to transform the
    sensor measurements (metrics) to basic probability assignments (bpa) we used multiple
    thresholds per sensor measurement that were set manually after studying the “normal”
    data set. In order to evaluate the PCA-based approach we implemented a single-link-multi-metric
    algorithm based on M3L and used the following metrics: number of UDP packets in,
    UDP packets out, ICMP packets out, ICMP packets in, TCP-SYN packets, TCP-FIN packets,
    TCP packets out, TCP packets in, TCP flows out, TCP flows in. The sample dataset
    required to train the system and create the network model was a part of the recorded
    traffic that was relatively flat and considered to be normal. SYN-attack was performed
    using a real DoS attack tool. The target of the attack was a host situated in
    the NTUA network at a 10 Mbps link and there were 3 attackers distributed at GRNET.
    Every one of the attackers was connected at a 100Mbps interface and was running
    the TFN2K tool that is used for DoS attacks. These attackers were sending TCP
    SYN packets towards the victim, using spoofed IP addresses from the C class network
    that they were part of. In that manner the three attackers managed an attack from
    256 sources. The trace file of the attack lasts 8 minutes with the attack lasting
    for 60 seconds. In the next section we provide some representative numerical results
    of our experiments, starting with the performance of each algorithm under various
    scenarios, and then conclude our experimental results by comparing their performance
    under common experiments. In the following experiments, ICMP-flood and UDP-flood
    attacks were injected manually in the network traces of the collected data 4.2.
    Performance Evaluation 4.2.1. D-S algorithm Detection Effectiveness In Figure
    1, an ICMP-flood attack, as detected by the D-S algorithm, is presented. In this
    scenario, the attack packets correspond to 5% of the background traffic. The four
    different diagrams correspond to each one of the four defined states (NORMAL,
    UDP-flood, ICMP-flood and SYN-ATTACK). As observed by this figure, during the
    attack, the belief and plausibility functions of ICMP-flood state have increased
    - together with the decrease of the respective functions for the NORMAL state
    - in a way that implies that the most likely state of our network is ICMP-flood.
    In Figure 2 we present the corresponding results of a real SYN-attack scenario.
    In this case, the attack packets represent only 2% of the background traffic.
    As we can observe from the four diagrams given for the four possible states of
    the network, the belief and plausibility functions of SYN-attack state have not
    increased during this attack. Therefore based on the D-S algorithm we erroneously
    conclude that the network was always in NORMAL state. Figure 1. ICMP-flood of
    5% rate detected by D-S algorithm Show All Figure 2. SYN-attack of 2% rate not-detected
    by D-S algorithm Show All In Figure 3 we depict the corresponding results for
    the D-S algorithm using a 20% SYN-attack rate. As we can observe there is a noticeable
    alteration of the belief and plausibility functions of the NORMAL and SYN-attack
    state, which increases our belief that the network is in SYN-attack state. Figure
    3. SYN-attack of 20% rate detected by D-S algorithm (real attack) Show All 4.2.2.
    M3L algorithm Detection Effectiveness In the following, the detection effectiveness
    of the M3L algorithm is evaluated. As observed by the results presented in the
    following figures, the behavior of the PCA algorithm differs significantly from
    the one of the D-S algorithm. In Figure 4 we present the corresponding Squared
    Prediction Error (SPE) for a simulated ICMP - flood attack. The attack packets
    correspond to 20% of the total background traffic. Figure 4. ICMP-flood attack
    of rate 20% not detected by PCA algorithm Show All As we can observe from figure
    4, there is not any significant change at the SPE, and as a result one can imply
    that the network was always at the NORMAL state. In this case M3L fails to detect
    the attack because the selection of metrics is inappropriate, namely the metrics
    utilized are uncorrelated and thus the algorithm cannot create a precise model
    of the network. On the other hand, figure 5 presents the SPE for a number of different
    rates of SYN attack. In this figure we present various volumes of the attack,
    ranging from 1% attack rate up to 20%. We observe that even for a 2% attack rate
    the SPE changes significantly compared to the SPE for the NORMAL state of the
    network. Figure 5. The SPE of the PCA algorithm for various rates of the SYN-attack
    Show All 4.2.3. Comparative Results In the following figures we present in common
    axes the discrete differential of the “alarm” function of each algorithm for the
    same attack. Along with D-S and M3L we study the performance of another parametric
    classification algorithm: the Bayesian inference. The Bayesian inference simply
    utilizes a function for each one of the four possible states of the network that
    estimates the probability of the system being in each state. Referring to Figures
    6 & 7 for the Bayesian Inference the “alarm” function is the probability function
    of the corresponding state, while for the D-S algorithm is either the belief function
    or the plausibility function, and for the PCA based algorithm (M3L) is the SPE
    function. More specifically, in Figure 6 we present the corresponding results
    for a simulated ICMP-flood, where the attack packets correspond to 10% of the
    background traffic. The attack was manually inserted in the corresponding traffic
    dump, starting at time bin 75 and ending at time bin 90 sec. In the differential
    diagram the large positive values indicate a large increase whereas the negative
    values indicate respective decrease. The change rate is significantly large for
    the parametric classification algorithms - Bayesian inference and DS theory of
    evidence. On the other hand M3L fails to detect the attack and presents false
    positives between time bins 120 and 140. Figure 6. The deferential of the alarm
    metric of every algorithm for the same simulated ICMP-flood of 10% attack rate
    Show All Figure 7. The deferential of the alarm metric of every algorithm for
    the real SYN-attack of 10% rate Show All The situation however is different in
    Figure 7, where we present the corresponding analysis for a 10% rate SYN-attack.
    The corresponding results verify that the PCA based algorithm is much more sensitive
    at the detection of such attacks. The attack was emulated according to the scenario
    described in section 4, starting at time bin 12 and ending at time bin 18 sec.
    Also in this differential diagram the large positive values indicate a large increase
    and the peaks at time bin 12 reveal the beginning of the attack whereas the negative
    peaks in time bin 18 denote its end. 4.2.4. Metric Correlation and Discussion
    The explanation of the difference in the performance of the algorithms lies in
    the correlation of the metrics used. The D-S Theory of Evidence performs well
    on the detection of attacks that can be sensed by uncorrelated metrics because
    it requires that evidence originating from different sensors is indenendent. On
    the other hand, M3L requires that the metrics fed into the fusion algorithm present
    some degree of correlation. The method models traffic patterns and interrelations
    by extracting the eigenvectors from the correlation matrix of a sample data set.
    If there is no correlation among the utilized metrics then the model is not efficient.
    The test for determining whether or not two sets of series are correlated is to
    calculate their correlation coefficient Rx, Y. Variables with correlation coefficient
    close to 1 vary together in the same direction; whereas variables with correlation
    close to −1 vary together in opposite directions. R X,Y = Cov(X,Y) S X ⋅ S Y View
    Source In our experiments, based on data gathered by GRNET, we have confirmed
    that neighboring virtual links are highly correlated, as their correlation matrix
    comprises of elements that have value close to 1. Metrics such as TCP SYN packets,
    TCP FIN packets, TCP in flows and TCP out flows are highly correlated and should
    be utilized in M3L, whereas the combination of UDP in/out packets, ICMP in/out
    packets, TCP in/out packets are uncorrelated and should be used in D-S. This can
    be further analyzed and mapped to the detection capabilities of these methodologies
    with respect to different attack types. For instance, attacks that involve alteration
    in the percentage of UDP packets in traffic composition such as UDP flooding are
    better detected by D-S method. On the other hand, attacks such as SYN attacks,
    worms spreading, port scanning which affect the proportion of correlated metrics
    such as TCP in/out, SYN/FIN packets and TCP in/out flows are better detected with
    M3L. SECTION 5. Conclusions With the advent and explosive growth of the global
    Internet and the electronic commerce infrastructures, timely and proactive detection
    of network anomalies is a prerequisite for the operational and functional effectiveness
    of secure wide area networks. If the next generation of network technology is
    to operate beyond the levels of current networks, it will require a set of well-designed
    tools for its management that will provide the capability of dynamically and reliably
    identifying network anomalies. In this paper, we studied the problem of discovering
    anomalies in a large-scale network based on the data fusion of heterogeneous monitors.
    We first presented and discussed taxonomy of anomaly detection algorithms based
    on the data fusion aspect. Moreover, we focused on the study of two different
    representative anomaly detection techniques, one based on the Demster-Shafer Theory
    of Evidence and one based on Principal Component Analysis. The two techniques
    that belong to different categories of data fusion algorithms were evaluated via
    emulation and simulation. Our study and corresponding numerical results revealed
    that in principle the conditions under which they operate efficiently are complementary,
    and therefore could be used effectively in an integrated way to detect a wide
    range of possible attacks. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was partially supported

    Get rights and content Abstract Two ways of introducing spatial information in
    Dempster–Shafer evidence theory are examined: in the definition of the monosource
    mass functions, and, during data fusion. In the latter case, a “neighborhood”
    mass function is derived from the label image and combined with the “radiometric”
    masses, according to the Dempster orthogonal sum. The main advantage of such a
    combination law is to adapt the importance of neighborhood information to the
    level of radiometric missing information. The importance of introducing neighborhood
    information has been illustrated through the following application: forest area

  explanation: The paper proposes a modified Bayesian approach to sensor fusion that
    considers measurement inconsistency and entropy to detect spurious data. The approach
    involves adding a term to the Bayesian formulation that estimates the probability
    of the data not being spurious based on measured data and the unknown true state.
    This term increases the variance of the posterior distribution when a measurement
    is inconsistent with others. The entropy of the posterior distribution is used
    to determine if the fusion of data improves the information content. The paper
    presents the approach using both centralized and decentralized Bayesian fusion
    schemes.

    of the major problems in sensor fusion is that sensors frequently provide spurious
    observations which are difficult to predict and model. The spurious measurements
    from sensors must be identified and eliminated since their incorporation in the
    fusion pool might lead to inaccurate estimation. This paper presents a unified
    sensor fusion strategy based on a modified Bayesian approach that can automatically
    identify the inconsistency in sensor measurements so that the spurious measurements
    can be eliminated from the data fusion process. The proposed method adds a term
    to the commonly used Bayesian formulation. This term is an estimate of the probability
    that the data is not spurious, based upon the measured data and the unknown value
    of the true state. In fusing two measurements, it has the effect of increasing
    the variance of the posterior distribution when measurement from one of the sensors
    is inconsistent with respect to the other. The increase or decrease in variance
    can be estimated using the information theoretic measure "entropy." The proposed
    strategy was verified with the help of extensive computations performed on simulated
    data from three sensors. A comparison was made between two different fusion schemes:
    centralized fusion in which data obtained from all sensors were fused simultaneously,
    and a decentralized or sequential Bayesian scheme that proved useful for identifying
    and eliminating spurious data from the fusion process. The simulations verified
    that the proposed strategy was able to identify spurious sensor measurements and
    eliminate them from the fusion process, thus leading to a better overall estimate
    of the true state. The proposed strategy was also validated with the help of experiments
    performed using stereo vision cameras, one infrared proximity sensor, and one
    laser proximity sensor. The information from these three sensing sources was fused
    to obtain an occupancy profile of the robotic workspace Published in: IEEE Sensors

    SECTION I. Introduction The principal objective of a multisensor system [1]–[3]
    is to combine information from a variety of sources in a coherent and synergistic
    manner to yield a robust, accurate, and consistent description of quantities of
    interest in the environment. There are several issues that arise when fusing information
    from multiple sources, some of which include data association, sensor uncertainty,
    and data management. The most fundamental of these issues arise from the inherent
    uncertainty in sensor measurement. The uncertainties in sensor measurement are
    not only caused by device impreciseness and noise, but also manifest themselves
    from the ambiguities and inconsistencies present within the environment, and from
    an inability to distinguish between them. The strategies used to fuse data from
    multiple sensors should be capable of handling these uncertainties, and combining
    different types of information to obtain a consistent description of the environment.
    Some of the more popular techniques for sensor fusion that are explored extensively
    in literature include Dempster–Shafer theory for evidential reasoning [4], [5],
    fuzzy logic [6], [7], neural network [8], [9], genetic algorithm [10], [11], Bayesian
    approach [12], and statistical techniques [13] such as Kalman filter [14]–[16].
    Another possible uncertainty that arises in the sensor measurement process occurs
    when the measurements become corrupted and appear spurious in nature. Such corrupted
    measurements are difficult to model because they are not directly attributable
    to the inherent noise or other sources of uncertainty mentioned above. The cause
    of the corruption may be due to events such as permanent sensor failures, short
    duration spike faults, or nascent (slowly developing) failures. Previous attempts
    at developing experimental models usually preclude the use of spurious measurements,
    and represent uncertainties attributable only to sensor noise and inherent limitations.
    Fusion techniques based on these incomplete models provide inaccurate estimation
    that can eventually result in potentially damaging action by the control system.
    Hence, a sensor validation scheme is necessary to identify spurious measurements
    so they can be eliminated before the fusion process. There are several techniques
    reported in the literature for sensor validation and identification of inconsistent
    data. Many of them are limiting because they are based on specific failure models;
    these techniques can work well for events that occur due to known failure modes,
    however, they do not capture all possible failure events and often perform poorly
    when unmodeled failures occur. As a means to detect inconsistency, there should
    be either redundancy in the data, or some availability of a priori information.
    For example, in the case where a priori information is available, researchers
    have used the Nadaraya–Watson Estimator [17] and a priori observations to validate
    sensor measurements. Other researchers have used a model based Kalman filter approach
    [18], while others have used covariance [19], [20], probability [21], [22], fuzzy
    logic [23], and neural network [24] based approaches. Some of these methods are
    explicit model-based, whereas others require tuning and training. In the general
    case where a priori information is often not available, these approaches are typically
    deficient and can often lead to undesirable results. Most of the fusion strategies
    based on Bayesian approaches reported in the literature handle inconsistency in
    data rather poorly. In practical real-world scenarios, where data generated by
    sensors might be incomplete, incoherent or inconsistent, this approach might lead
    to erroneous results. Consequently, the inconsistency in data needs to be dealt
    with accordingly when Bayesian approaches are used. This paper makes use of a
    modified Bayesian approach for fusion that takes into account measurement inconsistency
    and entropy to identify spurious data. Based on the entropy of the posterior distribution
    of a desired quantity, the approach presented in this paper detects whether the
    data from the sensors are spurious or inconsistent. Entropy-based analysis aids
    in determining if the fusion of data from a particular sensor actually improves
    the information content of the fusion. This paper is organized as follows: First,
    it describes a simplified version of the Bayesian approach. Next, it presents
    the analytical formulation of the proposed approach. Finally, the proposed approach
    is applied using two different fusion schemes: 1) centralized Bayesian fusion
    where data from all sensors are fused simultaneously and 2) decentralized Bayesian
    fusion in which data from sensors are fused sequentially so as to provide an opportunity
    to identify and eliminate spurious data. A simulated application is presented
    that makes use of data from three sensors, all with varying probability of providing
    spurious measurements. Finally, the paper demonstrates the proposed technique
    with a real-world application; obtaining the occupancy profile of a robotic workspace
    using three sensory sources: stereo vision, an infrared proximity sensor, and
    a laser proximity sensor. SECTION II. Bayesian Approach for Sensor Fusion Bayesian
    inference [12], [25], [26] is a statistical data fusion algorithm based on Bayes''
    theorem [27] of conditional or a posteriori probability to estimate an n -dimensional
    state vector X , after the observation or measurement denoted by Z has been made.
    The probabilistic information contained in Z about X is described by a probability
    density function (pdf) p(Z|X) , known as likelihood function, or the sensor model,
    which is a sensor dependent objective function based on observation. The likelihood
    function relates the extent to which the a posteriori probability is subject to
    change, and is evaluated either via offline experiments or by utilizing the available
    information about the system. If the information about the state X is made available
    independently before any observation is made, then the likelihood function can
    be improved to provide more accurate results. Such a priori information about
    X can be encapsulated as the prior probability P(X=x) and is regarded as subjective
    because it is not based on observed data. Bayes'' theorem provides the posterior
    conditional distribution of X=x , given Z=z , as p(X=x|Z=z) = p(Z=z|X=x)P(X=x)
    ∫p(Z=z|X=x)P(X=x)dx = p(Z=z|X=x)P(X=x) P(Z=z) . (1) View Source Since the denominator
    depends only on the measurement (the summation is carried out over all possible
    values of state), an intuitive estimation can be made by maximizing this posterior
    distribution, i.e., by maximizing the numerator of (1). This is called maximum
    a posteriori (or MAP) estimate, and is given by x ^ MAP =argmaxp(X=x|Z=z) ∝argmaxp(Z=z|X=x)P(X=x).
    (2) View Source Another popular estimation scheme minimizes the sum of squared
    errors, i.e., it minimizes the Euclidean distance between the true state x and
    the estimate x ^ after the observation z has been made. This estimator, called
    the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator, is given by x ^ MMSE =arg min
    x ^ E p(x|z) {( x ^ −x)( x ^ −x ) T } (3) View Source p(X=x| Z ¯ 1…n = z 1 , z
    2 ,… z n )= p(Z= z 1 |X=x)p(Z= z 2 |X=x)…p(Z= z n |X=x)P(X=x) P( Z ¯ 1…n = z 1
    , z 2 ,… z n ) (4) View Source where E p(x|z) is the expected value of a function
    with respect to distribution p(x|z) . Sensor modeling [28]–[31] forms an important
    part of sensor fusion and it deals with developing an understanding of the nature
    of measurements provided by the sensor, the limitations of the sensor, and probabilistic
    understanding of the sensor performance in terms of the uncertainties. The information
    supplied by a sensor is usually modeled as a mean about a true value, with uncertainty
    due to noise represented by a variance that depends on both the measured quantities
    themselves and the operational parameters of the sensor. A probabilistic sensor
    model is particularly useful because it facilitates a determination of the statistical
    characteristics of the data obtained. This probabilistic model is usually expressed
    in the form of pdf p(Z=z|X=x) that captures the probability distribution of measurement
    by the sensor ( z ) when the state of the measured quantity ( x ) is known. This
    distribution is extremely sensor specific and can be experimentally determined.
    The likelihood function relates the extent to which the a posteriori probability
    is subject to change, and is evaluated either via offline experiments or by utilizing
    the information available about the problem. Since the likelihood function is
    obtained from the experimental observations, it is said to be objective. Bayesian
    approaches make use of a priori information about X and fuse that information
    with measurement information from sensors to provide an improved estimate of the
    state. The data from multiple sensors can be fused simultaneously (centralized
    fusion scheme) as shown in Fig. 1, or sequentially (decentralized fusion) as shown
    in Fig. 2. Fusing data from n independent sensors in the centralized scheme using
    the Bayesian approach can be achieved via equation (4) shown at the bottom of
    the page, where z i represents the measurement obtained from sensor i . Similarly,
    the sequential Bayesian approach can be easily implemented in a distributed sensing
    environment and in an online manner where the posterior distribution obtained
    from old measurements becomes the prior distribution. Hence, the addition of new
    sensor measurement z n to the belief obtained from n−1 sensors ( Z ¯ 1…n−1 = z
    1 , z 2 ,… z n−1 ) can be achieved in an incremental manner via (5) shown at the
    bottom of the page. p(X=x| Z ¯ 1…n = z 1 , z 2 ,… z n )= p(Z= z n |X=x)p(X=x|
    Z ¯ 1…n−1 = z 1 , z 2 ,… z n−1 ) P( Z ¯ 1…n = z 1 , z 2 ,… z n ) (5) View Source
    It may be noted that (4) and (5) are valid only when measurements from different
    sensors are independent. This paper assumes the independence of sensors in its
    analysis. However, the analytical approach used in this paper is equally applicable
    when the sensors are not independent with some modifications in its formulation
    that can account for the interdependence of the measurements from different sensors.
    Fig. 1. Centralized sensor fusion scheme using Bayesian approach. Show All Fig.
    2. Decentralized sensor fusion scheme using Bayesian approach. Show All This type
    of decentralized fusion scheme is more robust in terms of individual component
    failure, is more efficient in using communication resources as compared with the
    conventional schemes, and is also scalable. This fusion scheme, based on sequential
    Bayesian estimation, provides a mechanism to identify sensor failure or the presence
    of spurious sensor data, and provides a means to eliminate those measurements.
    One of the major advantages of the Bayesian approach is that it provides an excellent
    mechanism to combine prior information with information obtained from current
    experiments. Since the estimation takes into account available data from all previous
    as well as current experiments, the approach leads to a theoretically optimal
    solution. However, for most practical applications, a lack of priors or use of
    noninformative priors presents difficulties for Bayesian-based sensor fusion approaches.
    Assumptions regarding informative priors creates the possibility of unreasonable
    fusion between priors and likelihood functions. Another major drawback of the
    Bayesian approach is its inability to fuse estimates from various sources that
    are either noncoherent or inconsistent. Thus, inconsistencies in data need to
    be dealt with separately when Bayesian approaches are used. SECTION III. Multisensor
    Fusion with Spurious Data Sensors often provide spurious data due to sensor failure;
    this can be due to some inherent limitation of the sensor and/or some ambiguity
    in the environment. The Bayesian approach described in the previous section is
    inadequate in handling this type of spurious data. The approach does not have
    a mechanism to identify when data from sensors is incorrect. The following paragraphs
    describe the use of a Bayesian-based approach for fusion of data from multiple
    sensors that takes into account measurement inconsistency. While building a stochastic
    sensor model, generally spurious data are identified and eliminated. Hence, these
    experimentally developed sensor models represent uncertainties arising only from
    sensor noise. If the event s=0 represents that the data obtained from a sensor
    is not spurious, then the sensor model developed in this manner actually represents
    the distribution p(Z=z|X=x,s=0) . From Bayes'' theorem, the probability that the
    data z i measured by sensor i is not spurious conditioned upon the actual state
    x , is given by [p(s=0|X=x,Z= z i ) ] i = [P(s=0) ] i [p(Z= z i |X=x,s=0)] ∑ s
    [P(s) ] i [p(Z= z i |X=x,s) ] i (6) View Source [P(s=0) ] i is the sensor specific
    prior probability that the data provided by sensor i is not spurious. The denominator
    of the right-hand side of the above equation is a summation carried over all possible
    values of s which are 0 and 1. The above equation can be rewritten as or [p(s=0|X=x,Z=
    z i ) ] i = [P(s=0) ] i [p(Z= z i |X=x,s=0)] [p(Z= z i |X=x) ] i [p(Z= z i |X=x)
    ] i = [P(s=0) ] i [p(Z= z i |X=x,s=0) ] i [p(s=0|X=x,Z= z i ) ] i . (7) (8) View
    Source Then, from (4), in a centralized fusion scheme, data from n sensors can
    be fused via the following equation: p(X=x|Z= z 1 , z 2 ,… z n ) = [P(s=0) ] 1
    [p(Z= z 1 |X=x,s=0) ] 1 [p(s=0|X=x,Z= z 1 ) ] 1 ×… [P(s=0) ] n [p(Z= z n |X=x,s=0)
    ] n [p(s=0|X=x,Z= z n ) ] n × P(X=x) P(Z= z 1 , z 2 ,… z n ) . (9) View Source
    Note the effect of the additional terms [p(s=0|X=x,Z= z 1 ) ] 1 …[p(s=0|X=x,Z=
    z n ) ] n in the denominator of (9). It will be demonstrated in the next section
    that the term [p(s=0|X=x,Z= z i ) ] i in the denominator results in an increase
    in the variance based on the belief that measurements from sensor i have a greater
    probability of being spurious. This results in less weight applied to the measurement
    from sensor i when fused with measurements from other sensors. Similarly, to combine
    the sensor measurement from sensor n sequentially with the current belief obtained
    from sensors 1,2…n−1 , (5) can be rewritten as (10) shown at the bottom of the
    page. p(X=x| Z ¯ = z 1 , z 2 ,… z n )= [P(s=0) ] n [p(Z= z n |X=x,s=0)]p(X=x|
    Z ¯ 1…n−1 = z 1 , z 2 ,… z z−1 ) P( Z ¯ 1…n = z 1 , z 2 ,… z n )[p(s=0|X=x,Z=
    z n ) ] n (10) View Source Hence, the addition of term [p(s=0|X=x,Z= z n ) ] n
    in the denominator has the effect of increasing the spread (variance) of the posterior
    if the new measurement has a greater probability of being spurious, and decreasing
    the spread of the posterior if the new measurement has a lower probability of
    being spurious. The increase or decrease in the spread of the posterior distribution
    can be easily ascertained by determining the information content given by the
    entropy of distribution obtained from the following equation: H(X)=∫−p(X=x|Z=
    z 1 , z 2 ,… z n ) ×log(p(X=x|Z= z 1 , z 2 ,… z n ))dx.(11) View Source Entropy
    of a variable represents the uncertainty in that variable. A larger value of entropy
    implies more uncertainty and, hence, less information content. The fusion of a
    new measurement should always lead to a decrease in entropy, and fusion should
    always be done in order to reduce entropy. Based on increasing or decreasing the
    entropy of the posterior, this method can identify and eliminate spurious data
    from a sensor. It is noted that the prior probability [P(s=0) ] i has a constant
    value and simply acts as a constant weighting factor in (9) and (10). This value
    does not influence the posterior distribution nor the MAP estimate of the state.
    SECTION IV. Fusion of Three Sensors A. Bayesian Fusion Without Consideration of
    Spuriousness in Data (Method 1) If the spurious nature of the sensor data is not
    considered, and the models of three sensors are given by the following Gaussian
    likelihood function: p(Z= z k |X=x)= 1 σ k 2π − − √ e { −(x− z k ) 2 2 σ 2 k }
    k=1,2,3 (12) View Source where k=1 represents the first sensor, k=2 represents
    the second sensor, and k=3 represents the third sensor. From Bayes'' Theorem,
    the fused MAP estimate is given by x ^ MAP =argmax[p(Z= z 1 |X=x) ×p(Z= z 2 |X=x)p(Z=
    z 3 |X=x)].(13) View Source If three Gaussian distributions (each given by the
    one of three sensors'' model pdfs) are fused, then the posterior distribution
    is jointly Gaussian, and the standard deviation is given by ( σ ′ ) 2 =[( σ 1
    ) −2 +( σ 2 ) −2 +( σ 3 ) −2 ] −1 (14) View Source and the mean (and the MAP estimate)
    are given by x ^ MAP =( σ ′ ) 2 [ z 1 ( σ 1 ) 2 + z 2 ( σ 2 ) 2 + z 3 ( σ 3 )
    2 ]. (15) View Source Hence, if there is no prior information available about
    the quantity to be estimated, the Bayesian approach for fusion of the three sensor
    estimates results in a weighted average dictated by the ratio of standard deviations.
    From (14) we note that the standard deviation of the fused distribution is smaller
    than any of the three individual distributions, representing less uncertainty
    in the fused estimates. B. Bayesian Fusion with Consideration of Spuriousness
    in Data If the spurious nature of the sensor data is considered, then the Gaussian
    sensor model represented by distribution p(Z=z|X=x,s=0) is given by [p(Z=z|X=x,s=0)
    ] k = 1 σ k 2π − − √ e { −(x− z k ) 2 2 σ 2 k } k=1,2,3.(16) View Source The probability
    that the measurement from sensor k is not spurious given the true state x and
    measurement z k , is assumed to be represented by the following equation: [p(s=0|X=x,Z=
    z k ) ] k = e { −(x− z k ) 2 a 2 k } . (17) View Source An advantage of choosing
    the above formulation for representing the probability is that the probability
    is 1 when measurement z k is equal to the true state x , and decreases when the
    measured value moves away from the true state. The rate at which the probability
    decreases when the measured value moves away from the true estimate depends upon
    the parameter a k . The value of the parameter is dependent on the variances of
    the sensor models and the distance between the output of sensor k with respect
    to other sensors. 1. Centralized Fusion Scheme (Method 2) The posterior distribution
    p(X=x|Z= z 1 , z 2 , z 3 ) in the centralized fusion scheme obtained from (9)

    variance of the individual distribution (representing belief from one particular
    measurement) if that particular measurement is at a larger distance to other measurements.
    Thus, if two measurements lie close to one another, then weights associated with
    those measurements become larger when compared to those measurements that lie
    farther away. This process yields a mathematical basis to provide more weighting
    to beliefs when they corroborate one another rather than when they contradict
    one another. 2. Decentralized Fusion Scheme (Method 3) In the decentralized or
    sequential fusion scheme, measurements from only two sources are fused at once.
    The belief resulting from the fusion of two sensors is then fused with the next
    sensor, and the process continues henceforth. Fusion of two sensors k and k+1

    (26) in (24) gives p(X=x|Z= z k , z k+1 ) = P(X=x) P(Z= z k , z k+1 ) ×[P(s=0)

    increasing the value of the variance of individual distribution by a factor of
    {( m 2 / m 2 −( z 1 − z 2 ) 2 )} . Larger differences in sensor measurement imply
    that the variance increases by a bigger factor. Depending on the squared difference
    in measurements from the two sensors, the variance of the posterior distribution
    may increase or decrease as compared with the variance of individual Gaussian
    distributions representing the sensor models. Therefore, the strategy is capable
    of determining if fusion of the two measurements would lead to an increase or
    decrease of the variance of the posterior distribution. In information theoretic
    terms, the strategy is capable of determining if the fusion leads to an increase
    in information content [or entropy given by (11)] or not. Based on increasing
    or decreasing of entropy in the posterior, a decision can be made whether to fuse
    those two sensors or not. This approach provides an opportunity to eliminate sensor
    measurements that are spurious and fuse measurements from only those sensors that
    are consistent, ensuring an increase in information content after fusion. Fig.

    Simulation Results A simulation study was carried out to validate the effectiveness
    of the proposed strategy in identifying spurious data. A comparative analysis
    was performed to study the efficiency with which the three methods (described
    in previous section) were able to handle inconsistency in data. The following
    parameters were assumed in the simulation. Sensor 1: [P(s=0) ] 1 =0.90 and σ 1
    =3 . Sensor 2: [P(s=0) ] 2 =0.98 and σ 2 =2 . Sensor 3: [P(s=0) ] 3 =0.94 and
    σ 3 =2.5 . True value of state: x=20 . Simulation data was generated so that Sensor
    1 provided 90% of the time normally distributed random data with a mean value
    of 20 and variance 9. It provided incorrect data 10% of the time which was uniformly
    distributed outside the Gaussian distribution. Sensor 2 provided 98% of the time
    normally distributed random data with a mean value of 20 and variance 4, and 2%
    of the time it provided incorrect data. Similarly, Sensor 3 provided 94% of the
    time normally distributed random data with a mean value of 20 and variance 6.25,
    and 6% of the time it provided incorrect data. It may be noted here that the values
    for [P(s=0) ] k have been assumed simply for the purpose of generating simulated
    data. These are not used in the fusion algorithm. Since these values are constants,
    they do not have any effect on the posterior distribution or the MAP estimate.
    Fig. 4. Sample data and fusion from multiple sensors with spurious data. (a) Fusion
    of a sample of 100 data points. (b) A case when two sensors provide spurious measurements.
    Show All Fig. 3(a) illustrates a case when all of the three sensors are in agreement,
    and measurement from none of the sensors is inconsistent with the rest. It can
    be seen that posterior distributions obtained from all three methods coincide
    resulting in the same value of MAP estimate. In Fig. 3(b), measurement from Sensor
    1 is in disagreement from the other two sensors. Method 1, which is a simple Bayesian
    fusion and does not take into account inconsistency of data, results in the weighted
    average of the three measurements given by (15). Method 2, which takes into account
    the inconsistency and weights those sensors more whose measurements are consistent
    (Sensors 2 and 3 in this case) with each other, results in an estimate which is
    closer to the sensors (Sensors 2 and 3) in agreement. Method 3 identifies the
    sensor which provides spurious measurements and eliminates that from the fusion
    process. Hence, it simply considers measurements from Sensors 2 and 3, and fuses
    them appropriately using (27). In a similar manner, Fig. 3(c) and (d), respectively,
    show that measurements from Sensors 2 and 3 are spurious. The figure shows the
    efficiency with which Method 3 identifies and eliminates spurious measurements,
    and results in better estimates (closer to the true value) of the variable. The
    figure also shows that Method 2 is able to appropriately and autonomously weight
    sensors to achieve an estimate which is better as compared to Method 1 which does
    not take inconsistency into consideration at all. A set of 10 000 data points
    were generated in the manner described above and fusion was carried out using
    all three methods. The mean value of the sum of squared error (MSE) between the
    fused value and true value for all 10 000 data points was computed. The values
    of MSE were found as 6.94 for Method 1, 6.03 for Method 2, and 5.50 for Method
    3. Hence, Method 3 was able to reduce the MSE by approximately 21% when compared
    with Method 1, and Method 2 was able to reduce the mean square error by approximately
    13% when compared with Method 1. Fig. 4(a) shows a sample of 100 data points taken
    from the above set of ten thousand data points. Data points represented by asterisks
    (∗) are the fused values obtained via Method 3. The figure shows that the asterisks,
    on an average, lie closer to the dashed line (—) which represents the true value
    of the variable. Method 3 has the built-in mechanism to identify and eliminate
    spurious data. As explained in the previous sections, it does so by comparing
    data from one sensor with those from the other two sensors. This method fails
    when two sensors simultaneously provide spurious data which are close to one another.
    The method wrongfully identifies the measurement from the third sensor as spurious.
    This rarely happens since the probability of two sensors providing spurious data
    at the same time is very low. In Fig. 4(a), for example, it happened for the encircled
    data. Fig. 4(b) shows the details of fusion results for this data point. Sensors
    1 and 2 have both provided spurious data. However, since they are close to each
    other, Method 3 identifies data from Sensor 3 as spurious, and eliminates that
    data from fusion process. This leads to inaccurate estimation. Similarly, Method
    2 provides more weights to data from Sensors 1 and 2, and also results in inaccurate
    estimation. However, since occurrence of such a case is rare, both Method 2 and
    Method 3 generally provide improved accuracy over Method 1. SECTION VI. Experimental
    Validation The theories developed in the previous sections were validated with
    the help of experiments performed in the Robotics and Manufacturing Automation
    (RAMA) Laboratory at Duke University. The objective of the experiment was to obtain
    a three-dimensional occupancy profile of the robotic workspace using three independent
    sensory sources: stereo vision, an infrared proximity sensor, and a laser proximity
    sensor. The occupancy profile was obtained using an occupancy grid framework.
    The occupancy grid [29]–[33] is a multidimensional field (usually of dimension
    two or three) where each cell (or unit of the grid) stores or represents the probabilistic
    estimate of the state of spatial occupancy. Occupancy grids are one of the most
    common low-level models of an environment, which provide an excellent framework
    for robust fusion of uncertain and noisy data. If the state variable (occupancy,
    in this case) associated with a cell, C i , is denoted by s( C i ) , then the
    occupancy probability P[s( C i )] represents the probabilistic estimate of occupancy
    of that particular cell. Fig. 5. Sensor models. (a) Stereo Vision. (b) Infrared
    proximity sensor. (c) Laser proximity sensor. Show All Fig. 6. Images of the worktable
    obtained from left and the right camera. Show All If P[s( C i )=occ]≈0 , then
    the cell is assumed to be empty, while if P[s( C i )=occ]≈1 , then the cell is
    assumed to be occupied. If a single sensor is used to obtain the occupancy grid,
    Bayes'' Theorem can be used in the following manner to determine the state of
    the cell: P[s( C i ) =occ|z]= p[z|s( C i )=occ]P[s( C i )=occ] ∑ s( C i ) p[z|s(
    C i )]P[s( C i )] (28) View Source where z is the sensor measurement. The pdf
    p[z|s( C i )=occ] is dependent on the sensor characteristics and is called the
    sensor model. The probability P[s( C i )=occ] is called prior probability mass
    function and specifies the information made available prior to any observation.
    At first, models of the three sensory sources using Gaussian distributions were
    obtained. These models were obtained using a neural network-based technique that
    established the relationship between the variance of the sensor model with respect
    to certain environmental or algorithmic conditions. The details of the sensor
    modeling process are explained in [28], and the results are shown in the Fig.
    5. Fig. 5(a) shows the graph of standard deviation of Gaussian sensor model plotted
    against the correlation score of stereo-matched templates for stereo vision sensor.
    Similarly, for infrared and laser proximity sensors, the variance of the sensor
    model was found to be dependent on the distance to the detected object, and the
    relationship between the variance and the sensor outputs (which are indicative
    of the distance to the detected object) are shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c), respectively,
    for infrared and laser proximity sensor. Occupancy grids were obtained individually
    for stereo vision, infrared, and laser proximity sensors, and then the individual
    grids were fused using two techniques: 1) Simple Bayesian Fusion and 2) Sequential
    Bayesian Fusion with Proposed Inconsistency Detection and Elimination Strategy.
    The details of the process for obtaining occupancy grids and sensor fusion are
    explained in [29]. In the experiment, a cylindrical object was placed on the robot''s
    worktable. Fig. 6 shows the images of the worktable obtained from the stereo cameras.
    Fig. 7(a) shows the actual occupancy grid of the workspace. This was obtained
    based on the geometric dimensions of the object and its location in the workspace.
    For the occupancy grid developed in this research, each grid is of size 5 mm ×
    5 mm × 5 mm. Fig. 7(b)–(d) shows the occupancy grids independently obtained from
    stereo vision, IR proximity sensor, and laser proximity sensor, respectively.
    Fig. 7(e) shows the occupancy grid obtained from simple Bayesian approach, and
    Fig. 7(f) shows the occupancy grid obtained from the Bayesian approach that utilizes
    the inconsistency detection and elimination technique proposed earlier. To facilitate
    a comparison of the performance of the fusion process via different algorithms,
    a measure of error was formulated which is given by the following equation: Error=
    ∑ C i [|s( C i ) | actual −|s( C i ) | sensor ] 2 (29) View Source Fig. 7. Occupancy
    grids. (a) Actual grid. (b) Grid obtained from stereo vision. (c) Grid obtained
    from IR proximity sensor. (d) Grid obtained from laser proximity sensor. (e) Fused
    grid (simple Bayesian approach). (f) Fused grid (proposed Bayesian fusion with
    inconsistency detection and elimination). Show All Table I Error Associated with
    Occupancy Grids Obtained from Fusion Process where |s( C i ) | actual is the actual
    state of the cell, and |s( C i ) | sensor is the state of the cell obtained from
    the sensor and/or fusion process. The state of the cell is either 1 (for occupied)
    or 0 (for empty). Table I provides the error value associated with the occupancy
    grid obtained from the fusion process described above. The table compares the
    error value obtained via the two approaches. The first approach is based on the
    simple Bayesian fusion scheme, and the second approach is based on the proposed
    Bayesian fusion scheme embedded with the mechanism for inconsistency detection
    and elimination. From the figures as well as from the table of results, it is
    evident that the proposed fusion scheme based on Bayesian approach with an built-in
    mechanism to identify and eliminate spurious/inconsistent measurement presented
    in this paper has been able to reduce the uncertainty inherent in individual sensors.
    The proposed method has been able to reduce the error by approximately 70% as
    compared with stereo vision, 64% as compared with IR proximity sensor, and 4%
    as compared with laser proximity sensor. On the other hand, simple Bayesian technique
    was able to reduce the error by approximately 64% as compared with stereo vision
    and by 56% as compared with IR proximity sensor. The technique based on simple
    Bayesian approach led to an increase in error by approximately 15% as compared
    with laser proximity sensor. The increase in error demonstrates the fact that
    it is not necessary that incorporation of additional sensor data will lead to
    improved accuracy of estimation. This is particularly more evident in cases when
    the accuracy of measurements from sensors differs by a large amount. In this case,
    the measurements from laser proximity are far more accurate (see Fig. 5) than
    measurements from the stereo vision or IR proximity sensor, and fusion of measurements
    from the laser with stereo vision and IR proximity leads to an increase in error.
    However, the proposed technique has a built-in mechanism to determine if the fusion
    process leads to an increase in the information content, and, in this way was
    able to eliminate inconsistent data and improve the overall accuracy of the fusion
    process. Of the 24 000 points (or cells) where the fusion of data from three sensors
    occurred (fusion occurred at 30 × 40 × 20 cells of the occupancy grid), the proposed
    technique detected 393 points where data from IR sensor were inconsistent and
    1028 points where data from stereo vision were inconsistent. None of the data
    from the laser sensor were detected to be inconsistent. This observation is consistent
    with the fact that the laser sensor was far more accurate than the other two sensors.
    One of the limitations of the proposed technique is that when there is a large
    number of sensors supporting an inconsistent measurement, then, based on the beliefs
    of the individual measurements, the technique may consider inconsistent measurements
    to be the correct one, and might disregard the correct measurements obtained by
    fewer numbers of sensors. In psychology, this kind of problem is termed as group
    conformity. For example, when an individual''s opinion differs significantly from
    that of others in a group, the individual is likely to feel extensive pressure
    to align his or her opinion with others. In the case of sensor systems, this kind
    of condition is more likely to occur in adversarial situations, such as the battlefield,
    where events are prone to be camouflaged to escape detection. Hence, a formal
    criterion to establish the difference between spuriousness and opinion difference
    must be developed for the sensor fusion process to be accurately carried out in
    such adversarial situations. For example, in these situations, the technique proposed
    in this paper could be applied if sensor models could be developed that represent
    the possibility/likelihood of events being camouflaged. Real-time implementation
    and scalability aspects of the proposed sequential scheme have to be considered.
    Since the method is based on the information content of the fused belief, novel
    fusion architectures can be designed to introduce parallelism in the process,
    and at the same time minimize the possibility of fused result falling into local
    attractor basins. On the other hand, the technique based on centralized fusion
    scheme is completely scalable and can be easily implemented in real time. SECTION
    VII. Conclusion Sensors often provide spurious measurements. Identification of
    such spurious measurements and their elimination is essential for carrying out
    accurate estimation. This paper proposes a unified and formalized approach to
    fuse data from multiple sources which can automatically identify inconsistency
    in sensor data. The proposed strategy adds a term to the popular Bayesian approach
    corresponding to a belief that the sensor data is not spurious conditioned upon
    the data and true state. An information theoretic measure is utilized to observe
    the information content of the posterior distribution to identify spurious data.
    Three approaches were comparatively studied in this paper. The first approach
    was based on simple Bayesian methods. The second approach adds the new term described
    above fuses all data in a centralized manner. The third method sequentially fuses
    data and eliminates those data which it identifies as spurious. An extensive simulation
    study was performed where data from three sensors was fused. It was observed that
    the third method was very effective in identifying spurious data, and elimination
    of spurious data ensured more accurate results. The second method performed better
    than the first method since it had a built-in mechanism for increasing the weighting
    of consistent measurements, while at the same time decreasing the weighting applied
    to spurious measurements. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed technique
    to identify and eliminate inconsistent sensor data in sequential Bayesian fusion
    was demonstrated with the help of an experiment performed in a robotic workcell,
    where measurements from stereo vision, infrared proximity, and laser proximity
    senor were fused to obtain three-dimensional occupancy profile of robotic workspace.

  explanation: The paper presents a two-stage Bayesian sensor fusion method for diagnosing
    electrical and mechanical faults in induction motors. The method integrates principal
    component analysis (PCA) and Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB) classifiers to fuse data
    from acoustic, electric, and vibration signals. The purpose of the PCA step is
    to reduce feature correlation and the influence of load conditions. The GNB classifiers
    are used at the local stage to fuse principal components of the features, and
    the results are combined at the global stage using a Bayesian approach. The method
    is evaluated for stator, rotor, and bearing faults under varying load and environmental
    conditions, showing low false and missed alarm rates.

    in industrial plants for critical operations. Stator faults, bearing faults, or
    rotor faults can lead to unplanned downtime with associated cost and safety implications.
    Different sensors may be used to monitor the health state of induction motors
    with each sensor typically being better suited for diagnosing different faults.
    Condition monitoring approaches that fuse data from multiple sensors have the
    potential to diagnose a greater number of faults. In this paper, a sensor fusion
    approach based on the combination of a two-stage Bayesian method and principal
    component analysis (PCA) is proposed for diagnosing both electrical and mechanical
    faults in induction motors. Acoustic, electric, and vibration signals are gathered
    from motors operating under different loading conditions and health states. The
    inclusion of the PCA step ensures robustness to varying loading conditions. The
    obtained results highlight that the proposed method performs better than the equivalent
    single-stage or feature-based Bayesian methods. Published in: IEEE Transactions

    I. Introduction Induction motors are widely used in industrial plants for critical
    operations, where a failure could result in a partial or complete shutdown of
    the production process. Unplanned maintenance, downtime, or replacements can result
    in high costs and, furthermore, critical failures can have serious safety implications.
    Induction motor faults may be categorized as electrical related, mechanical related,
    or environmental related [1]. The range of possible faults is numerous, with stator,
    bearing, and rotor faults being the most prevalent [2]–[4]. These faults will
    impact the mechanical, magnetic, and electrical characteristics of the induction
    motor in different ways. As a result, the optimal sensor type for diagnosing one
    type of fault mode may not be the same as the optimal sensor to diagnose another
    fault mode. It has previously been shown that specific induction motor faults
    can be diagnosed using different sensors [5]–[8]. Vibration, acoustic, and electric
    signals are among the most commonly used sensor types for rotor and stator faults
    detection, however some sensors are more suitable for detecting specific faults
    than others [7], [8]. Nandi [5] observed that acoustic and vibration signals are
    the most sensitive for bearing fault detection, whereas electric signals are more
    sensitive to broken rotor bar faults. It has recently been shown that acoustic
    signals are suitable for bearing, stator, and rotor fault diagnostics of single-phase
    and three-phase induction motors [9], [10]. Additionally, sensors that are responsive
    to a specific fault can also provide information about other faults [6]. Hence,
    a condition-monitoring system that fuses information obtained from multiple sensor
    types can ensure that a comprehensive range of fault modes may potentially be
    detected quickly and accurately. Various condition-monitoring methods that aim
    to increase the accuracy and robustness of fault detection via sensor fusion have
    been reported. In [11], neural networks were used to fuse vibration and current
    signals in order to diagnose mechanical and electrical faults. It was shown that
    these signal types are complementary to one another and that their fusion using
    the Dempster–Shafer theory at the decision level increases the accuracy of the
    classification. A K-nearest neighbor classifier was applied in [12] using an accelerometer
    and load signals in order to diagnose bearing faults, showing that, whereas load
    signals are more useful in distinguishing healthy bearings from faulty ones and
    accelerometer signals are better at detecting the location of the fault, the best
    performance was achieved when the two signals were fused together. In [13], vibration
    and acoustic signals were fused using the Dempster–Shafer theory at the decision
    level to diagnose faults in planetary gearboxes, with the fusion resulting in
    more precise diagnostics along with reduced false and missed alarm rates. In [14],
    vibration, acoustic, and oil debris signals were fused at the feature level to
    diagnose faults in gears with principal component analysis (PCA) and independent
    component analysis. In each aforementioned case, the sensor fusion proved to increase
    the accuracy, robustness, and missed or false alarm rate of the system. Sensor
    fusion can be implemented at the data level, the feature level, and at the decision
    level. The decision on the abstraction level depends on the information carried
    by the different signals. If the signal types are significantly different and
    carry complementary information, it is advised to use decision-level fusion [11],
    [15]. A typical challenge encountered when creating decision-level fusion algorithms
    is that there are often a large number of features relative to the number of observations.
    These features can be highly correlated, which ultimately can bias the results
    of the fault detection algorithm. A common method to reduce the correlation and
    the dimensionality of the features is PCA [16], [17]. For example, in [18], the
    dimensionality of features extracted from vibration and current signals was reduced
    by PCA before applying genetic algorithms and an artificial neural network for
    classifying faults in an induction motor. It was found that the performance of
    the fault classifier was improved by adding PCA as a feature preprocessing step.
    In [19], several feature reduction and transformation methods including neighborhood
    component analysis, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), locally linear coordination,
    and PCA were compared with maximally collapsing metric learning for multiple bearing
    fault diagnosis in induction motors with particular focus given to the dimensionality
    reduction aspect. Feature reduction is also found in multistage frameworks for
    the induction motor diagnosis, for example, a recent work [20] applied PCA, LDA,
    a genetic algorithm, and the Fisher score in a hybrid strategy to obtain a reduced
    and optimized feature set from vibration signals. Another regularly observed fault
    detection problem is the varying operating conditions of the machines, which can
    originate from a change in the load or environmental conditions. In [21], it was
    concluded that the prediction performance of a support vector machine (SVM) based
    fault detection algorithm for mechanical and electrical fault detections in induction
    motors is load dependent. Different severities of stator faults were monitored
    in induction motors under changing load torque and supply voltage unbalances in
    [22], finding that the performance of a multiagent system and neural estimator
    depends on the severity of the fault. Diagnostics and prognostics methods of rotating
    machinery were reviewed in [23], highlighting the operating condition dependence
    of algorithms as an existing but an understudied area. Bayesian inference has
    been described as a suitable method for fault detection and fault classification
    in condition-monitoring systems [23], [24]. Recently, Jaramillo et al. [25] proposed
    a two-stage Bayesian inference approach to monitor the condition of a system composed
    of several subsystems. The first stage of the sensor fusion takes place at the
    subsystem level, whereas the second stage fuses the result of the first stage
    at the decision level in order to determine the health state of the whole system.
    The method was efficient in diagnosing faults in complex systems composed of interacting
    components. Existing two-stage Bayesian sensor fusion frameworks described in
    the literature [25], [26] typically set alarm thresholds according to the probability
    distributions of features and control limits. Properly tuning alarm thresholds
    can be challenging, particularly when there are a large number of features in
    the data set, or when the thresholds themselves might optimally be described as
    a function of other parameters (e.g., operating conditions). This paper is an
    extension of the previous work in which a two-stage Bayesian sensor fusion method
    was applied to the diagnosis of mechanical faults in induction motors [26]. It
    was shown that, by fusing independent diagnoses of different sensor types at the
    decision level, the false and missed alarm rates of a fault classification algorithm
    could be significantly reduced. In [26], simple linear models of expected feature
    values relative to load values were applied to account for the load dependence
    of features. Such an approach limits the generality of the solution as the loading
    of the system is also required as an input to the algorithm during training and
    testing. It was also observed that the features used for training the Naïve Bayes
    classifier were highly correlated. As previously noted, such correlations between
    features can potentially bias the fault detection algorithm toward certain diagnoses.
    In this paper, a two-stage (local and global) Bayesian method combined with PCA
    is proposed as a method for diagnosing not only mechanical but also electrical
    faults in induction motors operating under varying load and environmental conditions.
    Stator, rotor, and bearing faults are all considered. Features are extracted from
    acoustic, electric, and vibration signals recorded from an experimental system.
    PCA is used to remove the correlations that are present in the extracted features
    and reduce the influence of load conditions. At the local Bayesian stage, principal
    components of the features are fused with a Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB) classifier.
    At the global Bayesian stage, the results of the local stages are fused in order
    to create a final diagnosis. The generality of the algorithm is investigated by
    omitting data recorded at selected operating and environmental conditions from
    the training set and subsequently testing the trained model using the omitted
    data. The novelties of this paper are as follows. A two-stage Bayesian sensor
    fusion approach is extended by integrating PCA and GNB classifiers into the framework.
    It is known that many fault indicators are dependent on loading conditions. By
    incorporating a multivariate statistical approach into the analysis, the correlations
    between operating conditions and feature level are accounted for. It is shown
    that the resulting method is able to accurately diagnose faults even for loading
    conditions not present in the training set. In this paper, additional data addressing
    stator faults with varying severity are included into the analysis. This data
    is used to illustrate how, by fusing the different signals, it is possible to
    achieve a holistic monitoring solution that both provide greater coverage and
    greater monitoring accuracy compared to considering each sensor independently.
    Through the addition of PCA and the GNB classifier, the approach introduced in
    this paper does not require monitoring thresholds to be defined, as the posterior
    fault class probabilities are directly calculated. This paper is organized as
    follows. In Section II, the methods are introduced. In Section III, the experimental
    data are described, which were used for the validation of the methods. Section
    IV describes the implementation of the methods using the experimental data. The
    results of the proposed fault diagnosis method are presented in Section V with
    a discussion in Section VI. Finally, in Section VII, conclusions are drawn, pointing
    out the advantages, limitations of the method, and possible future work. SECTION
    II. Methods A. Principal Component Analysis PCA is a well-established method for
    feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, data compression, and data visualization
    [27]. It is a common problem in data analysis that the features or attributes
    of the observation data are highly correlated. PCA transforms the correlated features
    to a linear space where the transformed features are uncorrelated and are ordered
    in a way that the first features retain most of the variation in the data. Singular
    value decomposition or eigenvalue decomposition (EIG) are popular algorithms for
    performing PCA. Here, SVD is considered, as it is numerically more robust when
    matrices are either singular or numerically very close to singular. Furthermore,
    SVD directly provides the required scores and loadings. If X is an n × m matrix
    with rank r, with n observations and m features, SVD is defined as follows: X=UL
    A T (1) View Source where U is an n × r orthonormal matrix, L is an r × r diagonal
    matrix, and A is an m × r orthonormal matrix. UL is an n × r matrix, containing
    the transformed uncorrelated features in the principal component space, usually
    referenced as scores. A contains the principal components, sometimes called loadings.
    For further information on PCA and SVD, readers are guided to [27]. B. GNB Classifiers
    A GNB classifier is a probabilistic classifier, which assumes conditional independence
    between data that are distributed according to a Gaussian distribution. The classifier
    uses the Bayes theorem to calculate the posterior probabilities that an observation
    x t ={ x 1 , x 2 ,…, x m } belongs to class c i out of classes C={ c 1 , c 2 ,…,
    c p } in the following way: P( c i | x t )= P( c i )⋅ ∏ m j=1 P( x j | c i ) ∑
    n k=1 P( c k )⋅ ∏ m j=1 P( x j | c k ) (2) View Source where P( c i ) is the prior
    probability of an observation belonging to class c i . The classifier learns the
    P( x j | c i ) conditional probabilities that a given feature value x j belongs
    to class c i from a training dataset. By assuming a Gaussian distribution of the
    features, the conditional probabilities may be obtained using the values of mean
    and standard deviation of the labeled training data for each class as follows:
    P( x j | c i ( μ i,j , σ i,j ))= 1 σ i,j 2π − − √ ⋅ e − ( x j − μ i,j ) 2 2 σ
    i,j 2 . (3) View Source Once the posterior probabilities are calculated for all
    of the classes, the observation x t will be classified into the class that has
    the highest posterior probability. Equation (2) can be simplified by omitting
    the normalization factor in the denominator, as only the index of the maximum
    a posteriori (MAP) class is important for the classification P( c i | x t )∝ c
    predicted = P( c i )⋅ ∏ j=1 m P( x j | c i ) argmax{P( C ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ | x t ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯
    ¯ )}. (4) (5) View Source For further reference regarding GNB classifiers, readers
    are guided to, for example, [28]–[30]. C. PCA and Two-Stage Bayesian Sensor Fusion
    The proposed two-stage Bayesian sensor fusion method combined with PCA is an extension
    of a previous work [26]. In this paper, the algorithm is updated to include a
    preprocessing PCA step. PCA was selected as it is able to mitigate feature correlation
    that can bias the likelihood calculations. It is a linear method that yields a
    reduced and uncorrelated feature set. Instead of the original features, uncorrelated
    principal components are fused using a GNB classifier. The number of principal
    components considered for each signal type is calculated using the validation
    set in a way that the performance of the algorithm is maximized while the false
    and missed alarm rates are reduced, using the detection accuracy as an optimization
    parameter. The method retains the structure of the global fusion stage on the
    decision level, as described in [26]. The advantage of applying the GNB classifier
    at the local stage is that there is no need to determine alarm thresholds and
    confidence intervals, as the GNB classifier calculates the fault class probabilities
    directly. D. Description of the Local Stage The proposed algorithm is suited for
    condition-monitoring problems where N different sensors provide measurement data
    for the determination of the health state of the system. For training, the algorithm
    requires data that has been labeled with M fault conditions. If there is a test
    set available, the data has to be split into two separate datasets for training:
    the training set and the validation set. The training set will be used for the
    training of the GNB classifiers at the local stage, whereas the validation set
    will produce the confusion matrices for the different sensor types at the global
    fusion stage. Once the data are cleaned and selected features are extracted, the
    features are split by sensor type. At this stage, the training set takes the form
    of an n × m matrix, where n is the number of observations and m is the number
    of features. The μ Ai,Sj means and σ Ai,Sj standard deviations are calculated
    for each A i feature and S j sensor type. A normalization step transforms the
    features such that the means are 0 and the standard deviations are 1. PCA calculates
    the S C Sj scores and L O Sj loadings for each sensor type. The scores, which
    might also be considered as the new “features,” are uncorrelated. The L O Sj loadings
    are calculated using the whole training set containing both healthy and faulty
    data. To calculate the conditional probabilities of the GNB according to (3),
    the μ Ai,Sj,Ck means and σ Ai,Sj,Ck standard deviations of the principal components
    are calculated for each C k fault type in the labeled data. Next, the validation
    set is used in both to find the optimal number of principal components and to
    calculate the confusion matrices using μ Ai,Sj , σ Ai,Sj , μ Ai,Sj,Ck , σ Ai,Sj,Ck
    , and L O Sj from the training data. The features in the validation set are normalized
    using μ Ai,Sj and σ Ai,Sj . The normalized features are transformed to the principal
    components space using the L O Sj loadings. To find the number of principal components
    for each S j sensor type, an iterative step is considered as follows. The first
    i principal components are used as features, calculating the posterior probabilities
    and class predictions for each observation in the validation set using (3)–(5).
    Count the correct predictions and save it for i. Once the iteration has finished,
    the value of i resulting in the highest number of correct predictions is chosen
    for the number of principal components used to calculate the predictions for each
    observation in the validation set. E. Description of the Global Stage The prediction
    counts for each fault type are organized in an M × M global confusion matrix G
    Si for each sensor type S i where the rows represent the actual condition, the
    columns represent the diagnosed condition, and the prediction counts by rows are
    divided by the total number of actual conditions for the fault type. The matrix
    elements can be interpreted as P( F i | F j ) conditional probabilities; given
    that the algorithm predicted F j , what is the probability that the actual fault
    condition is F i ? The P( F i | F i ) probabilities, located along the diagonal
    of the confusion matrix for each sensor type, represent the probability that the
    sensor diagnosed the corresponding fault correctly G S i = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ P( F 1 | F 1
    ) … P( F M | F 1 ) … P( F i | F i ) … P( F 1 | F M ) … P( F M | F M ) ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ .
    (6) View Source The test set is separate from the training set and is divided
    by sensor type into N sets, with observations in rows and features in columns.
    The test set is normalized and the GNB classifier is calculated with the optimized
    number of principal components. The fault class predictions of the GNB classifier
    for an observation are fused by (7) and (8) using the appropriate columns from
    the global confusion matrices for each sensor type. P( c i ) represents a priori
    knowledge; if no prior distribution is available, a uniform distribution is supposed.
    If the fault class predicted by S1 is F i and fault class predicted by S M is
    F j , then columns have to be selected in the following way from the corresponding
    confusion matrices: G S 1, F i = c predicted = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ P( F 1 | F i ) … P( F M |
    F i ) ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ,…, G S M , F j = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ P( F 1 | F j ) … P( F M | F j ) ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ argmax{P(
    c i )⋅ ∏ i=1,j=1 M,N G S i, F j }. (7) (8) View Source For each fault class, the
    output of the global fusion step is a posterior probability giving the likelihood
    of that fault class being present in the system. For the purposes of evaluating
    the performance of the algorithm, we consider the final prediction as being the
    fault class that has the highest posterior probability after the global fusion
    step (8). F. Testing an Observation The overall flow diagram of the proposed two-stage
    Bayesian sensor fusion method for testing an observation is shown in Fig. 1. At
    the local stage, each type of sensor is handled separately. For a given sensor
    type, features are fused in order to obtain a prediction of the most likely health
    state of the system, given the data recorded by that sensor type. At the global
    stage, the predictions of the most likely health state for each sensor type are
    fused using the global confusion matrix to create the global diagnosis result.

    III. Experimental Data The measurement set up for the experiment is shown in Fig.
    2. Experimental data were collected from three identical induction motors, differing
    only in terms of health state: one motor was healthy, one had two broken rotor
    bars, and one had an outer raceway fault in a bearing. It was also possible to
    seed stator faults into the nominally healthy motor, as described in [31]. The
    test motors were 0.8 kW, four-pole SZJKe 14a induction motors manufactured by
    TAMEL with a nominal rotor speed of 1400 r/min. The nominal values of voltage,
    current, rated torque, and power factor for these motors were 380 V, 2.2 A, 5.45
    N·m, and 0.74, respectively. The motor had a Y winding configuration with 4 coils
    per phase, 22 rotor bars, and 24 stator slots. The rotor inertia was 0.0025 kg·m2
    and the motor bearings were SKF type 6304 ZZ CXSQ. An eddy current brake was used
    to load the motor. The measurements were conducted at steady-state operation under
    different loading conditions. For each fault case between three and five loading
    conditions were tested, resulting in stator currents of 68%, 81%, 90%, 100%, and
    113% of nominal values. Measurements were recorded both with and without background
    noise generated by a separate shaker. Datasets for eight different health conditions
    were recorded, denoted as F0–F7, as follows: F0—Healthy motor; F1—Stator fault:
    Phase one bypassed in the first phase; F2—Stator fault: Phase one bypassed in
    half of the first phase; F3—Stator fault: Phase–phase short circuit; F4—Stator
    fault: Phase–phase short circuit with an offset point; F5—Stator fault: Break
    of half of the phase one; F6—Rotor fault: Two broken rotor bars; F7—Bearing fault:
    Outer raceway defect. Fig. 2. Schematic of the experimental system. Show All The
    tested motor was rewound in such a way that instead of coils for a given phase
    being directly connected to one another, the individual coils were connected to
    a switchboard allowing the winding configuration to be quickly changed. Furthermore,
    in six coils, special taps were created in order to allow different short circuits
    to be seeded. Such a configuration allows various stator faults to be seeded,
    as was investigated in [29] for the same SZJKe 14a induction motor. For F1 and
    F2, the first phase was bypassed by a 15 Ω resistance causing a short circuit
    in the first phase winding. For F3 and F4, a short circuit of two stator phases
    in the taps connected in the middle of the first coils was seeded by adding a
    115 Ω resistance. In the case of F5, part of the coil was not connected causing
    asymmetry in the winding, so that the current did not flow through a part of the
    winding. The two broken rotor bars (F6) were located next to one another. The
    bearing fault (F7) was caused by an incision through the outer ring of the bearing.
    Acoustic, electric, and vibration signals were collected using five different
    sensor types. Three G.R.A.S. 46AE microphones were used to measure the sound pressure
    levels. A Model USP regular three-dimensional Sound Intensity Microflown probe
    was also used to collect acoustic signals from the motors. The probe provided
    four measurement signals, three particle velocity signals in three orthogonal
    directions and a sound pressure signal. The vibration signals were measured by
    a three-axis PCB ICP accelerometer Model No. 356B18 and a one-axis PCB ICP accelerometer
    Model No. 353B32, providing four signals in total in unit g. The three phase voltages
    were measured by LV 25-P voltage transducers providing signals directly for analysis
    of voltage characteristics. The motor currents were measured by LTS-6NP and LEM
    HY 5-P current transducers. The following signals were collected using a 16-channel
    LMS Scada Mobile System: 4 microflown signals, 3 microphone signals, 2 current
    signals, 4 vibration signals, and 3 voltage signals. Data were collected with
    a 51.2-kHz sampling rate to capture all frequencies of interest with 30 s of data
    being recorded for each configuration to capture a sufficiently long steady-state
    periods for analysis. 58 datasets were obtained: one for each tested loading condition,
    both with and without additional background noise. The same background noise was
    applied over the tests. The microflown axis X probe has measured an average 47.26
    m/s particle velocity with no noise, whereas it has measured an average 88.69
    m/s particle velocity with noise for the healthy motor under nominal load. SECTION
    IV. Implementation of the Method The 58 datasets were split into 0.5-s observations
    resulting in 60 observations for 1 dataset and 3480 observations in total. For
    each signal, and for each 0.5-s observation, the following time-domain features
    were extracted: root mean square (rms), skewness, kurtosis, maximum peak, peak-to-peak,
    and crest factor. Features were also extracted from both the amplitude spectrum
    and the envelope spectrum of the signal: the frequency center, spectrum area,
    the amplitude of the components at the first two harmonics of the supply frequency
    (50, 100), the first three harmonics of the rotation speed (1×, 2×, 3×), the amplitude
    ratios (2×/1×, 3×/1×), and the amplitude at the sidebands of the supply frequency
    (50 Hz ± 2 × slip, 50 Hz ± rotation speed). The 0.5-s window length provided a
    2-Hz spectral resolution. While no windowing functions were applied in the calculation
    of the spectra, edge effects were found to be minimal. In total, 30 features were
    extracted for the 16 signals, resulting in 480 features in total. These time-
    and frequency-domain features are standard metrics, commonly used for the condition
    monitoring of induction motors [11], [21], [32]. It should be noted that for all
    signal types, all of the above-mentioned feature types were extracted. No additional
    feature selection approaches were applied. Fig. 3 shows the relative rms values
    of five different signal types extracted from 0.5-s measurement windows, for all
    observations through the 58 datasets. It may be observed that the sensors reacted
    to the fault modes and loading conditions in different ways. For example, the
    rms current is increased for stator fault modes F3 and F4, whereas the rms vibration
    did not significantly react. Conversely, in the case of the rotor fault F6, the
    vibration signal exhibited increased rms values, whereas the rms current did not
    show significant increases. This further illustrates that different faults are
    more easily diagnosed by different sensors. The 480 features of the 3480 observations
    were grouped by signal types into five groups, namely vibration features, current
    features, microflown features, microphone features, and voltage features. The
    data were then split into a training set, a validation set, and a test set, in
    the same way for the five signal types. The division is described in Section V.
    The training sets were used to train the local stage, the validation sets were
    used to calculate the global confusion matrices for the global fusion stage, and
    finally, the test sets were used to test the performance of the algorithm. All
    analyses were conducted in MATLAB. Fig. 3. Relative rms values of 5 different
    signal types extracted from 0.5-s measurement windows, for all observations through
    the 58 datasets. Show All SECTION V. Results In order to illustrate the performance
    of the described algorithm with respect to different loading and environmental
    noise conditions, the experimental data were divided into different training,
    validation, and test sets. In Test Case A, a random split was applied. In Test
    Cases B and C, eight entire datasets (one from each fault case) were included
    in the test set with no datasets from experiments conducted at this loading condition
    being considered in the training or validation sets. In Test Case B, the lowest
    load datasets with no background noise are the test set. In Test Case D, the highest
    load datasets with background noise are the test set. The aim of testing different
    divisions for testing, validation, and training is to observe the performance
    of the algorithm under different operating conditions, particularly under loading
    conditions that were not considered during model training. A. Test Case A: Random
    Split Test Case A was used to evaluate the overall performance of the algorithm.
    The total 3480 observations were randomly split into training set, validation
    set, and test set with a respective ratio of 60-20-20%. The random split was applied
    100 times and the averaged results are shown in Table I. The columns represent
    the conditions diagnosed by the algorithm, whereas the rows represent the actual
    fault conditions of the motors. The healthy motor was correctly diagnosed in 94%
    of the cases with a 6% false alarm rate in case of F2 stator fault. Missed alarms
    are present for F2, however it is only 2%. F2 is the least severe fault among
    the seven seeded faults, which explains this behavior. The successful detection
    rate is above 98% for all fault cases, with 100% success rate for F1, F5, F6,
    and F7. Among the stator faults, the following scenario can be observed: F3 and
    F4 are sometimes misdiagnosed as each other, as they are the variations of the
    same fault: F3 is the phase–phase short-circuit, whereas F4 is the phase–phase
    short circuit with an offset point. To give an overall measure of the test accuracy,
    the F1 score is calculated to be 99.32%. TABLE I Test Case A: Random Split B.
    Test Case B: Lowest Load and No Noise In Test Case B, the test set was formed
    of data taken from the lowest loading conditions, with no datasets from experiments
    conducted at this loading condition being considered in the training or validation
    sets. The aim was to test the performance of the algorithm under load conditions
    that are lower than those contained within the training and validation sets. The
    results are shown in Table II. The accuracy of the algorithm was 100% when diagnosing
    the healthy condition (F0); there were no false alarms. When diagnosing broken
    rotor bars and bearing faults (F6 and F7), the algorithm performed with 100% accuracy.
    However, the performance for the stator faults needs further analysis: while faults
    F1 and F3 are diagnosed with the success rates of 97% and 100%, faults F2, F4,
    and F5 were identified less reliably. The algorithm was able to diagnose the F2
    stator fault in only 57% of the cases. In 43% of the cases, the algorithm misdiagnosed
    F2, either as healthy or as the other similar stator faults F1 and F5. This was
    because F2, as the least severe fault, was the most difficult to diagnose. The
    algorithm was also unable to distinguish between fault modes F4 and F5, in 20%
    and 13% of the cases, respectively. F5 was also mistakenly diagnosed as other
    stator faults phase one bypassed in 10% of the cases. This result indicates that
    in the case of loading conditions lower than those seen in the training datasets,
    the algorithm can accurately determine the type of fault, however it is unable
    to accurately ascertain the severity of the fault. TABLE II Test Case B: Lowest
    Load and No Noise C. Test Case C: Highest Load With Noise Test Case C used datasets
    recorded for the highest loading conditions with background noise as the test
    set, with no data from this loading condition being considered in the training.
    This test case investigates the performance of the algorithm for loading conditions
    exceeding those considered in the training set and for unique environmental conditions,
    specifically when the background noise is at increased levels. The results are
    shown in Table III. The correct diagnosis of the healthy motor was 100%, as well
    as the diagnosis for F1, F4, F5, F6, and F7. In case of stator fault F2, there
    is a 2% missed alarm rate. In case of stator fault F3, the algorithm misdiagnoses
    F3 as F4 in 8% of the cases. These phenomena are similar to those observed in
    Test Case A: the stator faults are less severe and less easy to diagnose. Due
    to fault similarities, the algorithm can sometimes misdiagnose stator fault severities
    or confuse them with the healthy motor. The F1 score is 99.88%, which is even
    higher than the random split test case. TABLE III Test Case C: Highest Load With
    Noise D. Principal Components The number of principal components is shown in Table
    IV for each signal type together with the variance explained to complement the
    results in the above-presented test cases. In case of the random split in Test
    Case A, the variance explained by the chosen principal components is always above
    90%. In case of Test Case B and C, the number of chosen principal components is
    less than for Test Case A. This is due to the specific loading and noise conditions
    chosen for the test sets. TABLE IV Number of Principal Components and Variance
    Explained The first few principal components have been analyzed for all signal
    types to determine if there is any feature that dominates the principal component
    coefficients in the loading matrix. It was found that there was no single feature
    that would stand out for any signal type, therefore the importance of PCA for
    correlation reduction is further confirmed. Fig. 4 shows the first principal components
    of the five signal types, for all observations through the 58 datasets. The principal
    component values were obtained from the normalized feature values as described
    in Section II-D. In comparison to Fig. 3, where the rms of the five signal types
    are shown, it may be observed that the load dependence of the signals is less
    evident in the principal components. This further justifies the application of
    PCA for problems where the analyzed problem contains data from several loading
    conditions. Fig. 4. First principal components of the 5 different signal types,
    for all observations through the 58 datasets, the rms of the current is given
    as reference for the loading conditions. Show All Fig. 5 presents the histograms
    and underlying Gaussian distributions of the first principal component of the
    vibration signal by fault conditions. The distributions for each fault types have
    distinct mean and variance values and are not significantly different from Gaussian
    distributions. It can be observed that F6 and F7 are the most distinguishable
    from F0, whereas the other stator faults have overlaps with F0. It should be noted
    that F0 shows the evidence of multimodal behavior. This is due to the additional
    background noise incorporated to investigate the influence of different environmental
    conditions on the accuracy of diagnosis. However, as shown in Sections V-A–V-C,
    this noise did not significantly influence the resulting likelihood calculations.

    component of the vibration signal by fault conditions. Show All E. Single-Stage
    Data Fusion A comparison of the performance of the two-stage approach relative
    to a more standard single-stage approach, where sensors are not separated according
    to type, but instead all fused in a single stage, was performed. The total 3480
    observations were randomly split according to the conventional 70–30% partition
    to training set and test set. The random split was applied 100 times to a single-stage
    approach and the averaged results are shown in Table V. The results show that
    the performance of the single-stage algorithm significantly drops compared to
    the results of the two-stage method shown in Table I. The most significant difference
    appears in the reduced successful detection of the healthy motor, with the single-stage
    approach yielding false alarms in 91% of test cases. The F1 score is 92%. TABLE
    V Single-Stage Data Fusion F. Comparison of Results With SVM To provide a quantitative
    comparison with another classifier, the proposed PCA and two-stage Bayesian method
    is compared with the well-known SVM. Test Case A, B, and C are repeated using
    the default fitcecoc MATLAB implementation of the SVM for multiclass problems
    with one against one classification strategy and a linear kernel function. The
    F1 scores are compared. Similarly to the investigation described in Section V-F,
    the SVM was applied in a single stage. A 70-30% data split was applied and repeated
    100 times resulting in a 99.96% F1 score for Test Case A. This result is 0.64%
    better than that of the proposed method. For Test Case B, the F1 score for the
    SVM was 96.15%, which is 1.84% below than what was achieved with the newly proposed
    method. For Test Case C, the F1 score for the SVM was 97.8%, which is 2.08% below
    than what was achieved with the newly proposed method. While the performance of
    the two approaches is comparable, an advantage of PCA and two-stage Bayesian method
    lies in its transparency and modularity. Furthermore, the method also provided
    a marginally improved performance in the case of environmental and loading conditions
    not contained in the training set, as shown in Test Cases B and C. G. Signal Types
    Separately Versus Two-Stage Fusion Table VI shows the performance of only considering
    a single-stage fusion of features from a single-signal type, for the random split
    Test Case A. For comparison, the equivalent performance from the two-stage approach,
    which fuses the data from all sensors types in the global fusion stage, is also
    given. Results are given in terms of proportion of correct diagnoses, which are
    equivalent to the values on the diagonal of the previously presented results (see
    Tables I–III). It is evident that the two-stage data fusion of multiple signal
    types outperforms the equivalent results when only considering a single-signal
    type. This is due to the fact that the different sensor types have different strengths
    and weaknesses. For example, it may be observed that the analysis based only on
    vibration signals accurately diagnosed the mechanical bearing fault F7 in 100%
    of test cases, but was only able to diagnose an electrical stator fault, such
    as F1, in 92% of cases. In contrast, when only current signals were considered,
    stator fault F1 was diagnosed correctly in 98% of cases, but bearing fault F7
    was only diagnosed correctly in 96% of cases. When the two signals are fused,
    the conditional probabilities in the global confusion matrix effectively gives
    greater weight to vibration signals and less weight to current signals when diagnosing
    mechanical faults and vice versa in the case of diagnosing electrical faults.
    This leverages the strengths of each sensor type for fault monitoring and minimizes
    the impact of the weaknesses. TABLE VI Proportion of Correct Diagnoses for Each
    Fault Type When Considering Each Signal Individually and After Two-Stage Fusion
    SECTION VI. Discussion In this section, the results and the structure of the algorithm
    are discussed further, highlighting the observed strengths and weaknesses of the
    algorithm. A. Implementation and Constraints The training of the method takes
    place offline using historical datasets containing healthy and faulty data. Once
    the model is trained, diagnosis can be performed either online or offline. By
    applying a sliding window of the same size as used for training, the new sensor
    measurements can be fed into the two-stage Bayesian classifier online after the
    feature extraction and PCA steps have been performed. The width of the window
    could be different based on the nature of the monitored system, the extracted
    features, and the data available. The computational complexity of the classifier
    is proportional to the number of principal components retained and the number
    of fault modes monitored. The computational complexity of the feature extraction
    and PCA step depends on the number of features extracted and the size of the sliding
    window. For a better representation of the original feature space, nonlinear multivariate
    methods, such as kernel PCA [33], could be explored in the future instead of the
    currently used linear PCA. While it falls out of the scope of this paper, it should
    also be noted that the features used as inputs to the method may also be refined
    according to state of the art signal processing and feature extraction methods
    so that they may better discriminate between different health states. Thus, the
    accuracy and reliability of the approach would likely be improved further. In
    (4) and (8), the likelihoods might result in very small values if the number of
    features m, the number of sensors N, or the number of fault cases M is large.
    To avoid numerical problems, a logarithmic formulation might be considered. B.
    Algorithm Validation In Section V, three different algorithm validation test cases
    were presented by splitting the data into different training sets, test sets,
    and validation sets. It has been shown that for small datasets, the simple split-sample
    estimates can be biased and cross validation is more suitable for the prediction
    assessment of the classifiers [34]. In the case of a two-stage method, cross validation
    is unfeasible due to the increase in the number of computational steps associated
    with the addition of the global fusion stage and the use of a validation set.
    Specifically, relative to a simple single-stage fusion, when implementing cross
    validation on a two-stage approach, the method becomes n2 more computationally
    expensive, where n is the number of the observations, as both the local and the
    global stages have to be trained using separate training sets. In this paper,
    a pragmatic split-sample method was considered. It is also foreseen that such
    an approach would be applicable for applications of the method with larger volumes
    of datasets available. In the future, increases in computing power might also
    allow the cross-validation approach to be feasibly applied. C. Naïve Bayes Classifier
    Using Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) The GNB classifier is a parametric method
    that assumes a normal distribution of the observation variables. The more the
    distribution of the observation variables differs from the normal distribution,
    the less accurate the method is. One possible way to eliminate this Gaussian assumption
    is to use a naïve Bayes classifier with KDE, where the probability density function
    of the features are estimated using a nonparametric kernel distribution. Such
    an approach can be used when there is no prior knowledge regarding the distribution
    of the data, no assumptions are made, or a parametric distribution cannot describe
    the data. Tests conducted using such a naïve Bayes classifier with KDE, with the
    same random split as described in Test Case A, yielded comparable results to the
    GNB classifier. The naïve Bayes classifier with KDE resulted in correct classification
    rates in the ±2% range compared to the results in Table I, whereas the F1 score
    is 99.64%, which is 0.32% better compared to the results in Table I. However,
    when applying KDE, the computation time was two magnitudes greater for the local
    stage than for the case of the GNB classifier. It took 4.277 s for the original
    method to train the local stage and obtain the confusion matrixes for the vibration
    signals, whereas the same computation took 351.78 s with KDE. The processing hardware
    was an Intel Core i5-4300U, 1.9 GHz. D. Two-Stage Data Fusion Without PCA While
    not the primary focus of this paper, it is worth noting that an investigation
    into the importance of incorporating the PCA step into the algorithm was also
    performed. It was observed that when the PCA step was omitted from the algorithm,
    all test cases, including fault cases, were subsequently diagnosed as being healthy
    (F0). This was due to the load dependence of the features. This observation indicates
    that a PCA step, or similar, ensures that the algorithm is robust against changing
    loading and environmental conditions. E. Advantages of the Method The preceding
    sections provide quantifiable comparisons of the performance of the algorithm
    when including the novel steps of applying a GNB classifier and splitting the
    approach into two stages, relative to the cases when the steps are omitted. Due
    to the multitude of ways of properly designing and tuning various algorithms,
    it is unfeasible to perform similarly rigorous quantitative comparisons to benchmark
    the method relative to other data-driven fault detection methods. However, qualitative
    comparisons, which can guide design decisions at an early stage of the analytics
    development process, can be made. The main advantages of the proposed method are
    its transparency and modularity. In contrast to many other data-driven fault diagnosis
    methods, such as SVMs or neural networks, the decision-making process of the algorithm
    is easily back traceable from the global predictions to the inputs of the local
    stage to identify how the different sensors reacted to a fault. Such transparency
    is important for cases where the algorithm will be used to support maintenance
    decisions. While in this paper, only MAP probabilities were considered, in practice,
    the Bayesian sensor fusion approach allows the results to be presented in the
    form of likelihoods, showing the probability of each fault condition being present.
    Again, this additional insight can support maintenance decisions. The modularity
    of the approach, achieved by splitting the data fusion into two stages, also offers
    further advantages when considering practical implementation. In the case of a
    sensor being removed from a system, there is no need to retrain the whole model,
    as the removed sensor type can easily be omitted from the decision-level fusion.
    This is not possible for other fault diagnosis methods that only consider feature-level
    data fusion. Similarly, additional sensor types may be readily incorporated into
    the analysis with limited requirements for retraining. Recently, a trend of monitoring
    the health of components via signals recorded from connected elements, for example,
    monitoring gearboxes and bearings via electrical signals recorded from connected
    electrical motors, has emerged [35], [36]. Such emerging methods could also easily
    be incorporated into the algorithm, serving as an additional source of information
    for further improving the accuracy of diagnosis. SECTION VII. Conclusion In this
    paper, the performance of a newly proposed PCA and two-stage Bayesian sensor fusion
    method was evaluated under various test scenarios. The algorithm was shown to
    be able to diagnose stator faults, broken rotor bar faults, and bearing faults
    in induction motors, with low false and missed alarm rates. The algorithm also
    proved its ability to diagnose faults under different loading and environmental
    conditions. In addition to discussing the several advantages of the presented
    method, the limitations of the method were also highlighted. For example, it was
    shown that the method is capable of correctly distinguishing different types of
    fault, however, to consistently distinguish between different fault severities,
    adequate training sets are required at comparable loading conditions. In the future,
    the algorithm can potentially be extended so that it may be used not only with
    steady-state signals. Additionally, the performance of the method may be refined
    by further tailoring the extracted features to the monitored system. It was shown
    that by fusing data recorded from different sensor types, the proposed method
    is capable of diagnosing both mechanical and electrical faults. In the future,
    the algorithm should also be tested for other fault detection and condition-monitoring
    scenarios, for example, in process-monitoring applications. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The

    Abstract Scientific measurements from single or multiple sensors are usually incomplete
    and uncertain. A process making use of the concept of data fusion has been developed
    to try to encompass this problem by combining information from multiple sensors.
    The objective to synergistic use of information from multiple sources is to reduce
    uncertainty and increase the confidence level of a measurand. The implementation
    of data fusion to the field of NDT is relatively new. This paper summarizes the
    achievements of current research on data fusion applied to NDT. A theoretical
    data fusion strategy is described and experimental results generated from weld
    inspection are presented. Previous article View issue table of contents Next article

    and content Abstract Interpreting water quality data routinely generated for control
    and monitoring purposes in water distribution systems is a complicated task for
    utility managers. In fact, data for diverse water quality indicators (physico-chemical
    and microbiological) are generated at different times and at different locations
    in the distribution system. To simplify and improve the understanding and the
    interpretation of water quality, methodologies for aggregation and fusion of data
    must be developed. In this paper, the Dempster–Shafer theory also called theory
    of evidence is introduced as a potential methodology for interpreting water quality
    data. The conceptual basis of this methodology and the process for its implementation
    are presented by two applications. The first application deals with the interpretation
    of spatial water quality data fusion, while the second application deals with
    the development of water quality index based on key monitored indicators. Based
    on the obtained results, the authors discuss the potential contribution of theory
    of evidence as a decision-making tool for water quality management. Previous article

    operatorsWater distribution system 1. Introduction Monitoring and inspection of
    a system or a process may use more than one type of measurements and/or observations
    to describe the overall Condition State. The credibility of measurements to assess
    overall Condition State is important to be quantified for reliable decision-making.
    The data fusion is useful for an objective aggregation that can be reproducible
    and interpretable. Many infrastructure engineering problems, e.g., condition assessment
    of assets, production process quality control, and water quality monitoring require
    more than one performance indicator to define the Condition State. In addition,
    the aggregation of spatial or temporal observations of one (or more) performance
    indicator(s) is generally performed for reliable predictions. The data fusion
    refers to the scientific aggregation of the observations and measurements. In
    some cases, different data sets (e.g., measured by different types of sensors
    and probes, various water quality indicators) give information on various aspects
    of the system or a process by complementing each other. Therefore, the motivation
    is to collect more information for accurate prediction of Condition State. It
    is also possible that the information collected by various data sets can also
    be redundant if it deals with the same aspect of the problem, but it improves
    the reliability as one measurement/observation is confirmed by the other. Complementing
    information and redundancy of data sets are the basis of data fusion applications
    in condition assessment of assets and water quality monitoring. Regular monitoring
    of raw water quality, treatment processes and water quality in the distribution
    systems are integral parts of total drinking water quality management for the
    implementation of a multi-barrier approach for maintaining high-quality tap water
    for consumers. Water distribution systems are subjected to adverse reactions and
    events that can change the high-quality water to unpalatable and unsafe for human
    consumption by the time it arrives at the tap of the consumer (LeChevallier et
    al., 1996). As water quality can change significantly in the distribution system,
    regular monitoring is even more essential to ensure that high-quality drinking
    water reaches the consumer. To monitor the quality of water in the distribution
    system, physical, chemical, and biological indicators are recorded from routine
    grab sampling, followed by an analysis in the laboratory or using portable kits
    in the field (APHA, AWWA, WPCF, 1995). Sensor technology exists that enables capturing
    some indicators through online monitoring rather than grab samples. This technology
    is continually evolving to encompass more types of water quality indicators. Some
    common water quality indicators used for water distribution are turbidity, residual
    disinfectant, pH, nitrates, phosphates, organic compounds, total/fecal coliforms,
    and heterotrophic bacteria (HPC) (Clark, 1994, Hunsinger and Zioglio, 2002, Coulibaly
    and Rodriguez, 2003). Water uses generate a large amount of water quality data
    by routine sampling to control and maintain the acceptable Condition State of
    water quality in the system. Information is gathered on diverse water quality
    indicators using different techniques (manual sampling or auto-samplers and subsequent
    laboratory analysis, or online monitoring with automatic analyzer equipment).
    To better understand and interpret the water quality data, the use of novel techniques
    that favour the fusion and the aggregation of data is required to be explored.
    In this paper, the application of Dempster–Shafer (D–S) theory or theory of evidence
    for interpretation of water quality in the distribution system is demonstrated
    with the help of two examples. The first example discusses the application of
    theory of evidence for water quality data fusion for the case of water samples
    collected at different locations in the distribution system at a given time (interpreting
    spatial information), which is equally valid for fusion of temporal data or combining
    both. The second example briefly discusses the application of D–S theory for developing
    water quality index (WQI) that helps in aggregating and interpreting water quality
    linguistically, but in a rational manner. 2. Dempster–Shafer theory for interpreting
    water quality monitoring data There are numerous techniques available for conducting
    data and knowledge and information fusion, and most common among them are Bayesian
    inference, Dempster–Shafer rule of combination, fuzzy rule-based inference, and
    neural networks (Roemer et al., 2001). The idea of evidence integration and accumulation
    of beliefs are commonly used in Bayesian inference, which implies that p(A) +
    p(¬A) = 1, i.e., the belief in a hypothesis A can be used to derive the belief
    in its complement (Alim, 1988). But “NOT A” is the missing evidence (lack of knowledge)
    that is dealt as equal noninformative priors (Principle of Insufficient Reason)
    in Bayesian inference instead of ignorance. Alim (1988) argued that “No evidence”
    is different from having the same degree of confidence in all hypotheses, which
    is the basic motivation behind D–S theory. Dempster–Shafer theory is a theory
    of evidence, which is based on classic work by Dempster (1968) and Shafer (1976).
    The D–S theory can be interpreted as a generalization of probability theory where
    probabilities are assigned to subsets as opposed to mutually exclusive singletons.
    The probability theory can associate evidence to only one possible event, whereas
    D–S theory determines the evidence to sets of events, i.e., if the evidence is
    sufficient enough to permit the assignment of probabilities to single event (singleton),
    the D–S theory inference reduces to the probabilistic formulation (Sentz and Ferson,
    2002). The D–S theory applications in civil and environmental engineering vary
    from slope stability (Binaghi et al., 1998), environmental decision-making (Chang
    and Wright, 1996, Attoh-Okine and Gibbons, 2001), seismic analysis (Alim, 1988),
    failure detection (Tanaka and Klir, 1999), biological surveillance of river water
    quality (Boyd et al., 1993), and remote sensing (Wang and Civco, 1994) to climate
    change (Luo and Caselton, 1997). Many more applications of D–S theory can be seen
    in detailed bibliography reported by Sentz and Ferson (2002). However, the potential
    for application of D–S theory in the drinking water industry, in particular for
    fusion and aggregation of water quality monitoring data in the distribution system,
    has not been investigated until now. In the following section, the concepts of
    D–S theory application will be introduced by means of an example of data fusion
    of monitoring information on water quality in the distribution system. 2.1. Basic
    concepts of Dempster–Shafer theory and application The frame of discernment Θ
    (also called universe of discourse) is defined as a set of mutually exclusive
    alternatives, which has 2Θ subsets in the domain. For example, if the frame of
    discernment Θ is a set {L, M, H} it may have 8 (=23) subsets. Three important
    concepts, namely, basic probability assignment (m or bpa), belief (bel), and plausibility
    (pl) functions are used in D–S theory. Alim (1988) summarized some basic features
    of the D–S theory as follows: • Evidence in the form of belief (or disbelief)
    is attributed to subsets in Θ; • As evidence accumulates, the hypothesis set tends
    to narrow down toward precise estimation of probability; and • Ignorance does
    not assume equal priors or uniformly distributed, rather it is assigned to frame
    of discernment Θ. For example, if some evidence “a” is attributed to subset “L”
    in Θ, the ignorance “1 − a” will not be equally distributed to “M” and “H”, rather
    it is assigned to Θ = {L, M, H}. Example 1 In this example, it is assumed that
    water quality in the distribution is reported qualitatively using three risk levels––low
    (L), medium (M) and high (H) from consumption viewpoint based on compliance of
    drinking water regulations. The frame of discernment, Θ = {L, M, H} contains 8
    subsets ϕ (a null set) {L}, {M}, {H}, {L, M}, {M, H}, {L, H}, and {L, M, H}. Therefore,
    depending on the evidence, water could be rated as low, medium, high, low or medium,
    low or high, medium or high, and low or medium or high (in case of complete ignorance).
    2.2. Basic probability assignment The basic probability assignment (bpa or m)
    is different from classical definition of probability and is defined by mapping
    over the interval [0, 1], where the null set m(ϕ) is “0” and the sum of the basic
    probability assignments m(A) in a given set A is “1”. The m(A) expresses the proportion
    of all relevant and available evidence that supports the claim that a particular
    element of Θ belongs to the set A but to no particular subset of A (Klir, 1995).
    For a given basic probability assignment m, every set for which m(A) ≠ 0 is called
    focal element. Formally, this description of m can be represented with the following
    equation: (1) Example 1 (Contd.): If the water utility manager reports with 60%
    confidence that water is of low risk quality and with 30% confidence that it is
    low or medium risk, the ignorance is therefore 10%. The focal elements of hypothesis
    A can be written as The basic probability assignments for remaining subsets will
    be zero. 2.3. Belief function The lower and upper bounds of an interval can be
    determined from the basic probability assignment, which contains the probability
    set bounded by two nonadditive measures belief and plausibility. The lower bound
    belief (bl) for a set A is defined as the sum of all the basic probability assignments
    of the proper subsets (B) of the set of interest A, i.e., B ⊆ A. The general relation
    between bpa and belief can be written as (2) The belief functions also follow
    these relationships (3) Example 1 (Contd.): The belief functions can be derived
    as 2.4. Plausibility function The upper bound, plausibility, is the summation
    of basic probability assignment of the sets B that intersect with the set of interest
    A, i.e., B ∩ (A) ≠ ϕ, and therefore it can be written as (4) The plausibility
    function can be related to belief function through a function called doubt, which
    is defined as the compliment of belief (5) In addition, the following relationships
    for belief and plausibility functions hold true in all circumstances (6) pl (
    A ) ⩾ bl ( A ) pl ( ϕ ) = 0 pl ( Θ ) = 1 pl ( ¬ A ) = 1 - bel ( A ) Example 1
    (Contd.): Continuing on the example, the plausibility function can be derived
    as follows pl ( A ) L = m ( A ) L + m ( A ) L , M + m ( A ) L , H + m ( A ) Θ
    = 1.0 pl ( A ) M = m ( A ) M + m ( A ) L , M + m ( A ) M , H + m ( A ) Θ = 0.4
    pl ( A ) H = m ( A ) H + m ( A ) L , H + m ( A ) M , H + m ( A ) Θ = 0.1 pl (
    A ) L , M = m ( A ) L + m ( A ) M + m ( A ) L , M + m ( A ) L , H + m ( A ) M
    , H + m ( A ) Θ = 1.0 pl ( A ) L , H = m ( A ) L + m ( A ) H + m ( A ) L , M +
    m ( A ) L , H + m ( A ) M , H + m ( A ) Θ = 1.0 pl ( A ) M , H = m ( A ) M + m
    ( A ) H + m ( A ) L , M + m ( A ) L , H + m ( A ) M , H + m ( A ) Θ = 0.4 pl (
    A ) L , M , H = m ( A ) M + m ( A ) M + m ( A ) H + m ( A ) L , M + m ( A ) L
    , H + m ( A ) M , H + m ( A ) Θ = 1.0 2.5. Belief interval The belief interval
    (U) represents a range in which true probability may lie. It can be determined
    by subtracting belief from plausibility. The narrow uncertainty band represents
    more precise probabilities. The probability is uniquely determined if bel(A) =
    pl(A) and for classical probability theory all probabilities are unique (Yager,
    1987). If U(A) has an interval [0, 1], it means that no information is available,
    but if the interval is [1, 1], then it means that A has been completely confirmed
    by m(A). Example 1 (Contd.): The uncertainty interval for the case at hand is
    U ( A ) L = [ 0.6 , 1.0 ] ; U ( A ) M = [ 0.0 , 0.4 ] ; U ( A ) H = [ 0.0 , 0.1
    ] U ( A ) L , M = [ 0.9 , 1.0 ] ; U ( A ) L , H = [ 0.6 , 1.0 ] ; U ( A ) M ,
    H = [ 0.0 , 0.4 ] ; and U ( A ) Θ = [ 1.0 , 1.0 ] 2.6. Dempster–Shafer rule of
    combination The purpose of data fusion is to summarize and simplify information
    rationally. The D–S theory assumes sources of information are independent. The
    multiple sources of information in our context could be water quality samples
    collected at various points Sis in the distribution system at a given time “tj”.
    The D–S rule of combination can help in providing an overall picture of water
    quality at a given time “tj” in the distribution system. Similarly, evidences
    about the water quality can be aggregated temporally (samples collected at various
    times tjs) at a given sampling point Si using D–S rule of combination. Alim (1988)
    described that the “combined” belief represents not only the total belief in a
    set A and all of its subsets but also takes into account the contribution of different
    sources of evidence that focus on A. The D–S inference uses trade-off type combination
    operators and less information is assumed than that of Bayesian inference by compromising
    on precision, but Bayesian theory does not express any uncertainty associated
    with it and uses Principle of Insufficient Reason for inference (Sentz and Ferson,
    2002). The D–S rule of combination strictly emphasizes on the agreement between
    multiple sources and ignores all the conflicting evidence through normalization.
    A strict conjunctive logic through AND operator (estimated by a product of two
    probabilities) is employed in combination of evidence. The D–S combination rule
    determines the joint m1–2 from the aggregation of two basic probability assignments
    m1 and m2 by following equation: (7) m 1 – 2 ( A ) = ∑ B ∩ C = A m 1 ( B ) m 2
    ( C ) 1 - K when A ≠ ϕ ; and m 1 – 2 ( ϕ ) = 0 where (8) K = ∑ B ∩ C = ϕ m 1 (
    B ) m 2 ( C ) where K is the degree of conflict in two sources of evidences. The
    denominator (1 − K) in Eq. (7) is a normalization factor, which helps aggregation
    by completely ignoring the conflicting evidence. The above equations can also
    written as (9) m 1 – 2 ( A ) = ∑ B ∩ C = A m 1 ( B ) m 2 ( C ) ∑ B ∩ C ≠ ϕ m 1
    ( B ) m 2 ( C ) Example 1 (Contd.): Water quality is monitored at two locations
    Si (i = 1, 2) in the distribution system at a given time tj. The utility manager
    is interested in overall water quality in the distribution system at tj based
    on these two observations S1 and S2 m1(B)L = 0.6 m2(C)M = 0.4 m1(B)L,M = 0.3 and
    m2(C)M,H = 0.2 m1(B)Θ = 0.1 m2(C)Θ = 0.4 By applying D–S rule of combination on
    sources of information B and C, the following data is generated: Degree of conflict
    = K = 0.24 + 0.12 = 0.36, therefore normalization factor = 1 − K = 0.64 m 1 –
    2 ( A ) L = 0.24 / 0.64 = 0.38 ; m 1 – 2 ( A ) M = ( 0.12 + 0.06 + 0.04 ) / 0.64
    = 0.34 ; m 1 – 2 ( A ) H = 0.0 ; m 1 – 2 ( A ) L , M = 0.12 / 0.64 = 0.19 ; m
    1 – 2 ( A ) L , H = 0.0 ; m 1 – 2 ( A ) M , H = 0.02 / 0.64 = 0.03 ; m 1 – 2 (
    A ) Θ = 0.04 / 0.64 = 0.06 Similarly, belief and plausibility functions and belief
    interval can be determined by using corresponding equation described earlier.
    Subsets m1–2(A) bel1–2(A) pl1–2(A) U1–2(A) ϕ 0.0 0.0 1.0 [0.0, 1.0] {L} 0.38 0.38
    0.63 [0.38, 0.63] {M} 0.34 0.34 0.62 [0.34, 0.62] {H} 0.0 0.0 0.09 [0.0, 0.09]
    {L, M} 0.19 0.91 1.0 [0.91, 1.0] {L, H} 0.0 0.38 0.66 [0.38, 0.66] {M, H} 0.03
    0.34 0.62 [0.34, 0.62] Θ 0.06 1.0 1.0 [1.0, 1.0] From the above analysis it can
    be noticed that based on evidence from two samples, the water quality can be rated
    as low or medium. 2.7. Modified combination rules Serious drawbacks have been
    identified in D–S rule of combination. Zadeh (1984) presented an intriguing example
    of a patient who is diagnosed by two physicians A and B. The physician A diagnosed
    that the patient has a disease x with the 99% probability (confidence) and has
    only 1% probability of disease y. The physician B diagnosed that the patient has
    a disease z with the 99% probability and has only 1% probability of disease y.
    The frame of discernment for the diseases is Θ = {x, y, z}. Using D–S rule of
    combination, following results will be obtained: Degree of conflict = K = 0.9999
    ∴ Normalization factor = 1 - K = 0.0001 m x ( disease ) = 0.0 ; m y ( disease
    ) = 1.0 ; and m z ( disease ) = 0.0 These results are counterintuitive, as 99.99%
    evidence was neglected due to conflict. Sentz and Ferson (2002) have provided
    an excellent review of various methods and techniques to resolve this discrepancy.
    Most common methods are Yager’s modified Dempster’s rule (1987), Inagaki’s Unified
    Combination rule (1991), and Zhang’s Center Combination rule (Zhang, 1994). 2.8.
    Aggregation operators The triangular norms (t-norms) are a class of operators
    introduced for the development of a probabilistic generalization of the theory
    of metric spaces (Ramik and Vlach, 2001). The t-norms are used extensively in
    fuzzy set theory. They provide a tool for defining various types of intersection
    of fuzzy sets and expressing conjunctive logic. The t-norms, satisfy the axioms
    of commutativity, associativity, monotonicity, and boundary condition (Ramik and
    Vlach, 2001). Triangular conorms (t-conorms) provide a tool for defining various
    types of union of fuzzy sets and expressing conjunctive logic. These operators
    also satisfy all the axioms of commutativity, associativity, monotonicity, and
    boundary condition (Ramik and Vlach, 2001). The t-norms and t-conorms provide
    a range of operations for the aggregation of fuzzy sets (and probability theory).
    Aggregation or fusion is done through satisfying several or few criteria (performance
    indicators). When the requirement is such that all (or several) criteria have
    to be met, t-norms (and-type operators) are typically used; but when the requirement
    is such that only few criteria have to be met (out of many), t-conorms (or-type
    operators) are typically used. Consequently, on the scale of strictness of criteria,
    the t-norms represent the more strict criteria because being intersection-based
    they require conjunction (and-type operator) of aggregation, while the t-conorms
    represent more relaxed criteria, as being union-based they require disjunction
    (or-type operator) of aggregation (Sentz and Ferson, 2002). Fig. 1 illustrates
    the entire range of aggregation operators from very strict to very relaxed. Note
    that t-norms and t-conorms are only two classes out of an entire range of aggregation
    operations. Average-type (e.g., arithmetic mean, ordered weighted average (OWA)
    operators) or compromising/compensatory operators lie in between two extremes.

    2002). 2.9. Disjunctive operator for Dempster–Shafer rule Traditional D–S rule
    of combination does not all allow to fuse the information from completely conflicting
    sources because the normalization factor (1 − K) becomes zero in Eq. (7). Yager
    (2004) addressed this issue and proposed the use of disjunctive operators. Eq.
    (9) can be modified as (10) m 1 – 2 ( A ) = ∑ B ∩ C = A max [ m 1 ( B ) , m 2
    ( C ) ] ∑ B ∩ C ≠ ϕ max [ m 1 ( B ) , m 2 ( C ) ] Other disjunctive operators
    (see Fig. 1) than “max” can also be used in Eq. (10). In the physician–patient
    example discussed by Zadeh (1984), the new diagnosis will be mx(disease) = 0.497,
    my(disease) = 0.005, and mz(disease) = 0.497. Example 1 (Contd.): The disjunctive
    (maximum) operator (Eq. (10)) is used in modified combination rule. After estimating
    the basic probability assignments, the belief and plausibility functions are determined
    as described before in Eqs. (2), (4), respectively. Subsets m1–2(A) bel1–2(A)
    pl1–2(A) U1–2(A) ϕ 0.0 0.0 1.0 [0.0, 1.0] {L} 0.35 0.35 0.53 [0.35, 0.53] {M}
    0.28 0.28 0.50 [0.28, 0.50] {H} 0.10 0.10 0.28 [0.10, 0.28] {L, M} 0.09 0.72 0.90
    [0.72, 0.90] {L, H} 0.05 0.50 0.72 [0.50, 0.72] {M, H} 0.09 0.47 0.65 [0.47, 0.65]
    Θ 0.04 1.00 1.00 [1.0, 1.0] From the above analysis it can be noticed that based
    on evidence from two samples, the water quality can be rated as low or medium.
    2.10. Combining sources of varying credibility The approaches described before
    implicitly assume that all sources of information are equally credible. Sampling
    locations for monitoring water quality may be representative of a part of water
    distribution system, e.g., if one sample is collected from main distribution line
    and the other is collected from a minor line, the influence zones of both samples
    are different. Similarly, if the samples are collected at the same point when
    two different flow conditions prevail, the evidence of water quality also needs
    to be adjusted based on flow conditions. Similarly, if water utility staff with
    different levels of expertise collects water samples, the observations need to
    be adjusted based on their credibility. Yager (2004) discussed the credibility
    issue in detail and suggested a credibility transformation function. This approach
    discounts the evidence with a credibility factor (α) and distributes remaining
    evidence (1 − α) equally among elements (n) of frame of discernment. (11) m (
    A ) a = m ( A ) • α + 1 - α n where α is the Credibility factor and n is the focal
    elements in frame of discernment. Example 1 (Contd.): Assume that credibility
    adjustment factors assigned to two samples collected at different locations in
    the distribution are αB = 1.0 and αC = 0.5. These factors represent the confidence
    of the collected information. The modified evidences will be m1(B)L = 0.6 m2(C)M
    = 0.36 m1(B)L,M = 0.3 and m2(C)M,H = 0.1 m1(B)Θ = 0.1 m2(C)L = 0.17 m2(C)H = 0.17
    and m2(C)Θ = 0.2 As credibility of first evidence is 100%, therefore no adjustment
    is required for m1(B), but evidence m2(C) is only 50% credible, the evidence is
    adjusted as below: m 2 ( C ) M = 0.4 • 0.5 + ( 1 - 0.5 ) / 3 = 0.36 m 2 ( C )
    L = 0.0 • 0.5 + ( 1 - 0.5 ) / 3 = 0.17 m 2 ( C ) H = 0.0 • 0.5 + ( 1 - 0.5 ) /
    3 = 0.17 m 2 ( C ) M , H = 0.2 • 0.5 = 0.1 m 2 ( C ) Θ = 0.4 • 0.5 = 0.2 It is
    important to note that as α → 0 (i.e., confidence for given evidence), the inference
    tends to become Baysian, i.e., Principle of Insufficient Reason is applied. A
    limiting case for evidence is m2(C)Θ = 1.0, i.e., complete ignorance in D–S framework.
    If the credibility factor α = 0, the adjusted evidence will become m 2 ( C ) L
    = 0 • 0 + ( 1 - 0 ) / 3 = 0.33 , similarly m 2 ( C ) M = 0.33 and m 2 ( C ) H
    = 0.33 The adjusted evidences can be combined using modified D–S rule of combination
    as described earlier. Subsets m1–2(A)a bel1–2(A)a pl1–2(A)a U1–2(A)a ϕ 0.0 0.0
    1.0 [0.0, 1.0] {L} 0.42 0.42 0.61 [0.42, 0.61] {M} 0.26 0.26 0.42 [0.26, 0.42]
    {H} 0.13 0.13 0.24 [0.13, 0.24] {L, M} 0.08 0.76 0.87 [0.76, 0.87] {L, H} 0.03

    1.0] As noticed from the above analysis that belief of water quality being low
    is the highest among other Condition States (medium and high), therefore based
    on the available information the utility manager (or decision-maker) may conclude
    that water quality in the distribution is acceptable. But if the utility manager
    wants to be more confident about his judgement, he (she) will conclude that water
    quality is low or medium because the belief of subset {L, M} is 76%. In the above
    example, we allowed a subset {L, H}, that does not contain two contiguous states.
    But in reality, generally only two contiguous states are possible, i.e., in our
    case {L, M} or {M, H}. If the decision-maker wants to increase the confidence
    for his (her) judgement concerning water quality Condition State he (she) will
    collect more sample (evidence). In this way he (she) can narrow down the uncertainty
    and increase the confidence in his (her) judgment. 3. Dempster–Shafer theory application
    for developing water quality index Water quality is generally defined by a collection
    of upper and lower limits on selected possible contaminants (Maier, 1999). Water
    quality indicators can be classified into three broad categories: physical, chemical,
    and microbiological contaminants. Within each class, a number of quality indicators
    are considered. The acceptability of water quality for its intended use depends
    on the magnitude of these indicators (Swamee and Tyagi, 2000) and is often governed
    by regulations (US EPA, 2001). The physical, chemical, and microbiological processes
    occurring in drinking water distribution pipes are numerous and complex. A wealth
    of literature is available on water quality represented by an aggregate index
    using various statistical and mathematical techniques. Swamee and Tyagi (2000)
    have discussed in detail the pros and cons of different techniques and approaches
    available for evaluating the overall water quality index (WQI). Sinha et al. (1994)
    combined pH, chloride concentration, turbidity, residual chlorine, conductivity,
    and MPN (most probable number––a bacterial counting technique) into a single water
    quality index through a weighting technique to represent an overall water quality
    at various nodes in the distribution system. Sadiq et al. (2004) have suggested
    a fuzzy-based framework for aggregative risk analysis of water quality failure
    in the distribution system. Recently, Sadiq and Rodriguez (2004a) proposed a risk-based
    fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique for aggregating effects of disinfection byproducts
    found in drinking water. The WQI is a systematic way of interpreting measurements
    and (or) observations of water quality, which helps managers to describe a Condition
    State or to share and communicate with the public in a consistent manner. The
    WQI provides a general means of comparing and ranking water quality. Traditionally,
    WQI encompasses factors like number of indicators not meeting the regulation,
    frequency of a particular indicator by which it is not meeting the requirement
    in a given sampling protocol, and amount by which indicators are violating the
    regulatory requirements. These three factors are combined to form the WQI, which
    can be interpreted by predefined qualitative ranking system. For overall water
    quality based on various indicators, credibility adjustment is required for each
    indicator for its contribution. For example, if the water quality is defined by
    turbidity, total coliforms, residual chlorine, and aesthetic indicators (taste,
    odour, colour), the violation of turbidity from its threshold value has lesser
    consequences and impacts with respect to microbial violations. Different credibility
    weights need to be defined for each indicator representing its body of evidence
    in defining overall water quality. Another useful application of D–S rule of combination
    is to develop a WQI that integrates various water quality indicators (of noncommensurate
    units) as a single entity. Example 2 will illustrate such application for the
    case of aggregation of three important physico-chemical and microbiological indicators
    of water quality in the distribution system. Example 2 The application of disinfection
    agents in drinking water reduces the microbial risk but poses chemical risk in
    the form of their byproducts. A risk–risk trade-off is required to optimize the
    dose and type of disinfection practices. Three water quality indicators––trihalomethanes
    (THMs), residual chlorine (RC), and heterotrophic plate counts (HPCs) (indicator
    for microbial presence)––are identified for evaluating the overall water quality
    in the distribution system. The water quality is defined by five risk classes––very
    low (VL), low (L), medium (M), high (H), and very high (VH). Therefore, the frame
    of discernment is Θ = {VL, L, M, H, VH}. These water quality indicators are defined
    by these five classes of risk (Fig. 2). The thresholds shown in Fig. 2 for Example
    2 were established based on water quality standards and based on authors’ experience
    with the water quality in Canadian distribution systems. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Basic probability assignments for water quality indicators.  • The
    bpa for a given water quality indicator is determined by mapping on corresponding
    triangular functions as shown in Fig. 2. The qualitative scale is defined in such
    a way that bpa for only two risk classes are obtained. Therefore, for any value
    of water quality indicator, maximum two focal elements are possible. In this setting,
    subsets with two or more elements are not allowed. For a water quality indicator,
    bpa is represented by a 5-tuple set {VL, L, M, H, VH}. • For a given water sample,
    the bpa for three indicators are represented as follow: m(RC)VL m(HPC)VL m(THM)VL
    m(RC)L m(HPC)L m(THM)L m(RC)M m(HPC)M m(THM)M m(RC)H m(HPC)H m(THM)H m(RC)VH m(HPC)VH
    m(THM)VH • The credibility factors α are assigned to these indicators based on
    expert judgement α RC = 0.9 α HPC = 0.5 α THM = 0.8 • The bpa for each water quality
    indicator is adjusted by credibility factors α using Eq. (11). The adjusted bpa
    for water quality indicators are aggregated using modified disjunctive operator
    D–S rule of combination. • The belief and plausibility functions and belief interval
    are determined.  Example 2 (Contd.): A water sample was collected from distribution
    system and tested for residual chlorine, THMs, and HPCs. RC = 0.09 mg / l ; HPC
    = 62 / 100 ml ; and THM = 118 ppb The bpa for each water quality indicator is
    derived from Fig. 2 m(RC)VL = 0.0 m(HPC)VL = 0.0 m(THM)VL = 0.0 m(RC)L = 0.0 m(HPC)L
    = 0.48 m(THM)L = 0.0 m(RC)M = 0.0 m(HPC)M = 0.52 m(THM)M = 0.0 m(RC)H = 0.87 m(HPC)H
    = 0.0 m(THM)H = 0.0 m(RC)VH = 0.13 m(HPC)VH = 0.0 m(THM)VH = 1.0 The bpa is adjusted
    with respect to their credibility factors. The evidence is modified to m(RC)VL
    = 0.02 m(HPC)VL = 0.10 m(THM)VL = 0.04 m(RC)L = 0.02 m(HPC)L = 0.34 m(THM)L =
    0.04 m(RC)M = 0.02 m(HPC)M = 0.36 m(THM)M = 0.04 m(RC)H = 0.80 m(HPC)H = 0.10
    m(THM)H = 0.04 m(RC)VH = 0.14 m(HPC)VH = 0.10 m(THM)VH = 0.84 The adjusted bpa
    for water quality indicators can be aggregated using disjunctive operator D–S
    rule of combination. bpa Belief Plausibility m(WQ)VL = 0.04 bl(WQ)VL = 0.04 pl(WQ)VL
    = 0.04 m(WQ)L = 0.14 bl(WQ)L = 0.14 pl(WQ)L = 0.14 m(WQ)M = 0.15 bl(WQ)M = 0.15
    pl(WQ)M = 0.15 m(WQ)H = 0.33 bl(WQ)H = 0.33 pl(WQ)H = 0.33 m(WQ)VH = 0.34 bl(WQ)VH
    = 0.34 pl(WQ)VH = 0.34 The probability mass function of risk can be plotted using
    belief function. The universe of discourse of risk scale is soft in nature (Fig.
    3). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Probability mass function of risk.
    Utility values can be assigned to soft items to determine the water quality index
    as a crisp output. Yang and Xu (2002) discussed a probabilistic method to determine
    the utility values for soft items in a heuristic way. These values can also be
    determined through linear optimization based on expert judgement. Here, an arbitrary
    linear function is proposed to estimate the crisp WQI (a surrogate for representing
    risk) and all five classes of risk are assigned utility values as follow: (12)
    WQI = u 2 0 [ bl ( WQ ) VH ] + u 2 1 [ bl ( WQ ) H ] + u 2 2 [ bl ( WQ ) M ] +
    u 2 3 [ bl ( WQ ) L ] + u 2 4 [ bl ( WQ ) VL ] where utility coefficient u is
    assumed ≈1.3. New regulations for the allowable concentrations of disinfection
    byproducts are being developed in the US and elsewhere for drinking water supplies.
    Disinfection reduces the risk from microbial infections, but may pose cancer and
    other risks from the DBPs (THMs are the most commonly identified DBPs). Many other
    DBPs, however, remain to be identified and the public health significance of these
    is unknown. Society is facing a difficult trade-off between established (known)
    microbial risks due to pathogens and more uncertain (unknown) risks from DBPs.
    In the case of evaluating the risk–risk trade-offs in drinking water, the competing
    risks must be assessed within a common framework. Example 2 (Contd.): The risk–risk
    trade-off for HPCs (a microbial indicator) and THMs (representative DBP) is established
    at different levels of residual chlorine concentration in Fig. 4a–d. The WQI is
    used as a surrogate for risk, estimated using Eq. (12). Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Water quality index (WQI) representing risk profiles at various
    residual chlorine levels. The analysis is performed for 0, 0.2, 0.5, and 4 mg/l
    residual chlorine concentrations. When levels of residual chlorine are not detectable,
    the WQI varied approximately from 0.6 to 1.0. Higher risks were observed for even
    very low HPC and THM concentrations (Fig. 4a), because the minimal levels of residual
    chlorine are necessary to provide safeguard against microbial contamination. But
    when the residual concentration is increased to 0.2, 0.5, and 4.0 mg/l, the WQI
    varied from 0.2 to approximately 0.8 (Fig. 4b–d), which is comparatively lower
    than the first case. The three-dimensional characteristic risk curves (e.g. Fig.
    4) can be established for various water quality indicators, which are able to
    predict levels of any particular indicator (e.g., HPCs) that are required to achieve
    acceptable risk under given conditions. For example, for an acceptable risk (WQI)
    of 0.25, the residual chlorine in the distribution system is reported to be in
    the range of 0.2–0.5 mg/l and THM potential is estimated (using regression or
    kinetic models, see Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004b) to be in the range of 25–50 ppb,
    and the HPC levels should not exceed 200/100 ml. This concept can be extended
    to more water quality indicators. 4. Summary and conclusions In this paper, the
    evidence theory was introduced as an innovative methodology that can be used for
    simplifying and improving the understanding of data generated through routine
    water quality monitoring in distribution systems. Two examples were presented
    that support the potential application of theory of evidence for data fusion,
    namely, interpretation of overall water quality in the distribution system based
    on spatial data collected at different sampling locations and development of WQI.
    For the first example, additional aspects should be investigated in the future,
    such as the impact of the uncertainty on the confidence of the decision-maker’s
    judgement (according to the amount of information available, in this case the
    number and the frequency of spatial distribution of samples collected). For the
    second example, additional information should be considered in the future to develop
    more robust indices, i.e., additional water quality indicators (e.g., pathogenic
    indicators such as coliforms and other disinfection byproducts like haloacetic
    acids), operational parameters (e.g., pressures, flow rates, reservoir level control,
    etc.), and data on the distribution system infrastructure (e.g., pipe breakage
    rate and replacement, pipe flushing etc.). Theory of evidence can efficiently
    deal with the difficulties related to host of indicators describing water quality,
    with spatial and temporal dimensions of distribution system, where redundancy
    of information is routinely observed as well as the credibility of available data
    is varied. Future research must focus on the implementation of decision-making
    tools using theory of evidence that can be adapted to specific water utility conditions
    and manager’s needs. The potential combination of theory of evidence with modeling
    techniques, such as linear and nonlinear time-series analysis, neural networks,
    and genetic algorithms, to predict the condition state of water quality must also
    be evaluated through future research efforts to implement more powerful decision-making
    tools. References Alim, 1988 S. Alim Application of Dempster–Shafer theory for

    Abstract:

    This paper is focused on detecting and analyzing the Distributed Denial of Service

    (DDoS) attacks in cloud computing environments. This type of attacks is often
    the

    source of cloud services disruptions. Our solution is to combine the evidences
    obtained

    from Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) deployed in the virtual machines (VMs)
    of

    the cloud systems with a data fusion methodology in the front-end. Speciﬁcally,
    when

    the attacks appear, the VM-based IDS will yield alerts, which will be stored into
    the

    Mysql database placed within the Cloud Fusion Unit (CFU) of the front-end server.

    We propose a quantitative solution for analyzing alerts generated by the IDSs,
    using

    the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) operations in 3-valued logic and the fault-tree

    analysis (FTA) for the mentioned ﬂooding attacks. At the last step, our solution
    uses

    the Dempsters combination rule to fuse evidence from multiple independent sources.

    Keywords: cloud computing, cloud security, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

    attacks, Intrusion Detection Systems, data fusion, Dempster-Shafer theory.

    Introduction

    Cloud computing technology is in continuous development and with numerous challenges

    regarding security. In this context, one of the main concerns for cloud computing
    is represented by

    the trustworthiness of cloud services. This problem requires prompt resolution
    because otherwise

    organizations adopting cloud services would be exposed to increased expenditures
    while at a

    greater risk.

    A survey conducted by International Data Corporation (IDC) in August 2008

    conﬁrms that security is the major barrier for the cloud users.

    There are two things that cloud service providers should guarantee all the time:
    connectivity

    and availability, and if there are not met, the entire organizations will suﬀer
    high costs [1].

    This paper is focused on detecting and analyzing Distributed Denial of Service
    (DDoS) attacks

    in cloud computing environment.

    This type of attacks is often the source of cloud services

    disruptions. One of the eﬃcient methods for detecting DDoS is to use the Intrusion
    Detection

    Systems (IDS), in order to assure usable cloud computing services [2]. However,
    IDS sensors

    have the limitations that they yield massive amount of alerts and produce high
    false positive

    rates and false negative rates [3].

    Detecting DDoS Attacks in Cloud Computing Environment

    71

    With regards to these IDS issues, our proposed solution aims to detect and analyze
    Dis-

    tributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in cloud computing environments, using
    Dempster-

    Shafer Theory (DST) operations in 3-valued logic and Fault-Tree Analysis (FTA)
    for each VM-

    based Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The basic idea is to obtain information
    from multiple

    sensors, which are deployed and conﬁgured in each virtual machine (VM). The obtained
    infor-

    mation is integrated in a data fusion unit, which takes the alerts from multiple
    heterogeneous

    sources and combines them using the Dempster’s combination rule. Our approach
    quantitatively

    represents the imprecision and eﬃciently utilizes it in IDS to reduce the false
    alarm rates.

    Speciﬁcally, our solution combines the evidences obtained from Intrusion Detection
    Systems

    (IDSs) deployed in the virtual machines (VMs) of the cloud system with a data
    fusion method-

    ology within the front-end.

    Our proposed solution can also solve the problem of analysing the logs generated
    by sensors,

    which seems to be a big issue [4].

    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: section 2 introduces Dempster-Shafer

    Theory. Section 3 presents the related work of IDS in Cloud Computing and the
    related work of

    IDS using data fusion. Section 4 introduces the proposed solution of detecting
    DDoS attacks in

    Cloud Computing. Finally, in section 5 the paper presents the concluding remarks.

    Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST)

    Dempster-Shafer Theory is established by two persons: Arthur Dempster, who introduced
    it

    in the 1960’s and Glenn Shafer, who developed it in the 1970’s [5].

    As an extension of Bayesian inference, Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) of Evidence
    is a

    powerful method in statistical inference, diagnostics, risk analysis and decision
    analysis. While

    in the Bayesian method probabilities are assigned only for single elements of
    the state space

    (Ω),in DST probabilities are assigned on mutually exclusive elements of the power
    sets of possible

    states [6], [7].

    According to DST method, for a given state space (Ω) the probability (called mass)
    is allo-

    cated for the set of all possible subsets of Ω, namely 2Ω elements.

    Consequently, the state space (Ω) is also called frame of discernment, whereas
    the assignment

    procedure of probabilities is called basic probability assignment (bpa) [6], [7],
    [8].

    We will apply the particular case of DST, i.e., the DST operations in 3-valued
    logic using the

    fault-tree analysis (FTA), adopted by Guth (1991) and also used in Popescu, et
    al. (2010).

    Thus, if a standard state space Ω is (True, False), then 2Ω should have 4 elements:
    { ϕ,

    True, False, (True, False) }. The (True, False) element describes the imprecision
    component

    introduced by DST, which refers to the fact of being either true or false, but
    not both. DST is a

    useful method for fault-tree analysts in quantitatively representing the imprecision
    [8]. Another

    advantage of DST is it can eﬃciently be utilized in IDS to reduce the false alarm
    rates by the

    representation of ignorance [6], [7], [10].

    For the reason that in DST the [sum of all masses] = 1 and m(ϕ) = 0,we have the
    following

    relation:

    m(True) + m(False) + m(True, False) = 1

    (1)

    In order to analyze the results of each sensor we’ll use the fault tree analysis,
    which can be

    realized by boolean OR gate. Table 1 describes the Boolean truth table for the
    OR gate.

    From Table 1 we have:

    m(A) = (a1, a2, a3) = {m(T), m(F), m(T, F)}

    (2)

    ⇒ m(A ∨ B) = (a1b1 + a1b2 + a1b3 + a2b1 + a3b1; a2b2; a2b3 + a3b2 + a3b3)

    (4)

    m(A ∨ B) = (a1 + a2b1 + a3b1; a2b2; a2b3 + a3b2 + a3b3)

    (5)

    At the last step, our solution applies the Dempster’s combination rule, which
    allows fusing

    evidences from multiple independent sources using a conjunctive operation (AND)
    between two

    bpa’s m1 and m2 , called the joint m12 [11]:

    m12(A) =

    ∑

    B ∩ C=A m1(B)m2(C)

    1 − K

    ,

    (6)

    when : A ̸= ϕ

    m12(ϕ) = 0

    and K = ∑

    B ∩ C=ϕ m1(B)m2(C)

    The factor 1-K, called normalization factor, is constructive for entirely avoiding
    the conﬂict

    evidence.

    Data fusion is also applied in real world examples: robotics, manufacturing, remote
    sensing

    and medical diagnosis, as well in military threat assessment and weather forecast
    systems [12].

    Sentz and Ferson (2002) demonstrated in their study that Dempster’s combination
    rule is

    suitable for the case that the sources of evidences are reliable and a minimal
    conﬂict or irrelevant

    conﬂict is generated.

    Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in Cloud Computing

    One of the IDS strategies proved reliable in cloud computing environments is its
    applicability

    to each virtual machine. This is the method we’ll choose for our proposed solution.
    Mazzariello,

    et al. (2010) presented and evaluated this method in comparison with another IDS
    deployment

    strategy, which uses single IDS near the cluster controller. IDS applied to each
    virtual machine

    in cloud computing platform eliminates the overloading problem, because in a way
    the network

    traﬃc is split to all IDSs. Thus, applying IDS to each virtual machine gets rid
    of the issue of the

    IDS strategy near the cluster controller, which tends to be overloaded because
    of its necessity to

    monitor all the supposed traﬃc from the cloud computing infrastructure. Another
    advantage of

    this strategy as described by Roschke, et al. (2009) is the beneﬁt of reducing
    the impact of the

    possible attacks by the IDS Sensor VMs.

    However, the limitation of IDS strategy applied to each virtual machine is the
    missing of the

    correlation phase, which is suggested in the future work by Mazzariello, et al.
    (2010).

    Detecting DDoS Attacks in Cloud Computing Environment

    73

    The correlation phase will be included in our proposed solution, because beside
    the IDS for

    each virtual machine, our IDS cloud topology will include a Cloud Fusion Unit
    (CFU) on the

    front-end, with the purpose of obtaining and controlling the alerts received from
    the IDS sensor

    VMs as presented by Roschke, et al. (2009) in their theoretical IDS architecture
    for cloud, which

    utilizing an IDS Management Unit.

    Compared to Roschke, et al.

    (2009) who suggested the utilization of IDMEF (Intrusion

    Detection Message Exchange) standard, a useful component for storage and exchange
    of the

    alerts from the management unit, the alerts in our proposed solution will be stored
    into the

    Mysql database of Cloud Fusion Unit. The Cloud Fusion Unit will add the capacity
    to analyze

    the results using the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) of evidence in 3-valued logic
    and the Fault-

    Tree Analysis for the IDS of each virtual machine and at the end the results of
    the sensors will

    be fused using Dempster’s combination rule.

    A similar method of using a IDS Management Unit is proposed in Dhage, et al. (2011),

    who presented a theoretical model of an IDS model in cloud computing, by using
    a single IDS

    controller, which creates a single mini IDS instance for each user. This IDS instance
    can be

    used in multiple Node controllers and a node controller can contain IDS instances
    of multiple

    users. The analysis phase of the mini IDS instance for each user takes place in
    the IDS controller.

    Compared with Roschke, et al. (2009) where the emphasis is on how to realize the
    synchronization

    and integration of the IDS Sensor VMs, in Dhage, et al. (2011) the focus is to
    provide a clear

    understanding of the cardinality used in the basic architecture of IDS in cloud
    infrastructure.

    Applying the IDS for each virtual machine is an idea suggested also by Lee, et
    al. (2011), who

    increases the eﬀectiveness of IDS by assigning a multi-level intrusion detection
    system and the log

    management analysis in cloud computing. In this sense the users will receive appropriate
    level

    of security, which will be emphasized on the degree of the IDS applied to the
    virtual machine,

    and as well on the prioritization stage of the log analysis documents. This multi-level
    security

    model solves the issue of using eﬀective resources.

    Lo, et al. (2010) proposed a cooperative IDS system for detecting the DoS attacks
    in Cloud

    Computing networks, which has the advantage of preventing the system from single
    point of

    failure attack, even if it is a slower IDS solution than a pure Snort based IDS.
    Thus, the framework

    proposed by Lo, et al. (2010) is a distributed IDS system, where each IDS is composed
    of three

    additional modules: block, communication and cooperation, which are added into
    the Snort IDS

    system.

    3.2

    IDS using Dempster-Shafer theory

    Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) is an eﬀective solution for assessing the likelihood
    of DDoS

    attacks, which was demonstrated by several research papers in the context of network
    intrusion

    detection systems. Dissanayake (2008) presented a survey upon intrusion detection
    using DST.

    Our study is to detect DDoS attacks in cloud computing environments. Dempster-Shafer

    Theory (DST) is used to analyze the results received from each sensor (i.e. VM-based
    IDS).

    Data used in experiments using DST vary: Yu and Frincke (2005) used DARPA DDoS

    intrusion detection evaluation datasets, Chou et al.

    (2008) used DARPA KDD99 intrusion

    detection evaluation dataset, Chen and Aickelin (2006) used the Wisconsin Breast
    cancer dataset

    and IRIS plant data, while others scientists generated their own data [7]. The
    data to be used in

    our proposed solution will be generated by ourselves, by performing DDoS attacks
    using speciﬁc

    tools against the VM-based IDS.

    Siaterlis, et al. (2003) and Siaterlis and Maglaris (2005) performed a similar
    study of detecting

    DDoS using data fusion and their ﬁeld was an operational university campus network,
    while in

    our solution the DDoS attacks are proposed to be detected and analyzed in our
    private cloud

    74

    A.M. Lonea, D.E. Popescu, H. Tianﬁeld

    computing environment.

    Additionally, we consider to analyze the attacks generated against the TCP, UDP,
    ICMP

    packets, like Siaterlis, et al.

    (2003) and Siaterlis and Maglaris (2005).

    However, instead of

    applying DST on the state space Ω = {Normal, UDP − flood, SY N − flood, ICMP −
    flood},

    our study uses DST operations in 3-valued logic as suggested by Guth (1991) for
    the same

    ﬂooding attacks: TCP-ﬂood, UDP-ﬂood, ICMP-ﬂood, for each VM-based IDS. Like Siaterlis

    and Maglaris (2005), Chatzigiannakis, et al., (2007) chosen the same frame of
    discernment, while

    Hu, et al. (2006) used a state space: {Normal, TCP, UDP and ICMP}.

    Furthermore, compared with the study performed by Siaterlis, at al. (2003) and
    Siaterlis and

    Maglaris (2005), who use a minimal neural network at the sensor level, our proposed
    solution will

    assign the probabilities using: DST in 3-valued logic, the pseudocode and the
    fault tree analysis.

    Whilst the computational complexity of DST is increasing exponentially with the
    number of

    elements in the frame of discernment [12], the DST 3-valued logic proposed to
    be used in our

    research will not encounter this issue, which will meet the eﬃciency requirements
    in terms of

    both detection rate and computation time [15].

    Finally, the data fusion of the evidences obtained from sensors studied by Siaterlis
    and

    Maglaris (2005) will be used in our study. The data fusion will be realized using
    the Dempster-

    Shafer combination rule, which was demonstrated in Siaterlis and Maglaris (2005)
    for its ad-

    vantages, i.e., maximization of DDoS true positive rates and minimization of the
    false positive

    alarm rate, by combining the evidence received from sensors.

    Therefore, the work of cloud

    administrators will be alleviated, whereas the number of alerts will decrease.

    Proposed Solution

    In order to detect and analyze Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in
    cloud com-

    puting environments we propose a solution as presented in Figure 1. For illustration
    purpose, a

    private cloud with a front-end and three nodes is set up. Whilst the detection
    stage is executed

    within the nodes, more precisely inside the virtual machines (VMs), where the
    Intrusion Detec-

    tion Systems (IDSs) are installed and conﬁgured; the attacks assessment phase
    is handled inside

    the front-end server, in the Cloud Fusion Unit (CFU).

    The ﬁrst step in our solution includes the deployment stage of a private cloud
    using Euca-

    lyptus open-source version 2.0.3. The topology of the implemented private cloud
    is: a front-end

    (with Cloud Controller, Walrus, Cluster Controller, Storage Controller) and a
    back-end (i.e.

    three nodes). The Managed networking mode is chosen because of the advanced features
    that it

    provides and Xen hypervisor is used for virtualization.

    Then, the VM-based IDS are created, by installing and conﬁguring Snort into each
    VM. The

    reason of using this IDS location is because the overloading problems can be avoided
    and the

    impact of possible attacks can be reduced [2], [13].

    These IDSs will yield alerts, which will be stored into the Mysql database placed
    within the

    Cloud Fusion Unit (CFU) of the front-end server. A single database is suggested
    to be used

    in order to reduce the risk of losing data, to maximize the resource usage inside
    the VMs and

    to simplify the work of cloud administrator, who will have all the alerts situated
    in the same

    place. A similar idea of obtaining and controlling the alerts received from the
    IDS Sensor VMs

    using an IDS Management Unit was presented by Roschke, et al. (2009) as a theoretical
    IDS

    architecture for cloud.

    A similar method of using an IDS Management Unit is proposed in

    Dhage, et al. (2011). However, our solution adds the capacity to analyse the results
    using the

    Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence in 3-valued logic.

    As showed in Figure 1, the Cloud Fusion Unit (CFU) comprises 3 components: Mysql

    database, bpas calculation and attacks assessment.

    Detecting DDoS Attacks in Cloud Computing Environment

    75

    Figure 1: IDS Cloud Topology

    I. Mysql database

    The Mysql database is introduced with the purpose of storing the alerts received
    from the

    VM-based IDS. Furthermore, these alerts will be converted into Basic Probabilities
    Assignments

    (bpas), which will be calculated using the pseudocode below.

    II. Basic probabilities assignment (bpa’s) calculation

    For calculating the basic probabilities assignment, ﬁrst we decide on the state
    space Ω. In this

    paper we use DST operations in 3-valued logic {True, False, (True, False)} Guth
    (1991) for the

    following ﬂooding attacks: TCP-ﬂood, UDP-ﬂood, ICMP-ﬂood, for each VM-based IDS.
    Thus,

    the analyzed packets will be: TCP, UDP and ICMP. Further, a pseudocode for converting
    the

    alerts received from the VM-based IDS into bpas is provided. The purpose of this
    pseudocode

    is to obtain the following probabilities of the alerts received from each VM-based
    IDS:

    (mUDP (T), mUDP (F), mUDP (T, F))

    (mTCP (T), mTCP (F), mTCP (T, F))

    (mICMP (T), mICMP (F), mICMP (T, F))

    76

    A.M. Lonea, D.E. Popescu, H. Tianﬁeld

    Figure 2: BPA’s calculation

    Pseudocode for converting the alerts into bpa’s:

    For each node

    Begin

    For each X ∈ {UDP; TCP; ICMP}:

    Begin

    1: Query the alerts from the database when a X attack occurs for the speciﬁed
    hostname

    2: Query the total number of possible X alerts for each hostname

    3: Query the alerts from the database when X attack is unknown

    4: Calculate the Belief (True) for X, by dividing the result obtained at step
    1 with the result

    obtained at step 2

    5: Calculate the Belief (True, False) for X, by dividing the result obtained at
    step 3 with the

    result obtained at step 2

    6: Calculates Belief (False) for X: 1- Belief (True) - Belief (True, False)

    end

    end

    Furthermore, after obtaining the probabilities for each attack packet (i.e. UDP,
    TCP, ICMP)

    for each VM-based IDS, the probabilities for each VM-based IDS should be calculated
    following

    the fault-tree as shows in Figure 2. Figure 2 reveals only the calculation of
    the probabilities (i.e.

    mS1(T), mS1(F), mS1(T, F)) for the ﬁrst VM-based IDS.

    Thus, using the DST with fault-tree analysis we can calculate the belief (Bel)
    and plausibility

    (Pl) values for each VM-based IDS:

    Bel(S1) = mS1(T)

    (7)

    Pl(S1) = mS1(T) + mS1(T, F)

    (8)

    III. Attacks assessment

    The attacks assessment consists of data fusion of the evidences obtained from
    sensors by

    using the Dempster’s combination rule, with the purpose of maximizing the DDoS
    true positive

    rates and minimizing the false positive alarm rate. mS1,S2(T) can be calculated
    using Table 2

    and equation (6).

    Conclusions

    To detect and analyze Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in cloud computing

    environments we have proposed a solution using Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) operations
    in

    3-valued logic and the Fault-Tree Analysis (FTA) for each VM-based Intrusion Detection
    System

    (IDS). Our solution quantitatively represents the imprecision and eﬃciently utilizes
    it in IDS to

    reduce the false alarm rates by the representation of the ignorance.

    Whilst the computational complexity of DST is increasing exponentially with the
    number of

    elements in the frame of discernment [12], the DST 3-valued logic in our solution
    does not have

    this issue, which meets the eﬃciency requirements in terms of both detection rate
    and computa-

    tion time. At the same time, the usability requirement has been accomplished,
    because the work

    of cloud administrators will be alleviated by using the Dempster rule of evidence
    combination

    whereas the number of alerts will decrease and the conﬂict generated by the combination
    of

    information provided by multiple sensors is entirely eliminated.

    To sum up, by using DST our proposed solution has the following advantages: to
    accom-

    modate the uncertain state, to reduce the false negative rates, to increase the
    detection rate, to

    resolve the conﬂicts generated by the combination of information provided by multiple
    sensors

    and to alleviate the work for cloud administrators.

    Abstract: Wireless sensor networks are being increasingly used in several application
    areas,

    particularly to collect data and monitor physical processes. Non-functional requirements,
    like

    reliability, security or availability, are often important and must be accounted
    for in the application

    development. For that purpose, there is a large body of knowledge on dependability
    techniques for

    distributed systems, which provide a good basis to understand how to satisfy these
    non-functional

    requirements of WSN-based monitoring applications. Given the data-centric nature
    of monitoring

    applications, it is of particular importance to ensure that data are reliable
    or, more generically,

    that they have the necessary quality. In this survey, we look into the problem
    of ensuring the

    desired quality of data for dependable monitoring using WSNs. We take a dependability-oriented

    perspective, reviewing the possible impairments to dependability and the prominent
    existing

    solutions to solve or mitigate these impairments. Despite the variety of components
    that may form a

    WSN-based monitoring system, we give particular attention to understanding which
    faults can affect

    sensors, how they can affect the quality of the information and how this quality
    can be improved

    and quantiﬁed.

    1. Introduction

    In order to increase the dependability of monitoring applications in wireless
    sensor network (WSN)

    settings, one must be aware that the quality of monitoring data can be affected
    by faults. In essence,

    there is a problem of data quality assurance, which can be faced taking two main
    perspectives: either

    by deploying dependability techniques to mask faults and enforce the reliability
    of the system or

    by enhancing the system with means to continuously assess and characterize the
    quality of data [1].

    In the former case, the system will not be aware of the quality of data, and hence,
    if a certain quality

    is needed, it must be enforced by design, conﬁning the effects of faults a priori.
    Considering sensors

    to be the main source of data, errors in sensing measurements are handled by procedures
    that are

    established based on a deep understanding of the characteristics of the sensors
    [2]. Missing readings

    may be handled by oversampling, and glitches, like outliers and noise, can be
    masked by averaging.

    In the latter case, given that the system can be aware of the quality of data
    at run-time, it is better

    suited to be used in environments where full knowledge of the operational conditions
    is not known

    in advance. In this case, mitigation techniques must be deployed to handle faults
    and data quality

    problems at run-time, for instance exploiting application semantics to determine
    appropriate data

    corrections and to regain the needed data quality. Given that no system can be
    built to exhibit 100%

    reliability, the two perspectives can be combined. In this paper, we take the
    latter perspective and

    consider that the quality of sensor data can be assessed, providing an indication
    of the overall system

    health, encompassing sensors, the wireless network and the processing tasks.

    Assuring the quality of sensor data for a dependable operation is particularly
    challenging in

    some WSN-based monitoring applications. In fact, it is often the case that the
    sensors and the

    WSN are deployed in harsh environments and exposed to extreme physical conditions,
    thus being

    more likely affected by faults. The problem becomes critical when dependability
    is an important

    application requirement. For instance, in water-related information systems, inaccurate
    information in

    aquatic monitoring may lead to false warnings being issued or harmful situations
    not being detected

    early enough (e.g., ﬂoods or pollution events). As another example, WSNs are deployed
    in data

    centers for ﬂexible temperature monitoring and energy-efﬁcient control of air-cooling
    equipment [3,4].

    Therefore, ensuring the accuracy of collected data is also necessary for effectiveness
    reasons. In these

    examples, the operational conditions are typically hard to accurately predict,
    ensuring that the

    reliability of operations is often hard or costly, and the consequences of inaccurate
    sensor data collection

    can be severe.

    In this survey, we characterize and systematize existing solutions to dependable
    monitoring in

    WSNs by approaching them in two steps. In the ﬁrst step, we look at the root cause
    of dependability

    problems concerning the quality of sensor data, that is we identify and analyze
    several kinds of faults

    that may affect the system operation, in particular at the sensor and network
    levels, describing

    the speciﬁc effect on the sensor data and the relevant failure modes [5] that
    allow abstracting

    particular kinds of faults. When appropriate, we also refer to particular mitigation
    solutions to

    automatically adjust the sensors measurements according to each disturbance. Then,
    we provide a

    comprehensive overview of the solutions to achieve improved sensor data quality
    and dependable

    operation of WSN-based monitoring applications. In addition to detection and correction
    strategies,

    fault-tolerance strategies based on sensor data fusion procedures, exploiting
    the availability of

    redundant measurements or available modeling surrogates, are surveyed. However,
    there is a focus on

    works and solutions related to monitoring in aquatic environments, noting that
    these solutions are also

    applicable in many other contexts, but that the opposite might not be true, in
    particular concerning

    solutions that are not agnostic to the semantics of the monitored data.

    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 exposes a set of
    fundamental ideas

    related to the issue of data quality in WSNs, motivating the need for dependability,
    introducing the

    baseline architecture for a WSN-based monitoring system and referring to the main
    dependability

    strategies that may be employed. Section 3 describes the notion of data quality
    and the main aspects

    that may affect this quality during monitoring. Section 4 presents an overview
    of solutions for

    dependable sensor networks. We will conclude in Section 5, with a discussion of
    the possible results of

    the solutions mentioned herein.

    2. Overview of Key Issues

    2.1. Motivation

    Complex and powerful forecast systems are now able to predict environmental variables
    such as

    storm events with small errors, but they depend on a continuous ﬂow of conﬁrmation
    with real-time

    data for robustness. Real-time monitoring data, such as surface water elevation,
    ﬂow or water quality

    variables depend solely on the sensor hardware deployed in the physical environment
    (oceans, river,

    lakes, etc.) and its proper maintenance.

    The effectiveness of existing emergency warning and forecast procedures for natural
    and

    man-made hazardous events may be limited by several factors, including an often
    sparse and unreliable

    real-time observational network, the use of coarse-resolution prediction models
    and the reliance on

    traditional approaches to convey warning and forecast information.

    In spite of the vast research on the dependability of distributed systems, in
    particular on

    computational architectures/frameworks for reliable and timely operations, monitoring
    systems

    pose new challenges to dependability. The sensory and sensor network technologies,
    which are now

    becoming widely available, are subject to diverse hazards and are not sufﬁciently
    reliable and robust

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    3 of 23

    against harsh exogenous and/or environmental factors. In this ﬁeld, there is still
    a lack of architectural,

    fault-tolerant and system management solutions, which are essential for dependable,
    robust remote

    monitoring, necessary for adequate water management.

    Ensuring the quality of monitoring data is fundamental to avoid false alarms or
    ignoring relevant

    data. However, because these sensors are located in the physical environment,
    they are constantly

    being subjected to factors that directly interfere with the data quality, such
    as potentially strong

    currents, debris accumulation and tough weather conditions. Consequently, there
    is a trust issue

    related to the collected data, which demands an extensive human intervention in
    terms of time and

    knowledge specialization, data validation tasks and periodic maintenance of sensors.
    To deal with this

    problem, it is necessary to continuously and automatically characterize the quality
    of collected data.

    Hence, the application of techniques based in the existence of redundancy at the
    data collection and

    data processing levels is a promising approach.

    2.2. Monitoring and Data Processing

    The process of environment monitoring requires sensor devices to be deployed within
    the system.

    These sensors will be the entities responsible for measuring the parameters of
    interest, like temperature,

    water level or salinity. A sensor essentially converts a physical quantity in
    its input to an electrical

    signal, produced as the output, which is usually proportional to the input. Further
    to the sensor itself,

    additional components are needed to perform signal processing functions, store
    measured values

    and communicate these values to other systems. It is hence usual to refer to these
    more complex

    components as smart sensors or intelligent sensors [6], typically interconnected
    to other smart sensors

    to form wireless sensor networks.

    For monitoring and control purposes, wireless sensor networks have become a subject
    of interest

    in recent years, mostly due to enormous advances in sensing and communication
    technology, which

    has fostered the use of smart sensors, with applications in many ﬁelds: (a) military
    applications;

    (b) environmental monitoring; (c) commerce; (d) human-centric applications; and
    (e) applications to

    robotics (Arampatzis et al. [7]). WSNs are formed by smart sensor nodes, and each
    sensor node may

    have several individual sensors, in which case they are said to be clustered.
    Information collected by

    sensor nodes is typically transmitted to a sink or controller node.

    After the sensors measurement step, performed usually through a WSN, there is
    another layer

    in the overall system that comprises the gathering and analysis of the measurements,
    including

    information fusion (Section 4). This phase is commonly referred to as data processing
    (see Figure 1).

    Our goal is to describe and enumerate the processes involved in each layer of
    the scheme in

    Figure 1. In a bottom-up perspective, the ﬁrst layer is the physical environment
    (it can also be deﬁned

    as the object or the event to be monitored), which can have a great inﬂuence on
    the measurements.

    Although there are many speciﬁc external factors related to perturbation events
    or objects in all of the

    different applications of WSNs, we decided to tackle the problems of the involved
    water body by ﬁrst

    enumerating well-known limitations of sensor devices in Section 3.2.

    On the second layer, we are considering that in terms of faults and validity issues,
    monitoring

    has two abstraction levels: the sensors and communication between them. Each level
    has a particular

    fault model, with faults arising from different sources (see Figure 2). We will
    explore these subjects in

    Sections 3.2 and 3.3 with the respective mitigation solutions.

    Finally, in order to centrally analyze all of the sensing information, a third
    layer appears in the

    system. In the data processing layer, it is possible to infer the quality of the
    gathered information,

    through fusion processes of redundant and related measurements, by multi-sensor
    fusion methods,

    or by expert-knowledge of the system model. In fact, this is where we can ultimately
    handle both

    sensor and network-level problems and apply the mitigation techniques identiﬁed
    already in Figure 2.

    These techniques will be addressed in Section 4.

    2.3. Dependability Strategies

    When designing a fault-tolerant and dependable system, the typical means to deal
    with system

    errors and faults include error detection and error or fault recovery. In this
    context, endowing the

    system with redundant components can be instrumental to compensate existing errors
    or faults

    affecting some component.

    The affected component can be replaced in its tasks by the spare,

    redundancy component, which will ensure that the system function will continue
    to be provided.

    However, redundancy does not refer solely to having multiple similar components,
    which is a form of

    space redundancy. It is also possible to implement forms of redundancy in the
    time (e.g., repeating

    some action multiple times) and in the value domains (e.g., adding extra information)
    [8].

    Some examples of space redundancy include storing information in several disks,
    machines

    or data centers, having multiple nodes performing the same computation (either
    in parallel, called

    active replication, or with some nodes in stand-by mode, called passive replication),
    or sending a

    network message through multiple network paths. Time redundancy is typically explored
    in reliable

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    5 of 23

    communication systems that retransmit messages when they suspect that these messages
    might have

    been lost in previous transmissions. Restarting an aborted transaction or a deadlocked
    computation

    are also examples of time redundancy. Finally, value redundancy is observed in
    data storage and

    communication systems that use error correcting codes associated with the stored
    or transmitted data,

    allowing the original information to be reconstructed when some bits or parts
    of the information

    become corrupted. To deal with malicious forms of information corruption, cryptographic
    signatures

    may be used.

    In the application of these concepts to sensor validation, [9] stated that there
    are two

    classical approaches that are widely used: (a) analytical redundancy and (b) hardware
    redundancy.

    Analytical redundancy uses mathematical relationships between measurements to
    predict or infer a

    sensor’s value. Two disadvantages of this approach are the possible inefﬁciency
    of the mathematical

    processes when we have a large number of sensors and the model complexity increases
    and the fact

    that the mathematical relationships can be very data speciﬁc, and a slight modiﬁcation
    may require

    signiﬁcant efforts to stabilize. Hardware redundancy is not always possible because
    of the costs

    implied by additional sensors and their installation and maintenance operations.

    The right approach to be used depends on several issues, like the assumed fault
    model, the

    criticality of the application, the cost or timeliness requirements. In some cases,
    several dependability

    techniques can be used in a single system to deal with different problems or to
    achieve the needed

    levels of assurance. This is particularly true in complex systems, like aquatic
    systems, in which

    different techniques can be applicable to mitigate faults in the sensing process
    and to handle WSN

    faults. Combinations of the solutions mentioned later in this survey (Section
    4.1) may thus be used in

    the design of a single system.

    3. Sensor Data Quality

    When the quality of sensor data is an important attribute for the dependability
    of the application,

    it becomes necessary to somehow express this quality, which can be done in various
    ways. Additionally,

    a priori knowledge about the possible causes of quality degradation, translated
    into faults and a

    corresponding fault model, is also relevant. It will enable a more accurate characterization
    of the quality

    of sensor data and the possibly of incorporating in the system some techniques
    to mitigate the effects

    of speciﬁc faults assumed in the fault model. These aspects are addressed in the
    following sections.

    3.1. Expressing Data Quality

    The interpretation and modeling of the available information into adequate theoretical

    frameworks is the main means to characterize the quality of the obtained sensor
    data. These qualitative

    interpretations of sensor data can become confusing when different authors introduce
    an array of

    terms for quality (the most generic), including:

    •

    Validity is typically employed when a determined requirement about the quality
    of data is

    available, against which it is possible to compare some quality measure and declare
    if the data

    are valid [1,10].

    •

    Conﬁdence is an attribute that may be elaborated from the continuous observation
    of sensor data,

    without the need for a quality requirement to be available. It is generally used
    when datasets are

    available and can be characterized in a probabilistic way, along with model ﬁtting
    or threshold

    deﬁnition techniques, to yield continuous or multi-level conﬁdence measures [11].

    •

    Reliability is a typical dependability attribute [12], expressing the ability
    of a system to provide

    the correct service (or the correct data, for that matter) over a period of time.
    The term data

    reliability in sensor networks is often considered when transmissions and/or communications

    may be subject to faults like omissions or a total crash [13,14].

    •

    Trustworthiness is mostly employed in connection with security concerns, namely
    when it

    is assumed that data can be altered in a malicious way. In the context of sensor
    networks,

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    6 of 23

    it characterizes the degree to which it is possible to trust that sensor data
    have not been tampered

    with and have thus the needed quality [15].

    •

    Authenticity is also used, in particular in a security context, but to express
    the degree to which it is

    possible to trust the claimed data origin [16]. This is particularly important
    when the overall quality

    of the system or application depends on the correct association of some data to
    their producer.

    This terminology does contain other terms, including other aspects of data quality
    that are

    implicit and brieﬂy approached herein, such as timeliness, precision, tunability,
    completeness, usability,

    accuracy, throughput, affordability and reusability [17]. We will also describe
    herein the diverse

    typologies of data quality and how to obtain a quality parameter, either for each
    individual sensor

    or for the global system, according to several studies. Therefore, in terms of
    applicability, we must

    differentiate single-sensor validity from multi-sensor fusion validity, when several
    sensors exist and

    sensor fusion can be applied.

    In single-sensor situations, there are models or related information that allow
    reasoning about

    an individual sensor’s data quality without requiring other sensors’ data. The
    work in [18] tried

    to identify faulty situations (see Section 3.2) such as noise and outliers in
    chlorophyll concentration

    sensors deployed in lake water, by implementing different fault detection methods:

    •

    Rule-based methods that use expert knowledge about the variables that sensors
    are measuring to

    determine thresholds or heuristics with which the sensors must comply.

    •

    Estimation methods that deﬁne a “normal” behavior by considering spatial and temporal

    correlations from sensor data. A sensor reading is matched alongside its forecasted
    value to

    assess its validity.

    •

    Learning-based methods that deﬁne models for correct and faulty sensor measurements,
    using

    collected data for building the models.

    In the example from [18], all three methods were used to assert the correctness
    (or incorrectness)

    of the collected data, thus adopting a Boolean approach to quality characterization.
    However, the

    same methods may be employed in other ways, as a means to characterize quality
    in a step-wise or

    even continuous way. For instance, and still considering a single-sensor situation,
    [11] employed fuzzy

    logic rules to obtain a qualitative sense of a sensor’s validity based on its
    own historical behavior

    represented by a conﬁdence measure.

    In a multi-sensor situation, the quality of sensor measurements is characterized
    by using

    redundant or correlated data obtained from the different sensors. This redundancy
    allows for data

    fusion methods to be deployed at the network level, resulting in improved (fused)
    sensor data, as

    well as improved data quality characterization. Various quality-oriented network
    meta-models can be

    explored according to the application requirements. For instance, in [17], the
    data quality is calculated

    through the several nodes (and the sink) on the entire WSN structure.

    Sensor data fusion methods will be detailed in Section 4. As for the quality characterization
    process

    when data fusion is performed, the applicable methodology depends on the available
    information

    concerning the quality of individual sensor measurements. In fact, this information
    can also be used in

    the data fusion process itself.

    For instance, in [11], the approach relied on a statistical method (Parzen estimation
    of the

    probability density function) to determine the variance of sensors’ data and to
    calculate the average of

    the sensors, considering just the sensors with a high-quality standard in the
    data fusion process. If all

    sensors are producing high-quality data, then the fusion will also reach the highest
    possible quality.

    Otherwise, better results will be achieved when discarding sensor data with lower
    quality, rather than

    using these data in the fusion process.

    Another example can be found in [19], where reliability estimates are calculated
    for sensor data,

    using Bayesian networks or random forests to obtain reliability coefﬁcients, and
    then, these reliability

    estimates are used in a sensor fusion process to discard sources that are considered
    unreliable if the

    reliability estimate is below a deﬁned threshold.

    Regarding the quantiﬁcation of data quality, the two main approaches consist of
    considering

    discrete quality classes or continuous quality values.

    In the discrete approach, it is possible to use binary classes, such as {valid,
    invalid} [20], or to use

    a multi-level class, like {verylow, low, high, veryhigh} [11]. These discrete
    classiﬁcations can be applied

    to each sensor (individual sensor data) or to the whole network of sensors (fused
    data).

    In the continuous approach, a conﬁdence level is usually derived, ranging in a
    well-deﬁned

    continuous interval (often [0, 1] or equivalently [0%, 100%]).

    Therefore, the validity of sensor

    information may not only have the values “true and” “false”, especially if one
    must process

    continuously-valued data [1,9]. For instance, a noisy sensor (internal or external
    noise) may deliver

    useful data within some error margin, but the quality of that data is lower than
    that from a non-noisy

    sensor. In a multi-sensor fusion application, the quality quantiﬁcation can be
    calculated using a

    cumulative association of each sensor quality coefﬁcient [21] or calculating the
    percentage of sensors

    used in the fusion against the sensors in the network.

    3.2. Sensor Level Faults

    In this subsection, we present a systematization of the main types of sensors
    and their

    characteristics, classifying the various data errors that may be produced by sensors.
    From the

    perspective of building modular dependable systems, what is interesting is to
    group the several

    possible faults and the consequent data errors into well-deﬁned sensor failure
    modes. We thus identify

    the relevant failure modes under which a sensor can fail and produce data with
    degraded quality.

    The focus herein is on the sensor level, whereas the next subsection addresses
    network level faults.

    Finally, we also focus on possible mitigation techniques to handle sensor faults.

    3.2.1. Sensor Characteristics

    We begin to dissect sensor faults by exploring the transducing processes, enumerating
    the different

    methods to convert the various physical effects into electric signals, as well
    as each one’s advantages

    and limitations. This enumeration is important to the survey, to understand the
    most basic origins of

    faults in sensors. The sensor material characteristics or the harshness of the
    environmental conditions

    lead to the production of a speciﬁc kind of fault. Some sensors strive to perceive
    an object that is

    moving in dusty environments, while others experience issues reading a correct
    level observation

    in ﬂuids. For instance, capacitive sensors present a considerable sensitivity
    and require low energy

    usage, making them an attractive choice for many areas, but as pointed out by
    [22], the response

    characteristics of these sensors are very nonlinear, and the offset capacitance
    is non-negligible and

    must be handled to correctly detect capacitance variations due to the applied
    pressure and to avoid

    errors. In summary, from a dependability perspective, it is important to distinguish
    sensors in terms of

    their operation and robustness to distinct environment conditions. When a sensor
    is highly sensitive,

    but frequently faulty, a redundancy solution must be considered, possibly using
    a sensor that offers

    the same sensitivity, but is more reliable.

    The main types of sensors according to the exploitation of displacement effects
    are

    the following [23]:

    •

    Resistance: Resistive sensors, also termed potentiometers, are based on an electromechanical

    instrument that transforms a mechanical variation, like a displacement, into an
    electrical signal

    capable of being monitored following conditioning;

    •

    Induction: Inductive sensors are primarily based on the principles of magnetic
    circuits and may

    be categorized as self-generating or passive;

    •

    Capacitance: Capacitive sensors depend on variations in capacitance in reply to
    physical changes.

    A capacitive level pointer uses the changes in the comparative permittivity among
    the plates;

    •

    Piezoelectricity: Piezoelectricity is the term used to determine the capacity
    of speciﬁc materials to

    create an electric charge that is relative to a directly applied mechanical pressure;

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    8 of 23

    •

    Laser: Laser sensors compare changes in optical path length and in the wavelength
    of light, which

    can be determined with very little uncertainty. Laser sensors achieve a high precision
    in the

    length and displacement measurements, where the precision achieved by mechanical
    means is

    not enough;

    •

    Ultrasonic: Uses the time-of-ﬂight method as the standard for the use of ultrasound
    for monitoring

    purposes. A pulse of ultrasound is transmitted in a medium, reﬂecting when it
    reaches another

    medium, and the time from emission to recognition of the reﬂected pulsation is
    read;

    •

    Optical: Optical sensors encompass a variety of parts that use light as the means
    to convert

    kinetics into electrical signals, comprised mostly of two components: a main diffraction
    grating,

    representing the measurement standard (scale); and a detection system. What is
    detected is the

    position of one regarding the other;

    •

    Magnetic: A magnetic sensor is either triggered to function by a magnetic ﬁeld
    or the use of the

    ﬁeld that deﬁnes the properties of the sensor;

    In Table 1, a summary of the relative advantages and disadvantages of each of
    the described

    displacement effects is presented. The goal here is not to choose the best type
    of sensor, but to

    discriminate the strong and weak points of all of the types.

    Table 1. Advantages and disadvantages of the various displacement effects [23–25].

    vary with temperature).

    loud noise; slow measurements in

    proximity sensors; changes in the

    environment affect the response; targets

    minimum sensing distance required.

    Optical encoding

    Inherently digital (which makes the

    interface easy for control systems); fast

    measurements; long durability.

    Fairly complex; delicate parts; low

    tolerance to mechanical abuse; low

    tolerance to high temperatures.

    Magnetic

    Non-contacting; high durability; high

    sensitivity; small size; output is highly

    linear.

    Very sensitive to fabrication tolerances;

    calibration needed after installation.

    Beyond the limitations of the transducers, [26] explained other causes of measurement
    uncertainty

    and how only an estimation of the observed physical property can be given. When
    considering

    individual sensor measurements, the possible types of errors observed in measurement
    values can be

    classiﬁed as follows:

    •

    Random errors are described by an absence of repeatability in the readings of
    the sensor, for

    instance due to measurement noise. These errors tend to happen on a permanent
    basis, but have a

    stochastic nature;

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    9 of 23

    •

    Systematic errors are described through consistency and repeatability in the temporal
    domain.

    There are three types of systematic errors at the sensor level:

    –

    Calibration errors result from errors in the calibration procedure, often in relation
    to

    linearization procedures;

    –

    Loading errors emerge when the intrusive nature of the sensor modiﬁes the measurand.

    Along with calibration errors, loading errors are caused by internal processes;

    –

    Environmental errors emerge when the sensor experiences the surrounding environment

    and these inﬂuences are not considered. In contrast with the previous two types
    of errors,

    environmental errors are due to external factors;

    •

    Spurious readings are non-systematic reading errors. They occur when some spurious
    physical

    occurrence leads to a measurement value that does not reﬂect the intended reality.
    For instance, a

    light intensity measurement in a room can provide the wrong value if obtained
    precisely when a

    picture of the room is taken and the camera ﬂash is triggered.

    3.2.2. Sensor Failure Modes

    The classiﬁcation presented above builds essentially on the persistence and nature
    of the

    observable value errors. An alternative way to acknowledge and to deal with the
    fact that sensor

    measurements are affected by uncertainties, which is commonly used when building
    modular

    distributed systems, is to identify relevant sensor failure modes. Independently
    of the several factors

    leading to a sensor fault and the consequent measurement error(s), the faulty
    behavior of the sensor

    component is observed through its interface, that is, through the values it produces.
    Therefore, a

    failure mode characterizes a certain deviating behavior, abstracting its causes
    and considering only the

    measurement values produced at the sensor interface.

    The main sensor failures modes, depicted in Figure 3, are the following [1]:

    1.

    Constant or offset failure mode: The observations continuously deviate from the
    expected value

    by a constant offset.

    2.

    Continuous varying or drifting failure mode: The deviation between the observations
    and the

    expected value is continuously changing according to some continuous time-dependent
    function

    (linear or non-linear).

    3.

    Crash or jammed failure mode: The sensor stops providing any readings on its interface
    or gets

    jammed and stuck in some incorrect value.

    4.

    Trimming failure mode: The observations are correct for values within some interval,
    but are

    modiﬁed for values outside that interval. Beyond the interval, the observation
    can be trimmed at

    the interval boundary or may vary proportionally with the expected value.

    5.

    Outliers failure mode: The observations occasionally deviate from the expected
    value, at random

    points in the time domain;

    6.

    Noise failure mode: The observations deviate from the expected value stochastically
    in the value

    domain and permanently in the temporal domain.

    a ﬁlled line, whereas the

    real values are depicted with a dashed line.

    Comparing this classiﬁcation of sensor failure modes with the classiﬁcation of
    sensor errors

    previously introduced, it is interesting to note the direct correspondence between
    the class of random

    errors and the noise failure mode and between the class of spurious errors and
    the outliers failure

    mode. The remaining four failure modes can be seen as specializations of the systematic
    errors class.

    3.2.3. Mitigation Techniques

    Regarding mitigation techniques to address faults and respective value errors,
    we make a

    separation between what can be done at the sensor level and what can be done at
    the distributed

    system level, namely within the application that uses the sensor data, possibly
    exploiting additional

    sources of information. Considering an individual sensor, it is possible to use
    dependability techniques

    to prevent or tolerate the occurrence of faults and achieve an improved behavior,
    possibly even

    removing some failure modes. This can be described as a “basic quality improvement”,
    and in

    what follows, we describe two basic techniques that are usually carried out to
    achieve this objective:

    calibration and measurand reconstruction. The general approaches for improving
    the quality of data

    in WSN monitoring applications are then covered in Section 4.

    Commonly, calibration is deﬁned as a test under speciﬁc conditions in which pre-determined

    known values of the measurand are given to the transducer and the corresponding
    outputs are

    recorded. In a formal way, calibration consists of deﬁning a function f (r, β)
    that, along with a set of

    selected device parameters β ∈ R, will translate real sensor output r to the intended
    output r*.

    Calibration actions are required every time a sensor is deployed in a different
    environment, as

    the physical measurement elements must be adjusted or even dedicated to the monitored
    device or

    process, providing at the start a reduction of measuring uncertainty and minimal
    interference with

    sensor functions. However, periodic calibrations are also needed, since during
    the operation, we can

    assist the change of conditions with respect to those known during the calibration
    process and to

    the impact of various external factors that could be absent in the laboratory
    calibration conditions.

    These factors can be the base cause of many errors and should hence be continuously
    re-evaluated.

    For instance, in aquatic sensors, offset and drifting errors are related to the
    accuracy range becoming

    unbalanced, which is solvable by recalibration. This is done off-ﬁeld (removing
    the sensor of the

    monitoring environment and recalibrating it in a container with water in controlled
    conditions), with

    potential data loss if no redundant way of collecting sensor data is available,
    and with re-deployment

    costs. It can also be done in the ﬁeld, which is a time-consuming task with sometimes
    difﬁcult

    conditions and, especially, exposing the calibration process to environmental
    factors that may affect the

    calibration accuracy.

    As alternatives to manual calibration, two generic options can be considered:
    factory sensor

    calibration, with the advantage of reducing the time consumption efforts of the
    initial manual process,

    but not completely eliminating the problems mentioned before; and auto or self-calibration,
    enabling

    sensors to monitor themselves and recalibrate using a reference. This latter option,
    which, being

    adaptive, is potentially better for dealing with varied and even unpredicted misbehavior,
    is designated

    as measurand reconstruction or sensor compensation.

    Auto-calibration refers to methods aimed at diminishing the effect of the disturbing
    parameters in

    the input/output features of sensors. Preferably, the transduced value must have
    a direct relation with

    the measurand, which should not be sensible to past information, interfering environmental
    factors,

    noise, error gain, etc. To try to compensate all of these disturbances, numerical
    techniques have to be

    used. These techniques are applied after the transformed signal has been quantiﬁed,
    through digital

    signal processing that must transform the sensor output signal (r*) into a corrected
    value ( ˆr*).

    Several auto-calibration techniques have been used with relative success, for
    instance exploiting

    statistical regression based on a priori knowledge [27] or artiﬁcial neural networks
    [28,29]. In the

    statistical regression approach, the goal is to determine the polynomial approximation
    to the

    characteristics of the sensor. In the artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) approach,
    the inputs are the

    measurements, and the ideal outputs are the measurand. This model inversion is
    the reason why it is

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    11 of 23

    called measurand reconstruction. Other machine-learning algorithms have also been
    applied, such

    as Kalman ﬁlters [30] and support vector machines [31], especially in order to
    overcome the ANN

    disadvantages: neural network training may not converge to the global optimum,
    and training may

    need to be repeated several times, which will be prejudicial with respect to the
    computational cost; and

    the poor generalization capabilities that may arise from insufﬁcient data, from
    over- or under-training

    or from under- or over-ﬁtting.

    3.3. Communication Faults in WSNs

    When connecting individual sensor nodes in a wireless sensor network, additional
    faults affecting

    sensor data can be introduced by the network. In this subsection, we focus on
    the main kinds of

    network faults that may affect the quality of sensor data in order to achieve
    a reliable network operation,

    speciﬁcally considering faults in the time domain and faults in the value domain.

    In the time domain, a crash, omission or delay faults could occur. Crash faults
    (for instance of the

    radio subsystem in a sensor node) lead to data absence and can only be mitigated
    with redundancy (e.g.,

    a dual-radio system). Omissions correspond to missing sensor readings due to lost
    messages. They can

    be prevented by enforcing communication reliability, for instance based on message
    retransmission.

    However, reliable communication protocols are not very common in WSNs due to the
    additional

    resources (namely energy) they require. Therefore, omissions do happen in sensor
    networks and for

    the most part emerge because of sensor failures and packet losses. Heavy packet
    loss and asymmetric

    links occur frequently in WSNs [32,33], for instance due to signal strength fading
    and intermittent or

    continuous environmental interference (e.g., wind or rain). Absent values inﬂuence
    the outcome of

    any query over sensor readings. The resulting inaccuracies can be critical as
    in in-network processing

    and aggregations [33–35]. Several solutions have been suggested to tolerate these
    types of errors such

    as masking lost values through redundant information or estimating using past
    values [34]. Although

    this problem has been studied and solved in many applications, one must be aware
    that it is impossible

    to fully avoid omissions. Finally, delay faults are only relevant when the correctness
    of the application

    depends on the timeliness of sensor data. This is typically the case in real-time
    control, where the

    temporal validity of sensor data is bounded [36]. Sensor data become useless after
    a certain amount of

    time due to not reﬂecting the present reality with sufﬁcient accuracy, possibly
    leading to system failures

    if used in the control process. Existing solutions to avoid timing failures are
    based on techniques from

    the real-time area, namely seizing the needed resources and using synchronized
    clocks to timestamp

    data and discard the outdated data. The existence of redundant sensor nodes can
    also be explored, to

    avoid missing important events.

    In the value domain, a communication fault is translated into a message corruption.

    However, communication protocols typically incorporate data integrity veriﬁcation
    mechanisms

    that allow the detection of corrupted messages, discarding those messages and
    hence transforming

    value faults into omission faults. Therefore, the only chance that received data
    do not correspond to

    what has been sent is when some part of the communication stack in the sending
    or receiving node

    (or both) is affected by an accidental fault not covered by the integrity veriﬁcation
    mechanisms or

    when it has been intentionally corrupted. In fact, WSNs and sensor nodes can be
    subject to attacks

    that may signiﬁcantly affect the quality of sensor data, among other consequences
    for the application.

    Therefore, in critical applications, it is important to deploy security techniques
    to avoid attacks or to

    mitigate their effects. These security techniques are, however, outside the scope
    of this survey.

    4. Solutions for Dependable Data Quality

    Several methods have been proposed in the literature to improve the quality of
    sensor data.

    Our focus is on solutions to mitigate the negative effects of faults on data quality.
    The ones that are

    applicable at the sensor level to mitigate data errors at the sensor interface
    have already been addressed

    in Section 3.2. In this section, we discuss what can be done at sink or processing
    nodes. We start

    by identifying and characterizing the three different forms of redundancy that
    may be explored for

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    12 of 23

    dependable data quality. They are related to the available sources of information,
    to which data

    analysis and processing techniques can be applied: (a) single sensor data stream,
    (b) multi-sensor data

    streams or (c) multi-source data streams.

    Then,

    and given our focus on dependability aspects,

    we present a taxonomy for

    dependability-oriented data quality in WSNs. We identify the relevant dimensions
    to reason about

    dependable data quality, classifying the options within each of these dimensions.
    In this exercise,

    we introduce dependability-related categories concurring with the goal of estimating
    the quality of

    sensor data. In most cases, WSN-based monitoring systems address concerns (sometimes
    implicitly) of

    improving the quality of data, but not of estimating the achieved quality. The
    resulting systematization

    underlies the survey on concrete techniques for data processing, further ahead
    in the section.

    4.1. Exploiting Redundancy

    Redundancy is a fundamental dependability technique to achieve reliability, availability
    and even

    improved performance. Therefore, WSN applications naturally exploit the existence
    of multiple sensor

    nodes and the spatial redundancy they offer. In fact, if information relative
    to a certain environmental

    process is collected through several sensors, then it is possible to apply a range
    of data processing

    techniques to fuse the multiple data streams (from the different sensor nodes).
    This approach permits

    obtaining the resulting data with more quality, masking possible faults affecting
    data provided by

    some of the nodes. In sensor networks, it is also possible to exploit value redundancy
    [8] for improving

    the quality of data. This redundancy is offered, for instance, by environmental
    models describing the

    monitored dynamic process or setting limits to the static or dynamic attributes
    of this process. Finally,

    if sensor data from multiple sensor nodes cannot be correlated, then it is still
    possible to exploit a form

    of temporal redundancy. This temporal redundancy is intrinsic to continuous transmission,
    in a single

    ﬂow, of data samples that can be correlated over time.

    4.1.1. Spatial Redundancy

    The techniques aimed at exploiting spatial redundancy in WSN-based applications
    are known as

    sensor fusion techniques. Sensor fusion deals with sensor data from sensors in
    the same monitoring

    area. Through processes of comparison, combination and/or smart voting schemes,
    it may be

    possible to detect faulty behaviors, erroneous information and derive a corrected
    observation from the

    remaining (considered correct) data samples [37–39].

    Sensor fusion is realized by employing a collection of techniques, such as classical
    Bayesian,

    Dempster–Shafer inference, artiﬁcial neural networks and fuzzy logic. The less
    mature techniques

    are dominated by heuristic and ad hoc methods. The major algorithm categories
    and techniques are

    discussed in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2.

    Sensor fusion is very useful in several situations, in particular in the following:
    (a) when some

    sensors measure correctly the intended phenomena, but others do not, due to failures;
    (b) when all

    sensors measure correctly, but some respond to a different phenomenology; (c)
    when the data of a

    sensor may be masked or counter measured with respect to one sensor, but not to
    another; (d) when

    one sensor may be blocked or unable to measure, but another sensor located elsewhere
    may have the

    correct data. In this case, the data from the sensor with the correct view may
    be combined with past

    information from the blocked sensor to update the overall measurements.

    The work in Reference [40] categorizes multi-sensor data fusion systems regarding
    what is

    observed by several sensors. Data fusion can take place:

    1.

    across sensors when several sensors observe the same variable; for instance, when
    the temperature

    of a particular object is monitored by a set of temperature sensors;

    2.

    across attributes when sensors observe several quantities related with one event;
    for instance,

    when measurements of water temperature and water conductivity are combined to
    deﬁne the

    water salinity;

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    13 of 23

    3.

    across domains when sensors observe one speciﬁc attribute in several places. An
    example

    is when sensors in different places measure the temperature and the measured values
    are

    somehow correlated.

    4.

    across time when new readings are fused with past data. For example, historical
    information from

    a former calibration can be incorporated to make adjustments on current measurements.
    Note

    that this is a particular case that applies to systems with single sensors, which
    we speciﬁcally

    discuss later as a form of temporal redundancy.

    The work in Reference [41] provides a slightly different classiﬁcation of a multi-sensor
    data fusion

    system, which partially overlaps with the previous classiﬁcation. They consider
    that sensor fusion

    can be:

    1.

    competitive when every sensor conveys an autonomous reading of the same variable.
    The purpose

    of this type of fusion is to diminish the effects of uncertain and incorrect monitoring.

    Competitive fusion corresponds to sensor fusion across sensors, in the terminology
    of [40];

    2.

    cooperative when the data measured by many autonomous sensors is utilized to infer
    information

    that would not be accessible through each of the sensors. This corresponds to
    sensor fusion

    across attributes;

    3.

    complementary when sensors are not directly dependent, but might be merged with
    the

    speciﬁc goal of providing a more comprehensive view of what the network is trying
    to observe.

    Thus, complementary fusion can assist in solving the incompleteness problem. This
    category

    does not entirely match the categories by [40]; it is closer to sensor fusion
    across attributes, but

    the idea is not to extract information, but to complement it.

    From the above, it is clear that data fusion can take place in many ways and for
    different purposes,

    some of which are not speciﬁcally concerned with dependability issues, but rather
    functional issues.

    This is the case of cooperative sensor fusion, whose the objective is to derive
    new information rather

    than correcting the existing information.

    Unfortunately, sensor fusion is not always possible. For instance, when considering
    monitoring

    activities over a wide physical area, it may be better or even necessary (namely
    for cost-effectiveness

    reasons) to scatter the sensors in pre-identiﬁed points according to area dynamics
    expertise and local

    knowledge, to cover the most signiﬁcant events. For instance, this is often the
    case when monitoring

    water bodies [42], because of their typically large extension and the involved
    complex water dynamics,

    requiring expert knowledge when determining the deployment locations scattered
    to cover the highly

    variable environmental dynamics. Moreover, water monitoring usually requires costly
    sensors [43],

    which makes it infeasible to have more than one in a conﬁned area. Exploiting
    sensor fusion in these

    conditions is thus very hard or even impossible.

    Even when sensor fusion can be opted as an alternative for achieving increased
    dependability,

    there are a number of technical problems that may have to be addressed. For example,
    when monitoring

    environmental processes with fast dynamics, it may be necessary that all measurements
    are obtained

    at roughly the same time [37] so that they can be correlated. However, timing
    aspects are hard to

    deal with in distributed settings, and issues like network delays or incorrect
    clock synchronization of

    sensor nodes, if not accounted for during system design, can lead to incorrect
    data being produced

    by sensor fusion algorithms. Given the real-time nature of sensor data, there
    is a temporal validity

    interval during which the difference between the measured data value and the real
    value is acceptable

    for the application. After this temporal validity interval, data become outdated
    and must be discarded.

    Therefore, data should be timestamped as soon as they are collected, and the temporal
    validity interval

    must be known at design time. This will allow setting up mechanisms to discard
    outdated data.

    The clocks of the different nodes in the system must be synchronized and the precision
    (the maximum

    difference between all of the clocks) must also be known and taken into account
    when deciding

    whether some sensor data are already outdated. Dependable sensor fusion thus requires
    additional

    design efforts, to adapt the solution to the speciﬁc application characteristics
    and requirements.

    4.1.2. Value Redundancy

    While sensor fusion relies on the physical (space) redundancy provided by the
    existence of several

    sensors, it is possible to consider data fusion [44,45] as an alternative approach.
    It does not require

    physically redundant sensor nodes, but relies on the value redundancy provided
    by extra information,

    obtained by other means. The notions of sensor fusion and (multi-sensor) data
    fusion are often used

    interchangeably. In fact, data fusion can be considered a generalization of sensor
    fusion, when data

    fusion is applied to multi-sensor data. Data fusion, in general, is related to
    the fusion of data, no matter

    its source, whereas sensor fusion (or multi-sensor data fusion) describes the
    use of more than one

    sensor in a multi-sensor system to enhance the accuracy of measured data or to
    handle missing data.

    The process of data fusion deals with the identiﬁcation, association, correlation,
    estimation and

    combination of spatially- and temporally-indexed data or information from numerous
    inputs with

    the speciﬁc goal of enhancing the analysis and understanding of this information.
    The techniques

    employed for data fusion are essentially the ones referred to for sensor fusion,
    which are discussed

    below. However, from a dependability perspective, it is important to note that
    data fusion opens new

    perspectives (in comparison to sensor fusion) regarding exploitable redundancy.
    We refer, in particular,

    to two forms of value redundancy that are exploitable with data fusion:

    •

    Signal analysis or analytical redundancy: This is used to monitor parameters such
    as frequency

    response, signal noise and amplitude change velocity among others [46]. It is
    a robust approach in

    the case of strange behavior in a controlled system. If there is a strong variability
    of a variable, then

    a sensor is categorized as faulty (or the system under monitoring has been altered).
    This necessarily

    requires some bounds to be established a priori, against which the parameters
    can be fused to

    perform the intended classiﬁcation.

    •

    Model-based redundancy: With the help of simulation/mathematical models of the
    monitored

    system, it is possible to obtain values to validate the measurements. The author
    in Reference [47]

    was a big promoter of this type of redundancy, where the system model calculates
    the measured

    variable, and then it, is compared to the sensor measurement.

    One potential difﬁculty in applying model-based redundancy is deﬁning relevant
    and accurate

    models. The problem becomes even more difﬁcult when these models characterize
    physical

    processes that change over time, which is often the case when monitoring environmental
    systems.

    Forecasting modeling techniques include simulation, estimation and syntactic methods
    [48]. Simulation

    is used when the physical characteristics to be measured can be accurately and
    predictably modeled.

    These models can be used in all types of scenarios, but most studies present examples
    based on

    terrestrial (indoor) applications [49], whereas the theme of the work herein concentrates
    on the

    complexity of the aquatic environment (e.g., water circulation). It is for this
    exact reason that current

    aquatic systems do not support real-time model-based data fusion [50]. Ideally,
    at run-time, a

    forecasting model represents a reference to validate the sensing data, which can
    also be applied

    for optimization and planning [51].

    4.1.3. Temporal Redundancy

    In WSN applications, sensor nodes continuously send new measurements of the monitored

    network, typically in a periodic way, to satisfy the temporal accuracy requirements
    of the application.

    The sequential measurements arriving at the sink or processing node constitute
    a time series

    to which data processing techniques can be applied with dependability objectives.
    In other words,

    if past measurements are considered historical data, then sensor fusion techniques
    can be applied to

    fuse the historical data with the current measurement. For instance, it is usual
    that noise reduction

    techniques are applied to single data streams, as a preliminary data enhancement
    step before any

    other data processing algorithms are applied. Outlier detection techniques [52]
    are also commonly

    applied to single data streams, detecting a faulty measurement when it deviates
    too much from the

    recent measurement history. Given the deviations caused by intrinsic noise and
    complex failure modes

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    15 of 23

    affecting the transducing process [53], choosing the adequate margins to achieve
    accurate outlier

    detection is usually a difﬁcult problem. One approach to this problem is to use
    detection patterns

    rather than thresholds, applied to the incoming data stream. This approach allows
    detecting other

    phenomena, in addition to or instead of outliers [54]. Interestingly, outlier
    detection is a problem

    common to several areas including network intrusion, fraud detection, performance
    assessment and

    weather forecasting, among others [55].

    The identiﬁcation of outliers contributes to improving the data fusion processes
    and hence the

    quality of the resulting data. If performed by intermediate nodes, it may also
    contribute to enhancing

    the network performance by preventing the transmission of messages containing
    outliers (thus

    transforming outlier faults into omission faults, possibly a good strategy in
    systems with redundant

    information sources).

    We note that temporal redundancy and value redundancy strategies, as described
    here, can be

    combined with spatial redundancy in a single system.

    4.2. A Taxonomy for Dependability-Oriented Data Quality in WSNs

    To help the reader understanding the main dimensions, aspects and techniques that
    are related to

    the problem of achieving data quality and dependability in WSNs, we provide in
    Figure 4 a schema

    with a tree-like organization of the relevant taxonomy. Note that the redundancy
    approaches presented

    earlier serve as a base for the application of the techniques described ahead.

    We consider three main dimensions that are relevant when addressing the problem
    of data quality

    and dependability improvement: goals to be achieved, functions to be performed
    and techniques to

    be applied.

    We identify two distinct goals. The ﬁrst consists of improving the quality of
    data, which is the

    most common in WSN applications that aim at satisfying non-functional requirements
    (often not

    explicitly speciﬁed), like reliable or safe operation. The second goal is less
    common. It consists of

    estimating the quality of data to enable assessing if non-functional requirements
    are satisﬁed. Although

    it may not be easy to explicitly deﬁne these requirements, the advantage is that
    it becomes possible to

    deﬁne mechanisms to mitigate the negative effects of deviations from the speciﬁcation.
    For instance,

    users can be notiﬁed that the application is not working properly, or the application
    may be stopped in

    a fail-safe state instead of performing some unsafe operation.

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    16 of 23

    To meet these goals, it is necessary to execute speciﬁc functions, which we classify
    into two

    categories: state oriented and data oriented. State-oriented functions are meant
    to evaluate the health

    of system components, in particular sensors (or sensor nodes), on the assumption
    that this health is

    affected by faults. Several fault detection functions are thus considered, to
    deal with the different

    failure modes identiﬁed in Section 3.2. These functions are important to both
    improve and estimate

    the quality of data, respectively by providing information that allows differentiating
    good and bad

    information sources in sensor fusion processes and by allowing distinguishing
    the quality of results

    obtained with source components in different health conditions. Data-oriented
    functions include all

    those that are meant to process sensor data, namely (but not exclusively) to calibrate,
    ﬁlter, correct or

    reconstruct data that are affected by faults. Calibration performs an automatic
    adjustment of values,

    for instance to compensate the effect of an offset. Filtering can be used to remove
    outliers or noise

    effects. Correction allows modifying values, for instance when it is know that
    they are drifting from

    the real values or that they are trimmed. Reconstruction is helpful for instance
    when a value is missing

    or when it is removed due to being an outlier and a replacement value needs to
    be produced. All of

    these functions are meant to improve the quality of data, rather than estimating
    this quality. They can

    be combined with each other and also with state-oriented functions, for better
    results concerning data

    quality improvement.

    There is a vast range of techniques and speciﬁc algorithms that may be employed
    to process sensor

    data and perform the mentioned functions. In this survey, we go through the main
    ones, providing

    illustrating references, and considering the two broad categories of supervised
    and unsupervised

    techniques. No matter the function to which it contributes, when a technique requires
    model training

    and training datasets, it is characterized as a supervised learning technique.
    In this category, the

    constructed and trained models are used at run-time to classify data, estimate
    new values and correct

    existing data, among other. On the other hand, unsupervised techniques are characterized
    by directly

    inferring the possible relations between data, without the need for a correcting
    model output reference.

    In the following sections, we include examples to help the reader understanding
    that for a given

    problem involving data quality issues, it may be possible to use multiple solutions
    or techniques.

    For instance, in [56] Kreibich et al. present two solutions for the evaluation
    of sensor-fusion quality in

    an industrial WSN that suffers from temporary losses of data and interferences
    in data streams, using

    fuzzy logic and Dempster–Shafer theory. Moreover, the authors mention that other
    techniques could

    be used (such as Bayesian, Kalman ﬁlter, artiﬁcial neural network or voting fusion).

    4.2.1. Supervised Techniques

    Since data fusion is a concept that exists in works dated from the 1980s until
    now, many authors

    present data fusion taxonomies for detection, classiﬁcation and identiﬁcation
    algorithms [45,57–59].

    These are low-level processing algorithms that can be applied in sensor nodes
    of a WSN. The goals

    here are to detect if an object is present, to classify the object and to identify
    it as accurately as possible.

    Within the supervised techniques, we group the major algorithm categories into
    feature-based

    inference techniques and techniques based on behavioral models, as illustrated
    in the scheme

    of Figure 4.

    Feature-based inference techniques achieve information mapping through classiﬁcation
    or

    detection. An example is the use of statistical knowledge about an object or information
    about

    its features, as a means for its identiﬁcation.

    These techniques can be further partitioned into

    several classes. In the following paragraphs, we will refer to some of the most
    frequently-used

    techniques, namely parametric such as Bayesian inference, Dempster–Shafer evidential
    theory (DST)

    and Kalman ﬁlters, and artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN), which is a well-known
    information theoretic

    technique. We note that there are many other machine learning techniques that
    may be of use,

    such as entropy-measuring techniques, pattern recognition, parametric templates,
    ﬁgures of merit,

    whose description falls out of the scope of this survey (we refer the interested
    reader, for example, to

    Reference [45], for further details on feature-based methods for information fusion
    in sensor networks).

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    Bayesian inference techniques use likelihood models applied to collected data
    to make deductions

    about observed quantities and even gain insights about quantities that have not
    been observed.

    Bayesian inference is used to solve the problem of efﬁcient data gathering in
    sensor networks. The work

    in Reference [60] used this approach in a temperature and pressure sensor network
    composed of

    500 nodes, to solve the problem of missing data, and to infer that missing information.
    The work in

    Reference [61] used a Bayesian-network-based approach to detect global outliers
    in an environmental

    monitoring network. Bayesian inference is a computationally-complex process, in
    which learning the

    classiﬁcation model can be challenging, if there is a large number of correlations
    in the WSN.

    The difﬁculty and uncertainty included in integrating sets of data gathered from
    numerous sources

    promoted the development of alternatives to Bayesian inference. Among them, Dempster–Shafer

    theory (DST) has turned out to be one of the more considered [62,63], for the
    most part because of the

    fundamental Dempster’s combination rule [64]. The biggest beneﬁt of this method
    is the simplicity of

    consolidating possibly contradictory evidence, independently of whether it was
    collected as direct or

    indirect data. DST adapts better to the situations than the Bayesian approach
    as no former probabilities

    must be presumed regarding the potential node behavior, and acceptance of a theory
    does not deﬁne

    rejection of the contrasting proposition, which allows handling contradictory
    indications quantitatively.

    In addition, Reference [65] studied a DST approach to evaluate sensor nodes misbehavior.

    Kalman ﬁltering is a well-known estimation-based approach to solve data quality
    problems in

    WSNs. One recent example [66] presents an algorithm to correct rough and missing
    information

    grounded on Kalman ﬁltering to surpass the issue with querying faulty information
    and to enhance

    the exactness of data in a 1000-node WSN in a synthetic environment. Another example
    is presented

    in Reference [67], in the context of an aquatic monitoring application, in which
    Kalman ﬁltering was

    used with forecasting algorithms to assess the quality of the monitoring data
    series.

    Artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) are hardware or software systems that need a training
    process

    consisting of mapping input information to target values or classes. The conversion
    of this input

    information into the yields is executed by artiﬁcial neurons that try to imitate
    the complicated, nonlinear

    and hugely parallel procedures that happen in natural sensory systems. ANNs have
    been used in WSNs

    for the most varied applications, many of which are related to fault-detection
    [68–70]. In consonance

    with the theme of the work herein, [71] presented an ANN-based approach to detect
    disaster events

    through an environmental sensor network. Additionally, [72] presents another ANN-based
    approach

    to detect biofouling events (thus, fault events) in an aquatic sensor network.

    The behavioral (cognitive-based) models group encompasses techniques that attempt
    to imitate

    and mechanize the decision-making procedures utilized by human analysts. These
    include event

    algebra, rule-based systems and fuzzy logic. The latter technique is the most
    studied and applied,

    which justiﬁes our particular attention to it.

    According to [73], fuzzy set theory allows for imprecise knowledge to be mathematically
    treated

    by making it easier to represent or classify system state variable information.
    The use of fuzzy

    associative memory (also known as production rules) allows a proposition to have
    a membership

    value in a given class ranging from zero (absolutely does not belong in the category)
    to one (absolutely

    belongs in the category). An expert speciﬁes the production rules and fuzzy sets
    that represent the

    characteristics of each input and output variable. Fuzzy data fusion application
    to WSNs has at least

    as much popularity as ANN-based fusion; therefore, its applications range from
    fault detection [74–76]

    to applications in industrial WSNs [77], the environment [78] and aquatic-related
    WSNs [79].

    There are some other mathematical approaches that have been developed in recent
    years, which

    include random set theory, conditional algebra and relational event algebra [48].

    Random set theory complements the existing theories of random vectors and of random
    functions

    serving as a mechanism for modeling observed phenomena, which are sets rather
    than precise points.

    It can be applied to incorporate ambiguous evidence (e.g., natural language reports
    and rules) and

    various expert system methods into multi-sensor estimation. Conditional event
    algebra refers to

    sets with one or more ﬁnitary operations deﬁned on it that satisfy a list of axioms,
    whose domain

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    18 of 23

    consists of logical objects using a type of probabilistic calculus suited for
    contingency problems such

    as knowledge-based rules and contingent decision making. Relational event algebra
    is an extension

    of conditional event algebra where functions of probabilities formally representing
    single event

    probabilities represent actual relational events considering appropriately determined
    larger probability

    spaces, providing a systematic basis for solving problems involving pooling of
    evidence.

    4.2.2. Unsupervised Techniques

    There are several unsupervised data processing techniques (Figure 4), which serve,
    just

    like supervised techniques, to perform the needed functions in WSN-based monitoring
    systems,

    like detection, ﬁltering or correction.

    Various statistical analysis methods can be used as unsupervised techniques for
    data processing.

    For instance, the work in [80] resorts to statistical analysis to identify events,
    recognize observation

    errors and predict absent measurements in ecological WSNs. The proposed method
    requires learning

    statistical distributions of differences between measurements of a sensor and
    those of its neighbors,

    as well as between sequences of single-sensor measurements. According to the author,
    there is a

    large degree of spatiotemporal correlation in scalar physical variables, which
    provides a spectrum

    of oscillations between adjoining or successive readings with little differences.
    Based on successive

    readings, it is possible to learn their distribution and then detect outliers
    when a reading value is lower

    than a determined threshold, in the statistical signiﬁcance test.

    Clustering techniques are quite common in WSN-based applications. The general
    procedure

    is to integrate analogous information into groups with identical comportment.
    Data not belonging

    to these clusters or belonging to a smaller cluster would be considered outliers,
    if this is the goal.

    A simple and well-known clustering algorithm is the nearest neighbor, which associates
    the most

    similar measurements. For example, the approach was used by [81] to handle unsupervised
    outlier

    detection and, in particular, to identify global-wise outliers. Every node utilizes
    distance similitude

    to locally distinguish anomalous readings and transferring those readings to the
    nearby nodes for

    conﬁrmation. These nearby nodes will repeat this process until the entire network
    ultimately agrees

    on the overall anomalous readings. The downside of this method is the lack of
    scalability to large-scale

    networks. The most used method to measure the similarity between two data instances
    is the Euclidean

    distance. For instance, this is used in [82] in the context of target classiﬁcation
    in a multi-channel

    seismic network.

    The spectral decomposition-based approach aims at deﬁning standard behaviors in
    the data by

    utilizing principal component analysis (PCA). PCA allows decreasing the magnitude
    of an information

    set in which there are many interrelated variables, while holding as much as could
    be expected of the

    variety present in the set. The work in Reference [83] proposed a PCA-based method
    to address the

    data integrity arising from the imprecision triggered by faulty sensor nodes.
    The method requires a

    model of the standard behavior to be built a priori, by selecting appropriate
    principal components

    (PCs), and allows the detection of outliers.

    Voting methods are useful to fuse information from several sensors, particularly
    when applied to

    detection and classiﬁcation declarations from multiple sensors. These declarations
    are treated as votes,

    to which majority, plurality or decision-tree rules are applied to obtain a result
    that is more dependable

    than what would be obtained with a single sensor output [48]. This allows, for
    instance, masking false

    alarms when the sensors are used to detect the occurrence of some event, thus
    preventing premature

    reactions or countermeasures. In this sense, voting methods are also appropriate
    for fault-detection, to

    decide which node is the faulty one [84,85]. Finally, they are used in several
    other application contexts,

    such as WSN security [86] and sensor faults in on-body sensor networks [87].

    5. Conclusions

    Assuring the quality of sensor data is important in WSN-based monitoring applications.
    In the

    last decade, this dependability aspect has been explicitly or implicitly addressed
    in many works,

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    19 of 23

    notably by exploiting the redundancy provided by the multiple sensor nodes typically
    existing in

    a WSN. Various speciﬁc problems need to be addressed when aiming at a dependable
    WSN-based

    monitoring solution, from ensuring the reliability of the transducing process
    to achieving a correct

    interpretation of data collected from several correlated sensors.

    In this paper, we present an encompassing perspective of the several facets of
    the problem,

    focusing on dependability aspects speciﬁc to individual sensors, to the network
    that interconnects

    the sensor nodes and the processing nodes and to the processing tasks that are
    performed within the

    processing nodes. This separation of concerns allows one to: (a) clearly expose
    the possible causes

    of data quality loss from the source to the ﬁnal output; (b) describe speciﬁc
    mitigation solutions;

    (c) provide a dependability perspective on what can be explicitly done to achieve
    improved data

    quality and assess this quality. Particular focus is given to the different forms
    of redundancy that may

    be exploited to achieve the dependability objectives: spatial, value and temporal
    redundancy. These are

    intrinsically related to the many sensor and data fusion techniques commonly employed,
    also surveyed

    in the paper. We provide many references on publications with theoretical and
    practical applications

    of the techniques, chosen to illustrate the multitude of options that are studied
    to solve directly or

    indirectly data quality problems. A speciﬁc outlook on data quality issues and
    open problems in water

    monitoring applications is ﬁnally given.

  explanation: This paper presents a mathematical theory of evidence based on Dempster-Shafer's
    theory to fuse data from multiple sources, considering uncertainty and imprecision.
    It focuses on the application of this theory to medical image segmentation, specifically
    for classifying brain tissues in pathological dual-echo MR images. The method
    assigns mass functions to data based on gray-level histograms and incorporates
    the possibility of partial volume effects.

    evidence theory for data fusion in medical imaging. Examples are provided to show
    its ability to take into account a large variety of situations, which actually
    often occur and are not always well managed by classical approaches nor by previous
    applications of Dempster-Shafer theory in medical imaging. The modelization of
    both uncertainty and imprecision, the introduction of possible partial or global
    ignorance, the computation of conflict between images, the possible introduction
    of a priori information are all powerful aspects of this theory, which deserve
    to be more exploited in medical image processing. They may be of great influence
    on the final decision. They are illustrated on a simple example for classifying
    brain tissues in pathological dual echo MR images. In particular, partial volume
    effect can be properly managed by this approach. Previous article in issue Next

    \ This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution\
    \ License,\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in\
    \ any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nThe integration of\
    \ data and knowledge from several sources is known as data fusion. This paper\
    \ summarizes the state of the data\nfusion field and describes the most relevant\
    \ studies. We first enumerate and explain different classification schemes for\
    \ data fusion.\nThen, the most common algorithms are reviewed. These methods and\
    \ algorithms are presented using three different categories: (i)\ndata association,\
    \ (ii) state estimation, and (iii) decision fusion.\n1. Introduction\nIn general,\
    \ all tasks that demand any type of parameter\nestimation from multiple sources\
    \ can benefit from the use\nof data/information fusion methods. The terms information\n\
    fusion and data fusion are typically employed as synonyms;\nbut in some scenarios,\
    \ the term data fusion is used for\nraw data (obtained directly from the sensors)\
    \ and the term\ninformation fusion is employed to define already processed\ndata.\
    \ In this sense, the term information fusion implies a\nhigher semantic level\
    \ than data fusion. Other terms associ-\nated with data fusion that typically\
    \ appear in the literature\ninclude decision fusion, data combination, data aggregation,\n\
    multisensor data fusion, and sensor fusion.\nResearchers in this field agree that\
    \ the most accepted\ndefinition of data fusion was provided by the Joint Directors\n\
    of Laboratories (JDL) workshop [1]: “A multi-level process\ndealing with the association,\
    \ correlation, combination of data\nand information from single and multiple sources\
    \ to achieve\nrefined position, identify estimates and complete and timely\nassessments\
    \ of situations, threats and their significance.”\nHall and Llinas [2] provided\
    \ the following well-known\ndefinition of data fusion: “data fusion techniques\
    \ combine data\nfrom multiple sensors and related information from associated\n\
    databases to achieve improved accuracy and more specific\ninferences than could\
    \ be achieved by the use of a single sensor\nalone.”\nBriefly, we can define data\
    \ fusion as a combination of\nmultiple sources to obtain improved information;\
    \ in this\ncontext, improved information means less expensive, higher\nquality,\
    \ or more relevant information.\nData fusion techniques have been extensively\
    \ employed\non multisensor environments with the aim of fusing and\naggregating\
    \ data from different sensors; however, these tech-\nniques can also be applied\
    \ to other domains, such as text\nprocessing. The goal of using data fusion in\
    \ multisensor envi-\nronments is to obtain a lower detection error probability\
    \ and\na higher reliability by using data from multiple distributed\nsources.\n\
    The available data fusion techniques can be classified into\nthree nonexclusive\
    \ categories: (i) data association, (ii) state\nestimation, and (iii) decision\
    \ fusion. Because of the large\nnumber of published papers on data fusion, this\
    \ paper does\nnot aim to provide an exhaustive review of all of the studies;\n\
    instead, the objective is to highlight the main steps that are\ninvolved in the\
    \ data fusion framework and to review the most\ncommon techniques for each step.\n\
    The remainder of this paper continues as follows. The\nnext section provides various\
    \ classification categories for data\nfusion techniques. Then, Section 3 describes\
    \ the most com-\nmon methods for data association tasks. Section 4 provides\n\
    a review of techniques under the state estimation category.\nNext, the most common\
    \ techniques for decision fusion are\nenumerated in Section 5. Finally, the conclusions\
    \ obtained\n2\nThe Scientific World Journal\nfrom reviewing the different methods\
    \ are highlighted in\nSection 6.\n2. Classification of Data Fusion Techniques\n\
    Data fusion is a multidisciplinary area that involves several\nfields, and it\
    \ is difficult to establish a clear and strict classifi-\ncation. The employed\
    \ methods and techniques can be divided\naccording to the following criteria:\n\
    (1) attending to the relations between the input data\nsources, as proposed by\
    \ Durrant-Whyte [3]. These\nrelations can be defined as (a) complementary, (b)\n\
    redundant, or (3) cooperative data;\n(2) according to the input/output data types\
    \ and their\nnature, as proposed by Dasarathy [4];\n(3) following an abstraction\
    \ level of the employed data:\n(a) raw measurement, (b) signals, and (c) characteris-\n\
    tics or decisions;\n(4) based on the different data fusion levels defined by the\n\
    JDL;\n(5) Depending on the architecture type: (a) centralized,\n(b) decentralized,\
    \ or (c) distributed.\n2.1. Classification Based on the Relations between the\
    \ Data\nSources. Based on the relations of the sources (see Figure 1),\nDurrant-Whyte\
    \ [3] proposed the following classification\ncriteria:\n(1) complementary: when\
    \ the information provided by\nthe input sources represents different parts of\
    \ the\nscene and could thus be used to obtain more complete\nglobal information.\
    \ For example, in the case of visual\nsensor networks, the information on the\
    \ same target\nprovided by two cameras with different fields of view\nis considered\
    \ complementary;\n(2) redundant: when two or more input sources provide\ninformation\
    \ about the same target and could thus be\nfused to increment the confidence.\
    \ For example, the\ndata coming from overlapped areas in visual sensor\nnetworks\
    \ are considered redundant;\n(3) cooperative: when the provided information is\
    \ com-\nbined into new information that is typically more\ncomplex than the original\
    \ information. For example,\nmulti-modal (audio and video) data fusion is consid-\n\
    ered cooperative.\n2.2. Dasarathy’s Classification. One of the most well-known\n\
    data fusion classification systems was provided by Dasarathy\n[4] and is composed\
    \ of the following five categories (see\nFigure 2):\n(1) data in-data out (DAI-DAO):\
    \ this type is the most\nbasic or elementary data fusion method that is con-\n\
    sidered in classification. This type of data fusion\nprocess inputs and outputs\
    \ raw data; the results\nare typically more reliable or accurate. Data fusion\
    \ at\nthis level is conducted immediately after the data are\ngathered from the\
    \ sensors. The algorithms employed\nat this level are based on signal and image\
    \ processing\nalgorithms;\n(2) data in-feature out (DAI-FEO): at this level, the\
    \ data\nfusion process employs raw data from the sources\nto extract features\
    \ or characteristics that describe an\nentity in the environment;\n(3) feature\
    \ in-feature out (FEI-FEO): at this level, both\nthe input and output of the data\
    \ fusion process are\nfeatures. Thus, the data fusion process addresses a\nset\
    \ of features with to improve, refine or obtain new\nfeatures. This process is\
    \ also known as feature fusion,\nsymbolic fusion, information fusion or intermediate-\n\
    level fusion;\n(4) feature in-decision out (FEI-DEO): this level obtains a\nset\
    \ of features as input and provides a set of decisions\nas output. Most of the\
    \ classification systems that\nperform a decision based on a sensor’s inputs fall\
    \ into\nthis category of classification;\n(5) Decision In-Decision Out (DEI-DEO):\
    \ This type of\nclassification is also known as decision fusion. It fuses\ninput\
    \ decisions to obtain better or new decisions.\nThe main contribution of Dasarathy’s\
    \ classification is the\nspecification of the abstraction level either as an input\
    \ or an\noutput, providing a framework to classify different methods\nor techniques.\n\
    2.3. Classification Based on the Abstraction Levels. Luo et al.\n[5] provided\
    \ the following four abstraction levels:\n(1) signal level: directly addresses\
    \ the signals that are\nacquired from the sensors;\n(2) pixel level: operates\
    \ at the image level and could be\nused to improve image processing tasks;\n(3)\
    \ characteristic: employs features that are extracted\nfrom the images or signals\
    \ (i.e., shape or velocity),\n(4) symbol: at this level, information is represented\
    \ as\nsymbols; this level is also known as the decision level.\nInformation fusion\
    \ typically addresses three levels of\nabstraction: (1) measurements, (2) characteristics,\
    \ and (3)\ndecisions. Other possible classifications of data fusion based\non\
    \ the abstraction levels are as follows:\n(1) low level fusion: the raw data are\
    \ directly provided\nas an input to the data fusion process, which provide\nmore\
    \ accurate data (a lower signal-to-noise ratio)\nthan the individual sources;\n\
    (2) medium level fusion: characteristics or features\n(shape, texture, and position)\
    \ are fused to obtain\nfeatures that could be employed for other tasks. This\n\
    level is also known as the feature or characteristic\nlevel;\nThe Scientific World\

    (3) high level fusion: this level, which is also known\nas decision fusion, takes\
    \ symbolic representations as\nsources and combines them to obtain a more accurate\n\
    decision. Bayesian’s methods are typically employed at\nthis level;\n(4) multiple\
    \ level fusion: this level addresses data pro-\nvided from different levels of\
    \ abstraction (i.e., when\na measurement is combined with a feature to obtain\
    \ a\ndecision).\n2.4. JDL Data Fusion Classification. This classification is the\n\
    most popular conceptual model in the data fusion commu-\nnity. It was originally\
    \ proposed by JDL and the American\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) [1]. These organizations\
    \ clas-\nsified the data fusion process into five processing levels, an\nassociated\
    \ database, and an information bus that connects\nthe five components (see Figure\
    \ 3). The five levels could be\ngrouped into two groups, low-level fusion and\
    \ high-level\nfusion, which comprise the following components:\n(i) sources: the\
    \ sources are in charge of providing\nthe input data. Different types of sources\
    \ can be\nemployed, such as sensors, a priori information (ref-\nerences or geographic\
    \ data), databases, and human\ninputs;\n(ii) human-computer interaction (HCI):\
    \ HCI is an inter-\nface that allows inputs to the system from the oper-\nators\
    \ and produces outputs to the operators. HCI\nincludes queries, commands, and\
    \ information on the\nobtained results and alarms;\n(iii) database management\
    \ system: the database manage-\nment system stores the provided information and\n\
    the fused results. This system is a critical component\nbecause of the large amount\
    \ of highly diverse infor-\nmation that is stored.\nIn contrast, the five levels\
    \ of data processing are defined as\nfollows:\n(1) level 0—source preprocessing:\
    \ source preprocessing\nis the lowest level of the data fusion process, and\n\
    it includes fusion at the signal and pixel levels. In\nthe case of text sources,\
    \ this level also includes the\ninformation extraction process. This level reduces\
    \ the\namount of data and maintains useful information for\nthe high-level processes;\n\
    (2) level 1—object refinement: object refinement employs\nthe processed data from\
    \ the previous level. Com-\nmon procedures of this level include spatio-temporal\n\
    alignment, association, correlation, clustering or\ngrouping techniques, state\
    \ estimation, the removal of\nfalse positives, identity fusion, and the combining\
    \ of\nfeatures that were extracted from images. The output\n4\nThe Scientific\

    \ of this stage are the object discrimination\n(classification and identification)\
    \ and object track-\ning (state of the object and orientation). This stage\ntransforms\
    \ the input information into consistent data\nstructures;\n(3) level 2—situation\
    \ assessment: this level focuses on\na higher level of inference than level 1.\
    \ Situation\nassessment aims to identify the likely situations given\nthe observed\
    \ events and obtained data. It establishes\nrelationships between the objects.\
    \ Relations (i.e.,\nproximity, communication) are valued to determine\nthe significance\
    \ of the entities or objects in a specific\nenvironment. The aim of this level\
    \ includes perform-\ning high-level inferences and identifying significant\nactivities\
    \ and events (patterns in general). The output\nis a set of high-level inferences;\n\
    (4) level 3—impact assessment: this level evaluates the\nimpact of the detected\
    \ activities in level 2 to obtain a\nproper perspective. The current situation\
    \ is evaluated,\nand a future projection is performed to identify\npossible risks,\
    \ vulnerabilities, and operational oppor-\ntunities. This level includes (1) an\
    \ evaluation of the\nrisk or threat and (2) a prediction of the logical\noutcome;\n\
    (5) level 4—process refinement: this level improves the\nprocess from level 0\
    \ to level 3 and provides resource\nand sensor management. The aim is to achieve\
    \ effi-\ncient resource management while accounting for task\npriorities, scheduling,\
    \ and the control of available\nresources.\nHigh-level fusion typically starts\
    \ at level 2 because the\ntype, localization, movement, and quantity of the objects\n\
    are known at that level. One of the limitations of the JDL\nmethod is how the\
    \ uncertainty about previous or subsequent\nresults could be employed to enhance\
    \ the fusion process\n(feedback loop). Llinas et al. [6] propose several refinements\n\
    and extensions to the JDL model. Blasch and Plano [7]\nproposed to add a new level\
    \ (user refinement) to support a\nhuman user in the data fusion loop. The JDL\
    \ model represents\nthe first effort to provide a detailed model and a common\n\
    terminology for the data fusion domain. However, because\ntheir roots originate\
    \ in the military domain, the employed\nterms are oriented to the risks that commonly\
    \ occur in\nthese scenarios. The Dasarathy model differs from the JDL\nmodel with\
    \ regard to the adopted terminology and employed\napproach. The former is oriented\
    \ toward the differences\namong the input and output results, independent of the\n\
    employed fusion method. In summary, the Dasarathy model\nprovides a method for\
    \ understanding the relations between\nthe fusion tasks and employed data, whereas\
    \ the JDL model\npresents an appropriate fusion perspective to design data\nfusion\
    \ systems.\n2.5. Classification Based on the Type of Architecture. One of\nthe\
    \ main questions that arise when designing a data fusion\nsystem is where the\
    \ data fusion process will be performed.\nBased on this criterion, the following\
    \ types of architectures\ncould be identified:\n(1) centralized architecture:\
    \ in a centralized architecture,\nthe fusion node resides in the central processor\
    \ that\nreceives the information from all of the input sources.\nTherefore, all\
    \ of the fusion processes are executed\nin a central processor that uses the provided\
    \ raw\nmeasurements from the sources. In this schema, the\nsources obtain only\
    \ the observationas measurements\nand transmit them to a central processor, where\
    \ the\ndata fusion process is performed. If we assume that\ndata alignment and\
    \ data association are performed\ncorrectly and that the required time to transfer\
    \ the\ndata is not significant, then the centralized scheme is\ntheoretically\
    \ optimal. However, the previous assump-\ntions typically do not hold for real\
    \ systems. Moreover,\nthe large amount of bandwidth that is required to send\n\
    raw data through the network is another disadvantage\nfor the centralized approach.\
    \ This issue becomes a\nbottleneck when this type of architecture is employed\n\
    for fusing data in visual sensor networks. Finally,\nthe time delays when transferring\
    \ the information\nbetween the different sources are variable and affect\nThe\
    \ Scientific World Journal\n5\nthe results in the centralized scheme to a greater\n\
    degree than in other schemes;\n(2) decentralized architecture: a decentralized\
    \ architec-\nture is composed of a network of nodes in which each\nnode has its\
    \ own processing capabilities and there is\nno single point of data fusion. Therefore,\
    \ each node\nfuses its local information with the information that\nis received\
    \ from its peers. Data fusion is performed\nautonomously, with each node accounting\
    \ for its local\ninformation and the information received from its\npeers. Decentralized\
    \ data fusion algorithms typically\ncommunicate information using the Fisher and\
    \ Shan-\nnon measurements instead of the object’s state [8];\nThe main disadvantage\
    \ of this architecture is the\ncommunication cost, which is \U0001D442(\U0001D45B\
    2) at each com-\nmunication step, where \U0001D45B is the number of nodes;\nadditionally,\
    \ the extreme case is considered, in which\neach node communicates with all of\
    \ its peers. Thus,\nthis type of architecture could suffer from scalability\n\
    problems when the number of nodes is increased;\n(3) distributed architecture:\
    \ in a distributed architecture,\nmeasurements from each source node are processed\n\
    independently before the information is sent to the\nfusion node; the fusion node\
    \ accounts for the infor-\nmation that is received from the other nodes. In other\n\
    words, the data association and state estimation are\nperformed in the source\
    \ node before the information\nis communicated to the fusion node. Therefore,\
    \ each\nnode provides an estimation of the object state based\non only their local\
    \ views, and this information is\nthe input to the fusion process, which provides\
    \ a\nfused global view. This type of architecture provides\ndifferent options\
    \ and variations that range from only\none fusion node to several intermediate\
    \ fusion nodes;\n(4) hierarchical architecture: other architectures com-\nprise\
    \ a combination of decentralized and distributed\nnodes, generating hierarchical\
    \ schemes in which the\ndata fusion process is performed at different levels in\n\
    the hierarchy.\nIn principle, a decentralized data fusion system is more\ndifficult\
    \ to implement because of the computation and\ncommunication requirements. However,\
    \ in practice, there is\nno single best architecture, and the selection of the\
    \ most\nappropriate architecture should be made depending on the\nrequirements,\
    \ demand, existing networks, data availability,\nnode processing capabilities,\
    \ and organization of the data\nfusion system.\nThe reader might think that the\
    \ decentralized and\ndistributed architectures are similar; however, they have\n\
    meaningful differences (see Figure 4). First, in a distributed\narchitecture,\
    \ a preprocessing of the obtained measurements is\nperformed, which provides a\
    \ vector of features as a result (the\nfeatures are fused thereafter). In contrast,\
    \ in the decentralized\narchitecture, the complete data fusion process is conducted\n\
    in each node, and each of the nodes provides a globally\nfused result. Second,\
    \ the decentralized fusion algorithms\ntypically communicate information, employing\
    \ the Fisher\nand Shannon measurements. In contrast, distributed algo-\nrithms\
    \ typically share a common notion of state (position,\nvelocity, and identity)\
    \ with their associated probabilities,\nwhich are used to perform the fusion process\
    \ [9]. Third,\nbecause the decentralized data fusion algorithms exchange\ninformation\
    \ instead of states and probabilities, they have\nthe advantage of easily separating\
    \ old knowledge from new\nknowledge. Thus, the process is additive, and the associative\n\
    meaning is not relevant when the information is received\nand fused. However,\
    \ in the distributed data fusion algorithms\n(i.e., distributed by Kalman Filter),\
    \ the state that is going\nto be fused is not associative, and when and how the\
    \ fused\nestimates are computed is relevant. Nevertheless, in contrast\nto the\
    \ centralized architectures, the distributed algorithms\nreduce the necessary\
    \ communication and computational\ncosts because some tasks are computed in the\
    \ distributed\nnodes before data fusion is performed in the fusion node.\n3. Data\
    \ Association Techniques\nThe data association problem must determine the set\
    \ of\nmeasurements that correspond to each target (see Figure 5).\nLet us suppose\
    \ that there are \U0001D442 targets that are being tracked\nby only one sensor\
    \ in a cluttered environment (by a cluttered\nenvironment, we refer to an environment\
    \ that has several\ntargets that are to close each other). Then, the data association\n\
    problem can be defined as follows:\n(i) each sensor’s observation is received\
    \ in the fusion\nnode at discrete time intervals;\n(ii) the sensor might not provide\
    \ observations at a specific\ninterval;\n(iii) some observations are noise, and\
    \ other observations\noriginate from the detected target;\n(iv) for any specific\
    \ target and in every time interval, we\ndo not know (a priori) the observations\
    \ that will be\ngenerated by that target.\nTherefore, the goal of data association\
    \ is to establish the\nset of observations or measurements that are generated\
    \ by\nthe same target over time. Hall and Llinas [2] provided the\nfollowing definition\
    \ of data association: “The process of assign\nand compute the weights that relates\
    \ the observations or tracks\n(A track can be defined as an ordered set of points\
    \ that follow\na path and are generated by the same target.) from one set to\n\
    the observation of tracks of another set.”\nAs an example of the complexity of\
    \ the data association\nproblem, if we take a frame-to-frame association and assume\n\
    that \U0001D440 possible points could be detected in all \U0001D45B frames, then\n\
    the number of possible sets is (\U0001D440!)\U0001D45B−1. Note that from all\n\
    of these possible solutions, only one set establishes the true\nmovement of the\
    \ \U0001D440 points.\nData association is often performed before the state\nestimation\
    \ of the detected targets. Moreover, it is a key\nstep because the estimation\
    \ or classification will behave\nincorrectly if the data association phase does\
    \ not work\ncoherently. The data association process could also appear in\nall\
    \ of the fusion levels, but the granularity varies depending\non the objective\
    \ of each level.\n6\nThe Scientific World Journal\nPreprocessing\nPreprocessing\n\

    \ based on the type of architecture.\nIn general, an exhaustive search of all\
    \ possible combina-\ntions grows exponentially with the number of targets; thus,\n\
    the data association problem becomes NP complete. The\nmost common techniques\
    \ that are employed to solve the data\nassociation problem are presented in the\
    \ following sections\n(from Sections 3.1 to 3.7).\n3.1. Nearest Neighbors and\
    \ K-Means. Nearest neighbor\n(NN) is the simplest data association technique.\
    \ NN is\na well-known clustering algorithm that selects or groups\nthe most similar\
    \ values. How close the one measurement is\nto another depends on the employed\
    \ distance metric and\ntypically depends on the threshold that is established\
    \ by the\ndesigner. In general, the employed criteria could be based on\n(1) an\
    \ absolute distance, (2) the Euclidean distance, or (3) a\nstatistical function\
    \ of the distance.\nNN is a simple algorithm that can find a feasible (approx-\n\
    imate) solution in a small amount of time. However, in a\ncluttered environment,\
    \ it could provide many pairs that have\nthe same probability and could thus produce\

    \ propagation [10]. Moreover, this algorithm has poor\nperformance in environments\
    \ in which false measurements\nare frequent, which are in highly noisy environments.\n\
    All neighbors use a similar technique, in which all of the\nmeasurements inside\
    \ a region are included in the tracks.\n\U0001D43E-Means [11] method is a well-known\
    \ modification of\nthe NN algorithm. \U0001D43E-Means divides the dataset values\
    \ into\n\U0001D43E different clusters. \U0001D43E-Means algorithm finds the best\
    \ local-\nization of the cluster centroids, where best means a centroid\nthat\
    \ is in the center of the data cluster. \U0001D43E-Means is an iterative\nalgorithm\
    \ that can be divided into the following steps:\n(1) obtain the input data and\
    \ the number of desired\nclusters (\U0001D43E);\n(2) randomly assign the centroid\
    \ of each cluster;\n(3) match each data point with the centroid of each\ncluster;\n\
    (4) move the cluster centers to the centroid of the cluster;\n(5) if the algorithm\
    \ does not converge, return to step (3).\n\U0001D43E-Means is a popular algorithm\
    \ that has been widely\nemployed; however, it has the following disadvantages:\n\
    (i) the algorithm does not always find the optimal solu-\ntion for the cluster\
    \ centers;\n(ii) the number of clusters must be known a priori and\none must assume\
    \ that this number is the optimum;\n(iii) the algorithm assumes that the covariance\
    \ of the\ndataset is irrelevant or that it has been normalized\nalready.\nThere\
    \ are several options for overcoming these limita-\ntions. For the first one,\
    \ it is possible to execute the algorithm\nseveral times and obtain the solution\
    \ that has less variance.\nFor the second one, it is possible to start with a\
    \ low value\nof \U0001D43E and increment the values of \U0001D43E until an adequate\
    \ result\nis obtained. The third limitation can be easily overcome by\nmultiplying\
    \ the data with the inverse of the covariance matrix.\nMany variations have been\
    \ proposed to Lloyd’s basic\n\U0001D43E-Means algorithm [11], which has a computational\
    \ upper\nbound cost of \U0001D442(\U0001D43E\U0001D45B), where \U0001D45B is the\
    \ number of input points\nand \U0001D43E is the number of desired clusters. Some\
    \ algorithms\nmodify the initial cluster assignments to improve the separa-\n\
    tions and reduce the number of iterations. Others introduce\nsoft or multinomial\
    \ clustering assignments using fuzzy logic,\nprobabilistic, or the Bayesian techniques.\
    \ However, most of\nthe previous variations still must perform several iterations\n\
    through the data space to converge to a reasonable solution.\nThis issue becomes\
    \ a major disadvantage in several real-\ntime applications. A new approach that\
    \ is based on having\na large (but still affordable) number of cluster candidates\n\
    compared to the desired \U0001D43E clusters is currently gaining\nattention. The\
    \ idea behind this computational model is that\nthe algorithm builds a good sketch\
    \ of the original data while\nreducing the dimensionality of the input space significantly.\n\
    In this manner, a weighted \U0001D43E-Means can be applied to the\nlarge candidate\
    \ clusters to derive a good clustering of the\noriginal data. Using this idea,\
    \ [12] presented an efficient\nand scalable \U0001D43E-Means algorithm that is\
    \ based on random\nprojections. This algorithm requires only one pass through\n\
    the input data to build the clusters. More specifically, if the\ninput data distribution\
    \ holds some separability requirements,\nthen the number of required candidate\
    \ clusters grows only\naccording to \U0001D442(log \U0001D45B), where \U0001D45B\
    \ is the number of observations\nin the original data. This salient feature makes\
    \ the algorithm\nscalable in terms of both the memory and computational\nrequirements.\n\
    3.2. Probabilistic Data Association. The probabilistic data\nassociation (PDA)\
    \ algorithm was proposed by Bar-Shalom\nand Tse [13] and is also known as the\
    \ modified filter of all\nneighbors. This algorithm assigns an association probability\n\
    to each hypothesis from a valid measurement of a target.\nA valid measurement\
    \ refers to the observation that falls in\nthe validation gate of the target at\
    \ that time instant. The\nvalidation gate, \U0001D6FE, which is the center around\
    \ the predicted\nmeasurements of the target, is used to select the set of basic\n\
    measurements and is defined as\n\U0001D6FE ≥ (\U0001D44D (\U0001D458) − ̂\U0001D467\

    \ and \U0001D443\U0001D454 is the validation\nprobability of a detected value.\n\
    In the PDA algorithm, the state estimation of the target is\ncomputed as a weighted\
    \ sum of the estimated state under all\nof the hypotheses. The algorithm can associate\
    \ different mea-\nsurements to one specific target. Thus, the association of the\n\
    different measurements to a specific target helps PDA to\nestimate the target\
    \ state, and the association probabilities\nare used as weights. The main disadvantages\
    \ of the PDA\nalgorithm are the following:\n(i) loss of tracks: because PDA ignores\
    \ the interference\nwith other targets, it sometimes could wrongly clas-\nsify\
    \ the closest tracks. Therefore, it provides a poor\nperformance when the targets\
    \ are close to each other\nor crossed;\n(ii) the suboptimal Bayesian approximation:\
    \ when the\nsource of information is uncertain, PDA is the sub-\noptimal Bayesian\
    \ approximation to the association\nproblem;\n(iii) one target: PDA was initially\
    \ designed for the asso-\nciation of one target in a low-cluttered environment.\n\
    The number of false alarms is typically modeled with\nthe Poisson distribution,\
    \ and they are assumed to be\ndistributed uniformly in space. PDA behaves incor-\n\
    rectly when there are multiple targets because the false\nalarm model does not\
    \ work well;\n(iv) track management: because PDA assumes that the\ntrack is already\
    \ established, algorithms must be pro-\nvided for track initialization and track\
    \ deletion.\nPDA is mainly good for tracking targets that do not\nmake abrupt\
    \ changes in their movement patterns. PDA will\nmost likely lose the target if\
    \ it makes abrupt changes in its\nmovement patterns.\n3.3. Joint Probabilistic\
    \ Data Association. Joint probabilistic\ndata association (JPDA) is a suboptimal\
    \ approach for tracking\nmultiple targets in cluttered environments [14]. JPDA\
    \ is\nsimilar to PDA, with the difference that the association\nprobabilities\
    \ are computed using all of the observations\nand all of the targets. Thus, in\
    \ contrast to PDA, JPDA\nconsiders various hypotheses together and combines them.\n\
    JPDA determines the probability \U0001D6FD\U0001D461\n\U0001D456(\U0001D458) that\
    \ measurement \U0001D456 is\noriginated from target \U0001D461, accounting for\
    \ the fact that under\nthis hypothesis, the measurement cannot be generated by\n\
    other targets. Therefore, for a known number of targets, it\nevaluates the different\
    \ options of the measurement-target\nassociation (for the most recent set of measurements)\
    \ and\ncombines them into the corresponding state estimation. If\nthe association\
    \ probability is known, then the Kalman filter\nupdating equation of the track\
    \ \U0001D461 can be written as\n̂\U0001D465\U0001D461 (\U0001D458 | \U0001D458\
    ) = ̂\U0001D465\U0001D461 (\U0001D458 | \U0001D458 − 1) + \U0001D43E (\U0001D458\
    ) V\U0001D461 (\U0001D458) ,\n(13)\nwhere ̂\U0001D465\U0001D461(\U0001D458 | \U0001D458\
    ) and ̂\U0001D465\U0001D461(\U0001D458 | \U0001D458 − 1) are the estimation and\n\
    prediction of target \U0001D461, and \U0001D43E(\U0001D458) is the filter gain.\
    \ The weighted\nThe Scientific World Journal\n9\nsum of the residuals associated\
    \ with the observation \U0001D45A(\U0001D458) of\ntarget \U0001D461 is as follows:\n\
    V\U0001D461 (\U0001D458) =\n\U0001D45A(\U0001D458)\n∑\n\U0001D456=1\n\U0001D6FD\

    where V\U0001D461\n\U0001D456 = \U0001D467\U0001D456(\U0001D458) − \U0001D43B\U0001D465\
    \U0001D461(\U0001D458 | \U0001D458 − 1). Therefore, this method\nincorporates\
    \ all of the observations (inside the neighborhood\nof the target’s predicted\
    \ position) to update the estimated\nposition by using a posterior probability\
    \ that is a weighted\nsum of residuals.\nThe main restrictions of JPDA are the\
    \ following:\n(i) a measurement cannot come from more than one\ntarget;\n(ii)\
    \ two measurements cannot be originated by the same\ntarget (at one time instant);\n\
    (iii) the sum of all of the measurements’ probabilities that\nare assigned to\
    \ one target must be 1: ∑\U0001D45A(\U0001D458)\n\U0001D456=0 \U0001D6FD\U0001D461\
    \n\U0001D456(\U0001D458) = 1.\nThe main disadvantages of JPDA are the following:\n\
    (i) it requires an explicit mechanism for track initial-\nization. Similar to\
    \ PDA, JPDA cannot initialize new\ntracks or remove tracks that are out of the\
    \ observation\narea;\n(ii) JPDA is a computationally expensive algorithm when\n\
    it is applied in environments that have multiple targets\nbecause the number of\
    \ hypotheses is incremented\nexponentially with the number of targets.\nIn general,\
    \ JPDA is more appropriate than MHT in\nsituations in which the density of false\
    \ measurements is high\n(i.e., sonar applications).\n3.4. Multiple Hypothesis\
    \ Test. The underlying idea of the\nmultiple hypothesis test (MHT) is based on\
    \ using more than\ntwo consecutive observations to make an association with\n\
    better results. Other algorithms that use only two consecutive\nobservations have\
    \ a higher probability of generating an error.\nIn contrast to PDA and JPDA, MHT\
    \ estimates all of the\npossible hypotheses and maintains new hypotheses in each\n\
    iteration.\nMHT was developed to track multiple targets in cluttered\nenvironments;\
    \ as a result, it combines the data association\nproblem and tracking into a unified\
    \ framework, becoming\nan estimation technique as well. The Bayes rule or the\n\
    Bayesian networks are commonly employed to calculate the\nMHT hypothesis. In general,\
    \ researchers have claimed that\nMHT outperforms JPDA for the lower densities\
    \ of false\npositives. However, the main disadvantage of MHT is the\ncomputational\
    \ cost when the number of tracks or false\npositives is incremented. Pruning the\
    \ hypothesis tree using\na window could solve this limitation.\nThe Reid [15]\
    \ tracking algorithm is considered the stan-\ndard MHT algorithm, but the initial\
    \ integer programming\nformulation of the problem is due to Morefield [16]. MHT\
    \ is\nan iterative algorithm in which each iteration starts with a set\nof correspondence\
    \ hypotheses. Each hypothesis is a collec-\ntion of disjoint tracks, and the prediction\
    \ of the target in the\nnext time instant is computed for each hypothesis. Next,\
    \ the\npredictions are compared with the new observations by using\na distance\
    \ metric. The set of associations established in each\nhypothesis (based on a\
    \ distance) introduces new hypotheses\nin the next iteration. Each new hypothesis\
    \ represents a new\nset of tracks that is based on the current observations.\n\
    Note that each new measurement could come from (i) a\nnew target in the visual\
    \ field of view, (ii) a target being tracked,\nor (iii) noise in the measurement\
    \ process. It is also possible\nthat a measurement is not assigned to a target\
    \ because the\ntarget disappears, or because it is not possible to obtain a\n\
    target measurement at that time instant.\nMHT maintains several correspondence\
    \ hypotheses for\neach target in each frame. If the hypothesis in the instant\n\
    \U0001D458 is represented by \U0001D43B(\U0001D458)\n=\n[ℎ\U0001D459(\U0001D458\

    −1; \U0001D44E\U0001D456(\U0001D458) is the \U0001D456th possible association\
    \ of the\ntrack to the object; \U0001D44D(\U0001D458) is the set of detections\
    \ of the current\nframe, and \U0001D450 is a normal constant.\nThe first term\

    \ the\ncurrent hypothesis is calculated.\nThe MHT algorithm has the ability to\
    \ detect a new\ntrack while maintaining the hypothesis tree structure. The\nprobability\

    , \U0001D443∘(\U0001D706) is the a priori probability of\nthe source signal, and\
    \ \U0001D443(\U0001D44D) is the probability of obtaining the\nset of detections\
    \ \U0001D44D.\nMHT considers all of the possibilities, including both\nthe track\
    \ maintenance and the initialization and removal\nof tracks in an integrated framework.\
    \ MHT calculates the\npossibility of having an object after the generation of\
    \ a set\nof measurements using an exhaustive approach, and the\nalgorithm does\
    \ not assume a fixed number of targets. The key\nchallenge of MHT is the effective\
    \ hypothesis management.\nThe baseline MHT algorithm can be extended as follows:\n\
    (i) use the hypothesis aggregation for missed targets births,\n10\nThe Scientific\
    \ World Journal\ncardinality tracking, and closely spaced objects; (ii) apply\n\
    a multistage MHT for improving the performance and\nrobustness in challenging\
    \ settings; and (iii) use a feature-\naided MHT for extended object surveillance.\n\
    The main disadvantage of this algorithm is the compu-\ntational cost, which grows\
    \ exponentially with the number of\ntracks and measurements. Therefore, the practical\
    \ implemen-\ntation of this algorithm is limited because it is exponential in\n\
    both time and memory.\nWith the aim of reducing the computational cost, [17]\n\
    presented a probabilistic MHT algorithm in which the\nassociations are considered\
    \ to be random variables that\nare statistically independent and in which performing\
    \ an\nexhaustive search enumeration is avoided. This algorithm is\nknown as PMHT.\
    \ The PMHT algorithm assumes that the\nnumber of targets and measurements is known.\
    \ With the\nsame goal of reducing the computational cost, [18] presented\nan efficient\
    \ implementation of the MHT algorithm. This\nimplementation was the first version\
    \ to be applied to perform\ntracking in visual environments. They employed the\
    \ Murty\n[19] algorithm to determine the best set of \U0001D458 hypotheses\nin\
    \ polynomial time, with the goal of tracking the points of\ninterest.\nMHT typically\
    \ performs the tracking process by employ-\ning only one characteristic, commonly\
    \ the position. The\nBayesian combination to use multiple characteristics was\n\
    proposed by Liggins II et al. [20].\nA linear-programming-based relaxation approach\
    \ to the\noptimization problem in MHT tracking was proposed inde-\npendently by\
    \ Coraluppi et al. [21] and Storms and Spieksma\n[22]. Joo and Chellappa [23]\
    \ proposed an association algo-\nrithm for tracking multiple targets in visual\
    \ environments.\nTheir algorithm is based on in MHT modification in which\na measurement\
    \ can be associated with more than one target,\nand several targets can be associated\
    \ with one measurement.\nThey also proposed a combinatorial optimization algorithm\n\
    to generate the best set of association hypotheses. Their\nalgorithm always finds\
    \ the best hypothesis, in contrast to\nother models, which are approximate. Coraluppi\
    \ and Carthel\n[24] presented a generalization of the MHT algorithm using\na recursion\
    \ over hypothesis classes rather than over a single\nhypothesis. This work has\
    \ been applied in a special case of\nthe multi-target tracking problem, called\
    \ cardinality tracking,\nin which they observed the number of sensor measurements\n\
    instead of the target states.\n3.5. Distributed Joint Probabilistic Data Association.\

    individual hypothesis and reflects the localization influence\nof the current\
    \ measurements in the joint hypotheses.\nThese equations are obtained assuming\
    \ that commu-\nnication exists after every observation, and there are only\napproximations\
    \ in the case in which communication is\nsporadic and when a substantial amount\

    \ is the high com-\nputational cost that is in the order of \U0001D442(\U0001D45B\
    \U0001D440), where \U0001D45B is the\nnumber of possible associations and \U0001D440\
    \ is the number of\nvariables to be estimated.\n3.7. Graphical Models. Graphical\
    \ models are a formalism for\nrepresenting and reasoning with probabilities and\
    \ indepen-\ndence. A graphical model represents a conditional decom-\nposition\
    \ of the joint probability. A graphical model can be\nrepresented as a graph in\
    \ which the nodes denote random\nvariables; the edges denote the possible dependence\
    \ between\nthe random variables, and the plates denote the replication of\na substructure,\
    \ with the appropriate indexing of the relevant\nvariables. The graph captures\
    \ the joint distribution over the\nrandom variables, which can be decomposed into\
    \ a product\nof factors that each depend on only a subset of variables. There\n\
    are two major classes of graphical models: (i) the Bayesian\nnetworks [28], which\
    \ are also known as the directed graphical\nmodels, and (ii) the Markov random\
    \ fields, which are also\nknown as undirected graphical models. The directed graph-\n\
    ical models are useful for expressing causal relationships\nbetween random variables,\
    \ whereas undirected models are\nbetter suited for expressing soft constraints\
    \ between random\nvariables. We refer the reader to the book of Koller and\nFriedman\
    \ [29] for more information on graphical models.\nA framework based on graphical\
    \ models can solve the\nproblem of distributed data association in synchronized\n\
    sensor networks with overlapped areas and where each sensor\nreceives noisy measurements;\
    \ this solution was proposed\nby Chen et al. [30, 31]. Their work is based on\
    \ graphical\nmodels that are used to represent the statistical dependence\nbetween\
    \ random variables. The data association problem is\ntreated as an inference problem\
    \ and solved by using the\nmax-product algorithm [32]. Graphical models represent\n\
    statistical dependencies between variables as graphs, and\nthe max-product algorithm\
    \ converges when the graph is\na tree structure. Moreover, the employed algorithm\
    \ could\nbe implemented in a distributed manner by exchanging\nmessages between\
    \ the source nodes in parallel. With this\nalgorithm, if each sensor has \U0001D45B\
    \ possible combinations of\nassociations and there are \U0001D440 variables to\
    \ be estimated, it has\na complexity of \U0001D442(\U0001D45B2\U0001D440), which\
    \ is reasonable and less than\nthe \U0001D442(\U0001D45B\U0001D440) complexity\
    \ of the MHT-D algorithm. However,\naspecial attention must be given to the correlated\
    \ variables\nwhen building the graphical model.\n4. State Estimation Methods\n\
    State estimation techniques aim to determine the state of\nthe target under movement\
    \ (typically the position) given\nthe observation or measurements. State estimation\
    \ tech-\nniques are also known as tracking techniques. In their general\nform,\
    \ it is not guaranteed that the target observations are\nrelevant, which means\
    \ that some of the observations could\nactually come from the target and others\
    \ could be only noise.\nThe state estimation phase is a common stage in data fusion\n\
    algorithms because the target’s observation could come from\ndifferent sensors\
    \ or sources, and the final goal is to obtain a\nglobal target state from the\
    \ observations.\nThe estimation problem involves finding the values of the\nvector\
    \ state (e.g., position, velocity, and size) that fits as much\nas possible with\
    \ the observed data. From a mathematical\nperspective, we have a set of redundant\
    \ observations, and\nthe goal is to find the set of parameters that provides the\n\
    best fit to the observed data. In general, these observations\nare corrupted by\
    \ errors and the propagation of noise in the\nmeasurement process. State estimation\
    \ methods fall under\nlevel 1 of the JDL classification and could be divided into\
    \ two\nbroader groups:\n(1) linear dynamics and measurements: here, the esti-\n\
    mation problem has a standard solution. Specifically,\nwhen the equations of the\
    \ object state and the mea-\nsurements are linear, the noise follows the Gaussian\n\
    distribution, and we do not refer to it as a clutter\nenvironment; in this case,\
    \ the optimal theoretical\nsolution is based on the Kalman filter;\n(2) nonlinear\
    \ dynamics: the state estimation problem\nbecomes difficult, and there is not\
    \ an analytical solu-\ntion to solve the problem in a general manner. In prin-\n\
    ciple, there are no practical algorithms available to\nsolve this problem satisfactorily.\n\
    Most of the state estimation methods are based on control\ntheory and employ the\
    \ laws of probability to compute a\nvector state from a vector measurement or\
    \ a stream of vector\nmeasurements. Next, the most common estimation methods\n\
    are presented, including maximum likelihood and maxi-\nmum posterior (Section\
    \ 4.1), the Kalman filter (Section 4.2),\nparticle filter (Section 4.3), the distributed\
    \ Kalman filter\n(Section 4.4), distributed particle filter (Section 4.5) and,\n\
    covariance consistency methods (Section 4.6).\n4.1. Maximum Likelihood and Maximum\
    \ Posterior. The max-\nimum likelihood (ML) technique is an estimation method\n\
    that is based on probabilistic theory. Probabilistic estimation\nmethods are appropriate\
    \ when the state variable follows an\nunknown probability distribution [33]. In\
    \ the context of\ndata fusion, \U0001D465 is the state that is being estimated,\
    \ and \U0001D467 =\n(\U0001D467(1), . . . , \U0001D467(\U0001D458)) is a sequence\
    \ of \U0001D458 previous observations of\n\U0001D465. The likelihood function\
    \ \U0001D706(\U0001D465) is defined as a probability\ndensity function of the\
    \ sequence of \U0001D467 observations given the\ntrue value of the state \U0001D465\
    . Consider\n\U0001D706 (\U0001D465) = \U0001D45D (\U0001D467 | \U0001D465) .\n\
    (20)\nThe ML estimator finds the value of \U0001D465 that maximizes the\nlikelihood\
    \ function:\n̂\U0001D465 (\U0001D458) = arg max\n\U0001D465\n\U0001D45D (\U0001D467\
    \ | \U0001D465) ,\n(21)\n12\nThe Scientific World Journal\nwhich can be obtained\
    \ from the analytical or empirical\nmodels of the sensors. This function expresses\
    \ the probability\nof the observed data. The main disadvantage of this method\n\
    in practice is that it requires the analytical or empirical model\nof the sensor\
    \ to be known to provide the prior distribution\nand compute the likelihood function.\
    \ This method can also\nsystematically underestimate the variance of the distribution,\n\
    which leads to a bias problem. However, the bias of the ML\nsolution becomes less\
    \ significant as the number \U0001D441 of data\npoints increases and is equal\
    \ to the true variance of the\ndistribution that generated the data at the limit\
    \ \U0001D441 → ∞.\nThe maximum posterior (MAP) method is based on the\nBayesian\
    \ theory. It is employed when the parameter \U0001D465 to\nbe estimated is the\
    \ output of a random variable that has a\nknown probability density function \U0001D45D\
    (\U0001D465). In the context of\ndata fusion, \U0001D465 is the state that is\
    \ being estimated and \U0001D467 =\n(\U0001D467(1), . . . , \U0001D467(\U0001D458\
    )) is a sequence of \U0001D458 previous observations of \U0001D465.\nThe MAP estimator\
    \ finds the value of \U0001D465 that maximizes the\nposterior probability distribution\
    \ as follows:\n̂\U0001D465 (\U0001D458) = arg max\n\U0001D465\n\U0001D45D (\U0001D465\
    \ | \U0001D467) .\n(22)\nBoth methods (ML and MAP) aim to find the most likely\n\
    value for the state \U0001D465. However, ML assumes that \U0001D465 is a fixed\n\
    but an unknown point from the parameter space, whereas\nMAP considers \U0001D465\
    \ to be the output of a random variable with\na known a priori probability density\
    \ function. Both of these\nmethods are equivalent when there is no a priori information\n\
    about \U0001D465, that is, when there are only observations.\n4.2. The Kalman\
    \ Filter. The Kalman filter is the most popular\nestimation technique. It was\
    \ originally proposed by Kalman\n[34] and has been widely studied and applied\
    \ since then. The\nKalman filter estimates the state \U0001D465 of a discrete\
    \ time process\ngoverned by the following space-time model:\n\U0001D465 (\U0001D458\
    \ + 1) = Φ (\U0001D458) \U0001D465 (\U0001D458) + \U0001D43A (\U0001D458) \U0001D462\
    \ (\U0001D458) + \U0001D464 (\U0001D458)\n(23)\nwith the observations or measurements\
    \ \U0001D467 at time \U0001D458 of the state\n\U0001D465 represented by\n\U0001D467\
    \ (\U0001D458) = \U0001D43B (\U0001D458) \U0001D465 (\U0001D458) + V (\U0001D458\
    ) ,\n(24)\nwhere Φ(\U0001D458) is the state transition matrix, \U0001D43A(\U0001D458\
    ) is the input\nmatrix transition, \U0001D462(\U0001D458) is the input vector,\
    \ \U0001D43B(\U0001D458) is the\nmeasurement matrix, and \U0001D464 and V are\
    \ the random Gaussian\nvariables with zero mean and covariance matrices of \U0001D444\
    (\U0001D458)\nand \U0001D445(\U0001D458), respectively. Based on the measurements\
    \ and on\nthe system parameters, the estimation of \U0001D465(\U0001D458), which\
    \ is\nrepresented by ̂\U0001D465(\U0001D458), and the prediction of \U0001D465\
    (\U0001D458 + 1), which\nis represented by ̂\U0001D465(\U0001D458 + 1 | \U0001D458\
    ), are given by the following:\n̂\U0001D465 (\U0001D458) = ̂\U0001D465 (\U0001D458\
    \ | \U0001D458 + 1) + \U0001D43E (\U0001D458) [\U0001D467 (\U0001D458) − \U0001D43B\

    \ \U0001D445 (\U0001D458)]\n−1,\n(26)\nwhere \U0001D443(\U0001D458 | \U0001D458\
    \ − 1) is the prediction covariance matrix and\ncan be determined by\n\U0001D443\
    \ (\U0001D458 + 1 | \U0001D458) = Φ (\U0001D458) \U0001D443 (\U0001D458) Φ\U0001D447\
    \ (\U0001D458) + \U0001D444 (\U0001D458)\n(27)\nwith\n\U0001D443 (\U0001D458)\
    \ = \U0001D443 (\U0001D458 | \U0001D458 − 1) − \U0001D43E (\U0001D458) \U0001D43B\
    \ (\U0001D458) \U0001D443 (\U0001D458 | \U0001D458 − 1) .\n(28)\nThe Kalman filter\
    \ is mainly employed to fuse low-level\ndata. If the system could be described\
    \ as a linear model and\nthe error could be modeled as the Gaussian noise, then\
    \ the\nrecursive Kalman filter obtains optimal statistical estimations\n[35].\
    \ However, other methods are required to address nonlin-\near dynamic models and\
    \ nonlinear measurements. The modi-\nfied Kalman filter known as the extended\
    \ Kalman filter (EKF)\nis an optimal approach for implementing nonlinear recursive\n\
    filters [36]. The EKF is one of the most often employed\nmethods for fusing data\
    \ in robotic applications. However,\nit has some disadvantages because the computations\
    \ of the\nJacobians are extremely expensive. Some attempts have been\nmade to\
    \ reduce the computational cost, such as linearization,\nbut these attempts introduce\
    \ errors in the filter and make it\nunstable.\nThe unscented Kalman filter (UKF)\
    \ [37] has gained\npopularity, because it does not have the linearization step\
    \ and\nthe associated errors of the EKF [38]. The UKF employs a\ndeterministic\
    \ sampling strategy to establish the minimum set\nof points around the mean. This\
    \ set of points captures the\ntrue mean and covariance completely. Then, these\
    \ points are\npropagated through nonlinear functions, and the covariance\nof the\
    \ estimations can be recuperated. Another advantage of\nthe UKF is its ability\
    \ to be employed in parallel implementa-\ntions.\n4.3. Particle Filter. Particle\
    \ filters are recursive implemen-\ntations of the sequential Monte Carlo methods\
    \ [39]. This\nmethod builds the posterior density function using several\nrandom\
    \ samples called particles. Particles are propagated\nover time with a combination\
    \ of sampling and resampling\nsteps. At each iteration, the sampling step is employed\
    \ to\ndiscard some particles, increasing the relevance of regions\nwith a higher\
    \ posterior probability. In the filtering process,\nseveral particles of the same\
    \ state variable are employed,\nand each particle has an associated weight that\
    \ indicates\nthe quality of the particle. Therefore, the estimation is the\nresult\
    \ of a weighted sum of all of the particles. The standard\nparticle filter algorithm\
    \ has two phases: (1) the predicting\nphase and (2) the updating phase. In the\
    \ predicting phase,\neach particle is modified according to the existing model\n\
    and accounts for the sum of the random noise to simulate\nthe noise effect. Then,\
    \ in the updating phase, the weight of\neach particle is reevaluated using the\
    \ last available sensor\nobservation, and particles with lower weights are removed.\n\
    Specifically, a generic particle filter comprises the following\nsteps.\nThe Scientific\

    Particle filters are more flexible than the Kalman filters\nand can cope with\
    \ nonlinear dependencies and non-Gaussian\ndensities in the dynamic model and\
    \ in the noise error.\nHowever, they have some disadvantages. A large number\n\
    of particles are required to obtain a small variance in the\nestimator. It is\
    \ also difficult to establish the optimal number of\nparticles in advance, and\
    \ the number of particles affects the\ncomputational cost significantly. Earlier\
    \ versions of particle\nfilters employed a fixed number of particles, but recent\
    \ studies\nhave started to use a dynamic number of particles [40].\n4.4. The Distributed\
    \ Kalman Filter. The distributed Kalman\nfilter requires a correct clock synchronization\
    \ between each\nsource, as demonstrated in [41]. In other words, to correctly\n\
    use the distributed Kalman filter, the clocks from all of\nthe sources must be\
    \ synchronized. This synchronization is\ntypically achieved through using protocols\
    \ that employ a\nshared global clock, such as the network time protocol (NTP).\n\
    Synchronization problems between clocks have been shown\nto have an effect on\
    \ the accuracy of the Kalman filter,\nproducing inaccurate estimations [42].\n\
    If the estimations are consistent and the cross covariance\nis known (or the estimations\
    \ are uncorrelated), then it is\npossible to use the distributed Kalman filters\
    \ [43]. However,\nthe cross covariance must be determined exactly, or the\nobservations\
    \ must be consistent.\nWe refer the reader to Liggins II et al. [20] for more\
    \ details\nabout the Kalman filter in a distributed and hierarchical\narchitecture.\n\
    4.5. Distributed Particle Filter. Distributed particle filters\nhave gained attention\
    \ recently [44–46]. Coates [45] used a\ndistributed particle filter to monitor\
    \ an environment that\ncould be captured by the Markovian state-space model,\n\
    involving nonlinear dynamics and observations and non-\nGaussian noise.\nIn contrast,\
    \ earlier attempts to solve out-of-sequence\nmeasurements using particle filters\
    \ are based on regenerating\nthe probability density function to the time instant\
    \ of the\nout-of-sequence measurement [47]. In a particle filter, this\nstep requires\
    \ a large computational cost, in addition to the\nnecessary space to store the\
    \ previous particles. To avoid\nthis problem, Orton and Marrs [48] proposed to\
    \ store the\ninformation on the particles at each time instant, saving the\ncost\
    \ of recalculating this information. This technique is close\n14\nThe Scientific\
    \ World Journal\nto optimal, and when the delay increases, the result is only\n\
    slightly affected [49]. However, it requires a very large amount\nof space to\
    \ store the state of the particles at each time instant.\n4.6. Covariance Consistency\
    \ Methods: Covariance Intersec-\ntion/Union. Covariance consistency methods (intersection\n\
    and union) were proposed by Uhlmann [43] and are general\nand fault-tolerant frameworks\
    \ for maintaining covariance\nmeans and estimations in a distributed network.\
    \ These meth-\nods do not comprise estimation techniques; instead, they are\n\
    similar to an estimation fusion technique. The distributed\nKalman filter requirement\
    \ of independent measurements or\nknown cross-covariances is not a constraint\
    \ with this method.\n4.6.1. Covariance Intersection. If the Kalman filter is employ-\n\
    ed to combine two estimations, (\U0001D44E1, \U0001D4341) and (\U0001D44E2, \U0001D434\
    2), then it\nis assumed that the joint covariance is in the following form:\n\
    [\n[\n\U0001D4341\n\U0001D44B\n\U0001D44B\U0001D447 \U0001D4342\n]\n]\n,\n(36)\n\
    where the cross-covariance \U0001D44B should be known exactly so\nthat the Kalman\
    \ filter can be applied without difficulty.\nBecause the computation of the cross-covariances\
    \ is compu-\ntationally intensive, Uhlmann [43] proposed the covariance\nintersection\
    \ (CI) algorithm.\nLet us assume that a joint covariance \U0001D440 can be defined\n\
    with the diagonal blocks \U0001D440\U0001D4341 > \U0001D4341 and \U0001D440\U0001D434\
    2 > \U0001D4342. Consider\n\U0001D440 ⩾ [\n[\n\U0001D4341\n\U0001D44B\n\U0001D44B\
    \U0001D447 \U0001D4342\n]\n]\n(37)\nfor every possible instance of the unknown\
    \ cross-covariance\n\U0001D44B; then, the components of the matrix \U0001D440\
    \ could be employed\nin the Kalman filter equations to provide a fused estimation\n\
    (\U0001D450, \U0001D436) that is considered consistent. The key point of this\n\
    method relies on generating a joint covariance matrix \U0001D440 that\ncan represent\
    \ a useful fused estimation (in this context, useful\nrefers to something with\
    \ a lower associated uncertainty). In\nsummary, the CI algorithm computes the\
    \ joint covariance\nmatrix \U0001D440, where the Kalman filter provides the best\
    \ fused\nestimation (\U0001D450, \U0001D436) with respect to a fixed measurement\
    \ of the\ncovariance matrix (i.e., the minimum determinant).\nSpecific covariance\
    \ criteria must be established because\nthere is not a specific minimum joint\
    \ covariance in the\norder of the positive semidefinite matrices. Moreover, the\n\
    joint covariance is the basis of the formal analysis of the\nCI algorithm; the\
    \ actual result is a nonlinear mixture of the\ninformation stored on the estimations\
    \ being fused, following\nthe following equation.\n\U0001D436 = (\U0001D4641\U0001D43B\
    \U0001D447\n1 \U0001D434−1\n1 \U0001D43B1 + \U0001D4642\U0001D43B\U0001D447\n\

    \U0001D45B)\n−1,\n(38)\nwhere \U0001D43B\U0001D456 is the transformation of the\
    \ fused state-space\nestimation to the space of the estimated state \U0001D456\
    . The values\nof \U0001D464 can be calculated to minimize the covariance determi-\n\
    nant using convex optimization packages and semipositive\nmatrix programming.\
    \ The result of the CI algorithm has\ndifferent characteristics compared to the\
    \ Kalman filter. For\nexample, if two estimations are provided (\U0001D44E, \U0001D434\
    ) and (\U0001D44F, \U0001D435)\nand their covariances are equal \U0001D434 = \U0001D435\
    , since the Kalman\nfilter is based on the statistical independence assumption,\
    \ it\nproduces a fused estimation with covariance \U0001D436 = (1/2)\U0001D434\
    .\nIn contrast, the CI method does not assume independence\nand, thus, must be\
    \ consistent even in the case in which\nthe estimations are completely correlated,\
    \ with the estimated\nfused covariance \U0001D436 = \U0001D434. In the case of\
    \ estimations where\n\U0001D434 < \U0001D435, the CI algorithm does not provide\
    \ information about\nthe estimation (\U0001D44F, \U0001D435); thus, the fused\
    \ result is (\U0001D44E, \U0001D434).\nEvery joint-consistent covariance is sufficient\
    \ to produce\na fused estimation, which guarantees consistency. However,\nit is\
    \ also necessary to guarantee a lack of divergence. Diver-\ngence is avoided in\
    \ the CI algorithm by choosing a specific\nmeasurement (i.e., the determinant),\
    \ which is minimized in\neach fusion operation. This measurement represents a\
    \ non-\ndivergence criterion, because the size of the estimated covari-\nance\
    \ according to this criterion would not be incremented.\nThe application of the\
    \ CI method guarantees consis-\ntency and nondivergence for every sequence of\
    \ mean and\ncovariance-consistent estimations. However, this method\ndoes not\
    \ work well when the measurements to be fused are\ninconsistent.\n4.6.2. Covariance\
    \ Union. CI solves the problem of correlated\ninputs but not the problem of inconsistent\
    \ inputs (inconsistent\ninputs refer to different estimations, each of which has\
    \ a\nhigh accuracy (small variance) but also a large difference\nfrom the states\
    \ of the others); thus, the covariance union\n(CU) algorithm was proposed to solve\
    \ the latter [43]. CU\naddresses the following problem: two estimations (\U0001D44E\
    1, \U0001D4341)\nand (\U0001D44E2, \U0001D4342) relate to the state of an object\
    \ and are mutually\ninconsistent from one another. This issue arises when the\n\
    difference between the average estimations is larger than\nthe provided covariance.\
    \ Inconsistent inputs can be detected\nusing the Mahalanobis distance [50] between\
    \ them, which is\ndefined as\n\U0001D440\U0001D451 = (\U0001D44E1 − \U0001D44E\
    2)\U0001D447(\U0001D4341 + \U0001D4342)−1 (\U0001D44E1 − \U0001D44E2) ,\n(39)\n\
    and detecting whether this distance is larger than a given\nthreshold.\nThe Mahalanobis\
    \ distance accounts for the covariance\ninformation to obtain the distance. If\
    \ the difference between\nthe estimations is high but their covariance is also\
    \ high,\nthe Mahalanobis distance yields a small value. In contrast,\nif the difference\
    \ between the estimations is small and the\ncovariances are small, it could produce\
    \ a larger distance\nvalue. A high Mahalanobis distance could indicate that the\n\
    estimations are inconsistent; however, it is necessary to\nhave a specific threshold\
    \ established by the user or learned\nautomatically.\nThe CU algorithm aims to\
    \ solve the following prob-\nlem: let us suppose that a filtering algorithm provides\
    \ two\nobservations with mean and covariance (\U0001D44E1, \U0001D4341) and (\U0001D44E\
    2, \U0001D4342),\nThe Scientific World Journal\n15\nrespectively. It is known\
    \ that one of the observations is correct\nand the other is erroneous. However,\
    \ the identity of the\ncorrect estimation is unknown and cannot be determined.\n\
    In this situation, if both estimations are employed as an\ninput to the Kalman\
    \ filter, there will be a problem, because\nthe Kalman filter only guarantees\
    \ a consistent output if the\nobservation is updated with a measurement consistent\
    \ with\nboth of them. In the specific case, in which the measurements\ncorrespond\
    \ to the same object but are acquired from two\ndifferent sensors, the Kalman\
    \ filter can only guarantee that\nthe output is consistent if it is consistent\
    \ with both separately.\nBecause it is not possible to know which estimation is\
    \ correct,\nthe only way to combine the two estimations rigorously is\nto provide\
    \ an estimation (\U0001D462, \U0001D448) that is consistent with both\nestimations\
    \ and to obey the following properties:\n\U0001D448 ⪖ \U0001D4341 + (\U0001D462\
    \ − \U0001D44E1) (\U0001D462 − \U0001D4341)\n\U0001D447,\n\U0001D448 ⪖ \U0001D434\
    2 + (\U0001D462 − \U0001D44E2) (\U0001D462 − \U0001D4342)\U0001D447,\n(40)\nwhere\
    \ some measurement of the matrix size \U0001D448 (i.e., the deter-\nminant) is\
    \ minimized.\nIn other words, the previous equations indicate that if the\nestimation\
    \ (\U0001D44E1, \U0001D4341) is consistent, then the translation of the\nvector\
    \ \U0001D44E1 to \U0001D462 requires to increase the covariance by the sum\nof\
    \ a matrix at least as big as the product of (\U0001D462 − \U0001D44E1) in order\
    \ to\nbe consistent. The same situation applies to the measurement\n(\U0001D44E\
    2, \U0001D4342) in order to be consistent.\nA simple strategy is to choose the\
    \ mean of the estimation\nas the input value of one of the measurements (\U0001D462\
    \ = \U0001D44E1). In this\ncase, the value of \U0001D448 must be chosen, such\
    \ that the estimation\nis consistent with the worst case (the correct measurement\
    \ is\n\U0001D44E2). However, it is possible to assign \U0001D462 an intermediate\
    \ value\nbetween \U0001D44E1 and \U0001D44E2 to decrease the value of \U0001D448\
    . Therefore, the\nCU algorithm establishes the mean fused value \U0001D462 that\
    \ has\nthe least covariance \U0001D448 but is sufficiently large for the two\n\
    measurements (\U0001D44E1 and \U0001D44E2) for consistency.\nBecause the matrix\
    \ inequalities presented in previous\nequations are convex, convex optimization\
    \ algorithms must\nbe employed to solve them. The value of \U0001D448 can be computed\n\
    with the iterative method described by Julier et al. [51].\nThe obtained covariance\
    \ could be significantly larger than\nany of the initial covariances and is an\
    \ indicator of the\nexisting uncertainty between the initial estimations. One\
    \ of\nthe advantages of the CU method arises from the fact that\nthe same process\
    \ could be easily extended to \U0001D441 inputs.\n5. Decision Fusion Methods\n\
    A decision is typically taken based on the knowledge of the\nperceived situation,\
    \ which is provided by many sources in\nthe data fusion domain. These techniques\
    \ aim to make a\nhigh-level inference about the events and activities that are\n\
    produced from the detected targets. These techniques often\nuse symbolic information,\
    \ and the fusion process requires to\nreason while accounting for the uncertainties\
    \ and constraints.\nThese methods fall under level 2 (situation assessment) and\n\
    level 4 (impact assessment) of the JDL data fusion model.\n5.1. The Bayesian Methods.\
    \ Information fusion based on the\nBayesian inference provides a formalism for\
    \ combining evi-\ndence according to the probability theory rules. Uncertainty\n\
    is represented using the conditional probability terms that\ndescribe beliefs\
    \ and take on values in the interval [0, 1], where\nzero indicates a complete\
    \ lack of belief and one indicates an\nabsolute belief. The Bayesian inference\
    \ is based on the Bayes\nrule as follows:\n\U0001D443 (\U0001D44C | \U0001D44B\
    ) = \U0001D443 (\U0001D44B | \U0001D44C) \U0001D443 (\U0001D44C)\n\U0001D443 (\U0001D44B\
    )\n,\n(41)\nwhere the posterior probability, \U0001D443(\U0001D44C | \U0001D44B\
    ), represents the\nbelief in the hypothesis \U0001D44C given the information \U0001D44B\
    . This\nprobability is obtained by multiplying the a priori probability\nof the\
    \ hypothesis \U0001D443(\U0001D44C) by the probability of having \U0001D44B given\n\
    that \U0001D44C is true, \U0001D443(\U0001D44B\n|\n\U0001D44C). The value \U0001D443\
    (\U0001D44B) is used as a\nnormalizing constant. The main disadvantage of the\
    \ Bayesian\ninference is that the probabilities \U0001D443(\U0001D44B) and \U0001D443\
    (\U0001D44B | \U0001D44C) must\nbe known. To estimate the conditional probabilities,\
    \ Pan\net al. [52] proposed the use of NNs, whereas Cou´e et al. [53]\nproposed\
    \ the Bayesian programming.\nHall and Llinas [54] described the following problems\n\
    associated with Bayesian inference.\n(i) Difficulty in establishing the value\
    \ of a priori proba-\nbilities.\n(ii) Complexity when there are multiple potential\
    \ hypo-\ntheses and a substantial number of events that depend\non the conditions.\n\
    (iii) The hypothesis should be mutually exclusive.\n(iv) Difficulty in describing\
    \ the uncertainty of the deci-\nsions.\n5.2. The Dempster-Shafer Inference. The\
    \ Dempster-Shafer\ninference is based on the mathematical theory introduced\n\
    by Dempster [55] and Shafer [56], which generalizes the\nBayesian theory. The\
    \ Dempster-Shafer theory provides a\nformalism that could be used to represent\
    \ incomplete knowl-\nedge, updating beliefs, and a combination of evidence and\n\
    allows us to represent the uncertainty explicitly [57].\nA fundamental concept\
    \ in the Dempster-Shafer reason-\ning is the frame of discernment, which is defined\
    \ as follows.\nLet Θ\n=\n{\U0001D7031, \U0001D7032, . . . , \U0001D703\U0001D441\
    } be the set of all possible states\nthat define the system, and let Θ be exhaustive\
    \ and mutually\nexclusive due to the system being only in one state \U0001D703\
    \U0001D456 ∈ Θ,\nwhere 1 ⪕ \U0001D456 ⪕ \U0001D441. The set Θ is called a frame\
    \ of discernment,\nbecause its elements are employed to discern the current state\n\
    of the system.\nThe elements of the set 2Θ are called hypotheses. In\nthe Dempster-Shafer\
    \ theory, based on the evidence \U0001D438, a\nprobability is assigned to each\
    \ hypothesis \U0001D43B ∈ 2Θ according\nto the basic assignment of probabilities\
    \ or the mass function\n\U0001D45A : 2Θ → [0.1], which satisfies\n\U0001D45A (0)\
    \ = 0.\n(42)\n16\nThe Scientific World Journal\nThus, the mass function of the\
    \ empty set is zero. Furthermore,\nthe mass function of a hypothesis is larger\
    \ than or equal to\nzero for all of the hypotheses. Consider\n\U0001D45A (\U0001D43B\
    ) ≥ 0,\n∀\U0001D43B ∈ 2Θ.\n(43)\nThe sum of the mass function of all the hypotheses\
    \ is one.\nConsider\n∑\n\U0001D43B∈2Θ\n\U0001D45A (\U0001D43B) = 1.\n(44)\nTo\
    \ express incomplete beliefs in a hypothesis \U0001D43B, the Demp-\nster-Shafer\
    \ theory defines the belief function bel : 2Θ\n→\n[0, 1] over Θ as\nbel (\U0001D43B\
    ) = ∑\n\U0001D434⊆\U0001D43B\n\U0001D45A (\U0001D434) ,\n(45)\nwhere bel(0) =\
    \ 0, and bel(Θ) = 1. The doubt level in \U0001D43B can be\nexpressed in terms\
    \ of the belief function by\ndou (\U0001D43B) = bel (¬\U0001D43B) = ∑\n\U0001D434\
    ⊆¬\U0001D43B\n\U0001D45A (\U0001D434) .\n(46)\nTo express the plausibility of\
    \ each hypothesis, the function\npl : 2Θ → [0, 1] over Θ is defined as\npl (\U0001D43B\
    ) = 1 − dou (\U0001D43B) =\n∑\n\U0001D434∩\U0001D43B=0\n\U0001D45A (\U0001D434\
    ) .\n(47)\nIntuitive plausibility indicates that there is less uncer-\ntainty\
    \ in hypothesis \U0001D43B if it is more plausible. The confidence\ninterval [bel(\U0001D43B\
    ), pl(\U0001D43B)] defines the true belief in hypothesis\n\U0001D43B. To combine\
    \ the effects of the two mass functions \U0001D45A1 and\n\U0001D45A2, the Dempster-Shafer\
    \ theory defines a rule \U0001D45A1 ⊕ \U0001D45A2 as\n\U0001D45A1 ⊕ \U0001D45A\
    2 (0) = 0,\n\U0001D45A1 ⊕ \U0001D45A2 (\U0001D43B) =\n∑\U0001D44B∩\U0001D44C=\U0001D43B\

    =0 \U0001D45A1 (\U0001D44B) \U0001D45A2 (\U0001D44C).\n(48)\nIn contrast to the\
    \ Bayesian inference, a priori probabilities\nare not required in the Dempster-Shafer\
    \ inference, because\nthey are assigned at the instant that the information is\
    \ pro-\nvided. Several studies in the literature have compared the use\nof the\
    \ Bayesian inference and the Dempster-Shafer inference,\nsuch as [58–60]. Wu et\
    \ al. [61] used the Dempster-Shafer\ntheory to fuse information in context-aware\
    \ environments.\nThis work was extended in [62] to dynamically modify the\nassociated\
    \ weights to the sensor measurements. Therefore,\nthe fusion mechanism is calibrated\
    \ according to the recent\nmeasurements of the sensors (in cases in which the\
    \ ground-\ntruth is available). In the military domain [63], the Dempster-\nShafer\
    \ reasoning is used with the a priori information stored\nin a database for classifying\
    \ military ships. Morbee et al. [64]\ndescribed the use of the Dempster-Shafer\
    \ theory to build 2D\noccupancy maps from several cameras and to evaluate the\n\
    contribution of subsets of cameras to a specific task. Each task\nis the observation\
    \ of an event of interest, and the goal is to\nassess the validity of a set of\
    \ hypotheses that are fused using\nthe Dempster-Shafer theory.\n5.3. Abductive\
    \ Reasoning. Abductive reasoning, or inferring\nthe best explanation, is a reasoning\
    \ method in which a\nhypothesis is chosen under the assumption that in case it\n\
    is true, it explains the observed event most accurately [65].\nIn other words,\
    \ when an event is observed, the abduction\nmethod attempts to find the best explanation.\n\
    In the context of probabilistic reasoning, abductive infer-\nence finds the posterior\
    \ ML of the system variables given\nsome observed variables. Abductive reasoning\
    \ is more a\nreasoning pattern than a data fusion technique. Therefore,\ndifferent\
    \ inference methods, such as NNs [66] or fuzzy logic\n[67], can be employed.\n\
    5.4. Semantic Methods. Decision fusion techniques that\nemploy semantic data from\
    \ different sources as an input could\nprovide more accurate results than those\
    \ that rely on only\nsingle sources. There is a growing interest in techniques\
    \ that\nautomatically determine the presence of semantic features in\nvideos to\
    \ solve the semantic gap [68].\nSemantic information fusion is essentially a scheme\
    \ in\nwhich raw sensor data are processed such that the nodes\nexchange only the\
    \ resultant semantic information. Semantic\ninformation fusion typically covers\
    \ two phases: (i) build-\ning the knowledge and (ii) pattern matching (inference).\n\
    The first phase (typically offline) incorporates the most\nappropriate knowledge\
    \ into semantic information. Then, the\nsecond phase (typically online or in real-time)\
    \ fuses relevant\nattributes and provides a semantic interpretation of the\nsensor\
    \ data [69–71].\nSemantic fusion could be viewed as an idea for integrating\n\
    and translating sensor data into formal languages. Therefore,\nthe obtained resulting\
    \ language from the observations of\nthe environment is compared with similar\
    \ languages that\nare stored in the database. The key of this strategy is that\n\
    similar behaviors represented by formal languages are also\nsemantically similar.\
    \ This type of method provides savings\nin the cost of transmission, because the\
    \ nodes need only\ntransmit the formal language structure instead of the raw\n\
    data. However, a known set of behaviors must be stored\nin a database in advance,\
    \ which might be difficult in some\nscenarios.\n6. Conclusions\nThis paper reviews\
    \ the most popular methods and tech-\nniques for performing data/information fusion.\
    \ To determine\nwhether the application of data/information fusion methods\nis\
    \ feasible, we must evaluate the computational cost of the\nprocess and the delay\
    \ introduced in the communication.\nA centralized data fusion approach is theoretically\
    \ optimal\nwhen there is no cost of transmission and there are sufficient\ncomputational\
    \ resources. However, this situation typically\ndoes not hold in practical applications.\n\
    The selection of the most appropriate technique depends\non the type of the problem\
    \ and the established assumptions\nof each technique. Statistical data fusion\
    \ methods (e.g., PDA,\nJPDA, MHT, and Kalman) are optimal under specific condi-\n\
    tions [72]. First, the assumption that the targets are moving\nThe Scientific\
    \ World Journal\n17\nindependently and the measurements are normally dis-\ntributed\
    \ around the predicted position typically does not\nhold. Second, because the\
    \ statistical techniques model all\nof the events as probabilities, they typically\
    \ have several\nparameters and a priori probabilities for false measurements\n\
    and detection errors that are often difficult to obtain (at\nleast in an optimal\
    \ sense). For example, in the case of the\nMHT algorithm, specific parameters\
    \ must be established that\nare nontrivial to determine and are very sensitive\
    \ [73]. In\ncontrast, statistical methods that optimize over several frames\n\
    are computationally intensive, and their complexity typically\ngrows exponentially\
    \ with the number of targets. For example,\nin the case of particle filters, tracking\
    \ several targets can be\naccomplished jointly as a group or individually. If\
    \ several\ntargets are tracked jointly, the necessary number of particles\ngrows\
    \ exponentially. Therefore, in practice, it is better to\nperform tracking on\
    \ them individually, with the assumption\nthat targets do not interact between\
    \ the particles.\nIn contrast to centralized systems, the distributed data\nfusion\
    \ methods introduce some challenges in the data fusion\nprocess, such as (i) spatial\
    \ and temporal alignments of the\ninformation, (ii) out-of-sequence measurements,\
    \ and (iii)\ndata correlation reported by Castanedo et al. [74, 75]. The\ninherent\
    \ redundancy of the distributed systems could be\nexploited with distributed reasoning\
    \ techniques and cooper-\native algorithms to improve the individual node estimations\n\
    reported by Castanedo et al. [76]. In addition to the previous\nstudies, a new\
    \ trend based on the geometric notion of a low-\ndimensional manifold is gaining\
    \ attention in the data fusion\ncommunity. An example is the work of Davenport\
    \ et al. [77],\nwhich proposes a simple model that captures the correlation\n\
    between the sensor observations by matching the parameter\nvalues for the different\
    \ obtained manifolds.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author would like to thank Jes´us\

    \ technology has received signiﬁcant attention in a variety of ﬁelds, as\nit combines\
    \ the collected information from multi-sensors, which can enhance the robustness\
    \ and\nsafety of a system. In wireless sensor networks applications, however,\
    \ the data that are collected\nfrom the sensors are often imprecise and uncertain\
    \ [1]. How to model and handle the uncertainty\ninformation is still an open issue.\
    \ To address this problem, many mathematical approaches have been\npresented,\
    \ such as the fuzzy sets theory [2,3], that focuses on the intuitive reasoning\
    \ by taking into\naccount human subjectivity and imprecision; the intuitionistic\
    \ fuzzy sets theory [4] which generalizes\nfuzzy sets by considering the uncertainty\
    \ in the assignment of membership degree known as the\nhesitation degree; evidence\
    \ theory [5–7], as a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty,\nwith understood\
    \ connections to other frameworks such as probability, possibility, and imprecise\n\
    probability theories; rough sets theory [8,9] where its methodology is concerned\
    \ with the classiﬁcation\nand analysis of imprecise, uncertain, or incomplete\
    \ information and knowledge, which is considered\none of the ﬁrst non-statistical\
    \ approaches in data analysis; evidential reasoning [10,11] which is a\ngeneric\
    \ evidence-based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach for dealing\
    \ with problems\nhaving both quantitative and qualitative criteria under various\
    \ uncertainties including ignorance\nand randomness; Z numbers [12,13], that intend\
    \ to provide a basis for computation with numbers\nwhich are not totally reliable;\
    \ D numbers theory [14–17] which is a generalization of Dempster–Shafer\ntheory,\
    \ but does not follow the commutative law; and so on [18–21]. In addition, mixed\
    \ intelligent\nSensors 2018, 18, 1487; doi:10.3390/s18051487\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2018, 18, 1487\n2 of 20\nmethods have been applied in decision making\
    \ [22], risk analysis [23], supplier selection [24], pattern\nrecognition [25],\
    \ classiﬁcation [26], human reliability analysis [27], and fault diagnosis [28],\
    \ etc. In this\npaper, we focus on evidence theory to deal with the uncertain\
    \ problem of multi-sensor data fusion.\nDempster–Shafer evidence theory was ﬁrstly\
    \ presented by Dempster [5] in 1967; later, it was\nextended by Shafer [6] in\
    \ 1976. Dempster–Shafer evidence theory is effective to model both of the\nuncertainty\
    \ and imprecision without prior information, so it is widely applied in various\
    \ ﬁelds for\ninformation fusion [29–32]. Nevertheless, it may result in counter-intuitive\
    \ results when combining\nhighly conﬂicting pieces of evidence [33]. To address\
    \ this issue, many methods have been presented in\nrecent years [34–36]. On the\
    \ one hand, some researchers focused on amending Dempster’s combination\nrule.\
    \ On the other hand, some researchers tried to pretreat the bodies of evidence\
    \ before using\nDempster’s combination rule. In terms of of amending Dempster’s\
    \ combination rule, the major works\ncontain Smets’s unnormalized combination\
    \ rule [37], Dubois and Prade’s disjunctive combination\nrule [38], and Yager’s\
    \ combination rule [39]. However, the modiﬁcation of combination rule often\n\
    breaks the good properties, like commutativity and associativity. Furthermore,\
    \ if the sensor failure\ngives rise to the counter-intuitive results, the modiﬁcation\
    \ of combination rule is considered to\nbe unreasonable. Therefore, in order to\
    \ resolve the fusion problem of highly conﬂicting pieces of\nevidence, researchers\
    \ prefer to pretreat the bodies of evidence. With respect to pretreating the bodies\n\
    of evidence, the main works contain Murphy’s simple average approach of the bodies\
    \ of evidence [40],\nand Deng et al.’s weighted average of the masses based on\
    \ distance of evidence [41]. Deng et al.’s\nmethod [41] conquered the deﬁciency\
    \ of the method in [40]. However, the impact of evidence itself\nwas neglected\
    \ in the decision-making process.\nHence, in this paper, a weighted combination\
    \ method for conﬂicting pieces of evidence in\nmulti-sensor data fusion is proposed\
    \ to resolve fusion problem of highly conﬂicting evidence. First,\nthe credibility\
    \ degree of each piece of evidence is determined on the basis of the modiﬁed cosine\n\
    similarity measure of basic probability assignment [42]. Then, credibility degree\
    \ of each piece of\nevidence is modiﬁed by adopting the belief entropy function\
    \ [43] to measure the information volume\nof the evidence. Finally, the modiﬁed\
    \ credibility degree of each piece of evidence is used to adjust its\ncorresponding\
    \ body of evidence to obtain the weighted averaging evidence before using Dempster’s\n\
    combination rule. A numerical example is given to illustrate the feasibility and\
    \ effectiveness of the\nproposed method. Additionally, the proposed method is\
    \ applied in data classiﬁcation and motor rotor\nfault diagnosis, which validates\
    \ the practicability of it.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section\
    \ 2 brieﬂy introduces the preliminaries of\nthis paper. After that, Section 3\
    \ proposes the novel method, which is based on the similarity measure\nof evidence\
    \ and belief function entropy. Then, Section 4 gives a numerical example to show\
    \ the\neffectiveness of the proposed method. A statistical experiment is carried\
    \ out in Section 5. Afterwards,\nthe proposed method is applied to Iris data set\
    \ classiﬁcation, and motor rotor fault diagnosis is\nperformed in Section 6. Finally,\
    \ Section 7 gives the conclusions.\n2. Preliminaries\n2.1. Data Fusion\nData fusion\
    \ can be identiﬁed as a combination of multiple sources to obtain improved information\n\
    with less expensive, higher quality, or more relevant information [44]. General\
    \ data fusion structure can\nbe classiﬁed into three types based on the different\
    \ stages: data-level, feature-level, and decision-level,\nas referred in [45].\n\
    In the data-level fusion, all raw data from sensors for a measured object are\
    \ combined directly.\nThen, a feature vector is extracted from the fused data.\
    \ Fusion of data at this level consists of the\nmaximum information so that it\
    \ can generate good results. However, sensors used in the data-level\nfusion,\
    \ such as the sensors reporting vibration signals, must be homogeneous. As a consequence,\n\
    the data-level fusion is limited in the actual application environment, because\
    \ many physical quantities\nSensors 2018, 18, 1487\n3 of 20\ncan be measured for\
    \ a more comprehensive analysis. In the feature-level fusion, heterogeneous\n\
    sensors can be used to report the data. According to the types of collected raw\
    \ data, the features are\nextracted from the sensors. Then, these heterogeneous\
    \ sensor data are combined at the feature-level\nstage. All of the feature vectors\
    \ are combined into a single feature vector, which is then utilized in a\nspecial\
    \ classiﬁcation model for decision-making. In the decision-level fusion, the processes\
    \ of feature\nextraction and pattern recognition are sequentially conducted for\
    \ the data collected from each sensor.\nThen, the produced decision vectors are\
    \ combined by using decision-level fusion techniques such as\nthe Bayesian method,\
    \ Dempster–Shafer evidence theory, or behavior knowledge space.\nBecause of the\
    \ advantages of multi-sensor data fusion technology, it has been widely applied\
    \ in\nvarious ﬁelds, such as in fault diagnosis [46–48], target tracking [49,50],\
    \ health care analysis [51,52],\nimage processing [53], attack detection [54],\
    \ estimation of ship dynamics [55], and characterization of\nbuilt environments\
    \ [56].\nIn this paper, we focus on decision-level fusion, and try to improve\
    \ the performance of the system\nbased on Dempster–Shafer evidence theory.\n2.2.\
    \ Dempster-Shafer Evidence Theory\nDempster–Shafer evidence theory was ﬁrstly\
    \ proposed by Dempster [5] and was then further\ndeveloped by Shafer [6]. Dempster–Shafer\
    \ evidence theory, as a generalization of Bayesian inference,\nasks for weaker\
    \ conditions, which makes it more ﬂexible and effective to model both the uncertainty\n\
    and imprecision. The basic concepts are introduced as below.\nDeﬁnition 1. Let\
    \ U be a set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive events, indicated\
    \ by\nU = {C1, C2, . . . , Ci, . . . , CN}.\n(1)\nThe set U is called frame of\
    \ discernment. The power set of U is indicated by 2U, where\n2U = {∅, {C1}, {C2},\
    \ . . . , {CN}, {C1, C2}, . . . , {C1, C2, . . . , Ci}, . . . , U},\n(2)\nand\
    \ ∅ is an empty set. If A ∈ 2U, A is called a proposition or hypothesis.\nDeﬁnition\
    \ 2. For a frame of discernment U, a mass function is a mapping m from 2U to [0,\
    \ 1], formally defined by\nm : 2U → [0, 1],\n(3)\nwhich satisﬁes the following\
    \ condition:\nm(∅) = 0 and ∑\nA∈2U\nm(A) = 1.\n(4)\nIn Dempster–Shafer evidence\
    \ theory, a mass function can be also called as a basic probability\nassignment\
    \ (BPA). If m(A) is greater than 0, A will be called as a focal element, and the\
    \ union of all of\nthe focal elements is known as the core of the mass function.\n\
    Deﬁnition 3. For a proposition A ⊆ U, the belief function Bel : 2U → [0, 1] is\
    \ deﬁned as\nBel(A) = ∑\nB⊆A\nm(B).\n(5)\nThe plausibility function Pl : 2U →\
    \ [0, 1] is deﬁned as\nPl(A) = 1 − Bel( ¯A) =\n∑\nB∩A̸=∅\nm(B),\n(6)\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 1487\n4 of 20\nwhere ¯A = U − A.\nApparently, Pl(A) is equal or greater\
    \ than Bel(A), where the function Bel is the lower limit\nfunction of proposition\
    \ A and the function Pl is the upper limit function of proposition A.\nDeﬁnition\
    \ 4. Let the two BPAs be m1 and m2 on the frame of discernment U. Assuming that\
    \ these BPAs\nare independent, Dempster’s rule of combination, denoted by m =\
    \ m1 ⊕ m2, known as the orthogonal sum, is\ndeﬁned as below:\nm(A) =\n\n\n\n\
    1\n1−K\n∑\nB∩D=A\nm1(B)m2(D),\nA ̸= ∅,\n0,\nA = ∅,\n(7)\nwith\nK =\n∑\nB∩D=∅\n\
    m1(B)m2(D),\n(8)\nwhere B and D are also the elements of 2U, and K is a constant\
    \ that presents the conﬂict between the two BPAs.\nNote that Dempster’s combination\
    \ rule is only practicable for the two BPAs with the condition\nK < 1.\n2.3. Modiﬁed\
    \ Cosine Similarity Measure of BPAs\nA modiﬁed cosine similarity measure is proposed\
    \ by Jiang [42]. Because it considers three\nimportant factors, namely, angle,\
    \ distance, and vector norm, the modiﬁed cosine similarity measure is\nan efﬁcient\
    \ approach to measure the similarity between vectors more precisely. The modiﬁed\
    \ cosine\nsimilarity measure among the BPAs can determine whether the pieces of\
    \ evidence conﬂict with each\nother. A large similarity indicates that this piece\
    \ of evidence has more support from another piece of\nevidence, while a small\
    \ similarity indicates that this piece of evidence has less support from another\n\
    piece of evidence.\nDeﬁnition 5. Let E = [e1, e2, . . . , en] and F = [ f1, f2,\
    \ . . . , fn] be two vectors of Rn. The modiﬁed cosine\nsimilarity between vectors\
    \ E and F is deﬁned as\nSI(E, F) =\n(\n1\n2{α−P + min( |E|\n|F|, |F|\n|E|)}sicos(E,\
    \ F),\nE ̸= 0, F ̸= 0,\n0,\nE = 0 or F = 0,\n(9)\nwhere α is a constant whose\
    \ value is greater than 1, P is the Euclidean distance between the two vectors\
    \ E and F,\nα−P is the distance-based similarity measure, min( |E|\n|F|, |F|\n\
    |E|) is the minimum of |E|\n|F| and |F|\n|E|, and sicos(E, F) is the\ncosine similarity.\
    \ The larger the α is, the greater the distance impact on vector similarity will\
    \ be.\nDeﬁnition 6. Let m1 and m2 be the BPAs in the frame of discernment U =\
    \ {C1, C2, . . . , CN}. The two vectors\nare expressed as\nBeli = [Beli(C1), Beli(C2),\
    \ . . . , Beli(CN)],\ni = 1, 2,\nPli = [Pli(C1), Pli(C2), . . . , Pli(CN)],\n\
    i = 1, 2.\n(10)\nThen, the belief function vector similarity SI(Bel1, Bel2) and\
    \ the plausibility function vector similarity\nSI(Pl1, Pl2) can be calculated.\
    \ The new similarity of BPAs is deﬁned as\nSIBPA = (1 − λ) ∗ SI(Bel1, Bel2) +\
    \ λ ∗ SI(Pl1, Pl2),\n(11)\nwith\n0 ≤ λ ≤ 1,\n(12)\nSensors 2018, 18, 1487\n5 of\
    \ 20\nwhere λ is the total uncertainty of BPAs, which is deﬁned as\nλ =\n2\n∑\n\
    i=1\nN\n∑\nj=1\n(Pli(Cj) − Beli(Cj))\n2\n∑\ni=1\nN\n∑\nj=1\n(Pli(Cj))\n.\n(13)\n\
    Because Pli(Cj) ≥ Beli(Cj) and Bel ≥ 0, if Pli(Cj) = Beli(Cj), then λ = 0. Otherwise,\
    \ if Beli(Cj) =\n0, then λ = 1. The larger the uncertainty λ is, the greater the\
    \ inﬂuence on the similarity of BPA will be.\n2.4. Belief Entropy\nA novel type\
    \ of belief entropy, known as the Deng entropy, was ﬁrst proposed by Deng [43].\n\
    When the uncertain information is expressed by probability, the Deng entropy degenerates\
    \ to the\nShannon entropy. Hence, the Deng entropy is regarded as a generalization\
    \ of the Shannon entropy.\nIt is an efﬁcient mathematical tool to measure the\
    \ uncertain information, especially when the uncertain\ninformation is expressed\
    \ by the BPA. Because of its advantage in measuring the uncertain information,\n\
    the Deng entropy is applied in a variety of areas [57,58]. The basic concepts\
    \ are introduced below.\nDeﬁnition 7. Let B be a hypothesis or proposition of\
    \ the BPA m in the frame of discernment U and |B| be the\ncardinality of B. The\
    \ Deng entropy of the BPA m is deﬁned as follows:\nEd(m) = − ∑\nB⊆U\nm(B) log\n\
    m(B)\n2|B| − 1.\n(14)\nWhen the belief value is only allocated to the singleton,\
    \ the Deng entropy degenerates to the Shannon\nentropy, i.e.,\nEd(m) = − ∑\nB∈U\n\
    m(B) log\nm(B)\n2|B| − 1 = − ∑\nB∈U\nm(B) log m(B).\n(15)\nThe larger the value\
    \ of the cardinality of the hypothesis or proposition, the larger the value\n\
    the Deng entropy of evidence, which means that the piece of evidence involves\
    \ more information.\nTherefore, if a piece of evidence has a large Deng entropy\
    \ value, it has more support from other pieces\nof evidence, indicating that this\
    \ piece of evidence plays an important role in the evidence combination.\n3. The\
    \ Proposed Method\nIn this paper, a weighted combination method for conﬂicting\
    \ pieces of evidence multi-sensor data\nfusion is proposed by combining the modiﬁed\
    \ cosine similarity measure of evidence with the belief\nentropy function. In\
    \ contrast to the method of Jiang et al. [42], in the proposed method, the impact\
    \ of\nevidence itself is considered in the process of fusion of multiple pieces\
    \ of evidence by leveraging the\nbelief entropy [43], i.e., a useful uncertainty\
    \ measure tool, to measure the information volume of each\npiece of evidence,\
    \ so that the proposed method can combine multiple pieces of evidence with greater\n\
    accuracy. This will be discussed further in the next section.\n3.1. Process Steps\n\
    The proposed method is composed of the following procedures. The credibility degree\
    \ of the\npieces of evidence is ﬁrst determined on the basis of the similarity\
    \ measure among the BPAs. Then,\nthe credibility degree is modiﬁed by leveraging\
    \ the belief entropy function to measure the information\nvolume of the evidence.\
    \ Afterwards, the ﬁnal weight of each piece of evidence is obtained and adopted\n\
    to adjust the body of evidence before using Dempster’s combination rule. The speciﬁc\
    \ calculation\nprocesses are listed as follows. The ﬂowchart of the proposed method\
    \ is shown in Figure 1.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1487\n6 of 20\nStep 3: Calculate the\
    \ credibility degrees of the pieces of evidence.\nStep 1: Measure the similarities\
    \ between the pieces of evidence.\nStep 2: Obtain the support degrees of the pieces\
    \ of evidence.\nStep 4: Measure the information volume of the pieces of evidence.\n\
    Step 7: Normalise the modified credibility degrees of the pieces of evidence.\n\
    Step 5:  Normalise the information volume of the pieces of evidence.\nStep 6:\
    \ Modify the credibility degrees of the pieces of evidence.\nStep 8:  Obtain the\
    \ weighted average evidence.\nStep 9: Fuse the multiple weighted average pieces\
    \ of evidence.\nFigure 1. The ﬂowchart of the proposed method.\nStep 1: Measure\
    \ the similarities between the pieces of evidence.\nThe similarity measure SIBPA(ij)\
    \ between the BPAs mi and mj can be obtained by\nEquations (11)–(13). Then, a\
    \ similarity measure matrix (SMM) can be constructed as follows:\nSMM =\n\n\n\
    SIBPA(11)\n· · ·\nSIBPA(1i)\n· · ·\nSIBPA(1k)\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\nSIBPA(i1)\n\
    · · ·\nSIBPA(ii)\n· · ·\nSIBPA(ik)\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\nSIBPA(k1)\n· · ·\n\
    SIBPA(ki)\n· · ·\nSIBPA(kk)\n\n\n.\n(16)\nStep 2: Obtain the support degrees\
    \ of the pieces of evidence.\nThe support degree of the BPA mi (i = 1, . . . ,\
    \ k), denoted as SD(mi), is deﬁned as follows:\nSD(mi) =\nk\n∑\nj=1,j̸=i\nSIBPA(ij).\n\
    (17)\nStep 3: Calculate the credibility degrees of the pieces of evidence.\nThe\
    \ credibility degree of the BPA mi (i = 1, . . . , k), denoted as CD(mi), is deﬁned\
    \ as follows:\nCD(mi) =\nSD(mi)\n∑k\nl=1 SD(ml)\n.\n(18)\nSensors 2018, 18, 1487\n\
    7 of 20\nStep 4: Measure the information volume of the pieces of evidence.\nAccording\
    \ to Equation (14), the belief entropy Ed(mi) of the BPA mi (i = 1, . . . , k)\
    \ can be calculated.\nTo avoid assigning zero weight to the evidence, the information\
    \ volume IV(mi) is used for measuring\nthe uncertain information of mi. It is\
    \ deﬁned as follows:\nIV(mi) = eEd(mi) = e\n− ∑B⊆U m(B) log\nm(B)\n2|B|−1 .\n\
    (19)\nStep 5: Normalize the information volume of the pieces of evidence.\nThe\
    \ information volume of the BPA mi (i = 1, . . . , k) will be normalized as below:\n\
    IV(mi) =\nIV(mi)\n∑k\nl=1 IV(ml)\n.\n(20)\nStep 6: Modify the credibility degrees\
    \ of the pieces of evidence.\nBased on the normalized information volume, the\
    \ credibility degree of the BPA mi (i = 1, . . . , k)\nwill be modiﬁed, denoted\
    \ as MCD(mi):\nMCD(mi) = CD(mi) × IV(mi)(\n∑k\nl=1 CD(ml)\nk\n−CD(mi)).\n(21)\n\
    Step 7: Normalize the modiﬁed credibility degrees of the pieces of evidence.\n\
    The modiﬁed credibility degree MCD(mi) of the BPA mi (i = 1, . . . , k) will be\
    \ normalized as\nbelow, and is considered as the ﬁnal weight to adjust the bodies\
    \ of evidence.\nMCD(mi) =\nMCD(mi)\n∑k\nl=1 MCD(ml)\n.\n(22)\nStep 8: Obtain the\
    \ weighted average evidence.\nBased on the modiﬁed credibility degree of the BPA\
    \ mi (i = 1, . . . , k), the weighted average\nevidence WAE(m) is deﬁned as follows:\n\

    \ support target a, Dempster’s\ncombination method [5] always generates a counterintuitive\
    \ result. As the number of pieces of evidence\nincreases to three, Murphy’s combination\
    \ method [40] and Deng et al.’s combination method [41]\ncannot deal with the\
    \ highly conﬂicting pieces of evidence very well, because the BPA values of object\
    \ a\ngenerated by Murphy’s method [40] and Deng et al.’s method [41] are 33.24%\
    \ and 44.77%, respectively,\nwhich are smaller than 50%. When the number of pieces\
    \ of evidence increases from four to ﬁve,\nMurphy’s combination method [40] and\
    \ Deng et al.’s combination method [41] work well, and the\nBPA values of object\
    \ a generated by Murphy’s method [40] and Deng et al.’s method [41] increase up\n\

    \ and can efﬁciently deal with the highly conﬂicting pieces of evidence\nas the\

    \ to make a sound comparison, a statistical experiment is carried out with\nmultiple\
    \ pieces of initial data for the comparison of the proposed method with other\
    \ related methods.\nThis statistical experiment is implemented based on Example\
    \ 1. In the experimental setting,\nfor generating multiple initial data 100 times,\
    \ we provide a variation range [−0.1, 0.1] for each BPA of\nm1, and vary the values\
    \ of BPAs of m1 randomly.\nThen, the generated multiple pieces of initial data\
    \ are fused by utilizing the different methods,\nnamely, Dempster’s combination\
    \ method [5], Murphy’s combination method [40], Deng et al.’s\ncombination method\
    \ [41], Jiang et al.’s combination method [42], and the proposed method.\nThe\
    \ experimental results of target a’s BPA generated by different combination methods\
    \ are shown\nin Figure 3. From the comparison results, it is obvious that Murphy’s\
    \ combination method [40],\nDeng et al.’s combination method [41], Jiang et al.’s\
    \ combination method [42], and the proposed\nmethod are more efﬁcient than Dempster’s\
    \ combination method [5], because Dempster’s combination\nmethod cannot effectively\
    \ deal with the conﬂicting pieces of evidence, and thus always generates\ncounterintuitive\
    \ results where target a’s BPA value is 0 (under 0.5). In contrast, the other\
    \ methods can\neffectively cope with the conﬂicting evidence and recognize the\
    \ target a, where its corresponding BPA\nvalue is always larger than 0.5 under\
    \ multiple experiments. On the other hand, because Murphy’s\ncombination method\
    \ is a simply average-weighted approach to the bodies of evidence, its overall\n\
    performance is poorer than that of Deng et al.’s combination method, Jiang et\
    \ al.’s combination method,\nand the proposed method to a certain extent.\nFurthermore,\
    \ as shown in Figure 3a, Jiang et al.’s combination method [42] which is based\
    \ on the\nmodiﬁed cosine similarity measure, is more effective than Deng et al.’s\
    \ combination method [41] that\nis based on the Jousselme distance as a whole.\
    \ This is the reason that the modiﬁed cosine similarity\nmeasure is considered\
    \ in this study.\nIn order to improve the performance of Jiang et al.’s combination\
    \ method, we investigate and\nﬁnd that in the process of fusion of multiple pieces\
    \ of evidence, the impact of the evidence itself is\noverlooked in their method.\
    \ Hence, we also take the belief entropy into consideration to measure\nthe information\
    \ volume of each piece of evidence in the course of fusion and design the proposed\n\
    method. Consequently, as shown in Figure 3b, it can be noted that the proposed\
    \ method is superior to\nJiang et al.’s combination method [42] with a higher\
    \ target a BPA value.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1487\n12 of 20\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n\

    Supposing there are three types of faults for a motor rotor given by {F1, F2,\
    \ F3} = {rotor unbalance,\nrotor misalignment, pedestal looseness} in the frame\
    \ of discernment U. We place a set of vibration\nacceleration sensors at different\
    \ places for gathering the vibration signals given by S = {S1, S2, S3}.\nSensors\

    \ 1X, 2X, and 3X frequencies are considered as the\nfault feature variables. The\
    \ collected sensor reports at 1X, 2X, and 3X frequencies modeled as BPAs\nare\
    \ shown in Tables 7–9, respectively, in which m1(·), m2(·), and m3(·) represent\

    \ conducting the steps in Section 3, the weighted average evidence with regard\
    \ to motor rotor\nfault diagnosis at 1X frequency is obtained as below:\nm({F2})\
    \ = 0.5442,\nm({F3}) = 0.0006,\nm({F1, F2}) = 0.0773,\nm({F1, F2, F3}) = 0.3780.\n\
    Then, the final fusion results for motor rotor fault diagnosis at 1X frequency\
    \ are computed as follows:\nm({F2}) = 0.9055,\nm({F3}) = 0.0002,\nm({F1, F2})\
    \ = 0.0404,\nm({F1, F2, F3}) = 0.0541.\n6.2.2. Motor Rotor Fault Diagnosis at\
    \ 2X Frequency\nBy carrying out the steps in Section 3, the weighted average evidence\
    \ with respect to motor rotor\nfault diagnosis at 2X frequency is obtained as\
    \ follows:\nm({F2}) = 0.7387,\nm({F1, F2, F3}) = 0.2613.\nAfterwards, the ﬁnal\
    \ fusion results in terms of motor rotor fault diagnosis at 2X frequency are\n\
    generated as below:\nm({F2}) = 0.9822,\nm({F1, F2, F3}) = 0.0178.\nSensors 2018,\
    \ 18, 1487\n16 of 20\n6.2.3. Motor Rotor Fault Diagnosis at 3X Frequency\nBy applying\
    \ the steps in Section 3, the weighted average evidence with respect to motor\
    \ rotor\nfault diagnosis at 3X frequency is obtained as follows:\nm({F1}) = 0.3111,\n\
    m({F2}) = 0.4346,\nm({F1, F2}) = 0.2115,\nm({F1, F2, F3}) = 0.0428.\nThen, the\
    \ final combination results for motor rotor fault diagnosis at 3X frequency are\
    \ shown below:\nm({F1}) = 0.3345,\nm({F2}) = 0.6321,\nm({F1, F2}) = 0.0333,\n\
    m({F1, F2, F3}) = 0.0001.\nFrom the experimental results as shown in Tables 10–12,\
    \ it can be seen that the proposed method\ndiagnoses the fault type as F2, in\
    \ accordance with Jiang et al.’s method [48].\nFurthermore, the proposed method\
    \ outperforms Jiang et al.’s method [48] in dealing with the\nuncertainty as shown\
    \ in Figures 5–7, because by utilizing the proposed method, the belief degrees\n\
    allocated to the target fault type F2 at 1X frequency, 2X frequency and 3X frequency\
    \ increase up to\n90.55%, 98.22%, and 63.21%, respectively; however, by using\
    \ Jiang et al.’s method [48], the belief\ndegrees allocated to the target F2 at\
    \ 1X frequency, 2X frequency and 3X frequency are 88.61%, 96.21%,\nand 59.04%,\
    \ respectively.\nAdditionally, by utilizing the proposed method, the uncertainty\
    \ {F1, F2} falls from 0.0582 to 0.0541,\nand the uncertainty {F1, F2, F3} falls\
    \ from 0.0555 to 0.0404 at 1X frequency; the uncertainty {F1, F2, F3}\ndecreased\
    \ from 0.0371 to 0.0178 at 2X frequency; the uncertainty {F1, F2} falls from 0.0651\
    \ to 0.0333,\nand the uncertainty {F1, F2, F3} drops from 0.0061 to 0.0001 at\
    \ 3X frequency. As a result, the proposed\nmethod can diagnose motor rotor faults\
    \ more accurately than the related work.\nTable 10. Fusion results by using different\

    \ combination method for conﬂicting evidence in multi-sensor data\nfusion was\
    \ proposed by combining the modiﬁed cosine similarity measure of the pieces of\
    \ evidence\nwith the belief entropy function. The proposed method was a kind of\
    \ pretreatment of the bodies\nSensors 2018, 18, 1487\n18 of 20\nof evidence, which\
    \ was effective to handle the conﬂicting pieces of evidence in a multi-sensor\n\
    environment. A numerical example was illustrated to show the feasibility and effectiveness\
    \ of the\nproposal. In addition, applications in data classiﬁcation and motor\
    \ rotor fault diagnosis were presented\nto validate the practicability of the\
    \ proposed method, where it outperformed the related methods with\nbetter accuracy.\n\

  explanation: The study utilizes a three-layer convolutional neural network (CNN)
    with a tiny cloud-free fraction of the target image as training data. Testing
    is conducted on five Sentinel-2 images, which exhibit varying amounts of cloud
    cover. The CNN is applied to these images to estimate the normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI). The estimated NDVI values are then compared to reference
    values obtained from ground-truth data. The results demonstrate that the CNN-based
    method outperforms conventional temporal interpolation methods, especially in
    the presence of large temporal gaps. The study concludes that SAR images can be
    used to obtain a meaningful estimate of spectral indices when other sources of
    information are inaccessible.

    Sensitivity to weather conditions, and specially to clouds, is a severe limiting\
    \ factor\nto the use of optical remote sensing for Earth monitoring applications.\
    \ A possible alternative is\nto beneﬁt from weather-insensitive synthetic aperture\
    \ radar (SAR) images. In many real-world\napplications, critical decisions are\
    \ made based on some informative optical or radar features related\nto items such\
    \ as water, vegetation or soil. Under cloudy conditions, however, optical-based\
    \ features\nare not available, and they are commonly reconstructed through linear\
    \ interpolation between\ndata available at temporally-close time instants. In\
    \ this work, we propose to estimate missing\noptical features through data fusion\
    \ and deep-learning. Several sources of information are taken\ninto account—optical\
    \ sequences, SAR sequences, digital elevation model—so as to exploit both\ntemporal\
    \ and cross-sensor dependencies. Based on these data and a tiny cloud-free fraction\
    \ of the\ntarget image, a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained\
    \ to perform the desired\nestimation. To validate the proposed approach, we focus\
    \ on the estimation of the normalized\ndifference vegetation index (NDVI), using\
    \ coupled Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time-series acquired\nover an agricultural\
    \ region of Burkina Faso from May–November 2016. Several fusion schemes are\n\
    considered, causal and non-causal, single-sensor or joint-sensor, corresponding\
    \ to different operating\nconditions. Experimental results are very promising,\
    \ showing a signiﬁcant gain over baseline methods\naccording to all performance\
    \ indicators.\nKeywords: coregistration; pansharpening; multi-sensor fusion; multitemporal\
    \ images; deep learning;\nnormalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)\n1. Introduction\n\
    The recent launch of coupled optical/SAR (synthetic aperture radar) Sentinel satellites,\
    \ in the\ncontext of the Copernicus program, opens unprecedented opportunities\
    \ for end users, both industrial\nand institutional, and poses new challenges\
    \ to the remote sensing research community. The policy\nof free distribution of\
    \ data allows large-scale access to a very rich source of information. Besides\n\
    this, the technical features of the Sentinel constellation make it a valuable\
    \ tool for a wide array of\nremote sensing applications. With revisit time ranging\
    \ from two days to about a week, depending\non the geographic location, spatial\
    \ resolution from 5–60 m and wide coverage of the spectrum, from\nvisible to short-wave\
    \ infrared (~440–2200 nm), Sentinel data may decisively impact a number of Earth\n\
    monitoring applications, such as climate change monitoring, map updating, agriculture\
    \ and forestry\nplanning, ﬂood monitoring, ice monitoring, and so forth.\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2018, 10, 236; doi:10.3390/rs10020236\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 236\n2 of 20\nEspecially valuable is the diversity of information\
    \ guaranteed by the coupled SAR and\noptical sensors, a key element for boosting\
    \ the monitoring capability of the constellation. In fact,\nthe information conveyed\
    \ by the Sentinel-2 (S2) multi-resolution optical sensor depends on the spectral\n\
    reﬂectivity of the target illuminated by sunlight, while the backscattered signal\
    \ acquired by the\nSentinel-1 (S1) SAR sensor depends on both the target’s characteristics\
    \ and the illuminating signal.\nThe joint processing of optical and radar temporal\
    \ sequences offers the opportunity to extract the\ninformation of interest with\
    \ an accuracy that could not be achieved using only one of them. Of course,\n\
    with this potential comes the scientiﬁc challenge of how to exploit these complementary\
    \ pieces of\ninformation in the most effective way.\nIn this work, we focus on\
    \ the estimation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)\nin critical\
    \ weather conditions, fusing the information provided by temporal sequences of\
    \ S1 and S2\nimages. In fact, the typical processing pipelines of many land monitoring\
    \ applications rely, among other\nfeatures, on the NDVI for a single date or a\
    \ whole temporal series. Unfortunately, the NDVI, as well\nas other spectral features\
    \ are unavailable under cloudy weather conditions. The commonly-adopted\nsolution\
    \ consists of interpolating between temporally-adjacent images where the target\
    \ feature is\npresent. However, given the availability of weather-insensitive\
    \ SAR data of the scene, it makes sense\nto pursue fusion-based solutions, exploiting\
    \ SAR images that may be temporally very close to the\ntarget date, as it is well\
    \ known that radar images can provide valuable information on vegetation [1–4].\n\
    Even if this holds true, however, it is by no means obvious how to exploit such\
    \ dependency. To address\nthis problem, beneﬁting from the powerful learning capability\
    \ of deep learning methods, we designed\na three-layer convolutional neural network\
    \ (CNN), training it to account for both temporal and\ncross-sensor dependencies.\
    \ Note that the same approach, with minimal adaptations, can be extended\nto estimate\
    \ many other spectral indices, commonly used for water, soil, and so on. Therefore,\
    \ besides\nsolving the speciﬁc problem, we demonstrate the potential of deep learning\
    \ for data fusion in\nremote sensing.\nAccording to the taxonomy given in [5]\
    \ data fusion methods, i.e., processing dealing with data\nand information from\
    \ multiple sources to achieve improved information for decision making can be\n\
    grouped into three main categories:\n–\npixel-level: the pixel values of the sources\
    \ to be fused are jointly processed [6–9];\n–\nfeature-level: features like lines,\
    \ regions, keypoints, maps, and so on, are ﬁrst extracted\nindependently from\
    \ each source image and subsequently combined to produce higher-level\ncross-source\
    \ features, which may represent the desired output or be further processed [10–17];\n\
    –\ndecision-level: the high-level information extracted independently from each\
    \ source is combined\nto provide the ﬁnal outcome, for example using fuzzy logic\
    \ [18,19], decision trees [20],\nBayesian inference [21], Dempster–Shafer theory\
    \ [22], and so forth.\nIn the context of remote sensing, with reference to the\
    \ sources to be fused, fusion methods can be\nroughly gathered for the most part\
    \ into the following categories:\n–\nmulti-resolution: concerns a single sensor\
    \ with multiple resolution bands. One of the most\nfrequent applications is pansharpening\
    \ [6,23,24], although many other tasks can be solved under\na multi-resolution\
    \ paradigm, such as segmentation [25] or feature extraction [26], to mention\n\
    a few.\n–\nmulti-temporal: is one of the most investigated forms of fusion in\
    \ remote sensing due to the\nrich information content hidden in the temporal dimension.\
    \ In particular, it can be applied to\nstrictly time-related tasks, like prediction\
    \ [13], change detection [27–29] and co-registration [30],\nand general-purpose\
    \ tasks, like segmentation [7], despeckling [31] and feature extraction [32–34],\n\
    which do not necessarily need a joint processing of the temporal sequence, but\
    \ can beneﬁt from it.\n–\nmulti-sensor: is gaining an ever growing importance\
    \ due both to the recent deployment of many\nnew satellites and to the increasing\
    \ tendency of the community to share data. It represents also the\nmost challenging\
    \ case because of the several sources of mismatch (temporal, geometrical, spectral,\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 236\n3 of 20\nradiometric) among the involved data. As\
    \ for other categories, a number of typical remote\nsensing problems can ﬁt this\
    \ paradigm, such as classiﬁcation [10,16,35–37], coregistration [15],\nchange\
    \ detection [38] and feature estimation [4,39–41].\n–\nmixed: the above cases\
    \ may also occur jointly, generating mixed situations. For example,\nhyperspectral\
    \ and multiresolution images can be fused to produce a spatial-spectral\nfull-resolution\
    \ datacube [9,42]. Likewise, low-resolution temporally-dense series can be fused\
    \ with\nhigh-resolution, but temporally sparse ones to simulate a temporal-spatial\
    \ full-resolution sequence\n[43]. The monitoring of forests [21], soil moisture\
    \ [2], environmental hazards [12] and other\nprocesses can be also carried out\
    \ effectively by fusing SAR and optical time series. Finally, works\nthat mix\
    \ all three aspects, resolution, time and sensor, can also be found in the literature\
    \ [11,22,44].\nTurning to multi-sensor SAR-optical fusion for the purpose of vegetation\
    \ monitoring, a number\nof contributions can be found in the literature [4,11,16,21,45].\
    \ In [11], ALOS POLSAR and Landsat\ntime-series were combined at the feature level\
    \ for forest mapping and monitoring. The same problem\nwas addressed in [21] through\
    \ a decision-level approach. In [45], the fusion of single-date S1 and\nsimulated\
    \ S2 was presented for the purpose of classiﬁcation. In [4], instead, RADARSAT-2\
    \ and\nLandsat-7/8 images were fused, by means of an artiﬁcial neural network,\
    \ to estimate soil moisture\nand leaf area index. The NDVI obtained from the Landsat\
    \ source was combined with different SAR\npolarization subsets for feeding ad\
    \ hoc artiﬁcial networks. A similar feature-level approach, based on\nSentinel\
    \ data, was followed in [16] for the purpose of land cover mapping. To this end,\
    \ the texture\nmaps extracted from the SAR image were combined with several indices\
    \ drawn from the optical bands.\nAlthough\nsome\nfusion\ntechniques\nhave\nbeen\n\
    proposed\nfor\nspatio-temporal\nNDVI\nsuper-resolution [43] or prediction [13],\
    \ they use exclusively optical data. None of these papers\nattempts to directly\
    \ estimate a pure multispectral feature, NDVI or the like, from SAR data. In most\n\
    cases, the fusion, occurring already at the feature level, is intended to provide\
    \ high-level information,\nlike the classiﬁcation or detection of some physical\
    \ item. Conversely, we can register some notable\nexamples of indices directly\
    \ related to physical items of interest, like soil moisture or the area leaf\n\
    index, which have been estimated by fusing SAR and optical data [4,39].\nIn this\
    \ work, we propose several CNN-based algorithms to estimate the NDVI through the\n\
    fusion of optical and SAR Sentinel data. With reference to a speciﬁc case study,\
    \ we acquired temporal\nsequences of S1 SAR data and S2 optical data, covering\
    \ the same time lapse, with the latter partially\ncovered by clouds. Both temporal\
    \ and cross-sensor (S1-S2) dependencies are used to obtain the\nmost effective\
    \ estimation protocol. From the experimental analysis, very interesting results\
    \ emerge.\nOn the one hand, when only optical data are used, CNN-based methods\
    \ outperform consistently the\nconventional temporal interpolators. On the other\
    \ hand, when also SAR data are considered, a further\nsigniﬁcant improvement of\
    \ performance is observed, despite the very different nature of the involved\n\
    signals. It is worth underlining that no peculiar property of the NDVI was exploited,\
    \ and therefore,\nthese results have a wider signiﬁcance, suggesting that other\
    \ image features can be better estimated by\ncross-sensor CNN-based fusion.\n\
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the dataset\
    \ and describe\nthe problem under investigation. In Section 3, the basics of the\
    \ CNN methodology are recalled.\nThen, the speciﬁc prediction architectures are\
    \ detailed in Section 4. In Section 5, we present fusion\nresults and related\
    \ numerical accuracy evaluation. Finally, a detailed discussion of the results\
    \ and\nfuture perspectives is given in Section 6, while conclusions are drawn\
    \ in Section 7.\n2. Dataset and Problem Statement\nThe objective of this work\
    \ is to propose and test a set of solutions to estimate a target optical\nfeature\
    \ at a given date from images acquired at adjacent dates, or even from the temporally-closest\n\
    SAR image. Such different solutions also reﬂect the different operating conditions\
    \ found in practice.\nThe main application is the reconstruction of a feature\
    \ of interest in a target image, which is available,\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 236\n\
    4 of 20\nbut partially or totally cloudy. However, one may also consider the case\
    \ in which the feature is built\nand used on a date for which no image is actually\
    \ available.\nIn this work, we focus on the estimation of the normalized difference\
    \ vegetation index, but it\nis straightforward to apply the same framework to\
    \ other optical features. With reference to Sentinel\nimages, the NDVI is obtained\
    \ at a 10-m spatial resolution by combining, pixel-by-pixel, two bands,\nnear\
    \ infrared (NIR, 8th band) and red (Red, 4th band), as:\nNDVI ≜ NIR − Red\nNIR\
    \ + Red ∈ [−1, 1]\n(1)\nThe area under study is located in the province of Tuy,\
    \ Burkina Faso, around the commune\nof Koumbia. This area is particularly representative\
    \ of West African semiarid agricultural landscapes,\nfor which the Sentinel missions\
    \ offer new opportunities in monitoring vegetation, notably in the\ncontext of\
    \ climate change adaptation and food security. The use of SAR data in conjunction\
    \ with\noptical images is particularly appropriate in these areas, since most\
    \ of the vegetation dynamics take\nplace during the rainy season, especially over\
    \ the cropland, as smallholder rainfed agriculture is\ndominant. This strongly\
    \ reduces the availability of usable optical images in the critical phase of\n\
    vegetation growth, due to the signiﬁcant cloud coverage [46] by which SAR data\
    \ are only loosely\naffected. The 5253 × 4797 pixels scene is monitored from 5\
    \ May–1 November 2016, which corresponds\nto a regular agricultural season in\
    \ the area.\nFigure 1 indicates the available S1 and S2 acquisitions in this period.\
    \ In the case of S2 images,\nthe bar height indicates the percentage of data that\
    \ are not cloudy. It is clear that some dates provide\nlittle or no information.\
    \ Note that, during the rainy season, the lack of sufﬁcient cloud-free optical\n\
    data may represent a major issue, preventing the extraction of spatio-temporal\
    \ optical-based features,\nlike time-series of vegetation, water or soil indices,\
    \ and so on. S1 images, instead, are always completely\navailable, as SAR data\
    \ are insensitive to meteorological conditions.\nmay-05\nmay-15\njun-04\naug-03\n\

    \ test images.\nFor the purpose of training, validation and testing of the proposed\
    \ methods, we kept only\nS2 images that were cloud-free or such that the spatial\
    \ distribution of clouds did not prevent the\nselection of sufﬁciently large training\
    \ and test areas. For the selected S2 images (solid bars in Figure 1),\nthe corresponding\
    \ dates are indicated on the x-axis. Our dataset was then completed by including\
    \ also\nthe S1 images (solid bars), which are temporally closest to the selected\
    \ S2 counterparts. The general\nidea of the proposal is to use the closest cloud-free\
    \ S2 and S1 images to estimate the desired feature\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 236\n\
    5 of 20\non the target date of interest. Therefore, among the seven selected dates,\
    \ only the ﬁve inner ones are\nused as targets. Observe, also, that the resulting\
    \ temporal sampling is rather variable, with intervals\nranging from ten days\
    \ to a couple of months, allowing us to test our methods in different conditions.\n\
    To allow temporal analyses, we chose a test area, of a size of 470 × 450, which\
    \ is cloud-free\nin all the selected dates, hence with the available reference\
    \ ground-truth for any possible optical\nfeature. Figure 2 shows the RGB representation\
    \ of a complete image of the Koumbia dataset (3 August),\ntogether with a zoom\
    \ of the selected test area. Even after discarding the test area, a quite large\
    \ usable\narea remains, from which a sufﬁciently large number of small (33 × 33)\
    \ cloud-free patches is randomly\nextracted for training and validation.\n11°18ʹ0″N\n\

    \ data acquired in interferometric wide swath (IW) mode, in the\nhigh-resolution\
    \ Ground Range Detected (GRD) format as provided by ESA. Such Level-1 products\
    \ are\ngenerally available for most data users and consist of focused SAR data\
    \ detected in magnitude, with a\nnative range by azimuth resolution estimated\
    \ as 20 × 22 meters and a 10 × 10 meter pixel spacing.\nA proper multi-looking\
    \ and ground range projection is applied to provide the ﬁnal GRD product at a\n\
    nominal 10 m spatial resolution. On our side, all images have been calibrated\
    \ (VH/VV intensities to\nsigma naught) and terrain corrected using ancillary data\
    \ and co-registered to provide a 10-m resolution,\nspatially-coherent time series,\
    \ using the ofﬁcial European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel Application\nPlatform\
    \ (SNAP) software [47]. No optical/SAR co-registration has been performed, assuming\
    \ that the\nco-location precision provided by the independent orthorectiﬁcation\
    \ of each product is sufﬁcient for\nthe application. Sentinel-2 data are provided\
    \ by the French Pole Thématique Surfaces Continentales\n(THEIA) [48] and preprocessed\
    \ using the Multi-sensor Atmospheric Correction and Cloud Screening\n(MACCS) Level-2A\
    \ processor [49] developed at the French National Space Agency (CNES) to provide\n\
    surface reﬂectance products, as well as precise cloud masks.\nIn addition to the\
    \ Sentinel data, we assume the availability of two more features, the cloud masks\n\
    for each S2 image and a digital elevation model (DEM). Cloud masks are obviously\
    \ necessary to\nestablish when the prediction is needed and which adjacent dates\
    \ should be involved. The DEM is\na complementary feature that integrates the\
    \ information carried by SAR data and may be useful to\nimprove estimation. It\
    \ was gathered from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) 1 Arc-Second\n\
    Global, with 30-m resolution resampled at 10 m to match the spatial resolution\
    \ of Sentinel data.\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 236\n6 of 20\n3. Convolutional Neural\

    \ neural networks.\nIn the last few years, CNNs have been successfully applied\
    \ to many classical image processing\nproblems, such as denoising [50], super-resolution\
    \ [51], pansharpening [8,24], segmentation [52],\nobject detection [53,54], change\
    \ detection [27] and classiﬁcation [17,55–57]. The main strengths of\nCNNs are\
    \ (i) an extreme versatility that allows them to approximate any sort of linear\
    \ or non-linear\ntransformation, including scaling or hard thresholding; (ii)\
    \ no need to design handcrafted ﬁlters,\nreplaced by machine learning; (iii) high-speed\
    \ processing, thanks to parallel computing. On the\ndownside, for correct training,\
    \ CNNs require the availability of a large amount of data with the\nground-truth\
    \ (examples). In our speciﬁc case, data are not a problem, given the unlimited\
    \ quantity of\ncloud-free Sentinel-2 time-series that can be downloaded from the\
    \ web repositories. However, using\nlarge datasets has a cost in terms of complexity\
    \ and may lead to unreasonably long training times.\nUsually, a CNN is a chain\
    \ (parallels, loops or other combinations are also possible) of different layers,\n\
    like convolution, nonlinearities, pooling and deconvolution. For image processing\
    \ tasks in which the\ndesired output is an image at the same resolution of the\
    \ input, as in this work, only convolutional\nlayers interleaved with nonlinear\
    \ activations are typically employed.\nThe generic l-th convolutional layer, with\
    \ N-band input x(l), yields an M-band stack z(l) computed as:\nz(l) = w(l) ∗ x(l)\
    \ + b(l),\nwhose m-th component can be written in terms of ordinary 2D convolutions:\n\
    z(l)(m, ·, ·) =\nN\n∑\nn=1\nw(l)(m, n, ·, ·) ∗ x(l)(n, ·, ·) + b(l)(m).\nThe tensor\
    \ w is a set of M convolutional N × (K × K) kernels, with a K × K spatial support\n\
    (receptive ﬁeld), while b is an M-vector bias. These parameters, compactly, Φl\
    \ ≜\n\x10\nw(l), b(l)\x11\n, are\nlearned during the training phase. If the convolution\
    \ is followed by a pointwise activation function\ngl(·), then the overall layer\
    \ output is given by:\ny(l) = gl(z(l)) = gl(w(l) ∗ x(l) + b(l)) ≜ fl(x(l), Φl).\n\
    (2)\nDue to the good convergence properties it ensures [55], the rectiﬁed linear\
    \ unit (ReLU), deﬁned as\ng(·) ≜ max(0, ·), is a typical activation function of\
    \ choice for input or hidden layers.\nAssuming a simple L-layer cascade architecture,\
    \ the overall processing will be:\nf (x, Φ) = fL( fL−1(. . . f1(x, Φ1), . . .\
    \ , ΦL−1), ΦL),\n(3)\nwhere Φ ≜ (Φ1, . . . , ΦL) is the whole set of parameters\
    \ to learn. In this chain, each layer l provides\na set of so-called feature maps,\
    \ y(l), which activate on local cues in the early stages (small l), to become\n\
    more and more representative of abstract and global phenomena in subsequent ones\
    \ (large l). In this\nwork, all proposed solutions are based on a simple three-layer\
    \ architecture, and differ only in the input\nlayer, as different combinations\
    \ of input bands are considered.\nOnce the architecture has been chosen, its parameters\
    \ are learned by means of some optimization\nstrategy. An example is the stochastic\
    \ gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, specifying the cost to be\nminimized over\
    \ a properly-selected training dataset. Details on training will be given below\
    \ for our\nspeciﬁc solution.\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 236\n7 of 20\n4. Proposed\
    \ Prediction Architectures\nIn the following developments, with reference to a\
    \ given target S2 image acquired at time t,\nwe will consider the items deﬁned\
    \ below:\n•\nF: unknown feature (NDVI in this work) at time t;\n•\nF− and F+:\
    \ feature F at the previous and next useful times, respectively;\n•\nS ≜ (SVV,\
    \ SVH): double polarized SAR image closest to F (within ±5 days for our dataset);\n\
    •\nS− and S+: SAR images closest to F− and F+, respectively;\n•\nD: DEM.\nThe\
    \ several models considered here differ in the composition of the input stack\
    \ x, while the output\nis always the NDVI at the target date, that is y = F. Apart\
    \ from the input layer, the CNN architecture\nis always the same, depicted in\
    \ Figure 3, with hyper-parameters summarized in Table 1. The focus on\nthe choice\
    \ of this conﬁguration is postponed to the end of this section. This relatively\
    \ shallow CNN\nis characterized by a rather small number of weights (as CNNs go),\
    \ counted in Table 1, and hence\ncan be trained with a small amount of data. Moreover,\
    \ slightly different architectures have proven to\nachieve state-of-the-art performance\
    \ in closely-related applications, such as super-resolution [51] and\ndata fusion\

    \ solution and will be made explicit below.\nIn order to provide output values\
    \ falling in the compact interval [−1,1], as required by the NDVI\nsemantics (Equation\
    \ (1)), one can include a suitable nonlinear activation, like tanh(·), to complete\
    \ the\noutput layer. In such a case, it is customary to use a cross-entropy loss\
    \ for training. As an alternative,\none may remove the nonlinear output mapping\
    \ altogether and simply take the result of the convolution,\nwhich can be optimized\
    \ using, for example, a Ln-norm. Obviously, in this case, a hard clipping of\n\
    the output is still needed, but this additional transformation does not participate\
    \ in the error back\npropagation, hence it should be considered external to the\
    \ network. Through preliminary experiments,\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 236\n8 of\
    \ 20\nwe have found this latter solution more effective than the former, for our\
    \ task, and therefore, we train\nthe CNN considering a linear activation in the\
    \ last layer, g3(z(3)) = z(3).\nWe now describe brieﬂy the different solutions\
    \ considered here, which depend on the available\ninput data and the required\
    \ response time.\nConcerning data, we will consider estimation based on optical-only,\
    \ SAR-only and optical + SAR\ndata. When using SAR images, we will also test the\
    \ inclusion of the DEM, which may convey relevant\ninformation about them. Instead,\
    \ the DEM is useless, and hence neglected, when only optical data\nare used. All\
    \ these cases are of interest, for the following reasons.\n–\nThe optical-only\
    \ case allows for a direct comparison, with the same input data, between the\n\
    proposed CNN-based solution and the current baseline, which relies on temporal\
    \ linear\ninterpolation. Therefore, it will provide us with a measure of the net\
    \ performance gain guaranteed\nby deep learning over conventional processing.\n\
    –\nAlthough SAR and optical data provide complementary information, the occurrence\
    \ of a given\nphysical item, like water or vegetation, can be detected by means\
    \ of both scattering properties and\nspectral signatures. The analysis of the\
    \ SAR-only case will allow us to understand if signiﬁcant\ndependencies exist\
    \ between the NDVI and SAR images and if a reasonable quality can be achieved\n\
    even when only this source is used for estimation. To this aim, we do not count\
    \ on the temporal\ndependencies in this case, trying to estimate a S2 feature\
    \ from the closest S1 image only.\n–\nThe optical-SAR fusion is the case of highest\
    \ interest for us. Given the most complete set of relevant\ninput and an adequate\
    \ training set, the proposed CNN will synthesize expressive features and is\n\
    expected to provide a high-quality NDVI estimate.\nTurning to response time, except\
    \ for the SAR-only case, we will distinguish between “nearly”\ncausal estimation,\
    \ in which only data already available at time t, for example D, F−, S−, or shortly\n\
    later, can be used, and non-causal estimation, when the whole time series is supposed\
    \ to be available,\nand so future images (F+ and/or S+) are involved. In the former\
    \ case causality can be violated only by\nS and this happens only in two dates\
    \ out of ﬁve, 15 May (three-day delay) and 2 September (one-day\ndelay), in our\
    \ experiments.\n–\nCausal estimation is of interest whenever the data must be\
    \ used right away for the application\nof interest. This is the case, for example,\
    \ of early warning systems for food security. We will\ninclude here also the case\
    \ in which the closest SAR image becomes available after time t, since\nthe maximum\
    \ delay is at most ﬁve days. Hereinafter, we will refer to this “nearly” causal\
    \ case as\ncausal for short.\n–\nOn the other hand, in the absence of temporal\
    \ constraints, all relevant data should be taken into\naccount to obtain the best\
    \ possible quality, therefore using non-causal estimation.\nTable 2 summarizes\
    \ all these different solutions.\nTable 2. Proposed models. The naming reﬂects\
    \ the input stacking, explicated on the right. “SAR” refers\nto S1 images and\
    \ “Optical” to S2 products (F±). “+” marks the inclusion of the DEM. Moreover,\
    \ “C”\nstands for causal.\nInput Bands\nModel Name\nbx\nOptical\nSAR\nDEM\nSAR\n\

    \ to learn the network parameters, a sufﬁciently large training set, say T, of\
    \ input-output\nexamples t is needed:\nT ≜ {t1, . . . , tQ},\nt ≜ (x, yref)\n\
    In our speciﬁc case, x will be a sample of the concatenated images from which\
    \ we want to estimate\nthe target NDVI map, with yref the desired output. Of course,\
    \ all involved optical images must be\ncloud-free over the selected patches.\n\
    Formally, the objective of the training phase is to ﬁnd:\nΦ = arg min\nΦ\nJ (T,\
    \ Φ) ≜ arg min\nΦ\n1\nQ ∑\nt∈T\nL(t, Φ)\nwhere L(t, Φ) is a suitable loss function.\
    \ Several losses can be found in the literature, like Ln norms,\ncross-entropy\
    \ and negative log-likelihood. The choice depends on the domain of the output\
    \ and\naffects the convergence properties of the networks [58]. Our experiments\
    \ have shown the L1-norm\n(Equation (4)) to be more effective than other options\
    \ for training; therefore, we keep this choice, which\nproved effective also in\
    \ other generative problems [24]:\nL(t, Φ) ∝ || f (x, Φ) − yref||1.\n(4)\nAs for\
    \ minimization, the most widespread procedure, adopted also in this work, is the\
    \ SGD with\nmomentum [59]. The training set is partitioned into batches of samples,\
    \ T = {B1, . . . , BP}. At each\niteration, a new batch is used to estimate the\
    \ gradient and update parameters as:\nν(n+1) ← µν(n) + α∇ΦJ\n\x10\nBjn, Φ(n)\x11\
    \nΦ(n+1) ← Φ(n) − ν(n+1)\nA whole scan of the training set is called an epoch,\
    \ and training a deep network may require from\ndozens of epochs, for simpler\
    \ problems like handwritten character recognition [60], to thousands of\nepochs\
    \ for complex classiﬁcation tasks [55]. The accuracy and speed of training depend\
    \ on both the\ninitialization of Φ and the setting of hyperparameters like learning\
    \ rate α and momentum µ, with α\nbeing the most critical, impacting heavily on\
    \ stability and convergence time. In particular, we have\nfound experimentally\
    \ optimal values for these parameters, which are α = 0.5 × 10−3 and µ = 0.9.\n\
    For an effective training of the networks, a large cloud-free dataset is necessary,\
    \ with geophysical\nproperties as close as possible to those of the target data.\
    \ This is readily guaranteed whenever all\nimages involved in the process, for\
    \ example F−, F and F+, share a relatively large cloud-free area.\nPatches will\
    \ be extracted from this area to train the network, which, afterwards, will be\
    \ used to estimate\nF also on the clouded area, obtaining a complete coverage\
    \ at the target date.\nFor our relatively small networks (~7 × 104 weights to\
    \ learn in the worst case; see Table 1), a set\nof 19,000 patches is sufﬁcient\
    \ for accurate training, as already observed for other generative tasks\nlike\
    \ super-resolution [51] or pansharpening [8] addressed with CNNs of a similar\
    \ size. With our\npatch extraction process, this number requires an overall cloud-free\
    \ area of about 1000 × 1000 pixels,\nnamely about 4% of our 5253 × 4797 target\
    \ scene (Figure 2). If the unclouded regions are more\nscattered, this percentage\
    \ may somewhat grow, but remains always quite limited. Therefore, a perfectly\n\
    ﬁt training set will be available most of the times (always, in our experiments).\
    \ However, if the scene is\nalmost completely covered by clouds at the target\
    \ date, one may build a good training set by searching\nfor data that are spatially\
    \ and/or temporally close, characterized by similar landscape dynamics,\nor resorting\
    \ to data collected at other similar sites. This case will be discussed in more\
    \ detail with the\nhelp of a temporal transfer learning example in Section 6.\
    \ In the present case, instead, for each date,\na dataset composed of 15,200 33\
    \ × 33 examples for training, plus 3800 more for validation, was created\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2018, 10, 236\n10 of 20\nby sampling the target scene with an eight-pixel\
    \ stride in both spatial directions, always skipping test\narea and cloudy regions.\
    \ Then, the whole collection was shufﬂed to avoid biases when creating the\n128-example\
    \ mini-batches used in the SGD algorithm.\nTo conclude this section, we present\
    \ in Figure 4 some preliminary results about the evolution\nof the loss computed\
    \ on the validation dataset during the training process for a sample proposed\n\
    architecture and for some deviations from it. Although the L1 loss (or mean absolute\
    \ error) has not\nbeen directly considered for the accuracy evaluation presented\
    \ in the next section, which refers to\nwidespread measures of quality, it is\
    \ strictly related to them and can provide a rough preview of the\nperformance.\
    \ For the sake of simplicity, we gather in Figure 4 only a subset of meaningful\
    \ orthogonal\nhyperparameter variations. The ﬁrst observation is that after 500\
    \ training epochs, all models are about\nto converge, and doubling such a number\
    \ would provide a negligible gain as tested experimentally.\nDecreasing the number\
    \ of layers w.r.t. the reference architecture implies a considerable performance\n\
    drop. On the other side, increasing the network complexity with an additional\
    \ layer does not bring\nany gain. The number of features is also a factor that\
    \ can impact on accuracy. Figure 4 reports the\ncases when the number of features\
    \ for the ﬁrst layer is changed from 48 (proposed) to either 32 or 64.\nIn this\
    \ case, however, the losses are very close to each other, with the proposed and\
    \ the 64-feature\ncase almost coincident at the end of the training. The last\
    \ two plots show the impact of the learning\nrate α, and again, the proposed setting\
    \ (5 × 10−3) is “optimal” if compared with neighboring choices\n(10−3 and 10−2).\
    \ It is also worth underlining that using an higher learning rate, e.g., 10−2,\
    \ one can\ninduce a steep decay in the early phase of training, which can be paid\
    \ with a premature convergence.\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n5\n6\n7 ·10−2\nepochs\n\

    \ variants obtained by\nchanging one hyper-parameter at time.\nBesides accuracy,\
    \ complexity is also affected by architectural choices. For the same variants\n\
    compared in Figure 4, we report the average training time in Table 3, registered\
    \ using an NVIDIA GPU,\nGeForce GTX TITAN X. The test time is instead negligible\
    \ in comparison with that of training and is\ntherefore neglected. For all models,\
    \ the total cost for training is in the order of one hour. However,\nas expected,\
    \ increasing the number of network parameters adding layers or features impacts\
    \ the\ncomputational cost. Eventually, the proposed architecture is the result\
    \ of a tradeoff between accuracy\nand complexity.\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 236\n\

    3263\n3264\n5. Experimental Results\nIn order to assess the accuracy of the proposed\
    \ solutions, we consider two reference methods for\ncomparison, a deterministic\
    \ linear interpolator (temporal gap-ﬁlling), which can be regarded as the\nbaseline,\
    \ and afﬁne regression, both in causal and non-causal conﬁgurations. Temporal\
    \ gap ﬁlling\nwas proposed in [46] in the context of the development of a national-scale\
    \ crop mapping processor\nbased on Sentinel-2 time series and implemented as a\
    \ remote module of the Orfeo Toolbox [61]. This is\na practical solution used\
    \ by analysts [46] to monitor vegetation processes through NDVI time-series.\n\
    Besides being simple, it is also more generally applicable and robust than higher-order\
    \ models, which\nrequire a larger number of points to interpolate and may overﬁt\
    \ the data. Since temporal gap ﬁlling is\nnon-causal, we add a further causal\
    \ interpolator for completeness, a simple zero-order hold. Of course,\ndeterministic\
    \ interpolation does not take into account the correlation between available and\
    \ target\ndata, which can help in performing a better estimate and can be easily\
    \ computed based on a tiny\ncloud-free fraction of the target image. Therefore,\
    \ for a fairer comparison, we consider as a further\nreference the afﬁne regressors,\
    \ both causal and non-causal, optimized using the least square method.\nIf suitable,\
    \ post-processing may be included for spatial regularization, both for the reference\
    \ and\nproposed methods. This option is not pursued here. In summary, the following\
    \ alternatives are\nconsidered for comparison:\nbF =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\

    \ out on the basis of three commonly-used indicators,\nthe correlation coefﬁcient\
    \ (ρ), the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and the structural similarity\n\
    measure (SSIM). These are gathered in Tables 4–6, respectively, for all proposed\

    \ and Future Perspective\nIn this section, we will discuss the accuracy of the\
    \ proposed methods both objectively, through\nthe numerical results gathered in\
    \ Tables 4–6, and subjectively by visually inspecting Figures 5 and 6.\nThen,\
    \ we conclude the section discussing critical conditions when training data cannot\
    \ be retrieved\nfrom the target.\nLet us start with the numerical evaluation focusing\
    \ for the time being on the ρ Table 4 and in\nparticular on the last column with\
    \ average values, which accounts well for the main trends. First of\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2018, 10, 236\n15 of 20\nall, the fully-cross-sensor solutions, based on only-SAR\
    \ or SAR + DEM data, respectively, are not\ncompetitive with methods exploiting\
    \ optical data, with a correlation index barely exceeding 0.6.\nNonetheless, they\
    \ allow one to obtain a rough estimate of the NDVI in the absence of optical coverage,\n\
    proving that even a pure spectral feature can be inferred from SAR images, thanks\
    \ to the dependencies\nexisting between the geometrical and spectral properties\
    \ of the scene. Moreover, SAR images provide\ninformation on the target, which\
    \ is not available in optical images, and complementary to it. Hence,\ntheir inclusion\
    \ can help with boosting the performance of methods relying on optical data.\n\
    Turning to the latter, we observe, as expected, that non-causal models largely\
    \ outperform the\ncorresponding causal counterparts. As an example, for the baseline\
    \ interpolator, ρ grows from\n0.761 (causal) to 0.846 (non-causal), showing that\
    \ the constraint of near real-time processing has\na severe impact on estimation\
    \ quality.\nHowever, even with the constraint of causality, most of this gap can\
    \ be ﬁlled by resorting to\nCNN-based methods. By using the very same data for\
    \ prediction, that is, only F−, the optical/C\nmodel reaches already ρ = 0.821.\
    \ This grows to 0.847 (like the non-causal interpolator) when also\nSAR data are\
    \ used and to 0.852 when also the DEM is included. Therefore, both the use CNN-based\n\
    estimation and the inclusion of SAR data guarantee a clear improvement. On the\
    \ contrary, using\na simple statistical regressor is of little or no help (causal\
    \ interpolator and regressor behave equally\nw.r.t. ρ by deﬁnition). Looking at\
    \ the individual dates, a clear dependence on the time gaps emerges.\nFor the\
    \ causal baseline, in particular, the ρ varies wildly, from 0.610–0.976. Indeed,\
    \ when the previous\nimage is temporally close to the target, like for 15 May,\
    \ and hence strongly correlated with it, even this\ntrivial method provides a\
    \ very good estimation, and more sophisticated methods cannot give much of\nan\
    \ improvement. However, things change radically when the previous available image\
    \ is acquired\nlong before the target, like for the 3 August or 12 October dates.\
    \ In these cases, the baseline does\nnot provide acceptable estimates anymore,\
    \ and CNN-based methods give a large performance gain,\nensuring a ρ always close\
    \ to 0.8 even in the worst cases.\nMoving now to non-causal estimation, we observe\
    \ a similar trend. Both reference methods\nare signiﬁcantly outperformed by the\
    \ CNN-based solutions working on the same data, and further\nimprovements are\
    \ obtained by including SAR and DEM. The overall average gain, from 0.851–0.907,\n\
    is not as large as before, since we start from a much better baseline, but still\
    \ quite signiﬁcant. Examining\nthe individual dates, similar considerations as\
    \ before arise, with the difference that now, two time gaps\nmust be taken into\
    \ account, with previous and next images. As expected, the CNN-based methods\n\
    provide the largest improvements when both gaps are rather large, that is, 30\
    \ days or more, like for the\n3 August and 2 September images.\nThe very same\
    \ trends outlined for the ρ are observed also with reference to the PSNR and SSIM\n\
    data, shown in Tables 5 and 6. Note that, unlike ρ and SSIM, the PSNR is quite\
    \ sensitive to biases on\nthe mean, which is why, in this case, the statistical\
    \ afﬁne regressor provides signiﬁcant gains over the\nlinear interpolator. In\
    \ any case, the best performance is always obtained using CNN-based methods\n\
    relying on both optical and SAR data, with large improvements with respect to\
    \ the reference methods.\nFurther insight into the behavior of the compared methods\
    \ can be gained by visual inspection of\nsome sample results. To this end, we\
    \ consider two target dates, 4 June and 3 August, characterized by\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ temporal changes in spectral features with respect to the closest available\
    \ dates. In the ﬁrst\ncase, a high correlation exists with the previous date ρ\
    \ = 0.8925, but not with the next ρ = 0.6566.\nIn the second, both correlation\
    \ indexes are quite low, 0.6566 and 0.6704, respectively. These changes\ncan be\
    \ easily appreciated in the images, shown in the top row of Figures 5 and 6, respectively.\
    \ In both\nﬁgures, the results of most of the methods described before are reported,\
    \ omitting less informative\ncases for the sake of clarity. To allow easy interpretation\
    \ of results, images are organized for increasing\ncomplexity from left to right,\
    \ with causal and non-causal versions shown in the second and third row,\nrespectively.\
    \ As the only exception, the first column shows results for SAR+ and non-causal\
    \ interpolator.\nMoreover, in the last two rows, the corresponding absolute error\
    \ images are shown, suitably magnified,\nwith the same stretching and reverse\
    \ scale (white means no error) for better visibility.\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10,\
    \ 236\n16 of 20\nFor 4 June, the estimation task is much simpliﬁed by the availability\
    \ of the highly correlated\n15 May image. Since this precedes the target, causal\
    \ estimators work almost as well as non-causal ones.\nModerate gradual improvements\
    \ are observed going from left to right. Nonetheless, by comparing\nthe ﬁrst (interpolator)\
    \ and last (optical-SAR+) non-causal solutions, a signiﬁcant accumulated\nimprovement\
    \ can be perceived, which becomes obvious in the error images. In this case, the\
    \ SAR-only\nestimate is also quite good, and the joint use of optical and SAR\
    \ data (fourth column) provides\nsome improvements.\nFor the 3 August image, the\
    \ task is much harder; no good predictor images are available, especially\nthe\
    \ previous image, 60 days old. In these conditions, there is clear improvement\
    \ when going from\ncausal to non-causal methods, even more visible in the error\
    \ images. Likewise, the left-to-right\nimprovements are very clear, both in the\
    \ predicted images (compare for example the sharp estimate of\noptical-SAR+ with\
    \ the much smoother output of the regressor) and in the error images, which become\n\
    generally brighter (smaller errors) and have fewer black patches. In this case,\
    \ the SAR-only estimate is\ntoo noisy, while the joint solution (fourth column)\
    \ provides a sensible gain over the others.\nTable 7. Temporal transfer learning\
    \ results for model “Optical-SAR+”. The (i, j) table entry corresponds\nto the\
    \ accuracy (ρ) obtained on the j-th date (column) when training is carried out\
    \ on the i-th date (row).\n15 May\n4 June\n3 August\n2 September\n12 October\n\

    0.9289\nTo conclude this discussion, let us now focus on the learning-related\
    \ issues. In particular,\na fundamental question is how to proceed when no training\
    \ data can be collected from the target\nimage at a given time (fully cloudy condition).\
    \ To what extent we can use a machine learning model\ntrained elsewhere? This\
    \ is a key problem in machine learning and is very relevant for a number of\n\
    remote sensing applications, such as coregistration [62] or pansharpening [24].\
    \ In [62], the importance\nof selecting training data which are homogeneous with\
    \ the target has been underlined. In [24], it is\nshown that the performance of\
    \ a CNN can drop dramatically without a proper domain adaptation\nstrategy, and\
    \ the target-adaptive solution is proposed.\nTo gain insight into this critical\
    \ point, we beneﬁt from a simple test that gives an idea of the scale\nof the\
    \ problem. In particular, we have considered several training-test mismatches\
    \ by transferring\ntemporally the learned models. The accuracy assessed in terms\
    \ of the correlation index (similar results\nare obtained for PSNR and SSIM) for\
    \ all transfer combinations is shown in Table 7. The i-th row collects\nthe results\
    \ obtained on all dates by the model trained on the i-th date. Surprisingly, given\
    \ a target date,\nthe best model does not necessarily lie on the matrix diagonal,\
    \ as in three out of ﬁve cases, a model\ntransferred from a neighboring date outperforms\
    \ the model trained on the target date. More in general,\nwith one exception,\
    \ entry (2 September, 3 August), diagonal-adjacent values are relatively high,\
    \ while\nmoving away from diagonal (toward cross-season transfer), the accuracy\
    \ deteriorates progressively.\nIn other words, this table suggests that when weather\
    \ conditions are such that no training data can be\ncollected from the target,\
    \ one can resort to some extent to models trained in the same period of the year\n\
    as the spatio-temporal landscape dynamics are likely very similar. This means\
    \ also that one can refer\nfor training to acquisitions of previous years in similar\
    \ periods. It is also worth visually inspecting\nsome related estimates. In Figure\
    \ 7, for two sample target dates, we show the results obtained in\nnormal conditions\
    \ or by transferring the learning from different dates, the best (same season)\
    \ and the\nworst (cross-season) cases. Again it can be observed that models trained\
    \ within the season of the target\ncan work pretty well. On the contrary, although\
    \ preserving spatial details, when crossing the season,\nover- or under-estimate\
    \ phenomena can occur. In particular, if the model is trained in the rainy season\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 236\n17 of 20\n(rich vegetation) and tested in the dry\
    \ season (poor vegetation), we get over-estimation, while in the\nopposite case,\
    \ we get under-estimation.\nGround-truth\nno transfer: ρ = 0.978\nbest transfer:\

    \ and worst cases).\n7. Conclusions\nWe have proposed and analyzed CNN-based methods\
    \ for the estimation of spectral features when\noptical data are missing. Several\
    \ models have been considered, causal and non-causal, single-sensor\nand joint-sensor,\
    \ to take into account various situations of practical interest. Validation has\
    \ been\nconducted with reference to NDVI maps, using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2\
    \ time-series, but the proposed\nframework is quite general and can be readily\
    \ extended to the estimation of other spectral features.\nIn all cases, the proposed\
    \ methods outperform largely the conventional references, especially in the\n\
    presence of large temporal gaps. Besides proving the potential of deep learning\
    \ for remote sensing,\nexperiments have shown that SAR images can be used to obtain\
    \ a meaningful estimate of spectral\nindexes when other sources of information\
    \ are not available.\nSuch encouraging results suggest further investigation on\
    \ these topics. First of all, very deep\nCNN architectures should be tested, as\
    \ they proved extremely successful in other ﬁelds. However,\nthis requires the\
    \ creation of a large representative dataset for training. In addition, more advanced\n\
    deep learning solutions for generative problems should be considered, such as\
    \ the recently-proposed\ngenerative adversarial networks [63]. Finally, cross-sensor\
    \ estimation from SAR data is a stimulating\nresearch theme and certainly deserves\
    \ further study.\nSupplementary Materials: The software, developed in Python 2.7,\

  explanation: The research paper by Ye et al. proposes a new decision-making algorithm
    for uncertain data fusion based on the combination of grey relation analysis and
    Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. Specifically, the algorithm analyzes the adaptive
    data preprocessing methods used for dealing with varying data quality and formats
    from heterogeneous data sources, such as data normalization, feature scaling,
    and data fusion techniques (e.g., Dempster-Shafer theory and Bayesian inference).
  extract_1: The proposed decision-making algorithm for uncertain fusion firstly obtains
    the sensor’s credibility through the introduction of grey relation theory and
    then defines two impact factors as sensor’s credibility and evidence’s overall
    discriminability according to the focal element analyses and evidence’s distance
    analysis, respectively; after that, it uses the impact factors to modify the evidences
    and finally gets more reasonable and effective results through DS combination
    rule.
  extract_2: Simulation results and analyses demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
    can overcome the trouble caused by large evidence conflict and one-vote veto,
    which indicates that it can improve the ability of target judgment and enhance
    precision of uncertain data fusion.

    \ as the key technology for uncertain data fusion, is the core to obtain reasonable\
    \ multisensor\ninformation fusion results. DS evidence theory is a typical and\
    \ widely applicable decision-making method. However, DS evidence\ntheory makes\
    \ decisions without considering the sensors’ difference, which may lead to illogical\
    \ results. In this paper, we present\na novel decision-making algorithm for uncertain\
    \ fusion based on grey relation and DS evidence theory. The proposed algorithm\n\
    comprehensively takes consideration of sensor’s credibility and evidence’s overall\
    \ discriminability, which can solve the uncertainty\nproblems caused by inconsistence\
    \ of sensors themselves and complexity of monitoring environment and simultaneously\
    \ ensure the\nvalidity and accuracy of fusion results. The innovative decision-making\
    \ algorithm firstly obtains the sensor’s credibility through the\nintroduction\
    \ of grey relation theory and then defines two impact factors as sensor’s credibility\
    \ and evidence’s overall discriminability\naccording to the focal element analyses\
    \ and evidence’s distance analysis, respectively; after that, it uses the impact\

    \ that the proposed algorithm can overcome the trouble caused by large evidence\
    \ conflict and one-vote veto, which\nindicates that it can improve the ability\
    \ of target judgment and enhance precision of uncertain data fusion. Thus the\
    \ novel decision-\nmaking method has a certain application value.\n1. Introduction\n\
    In practical applications, single sensor is difficult to meet\nthe requirements\
    \ like target accuracy and identification\nperformance. Thus, there is a broad\
    \ application of decision-\nmaking algorithm on data fusion about target’s attributes,\n\
    characteristics, and types through comprehensive processing\nof information obtained\
    \ from multisensor. Currently, data\ndecision-making technology [1–3] based on\
    \ multisensor is\nhighly valued by scholars at home and abroad. In addition,\n\
    a lot of theorems and algorithms emerge in the area of\ndata decision-making.\
    \ However, due to constraints on the\nattributes as well as the types of data,\
    \ there is still no unified\ntheoretical framework or unique algorithm for classification\n\
    issue of multisensor data decision-making.\nFor multisensor decision-making field,\
    \ the traditional\nalgorithms are statistical method [4], empirical reasoning\
    \ [5],\nvoting method [6], Bayesian inference [7], template method\n[5], and adaptive\
    \ neural network [8], among others. These\ntypical methods all can settle the\
    \ decision fusion of multisen-\nsor information to some extent, whereas they all\
    \ have some\ndefects. Statistical method, empirical reasoning, and voting\nmethod\
    \ are too simple to achieve the reliable decision results\nfor multisensor information\
    \ fusion. Bayesian inference needs\nthe prior knowledge of environment to finish\
    \ the reasoning,\nwhich cannot be guaranteed in actual applications. And\ntemplate\
    \ method would waste time and energy of system\nwhen selecting the suitable template\
    \ according to certain\nrules. Although adaptive neural network can fulfill a\
    \ reason-\nable decision fusion, it is usually not adopted in practical\napplications\
    \ because of its large computation complexity. DS\nevidence theory [9, 10] is\
    \ favored for its ability of dealing with\nuncertainty, integration of measurement\
    \ information, and\nreasonable theoretical derivation. Thus, DS evidence theory\n\
    has become the mainstream method in multisensor decision-\nmaking field.\nAs a\
    \ wildly used decision-making algorithm for uncertain\ndata fusion, DS evidence\
    \ theory is able to deal with the uncer-\ntainty and imprecision of multisensor\
    \ information fusion.\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\nJournal of Sensors\nVolume\
    \ 2016, Article ID 3954573, 11 pages\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/3954573\n\
    2\nJournal of Sensors\nHence, DS evidence theory can properly handle the incon-\n\
    sistency of sensor conditions and complexity of monitoring\nenvironment. With\
    \ its introduction and perfection put for-\nward by Dempster and Shafer, respectively,\
    \ DS evidence the-\nory occupies a lot in the development of intelligent computing\n\
    and identification theory for multisensor information fusion.\nAlong with its\
    \ development, DS evidence theory has been\nwidely applied in various fields,\
    \ like pattern recognition [11],\ntarget identification [12], cognitive radio\
    \ network [13], fault\ndiagnosis [14], signal recognition [15], and decision-making\n\
    [16], among others. Although there are some problems of\nDS evidence theory itself,\
    \ these problems can be effectively\nsolved through rigorous theoretical derivation,\
    \ scientific\nimprovements, and combination with other methods. For\nexample,\
    \ a new entropy, named as Deng entropy, is proposed\nin [17] to handle the uncertain\
    \ measure of BPA, which is\nthe generalization of Shannon entropy. The new entropy\n\
    provides a promising way to measure the uncertainty of\nmultisensor fusion system.\
    \ Besides, Deng entropy is applied\nin [18] to realize the measurement of information\
    \ volume\nof the evidence. This improvement makes the application\nof DS evidence\
    \ theory with more validity and robustness.\nDue to limit space, the classic modified\
    \ methods [19–31]\nare exhibited in references and partially taken as compared\n\
    methods in Section 5.2.\nIn this paper, systematic research is implemented on\n\
    DS evidence theory, and the multisensor decision-making\nalgorithm is realized\
    \ by the combination of DS evidence\ntheory and grey relation analysis [32, 33].\
    \ The proposed\ndecision-making algorithm for uncertain data fusion firstly\n\
    utilizes sensors’ report generator to settle the acquisition\nprocessing of sensor’s\
    \ credibility by the introduction of grey\nrelation theory. Then, the sensor’s\
    \ credibility is consecutively\nadjusted by two different processes of consistency\
    \ and conflict\nanalysis in focal elements. At the same time, the novel method\n\
    defines the evidence’s overall discriminability according to\nthe concept of evidence’s\
    \ distance function. Finally, the\noriginal evidences are modified by two impact\
    \ factors as\nsensor’s credibility and evidence’s overall discriminability,\n\
    which can ensure getting more reasonable and effective\ndecision-making results\
    \ after evidences combine.\nThis paper is organized as follows. The theoretical\
    \ theo-\nrem and derivation of DS evidence theory and grey relation\ntheory are\
    \ briefly introduced in the next section. And the\nimplementation diagram and\
    \ flow chart of uncertain data\nfusion system are given in Section 3. Then, Section\
    \ 4 high-\nlights the implementation method and specific steps of the\nnew decision-making\
    \ algorithm for uncertain data fusion,\nand Section 5 presents the simulation\
    \ results and comparative\nanalyses. Concluding remarks are given in the last\
    \ section of\nthis paper.\n2. Theoretical Foundations\nDS evidence theory and\
    \ grey relation theory are separately\npresented in this section, which are the\
    \ foundations of the\nnovel decision-making algorithm in this paper.\n2.1. DS\
    \ Evidence Theory. DS evidence theory, also called\nDempster-Shafer theory, is\
    \ an effective data decision-making\nmethod to deal with the uncertainty of multisensor\
    \ infor-\nmation fusion system. Relative to probability theory [5], DS\nevidence\
    \ theory can settle imprecise data and has a more\nextensive application area.\
    \ Similar to Bayesian inference [7],\nDS evidence theory uses the prior probability\
    \ to represent the\nevidence interval of posterior probability, which can quantify\n\
    the credible degree and plausibility degree of propositions. DS\nevidence theory\
    \ is briefly comprised by the following four key\npoints.\n2.1.1. Frame of Discernment\
    \ and the Power Set. In DS model,\nthe frame of discernment (FoD) denoted by Θ\
    \ indicates a set\nof \U0001D441 mutually exclusive and exhaustive hypotheses,\
    \ which\nrepresents all interested propositions. And FoD is defined as\nthe form\

    2.1.2. Basic Probability Assignment. The basic probability\nassignment (BPA) is\
    \ a mass function \U0001D45A : 2Θ → [0, 1] defined\non 2Θ, which should satisfy\
    \ the following demands:\n\U0001D45A (0) = 0,\n∑\n\U0001D434⊆Θ\n\U0001D45A (\U0001D434\
    ) = 1,\n(3)\n∀\U0001D434 ∈ 2Θ. \U0001D45A(\U0001D434) is called the mass function\
    \ of proposition\n\U0001D434 that represents the basic belief degree and initial\
    \ support\ndegree strictly assigned to proposition \U0001D434 [17].\nDue to the\
    \ lack of further knowledge, \U0001D45A(\U0001D434) cannot be\nsubdivided. Any\
    \ proposition satisfying that \U0001D45A(\U0001D434) > 0 (\U0001D434 ∈\n2Θ) is\
    \ called the focal element, and the set of all focal elements\nis named as the\
    \ core of BPA.\n2.1.3. Belief Function and Plausibility Function. DS evidence\n\
    theory designates two uncertain measurements as the belief\nfunction (Bel) and\
    \ plausibility function (Pl). Similar to the\ndefinition of BPA, Bel and Pl can\
    \ be defined, respectively, as\nBel (\U0001D434) = ∑\n\U0001D435⊆\U0001D434\n\U0001D45A\

    \ ∈ 2Θ, where Bel(\U0001D434) is interpreted as the low probability\nof \U0001D434\
    , while Pl(\U0001D434) is interpreted as the upper probability of\n\U0001D434\
    . The relationship between Bel(\U0001D434) and Pl(\U0001D434) is derived as\n\
    follows:\nBel (\U0001D434) ≤ Pl (\U0001D434) ,\nPl (\U0001D434) = 1 − Bel (\U0001D434\
    ) ,\n(6)\nwhere \U0001D434 is the complement set of \U0001D434.\nAccording to\
    \ the relationship between Bel(\U0001D434) and Pl(\U0001D434),\nDS evidence theory\
    \ also divides the evidence interval into\nsupporting interval, uncertainty interval,\
    \ and rejecting inter-\nval, which are shown in Figure 1.\nThe interval [Bel(\U0001D434\
    ), Pl(\U0001D434)] is named the uncertainty\ninterval, which represents the uncertainty\
    \ and imprecision of\nmultisensor fusion system.\nThe concept of uncertainty interval\
    \ is similar to prob-\nability, but not entirely expressed as probability. The\
    \ inter-\nval makes the proposition possibly real; that is, it does\nnot directly\
    \ support or reject the proposition. That feature\ndemonstrates that DS evidence\
    \ theory needs weaker axiom\nthan probability theory and can represent the difference\n\
    between uncertainty and unknown of proposition [9]. Thus,\nDS evidence theory\
    \ is the generalization of probability theory\nand is an effective solution method\
    \ when the prior knowledge\nis absent.\n2.1.4. DS Combination Rule. DS evidence\
    \ theory provides a\nuseful evidence combination function. Suppose that there\n\
    are 2 independent and not completely conflict evidences that\nexist on the same\
    \ FoD in system; we can get a synthesis\nsupport degree for propositions by DS\
    \ combination rule. The\ncombination rule can be computed by the orthogonal sum\
    \ of\ntheir mass functions; that is,\n\U0001D45A (\U0001D434) = [\U0001D45A1 ⊕\
    \ \U0001D45A2] (\U0001D434)\n=\n1\n1 − \U0001D458\n∑\n\U0001D434\U0001D456∩\U0001D435\

    \ \U0001D458\nis the global conflict factor, which demonstrates the conflict\n\
    degree between \U0001D45A1 and \U0001D45A2:\n\U0001D458 = 1 −\n∑\n\U0001D434\U0001D456\

    \ of\nconformity. While \U0001D458 is close to 1, 2 evidences are totally\nconflict.\
    \ The denominator 1/(1−\U0001D458) is the normalization factor\nwhich ensures\
    \ that (3) are contented.\nThe equations and properties of DS combination rules\n\
    based on 2 evidences are exhibited here; readers can deduce\nthe equations and\
    \ properties of multiple evidences’ synthesis\nwith similar principle.\nObviously,\
    \ the DS combination rule satisfies both com-\nmutative law and associate law.\n\

    \ Relation Theory. Grey relation theory [34] is the\nquantity processing and ordering\
    \ procedure of systems with\nincomplete information or uncertain data. It can\
    \ be seen\nas a global analysis of system. Since appropriate reference\nis essential\
    \ to obtain reasonable sensor credibility result, a\ncertain sensor is used as\
    \ a comparative standard to determine\nthe credibility degree of multisensor [35].\n\
    2.2.1. Grey Relation Factor. Grey relation factor is the basis of\ngrey relation\
    \ analysis [32]. The space of Grey relation factors is\ndetermined by sequence\
    \ that has properties as comparability,\naccessibility, and extreme consistency.\n\
    Suppose that the sequences of system are \U0001D465\U0001D456 = [\U0001D465\U0001D456\

    \ = 0, 1, 2, . . . , \U0001D45A, where \U0001D4650 is the reference\nsequence\
    \ and \U0001D465\U0001D456, \U0001D456 = 1, 2, . . . , \U0001D45A, is the comparison\
    \ sequence.\n\U0001D6FE(\U0001D4650(\U0001D458), \U0001D465\U0001D456(\U0001D458\

    \ at the \U0001D458th point in grey relation factors’ space. Then we\ndefine the\

    LIU, YAGER, LI, TAN, HE, YAO, and MURPHY offer\nproposition A the largest support,\
    \ the numerical difference\nof support to propositions \U0001D434 and \U0001D435\
    \ is too tiny to facilitate\ndecision-making fusion. Thus, only the improved method\
    \ can\nget the proper fusion result.\nIn addition, sensor 3 is added in uncertain\
    \ data fusion\nto strengthen effectiveness validation of the new decision-\nmaking\
    \ method. Table 4 is the fusion result of 3 sensors.\nAs can be seen from Table\
    \ 2, sensor 3 is significantly\ndifferent from others which leads to high conflict,\
    \ and the\nsupport to proposition \U0001D434 is zero which leads to zero focal\n\
    element. In view of the particularity properties of sensor\n3, we can see in Table\
    \ 4 that one-vote veto phenomenon\nexists in YAGER, LI, TAN, CHEN, and HE. It\
    \ reveals that\nthe appearance of zero focal element directly deteriorates\nthe\
    \ fusion result. FLOREA still assigns a lot of support\nto Θ and increases the\
    \ uncertainty in fusion result. LIU,\nGUO, CHENG, YE, FLOREA, and MURPHY are unable\n\
    to reasonably handle zero focal element and utilize sensor’s\ncredibility. The\
    \ fusion results of them all give proposition\n\U0001D435 the excessive support\
    \ as the incorporation of sensor 3.\nThe proposed algorithm modifies the 3rd evidence\
    \ via taking\nsensor’s credibility into account as well as the overall situation\n\
    of all evidence’s discriminability, which reduces its influence\non fusion result.\
    \ Thus, in the fusion of 3 sensors, the proposed\nmethod is still the optimal\
    \ resolution for uncertain data\nfusion.\nFinally, in order to verify the priority\
    \ of the proposed\nmethod, evidence with relatively higher sensor credibility\
    \ is\nimported, and the data fusion is accomplished with 4 sensors.\nThe decision-making\
    \ processing is also completed, whose\nresult is displayed in Table 5. The threshold\
    \ values in decision-\nmaking rule are \U0001D7001 = 0.40 and \U0001D7002 = 0.15.\n\
    We can see from Table 5 that the occurrence of zero focal\nelement in sensor 3\
    \ seriously affects the data fusion. Even\nsensor 4 with large sensor’s credibility\
    \ supports proposition \U0001D434\nexplicitly, one-vote veto phenomenon still\
    \ exists in YAGER,\nLI, TAN, CHEN, and HE, and the decision fusions of LIU and\n\

    \ preset of threshold\nvalues in decision-making rule, GUO, CHENG, and YAO\nconsider\
    \ Θ as the decision result. Moreover, only YE and the\nproposed method generate\
    \ reasonable decision results as they\ntake proposition \U0001D434 as the final\
    \ decision. Compared with YE,\nthe proposed method assigns larger support to proposition\
    \ \U0001D434,\nwhich is beneficial to get the precise decision result. Thus, the\n\
    proposed method is more rational and reliable.\nThe data fusion of 4 sensors above\
    \ reflects that the\nproposed method makes the reliable and accurate decision\n\
    in comprehensive consideration of sensor’s credibility and\noverall evidence’s\
    \ discriminability. Besides, the decision result\nreveals that the proposed method\
    \ will not only give accurate\ndecision, but also avoid harmful effects caused\
    \ by sensors\nwith low credibility and zero focal elements.\n6. Conclusion\nAs\
    \ multisensor information fusion is broadly applied in many\ncivil and military\
    \ areas, the valid decision-making method for\nuncertain information fusion is\
    \ under great attention. This\npaper raises a neoteric decision-making algorithm\
    \ based on\ngrey relation and DS evidence theory to solve the uncertainty\ncaused\
    \ by inconsistence of sensors itself and complexity of\nmonitoring environment.\
    \ The new algorithm is carried out\nwith three innovative treatments: generation\
    \ of sensor’s cred-\nibility based on grey relation theory, focal element analyses\n\
    as overall weighted factor analysis and proportional factor\nanalysis, and evidences’\
    \ overall discriminability processing.\nSimulation results and analyses show that\
    \ the proposed\nalgorithm can make precise decision without worrying about\nsensors’\
    \ unreliability and evidence’s high conflict. Thus, it\nhas great application\
    \ significance and excellent engineering\nprospect.\nIn further study, the decision-making\
    \ method for uncer-\ntain data fusion should pay close attention to relieve the\
    \ huge\ncomputation burden for system as the increasing number of\n10\nJournal\
    \ of Sensors\nsensors and try to realize the on-time and on-line decision-\nmaking\
    \ system.\nCompeting Interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict\

    for smart city data fusion. • Review the smart city applications data fusion techniques
    for each domain. • List down current research trend within sub-domains in the
    smart city. • Discuss future challenges for implementing data fusion in the smart
    city. Abstract The advancement of various research sectors such as Internet of
    Things (IoT), Machine Learning, Data Mining, Big Data, and Communication Technology
    has shed some light in transforming an urban city integrating the aforementioned
    techniques to a commonly known term - Smart City. With the emergence of smart
    city, plethora of data sources have been made available for wide variety of applications.
    The common technique for handling multiple data sources is data fusion, where
    it improves data output quality or extracts knowledge from the raw data. In order
    to cater evergrowing highly complicated applications, studies in smart city have
    to utilize data from various sources and evaluate their performance based on multiple
    aspects. To this end, we introduce a multi-perspectives classification of the
    data fusion to evaluate the smart city applications. Moreover, we applied the
    proposed multi-perspectives classification to evaluate selected applications in
    each domain of the smart city. We conclude the paper by discussing potential future
    direction and challenges of data fusion integration. Previous article in issue

    of thingsMulti-perspectives classification 1. Introduction According to UN estimates
    [1], 68% of the world population would be living in cities by 2050. Hence, managing
    the existing resources and infrastructure to cater sustainable urban living conditions
    for the growing needs of the urban population has become ever more challenging.
    Fortunately, the advancement in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT),
    Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Data Mining, and Data Fusion is gradually
    paving path for the emergence of smart cities [2], [3], [4]. In this paper, we
    adopt the following definition of smart city [5]: “A city combining ICT and Web
    2.0 technology with other organizational, design and planning efforts to de-materialize
    and speed up bureaucratic processes and help to identify new, innovative solutions
    to city management complexity, in order to improve sustainability and livability”
    The integration of aforementioned technologies into various urban domains enables
    city managers to equip with the necessary information for better planning and
    resource management. Several cities around the world have already been leveraging
    these technologies to improve the comfort, security, mobility, health, and well-being
    of their citizens. To better evaluate rapid progress and to recognize the efforts
    of urban planners, smart city ranking systems have been established. For instance,
    IESE cities in motion index [6] has suggested 83 indicators to rank 165 cities
    over 80 countries. New York, London, and Paris are the top three smart cities
    in 2018. Smart city projects in New York [7] aim to consistently improve the quality
    of residents’ life, reduce the environmental impacts, increase the street light
    efficiency, and enhance the water quality. Meanwhile, the focus of Smart London
    Projects [8] is to collect city wide data to provide world class connectivity,
    security, and smarter streets to its residents. Digital transformation, sustainability,
    and urbanization for improving citizen services are at the cores of Paris Smart
    City Projects [9]. The following up of the top smart city list includes Singapore
    and Tokyo, which are some other notable smart cities in the world. In Singapore,
    Smart Nation Project [10] has been proposed, which includes e-payment systems,
    smart nation sensor platform, smart urban mobility, and smart community initiatives,
    with the aim to enhance the national digital identity of its citizens. On the
    other hand, Tokyo [11] aims to become the greenest city in Asia Pacific by improving
    the transportation and other sectors of their economy. Local governments in several
    Chinese cities [12], such as, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Beijing are also
    shaping up their cities to facilitate economic and social development to build
    high income smart cities. In addition, there are several research institutes and
    laboratories focusing on developing smart city applications, which are currently
    leading the worldwide effort in smart domains. These include MIT Senseable Lab
    [13], Future Cities Laboratory [14], SINTEF Smart Cities [15], SMART [16], etc.
    Nowadays, communication technology is the backbone for the smart city applications
    as it provides a channel for applications to transfer data effortlessly. The ongoing
    quest for novel, more efficient, low-latency, and cost-effective communication
    technologies and networks, such as, 5G [27], [28], [29], wireless sensor networks
    (WSN) [30], [31], [32], Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) [33], [34], and Narrow
    Band IoT (NB-IoT) [35], [36] and their integration in smart city projects is also
    relentless. These advancement has made many data sources available due to the
    potential of sensors collecting data with better coverage and power efficiency
    of the communication platform. With the large amounts of data becoming readily
    available in a smart city, data mining techniques [37], [38] are commonly used
    in the collected data. It helps in identifying the essential and important data
    sources in the smart city applications such as monitoring, control, resource management,
    anomaly detection, etc. With the availability of parallel data sources in various
    smart city domains, data fusion techniques that combine multiple data sources,
    lie at the heart of smart city platform integration. The major objectives of data
    fusion are to address problematic data while enhancing the data reliability and
    extracting knowledge from multiple data sources. The existing survey papers related
    to smart city applications or data fusion classification are summarized in Table
    1. Majority of these review papers [18], [39], [40], [41] strictly focus on one
    particular smart city domain or one genre of classification perspective. In [19],
    Alam et al. have conducted a review on data fusion technique based on mathematical
    model in IoT environment. Alternately in [20], Wang et al. have described the
    frameworks of data fusion within the smart city application. Interested readers
    can follow these references for additional technical details. However, there is
    only a handful of limited work to provide a multi-perspectives approach for data
    fusion problems in smart cities and this literature gap further motivates our
    study. Table 1. Literature review for data fusion on smart city. Surveys Objectives
    and topics covered Khaledgi et al. [17] Provides insights on the different types
    of data fusion techniques by exploring their concept, benefits, and challenges.
    Castanedo [18] Provides an overall view on the different data fusion techniques
    and methods. The author also reviewed common algorithms such as data association,
    state estimation, and decision fusion. Alam et al. [19] Provides a comprehensive
    survey on the mathematical model used in data fusion for specific IoT environments.
    Wang et al. [20] Proposes an IoT architecture concept to survey on the different
    sensor data fusion techniques and also provides an overall view on their evaluation
    framework. Zheng [21] Discusses about differences on fusing sources and varying
    techniques for cross domain data fusion. El et al. [22] Provides a survey on the
    intelligent transportation systems, which use data fusion techniques. Esmaeilian,
    B. et al. [23] Provides a throughout study on waste management for smart city
    aspects with three categories: (1) infrastructure for the collection of product
    lifecycle data, (2) new adapting business model, and (3) waste upstream separation
    techniques. Da Xu et al. [24] Provides an overall view on the current state of
    the industries for IoT and discusses key enabling technologies such as communication
    platforms, sensing technologies, and services. Chen et al. [25] Reviews the building
    occupancy estimation and detection techniques while providing a comparison between
    different sensor types for cost, detection and estimation accuracy, and privacy
    issues. Qin and Gu [26] Introduces the data fusion algorithms in IoT domains and
    data acquisition characteristics. Therefore, a different perspective to look at
    data fusion in smart city domains is necessitated by the expanding scale and scope
    of data sources, data collection techniques, and data processing system architectures.
    In order to cater evergrowing highly complicated applications, studies in smart
    city have to utilize data from various sources and evaluate their performance
    based on multiple aspects. To this end, we propose multiple generic perspectives
    with the ability to cover the entire depth and breadth of data fusion problems
    in smart city. These perspectives include data fusion objectives, data fusion
    techniques, data input and data output types, data sources, data fusion scales,
    and platform architectures for data processing. Utilizing proposed perspectives,
    we provide an overall view of classification techniques found in the seven domains
    of smart city applications such as: Smart Living, Smart Urban Area Management,
    Smart Environment, Smart Industry, Smart Economics, Smart Human Mobility, and
    Smart Infrastructure. A simple illustration of seven application domains discussed
    in this paper can be found in the Fig. 1. In each domain, we only select notable
    papers to demonstrate the universality and effectiveness of our multi-perspective
    approach on evaluating the data fusion techniques. Please note that we do not
    provide a comprehensive review of all the smart city applications. Afterwards,
    we talk about emerging data fusion trends in smart cities, while outlining the
    best practices for deploying a smart city application. In addition, data fusion
    challenges in different smart city applications are also identified and discussed.

    (each domain is enclosed in the dotted pink box). To summarize, our novel contributions
    in this paper are three-fold as shown below: • We propose a multi-perspectives
    classification to evaluate common data fusion techniques in smart city applications.
    • We provide an overview of smart city application domains and discuss the common
    trend of data fusion techniques in each domain utilizing proposed multi-perspectives
    classification. • We list down the future challenges and the ideal scenario for
    deploying data fusion techniques in a smart city application. Overall, we believe
    that with these contributions, the readers would have a quick grasp on the current
    data fusion trends in smart city research without extensively going through all
    the details. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we define
    the data fusion classification using multi-perspectives to evaluate a smart city
    application. This lays a foundation for evaluating the smart city applications
    leveraging data fusion techniques. In Section 3, different application domains
    of smart city based on data fusion techniques are evaluated using the proposed
    multi-perspectives classification of data fusion. In addition, a brief overall
    view of the current research trend of respective domain is presented. Subsequently
    in Section 4, we discuss the ideal data fusion scenario along with potential research
    directions/opportunities based on speculations of smart city applications from
    previous section. Lastly, we conclude our works in Section 5. 2. Data fusion classification
    using multi-perspectives In this section, we identify multiple generic perspectives
    with the ability to cover the entire depth and breadth of data fusion literature
    in smart city applications. We use smart city single perspective data fusion review
    papers [19], [26] and non-smart city data fusion classification papers [18], [39],
    [40], [41] as references. In non-smart city literature, there are four well-known
    data fusion classification techniques, which are Dasarathy’s Classification [39],
    Whyte’s Classification [40], Fusion Architecture’s Classification [18], and US
    Joint Directories of Laboratories (JDL) data fusion classification [41]. Dasarathy’s
    Classification is based on the data input and output types between data, where
    Whyte’s Classification focuses on the relationship between the data. JDL focuses
    on classifying the fusion process according to five processing levels. Meanwhile,
    the architecture-based classification only captures the system design level and
    does not consider data relationships and types. Most of the aforementioned classification
    of the data fusion techniques are not suitable for evaluating the applications
    of a smart city. Our proposed data fusion classification approach for smart city
    comprises of six different perspectives (also called categories): i) data fusion
    objectives (O), ii) data fusion techniques (T), iii) data input and output types
    (D), iv) data source types (S), v) system scales (L), and vi) platform architectures
    (P). Within each category, we further identify various sub-categories (also called
    classes). Overall, there are 30 different classes. The complete list of the adopted
    classification indicating all the categories and their classes is shown in Table
    2. Short reference codes (O, T, D, S, L, P) for each class are also included in
    the table for further use in the paper. For example, O1 refers to the data fusion
    objective category and problematic data fusion class. Similarly, S3 refers to
    data source types category and participatory class. Table 2. Data fusion classifications

    could be potentially more than one perspectives (other than data sources, fusion
    scales, and platform architecture) for smart city application depending on the
    complexity and fusion objective itself. Below, we provide further details of all
    the perspectives and classes adopted in this paper. 2.1. Data fusion objectives
    (O) The data fusion techniques deployed in a smart city project is influenced
    by the objective of applications. In this paper, we have summarized the four objectives
    as follows: • O1: Fixing Problematic Data ‘Problematic Data’ class refers to the
    case when the data source is having quality issues such as, inconsistency, imperfection,
    disparateness, etc. Data fusion could be used as an easy approach to overcome
    such problems. Examples of O1 can be found in [27], [42], [43], [44]. • O2: Improving
    Data Reliability Data may suffer from reliability issues when it is collected
    in a less ideal (less controlled) environment with high presence of noise. In
    such situation, additional data sources are required to add redundancy for increasing
    data quality to enhance data reliability. Such situations are identified as ‘Data
    Reliability’ class and [45], [46], [47], [48] exhibits such pattern. In addition,
    security enhancement through the data fusion also belongs to this category and
    examples of such objectives can be found in [49], [50], [51]. • O3: Extracting
    Higher Level Information Data mining advancement has contributed to many different
    architectures of data fusion in order to obtain knowledge from multiple data sources.
    For instance, the occupancy of a building can be detected using a combination
    of few ambient sensors with data fusion, where occupancy information cannot be
    directly inferred from the raw data sources. We classify these approaches as ‘Higher
    Level Information Extraction’ class and examples can be found in [52], [53], [54].
    • O4: Increasing Data Completeness In a situation of coverage limitations, an
    individual data source is insufficient to provide complete details of the desired
    output. Therefore, in ‘Data Completeness’ class, data fusion is performed across
    multiple data sources to obtain a complete picture of the overall system such
    as [55], [56], [57]. 2.2. Data fusion techniques (T) In this category, we present
    the data fusion techniques in two different information enrichment obtained after
    data fusion. The T1 until T3 are the common data fusion techniques and the further
    details can be found in [19], [39], where it describes the lower level information
    being fused to generate identical level of information. The techniques are associated
    with data mining [38], [58], where simple input data from multiple sources is
    fused to generate higher level information enrichment. Brief description of these
    classes is given below: • T1: Data Association Data association refers to data
    fusion technique that fuse data based on similarity between at least two or more
    data sources. Common techniques for data association include Nearest Neighbors
    [59], Probabilistic Data Association [60], and Multiple Hypothesis Test [61].
    • T2: State Estimation State estimation indicates the usage of multiple data sources
    to achieve higher sate estimation accuracy. Common techniques under this category
    are Maximum Likelihood [62], Kalman Filter [63], Particle Filter [64], and Covariance
    Consistency Model [65]. • T3: Decision Fusion Decision fusion is a technique that
    is used to fuse the decisions made by various sub-components of a system to achieve
    a certain overall objective. For instance, a robot can fuse different decisions
    from the modules to perform an actuation (direction, events, or actions). General
    techniques include Bayesian inference [66], Dempster–Shafer Inference [67], and
    semantic approaches [68]. • T4: Classification Classification technique denotes
    methodology of grouping objects into different classes based on their unique characteristics.
    In-depth details of generic classification techniques can be found in [38], [58].
    • T5: Prediction Prediction techniques are used to forecast output based on single
    or multiple different data sources. Note that, this covers simple methods such
    as regression and as well as complicated methods such as forecast modeling. Examples
    of such can be found in [69], [70], [71] • T6: Unsupervised Machine Learning Unsupervised
    machine learning tries to automate the knowledge discovery without relying on
    the data labels. Examples of such methods involves clustering [72], anomaly detection
    [73] and others [38]. Note that, semi-supervised machine learning approach [74]
    is also categorized under this class. • T7: Dimension Reduction Dimension reduction
    refers to the method of reducing data sources’ dimensions for features extraction
    or visualization purposes. Examples of dimension reduction techniques are Principal
    Component Analysis (PCA) [75], and others [38]. The aim is to preserve the characteristic
    of the data sources while reducing the complexity of processing high dimensional
    data. • T8: Statistical Inference and Analysis Statistical inference and analysis
    is used for outlining certain information along with some common knowledge / hypothesis
    from the input data sources. Examples of papers using such approaches can be found
    in [76], [77] • T9: Visualization Visualization is a technique used for the presentation
    of output to the end users via some platform. The end result often requires human
    intervention. Examples of such techniques can be referred to the following papers
    [78], [79], [80]. 2.3. Data input and output types (D) Dasarathy’s classification
    [39] is based on input and output of fusion technique to determine the relation
    between input and output data. There are five classes in data input and output
    perspective. Brief details are given below: • D1: Data In Data Out (DAI-DAO) Data
    In Data Out (DAI-DAO) refers to the situation when multiple raw data sources are
    fused to increase data reliability and the output after fusion is still a raw
    data. • D2: Data In Feature Out (DAI-FEO) Data In Feature Out (DAI-FEO) refers
    to the situation when multiple raw data sources are fused to extract some unique
    feature of the observed system. The output feature describes certain aspect of
    the system and it could be further used for more feature extraction or to make
    certain decisions. • D3: Feature In Feature Out (FEI-FEO) Feature In Feature Out
    (FEI-FEO) refers to the situation when multiple unique features from different
    sensors are combined to generate new features. This class is commonly known as
    feature fusion. • D4: Feature In Decision Out (FEI-DEO) Feature In Decision Out
    (FEI-DEO) refers to the situation when certain features of the system are fused
    to make certain decisions, e.g. actuation of various system components. • D5:
    Decision In Decision Out (DEI-DEO) Decision In Decision Out (DEI-DEO) refers to
    the situation when different decision sources (maintenance status, events, etc.)
    are combined to obtain a final output decision. 2.4. Data source types (S) There
    are four types of generic data sources in smart city applications and we categorize
    them based on the data sources regardless of the communication medium. Details
    of each category can be found as follows: • S1: Physical Data Sources The physical
    data sources are collected from sensors that are being deployed to capture information
    of a particular space, area, or even city wide. Examples of the physical sensors
    include temperature [81], air quality [82], camera [83], ultrasonic [84], LiDAR
    [85], and etc. Note that, we categorize smart city application based on the data
    sources rather than the method they are acquired. For instance, a temperature
    probe in a sensor nodes of a wireless sensor network (WSN) transmits data through
    gateway to cloud database is considered as physical data source, S1. • S2: Cyber
    Data Sources Cyber data sources denote datasets which are commonly obtained from
    the Internet domain such as social media information [76], [86], web access data
    [87], [88], and opinion based datasets [89]. Social media information involves
    major social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Weibo, and others.
    Note that, usually the data is acquired through data mining techniques. Meanwhile,
    the web access data can be obtained from web applications programming interface
    (API), such as transportation tickets information and online customer records.
    Apart from that, open datasets refer to data from third party vendors such as
    telecom operator or a company with readily available data. • S3: Participatory
    Data Sources Participatory data sources include crowdsensing [90], [91] and crowdsourcing
    [92], [93] data contributed by the personal devices, e.g. mobile phones, wearable
    devices, tablets, etc. of the users in smart city. Users provide the data voluntarily
    or through some incentive mechanisms. • S4: Hybrid Data Sources The hybrid data
    sources include data obtained from mixed data sources [94], [95], e.g. by combining
    the participatory and physical sensor data. As pointed in [21], hybrid data sources
    can achieve more insights as compared to single data sources. 2.5. Data fusion
    scales (L) The scale of data fusion is also an important classification perspective.
    Please note that data fusion scale is based on sensor coverage rather than sensor
    deployment. There are four different classes, which are described below: • L1:
    Sensor Level Fusion At the sensor scale, data from various physical sensors is
    fused to form an output such as [53], [96]. For instance, fusion of data collected
    by various smartphone sensors is an example of data fusion at sensor level. •
    L2: Building Wide Fusion At the building wide scale, data sources collected within
    a premise or building is fused to form an output. For instance, fusion of building
    energy and building security data to develop a building management system [97],
    [98], [99] is an example of data fusion at building level. • L3: Inter-Building
    Fusion In the inter-building scale, the data sources collected over several buildings
    are fused to form an output, where the scale of deployment normally includes small
    area. For example, data sources of several buildings within a university are used
    to generate a particular output is considered as inter-building scale. Other examples
    of this data fusion scale also can be found in [100], [101]. • L4: City Wide Fusion
    In the case of city wide fusion, data sources that involve whole city’s area as
    input for the data fusion architecture fall under this class such as [102], [103],
    [104]. For instance, the study of citizen behavior involves fusion of data gathered
    in different areas of the city is considered city wide data. • L5: Inter-City
    Fusion (or larger) At the inter-city fusion (or larger) scale, data from large
    areas involving one or more cities or terrains (mountains, sea, forests, etc.)
    is fused to form an output. Examples of this scale involve comparing one smart
    city to another city or data of a city outskirts and its surrounding areas. More
    examples of inter-city fusion (or larger) can be referred to [43], [105], [106].
    2.6. Platform architectures (P) The architecture of computational platform involved
    in data fusion is another important classification perspective. In this category,
    we identify four generic classes: • P1: Edge Computation Platform In edge computation
    platform, data sources are processed and fused at the edge (i.e. very close to
    the physical location, where data is actually collected). Edge computation devices
    include micro-controller, computing devices (Raspberry pi), computers, etc. Such
    architecture can be found in works such as [96], [99], [101]. With this architecture,
    communication overheads and latency can be significantly reduced. • P2: Fog Computation
    Platform In fog computation platform, data sources are processed and fused at
    the middle layer, i.e. between the edge and the cloud. In this architecture, data
    is periodically or continuously sampled at the edge (without processing) and is
    then forwarded to a gateway (that acts as a fog device). At the gateway, computing
    resources are provided for data processing. Both fog computing and edge computing
    platforms provide similar benefits of offloading computation as shown in [102],
    [107], [108]. However, fog computing architecture should be preferred when it
    is difficult to find stable power sources at the edge. • P3: Cloud Computation
    Platform In cloud computation platform, data sources are processed and fused in
    the cloud. This is the most common technique practiced by industry and research
    institutes for processing big data. Examples of this architecture being used are
    [56], [87], [109]. The advantages of cloud computing architecture includes ready
    access to the data and both online and offline for further processing or fusing.
    The disadvantages include increased communication overheads and costs. • P4: Hybrid
    Computation Platform In hybrid computation platform, processing is distributed
    among two or more layers (edge, fog and cloud) as shown in [105], [110], [111].
    In this architecture, depending on the available resources or application objectives,
    some low level data fusion and processing is done at the edge or fog, while high
    level information is extracted in the cloud. 3. Smart city applications overview
    Smart city applications tend to have extremely diverse requirements, which contribute
    to a large variety of different techniques and requirements as stated previously
    in Section 2 for different domains. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate the smart
    city applications from a more generic perspectives rather than one specific perspective.
    In this section, we select smart city applications with data fusion techniques
    from different domains listed in Fig. 1, and evaluate them based on multi-perspectives
    from the Section 2. Note that, there exist some literatures that are cross-disciplinary,
    which may involve more than one domain. In order to address the cross-disciplinary
    smart city applications, we have grouped them into their closest relevant domain.
    In each application domain, we outline sub-domains and present works related to
    data fusion techniques. Using the proposed data fusion classification based on
    multi-perspectives, we discuss the common data sources and fusion techniques,
    along with the current research trends in each domain. 3.1. Smart living Smart
    living concerns with the life of the urban citizens and revolves around the concept
    of improving live-ability in urban area. In the literature, the general objectives
    of utilizing the smart living domain involve data being used to extract higher
    level information or increasing the data completeness. In addition, smart city
    applications in this domain often leverage the cloud or hybrid platform architecture.
    In this domains, we have studied three different aspects of smart living, namely,
    (1) Smart Health, (2) Smart Home, and (3) Smart Community (Table 3). Table 3.

    is a crucial component in everyday life concerning medical and public practices
    using devices as defined by Lee and Co-authors [144], [145]. The rapid development
    of technology (e.g. smartphones and their in-built sensing devices such as heart
    rate sensors) provides more opportunities to adopt technology in healthcare applications
    pervasively. For telehealth application in smart city, Hossain et al. [112] have
    used electroencephalographic (EGG) signals and voice to monitor a specific user’s
    health with the support of cloud technology and doctor’s advices. In [113], work
    has shown to monitor elderly at home based on fuzzy fusion model using behavioral
    and acoustical environment data. Similarly, Noury [146] also monitors the activities
    and fall detection of elderly through fuzzy logic by fusing accelerometer, vibration,
    and orientation sensor. In [91], Marakkalage et al. have used crowd-sensing data
    from a smartphone application (location, noise, light, etc.) and introduced sensor
    fusion based environment classification (SFEC) to profile elderly people for understanding
    their daily lifestyle. In addition, Dawar and Kehtarnavaz [52] have implemented
    a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to combine both depth camera and wearable devices
    to detect the transition of movements to fall. Apart from that, Hondori et al.
    [111] have proposed using sensor fusion between depth images and inertia to perform
    tele-rehab in the home. The main challenge occurs in pervasive smart healthcare
    data fusion is discussed in [147] as the need of a higher accuracy to improve
    sensing robustness against uncertainty and unreliable integration. 3.1.2. Smart
    home The concept of Smart Homes plays an important role nowadays in contemporary
    urban areas. According to Jiang et al. [148], the definition of a smart home provides
    the capability of controlling, monitoring, and accessed appliances & services
    through implementation of ICT. There are currently many big players in developing
    the smart home appliances such as Amazon, Google, Apple, IBM, Intel, Microsoft,
    Xiaomi, and others. The challenge faced by manufacturers are related with service
    integration and formulating software ontology platform. These are necessary for
    implementing the services through different vendors and allow for a better integration.
    Meanwhile in [114], physical sensors (soil moisture) and cyber (weather, traffic)
    have been fused to control home appliances such as alarm clock and water sprinkle.
    The study of user daily activity is yet another important aspect to understand
    urban citizen well-being. In [45], Hong et al. have combined series of life activities
    to understand the lifestyle pattern depends on the equally weighted sum operation
    and Dempster-Shafer theory. Also, similar study on the user daily activity patterns
    can be found in [110]. Combination of house environmental sensor (infrared, door
    contact, temperature, hygrometry sensor, microphone) and wearable devices (kinematic
    sensors) using support vector machine (SVM) can be used to identify the user activity
    patterns. In addition, the modeling of human behavior in a smart home [149] in
    order to generate learning situation models have proven the efficiency of context-aware
    services. In addition, smart home security is yet another study field for many
    researchers [150], [151], [152] due to increased usage of IoT devices in normal
    household. The research challenges is to develop the applications for the smart
    houses while retaining the privacy and security of the end user. 3.1.3. Smart
    community According to Smart Communities Guidebook [153], a smart community is
    described as “a geographical area ranging in size from neighborhood to a multi-county
    region whose residents, organizations, and governing institutions are using information
    technology to transform their region in significant ways”. There is only a handful
    of cities focus on this aspect as majority are still in the stage of transforming
    from facility to community welfare. First world countries such as USA, Canada,
    Australia, European Union, and Singapore shown in [154] have started up initiatives
    to create smart communities. Information fusion for smart community video surveillance
    system is performed in [79] to aid neighborhood in terms of security. The combination
    of the different modal surveillance camera provides a vast amount of visual information
    extraction such as video summarization for highlighting certain events. A distance
    learning framework is proposed in [115], which enables personalized learning to
    cater what is best for each individual user. It uses data fusion to understand
    user environment and their activities by means of hybrid data sources. Real-time
    community monitoring also helps to prevent emergency situations and it ensures
    the safety of community citizens. A good example for a smart community application
    in large-scale is the Social Credit System in China [155]. It is a state-owned
    system to collect data from both public (traffic cameras, transit data etc.) and
    private (online shopping, fitness trackers etc.) data sources to monitor and analyze
    user behaviour to generate a single ”credit score” for each person, which helps
    in community well-being. The techniques fuse these data sources and remains a
    back box to the general public. However, the effect on user privacy with the rise
    of “data state” remains a debate for some [156]. A mature citizen should be on
    alert and always responds to any potential threat, while spreading the awareness
    to build a safer community in the urban city. 3.2. Smart urban area management
    Smart urban area management denotes the managing of urban area using ICT. Sub-domains
    in this regime composed of urban planning, governance, and smart buildings. For
    an application to fit into this definition, the minimum scale would be at the
    building level (e.g. a building management system). The main trend of data fusion
    techniques being applied in this domain mostly consists of objectives of extracting
    higher level information or increasing the data completeness. The end product
    of data fusion include visualization of information for respective authorities.
    3.2.1. Smart governance In smart governance, managing a city is considered as
    a complex task as the integration of different domains and services is proven
    to be challenging. Transparent services integration is an example of why many
    governance authorities are having difficulties to sort it out. It is hard to strike
    a balance in developing a transparent governance policy with consideration of
    sensitive information. Therefore, there is only limited study materials available
    to the best of our knowledge. Janssen and Estevez [118] have proposed a centralized
    platform for cutting down government staff by shifting existing organization to
    rely on integration of platforms. The disaster response management is also considered
    as another vital element for a smart city to carry out any potential counter measurements
    towards disaster as shown in [157]. Apart from that, urban reporting system [56]
    has collected report from the city wide region on the faulty infrastructure so
    that immediate actions can be taken to remedy the situation. It uses cloud technology
    and focuses on the display of fused data report, which it also describes the location
    and types of infrastructure. Example of research challenges is to remove any potential
    fake report to prevent misuse of the reporting platform. Another example of smart
    governance that involves city safety can be found in [158], where it can act as
    an emergency aid application (light pulse on emergency through mesh network) while
    providing energy efficient lighting to urban area. Moreover, there are cities
    also working on governance platform such as New York [7], Singapore [10], Tokyo
    [11], Oslo [159], and others. The potential research opportunity is to propose
    consensus protocols within the city for better integration of services. 3.2.2.
    Smart urban planning Urban planning plays an important role in developing the
    city economy by taking account of well-being of the urban residents. Traditionally
    in urban planning, aerial photography and statistical data sources (building size,
    population number, public amenities, etc.) are combined to understand the current
    development state of the city. The downside of such method is data sources frequently
    lacks of fine details, which resulting the output result is not representative.
    To address such issue, Cheng and Toutin [43] have combined various satellite and
    aerial images to generate details for the exiting urban structures. Alternately,
    low power sensors are capable to provide a larger coverage with lower deployment
    cost, which give researchers the opportunity to study different points of interest
    in the urban area. In [81], [95], [119], a bottom up urban planning method is
    implemented, where sensors are installed in a designated region to capture space
    utilization. From the collected data, urban planners can study public space utilization
    pattern using an integrated portal. Here, a hybrid processing method is proposed,
    where the data processing and fusion occur in different stages of data pipeline.
    In addition, a large variety of data sources can be used for urban planning such
    as physical sensors [160], photography [76], [161], or hybrid data sources [85].
    Despite wide variety of data sources, human interpretation is required when it
    comes to make decision on a proposed urban design. The need of full automated
    planning system would further benefit the urban planners to combine different
    data sources in order to achieve a more ideal city planning. 3.2.3. Smart building
    Urban building management provides building owner a platform to understand building’s
    energy consumption rate while automating building resources management. It has
    been extensively studied in [25], [162], [163], [164] and the current trend is
    to optimize the building resources such as hot water systems, electrical consumption,
    and heating ventilation & air conditioning (HVAC). In [94], Aftab et al. have
    combined four different parameters to predict building occupancy to control HVAC
    using low-cost embedded systems. Some other works such as [97], [165], [166] also
    have the same objectives but using different types of data sources. The potential
    solution for better building management system is to rely on fusing weather, human
    feedback, and electricity price to fine tune the building resources in order to
    maximize human comfort, while minimizing the energy consumption. Apart from that,
    fire alarm system is considered another important features of the smart building
    management system. Luo and Su [117] have fused three different data sources (flame,
    smoke, and temperature sensor) to detect any potential fire outbreak and reduce
    false alarms. In addition, a notification-based system is implemented to notify
    the property owner and manager in case of emergency. In future, potential building
    safety features may include a group of robots to deal with fire hazards and double
    duty as building security patrols. 3.3. Smart environment Smart environment studies
    the surrounding of a given area of interest, which covers the internal and external
    surrounding of a city. From the literature, we observed that majority of the data
    sources consist of physical and hybrid data sources, while the data scale often
    represent a large spatial coverage. Nowadays, the most common surrounding effects
    studied in the smart city include urban heat island (UHI), green house effect,
    and global warming. In addition, we have grouped urban waste management under
    this domain because it also has an environmental impact. 3.3.1. Landscape monitoring
    The main challenge of landscape monitoring in smart city is the sensing coverage
    of the data sources. To address such issue, two different sensing approaches have
    been used such as relying on mobile sensing or satellite-based data. Mobile sensing
    [106], [167] offers greater sensing capability by leveraging the mobility of moving
    objects (vehicles or humans). The mobile sensing technique provides a large spatial
    coverage, but it is not suitable for real-time applications unless there are multiple
    data sources to compensate the lack of spatial resolution concurrently. The output
    type of this mobile sensing includes combination of different spatial data in
    order to complete the data sources before proceed to data processing stage. Mobile
    sensing works such as [82], [168] utilized different data sources to complete
    spatial resolution and visualized the ambient changes across the city. The common
    characteristic of aforementioned works is feature extraction, which they visualize
    the processed features from the raw data sources. Majority of data input and output
    types in this domain are DAI-DAO and DAI-FEO since physical sensors are the common
    data sources. Using the satellite-based data sources, Shen et al. [46] have studied
    the UHI effect in a city using data sources collected over 26 years. The UHI index
    changes are measured through the combination of Landsat and MODIS images data.
    Mobile sensing offers a lower deployment cost, where it sacrifice the spatial
    resolution given there is limited number of sensors. Also, it has a lower coverage
    compared to satellite data sources. In contrast, satellite data has a wider coverage
    of spatial resolution but it frequently needs data enhancement and lacks of finer
    details. 3.3.2. Urban city modeling The surrounding natural resources of an urban
    city such as mountains and forests are considered as important assets of a city.
    The most common data sources in modeling the city area are satellite images, which
    as stated before, it requires data enhancement such as [169], [170] before using
    it. Therefore, prior work of data fusion [171] was focused on improving the satellite
    images quality. Only until recently, the emergence of machine learning algorithms
    and faster computers have created new ways to extract large variety of satellite
    image features. For instance in [120] and [121], forest types classification have
    been conducted in order to understand the variety of tree species in a specific
    region of interest. Both methods involve region-wide data sources and classification
    techniques, which are used to identify the tree species based on the forest types.
    With a lower deployment cost, small satellite (smallsat) and nano satellite (nanosat)
    could improve spatial coverage to generate a better data sources. Smart city applications
    leveraging satellite data will also beneficial from these deployment. 3.3.3. Waste
    management With astonishing rate of garbage being generated daily, waste management
    for an urban city can be rather challenging. Thus, it is essential to handle the
    waste efficiently to improve on sustainability of a city. An example of such effort
    could be found in [23], where they have proposed three new aspects of a smart
    waste management system such as: (1) infrastructure to overlook the overall life
    cycle of the product, (2) new business models revolving the product life cycle
    for preventing any waste generation, and (3) intelligent sensor networks for waste
    management facilities. In [102], Catania and Ventura have combined the proximity
    reading and weight sensor from garbage bin to estimate the garbage capacity of
    a typical household. Afterwards, rubbish categories collected from user mobile
    devices and garbage trucks are combined to keep track of residential participation
    in recycling scheme. On the other hand, waste water treatment helps to manage
    liquid waste of urban city before discharging to river or reuse. Chang et al.
    [122] have combined landsat and MODIS dataset in order to trace the water pollution
    level of a lake. On top of that, a web portal has been deployed to visualize and
    monitor the water pollution region over the time. Currently, many researchers
    are working together to develop an efficient waste management system since there
    is only limited resources available on earth. The goal is to adopt the 3R (Reduce,
    Reuse, and Recycle) concept with the help of ICT to improve city resource sustainability.
    3.4. Smart industry With the upcoming Industry 4.0 standards [172] touted as the
    gold standard of the future, various industries have been experiencing transformation
    with automation and data driven approaches. The majority of smart industry applications
    often leverage data collected from physical sensors while data fusion techniques
    are often performed at sensor or building level. Here, smart industry can be divided
    into three sub-domains, which are Smart Manufacturing, Smart Maintenance, and
    Smart Agriculture. 3.4.1. Smart manufacturing Smart manufacturing denotes the
    factory that depends on ICT to optimize the manufacturing process by increasing
    the production throughput. In [98], De Vin et al. have proposed a simulation tool
    to test out the management decision support by fusing undisclosed data entries
    and manufacturing process events. Similar to the aforementioned approach, decision
    based fusion can also be seen in [173], [174], which combines different machinery
    sensors data and data warehouse entries. The data fusion integration also considers
    supply chain demand in order to further optimize the manufacturing process. The
    challenge in this domain is to develop a self-optimizing manufacturing process
    while delivering the products to meet the demand of supply chain. Therefore, smart
    manufacturing frequently has a high correlation with the supply chain and attempts
    to deliver the market needs. In addition, the robotics usage in the smart manufacturing
    domain is nothing new. Guo et al. [51] have proposed an anomaly detection to combat
    potential security aspects in the robots using sensor fusion technique such as
    state estimation. 3.4.2. Smart maintenance The reliability and stability of the
    equipment and machinery is vital to all the industries to ensure smooth operation
    in production. Without the guarantee of smooth operation, any downtime can cost
    damages to reputation and also loses profit. Thus, preventive maintenance has
    been studied in [124], [125], [175], [176] and attempts to predict the remaining
    useful life (RUL) of a machine accurately. By accurately predicting the RUL, maintenance
    can be carried out on time to save cost only when needed. The common data fusion
    techniques for predicting RUL are neural network (NN) based model such as CNN
    and Deep NN (DNN). Please note that, common data source in this sub-domain is
    physical data source such as machine states, sensors readings, and related parameters.
    Nonetheless on the fault detection domain, machine fault detection can be found
    in [96], [123], where they describe the problem of fault diagnosis and apply data
    fusion techniques to overcome. State estimation and classification have been used
    to detect the current state of the machinery. The data sources share some similarity
    with the preventive maintenance, where lower level of data information is preferred.
    This yields a faster fault detection when compared to a complex data pipeline.
    The research challenge here is to develop a generic and a flexible maintenance
    system for different scale of applications adhering to the goal of accurate fault
    detection. 3.4.3. Smart agriculture In order to produce sustainable food resources
    in smart city, smart farming [177], [178] has become a trend to meet the food
    supply demand in a smart city. There are two different sub-domains in smart farming
    such as land and sea agriculture. In the land agriculture aspect, planting crops
    using controlled environment has shed some light in fulfilling the city needs
    of fresh supplies. However, plant disease remains a potential threat to a highly-dense
    plantation crop framing. In [127], Moshou et al. have classified the plant disease
    infection through Self Organizing Map (SOM) by fusing the spectral reflection
    and fluorescence imaging data. This helps to isolate infected crops while it focuses
    on the production of healthy plants. Apart from that, electromagnetic induction
    sensors, vegetarian index, water stress level, and radiance data are combined
    in [179] to better determine the partition of the crop field. Similar work also
    can be found in [128], where Khanum et al. propose an ontology-based fuzzy logic
    to classify plant disease. The research gaps in this domain involve improving
    live stock management as well as optimizing smart farm. On the other hand, sea
    agriculture is responsible for supplying the seafood supplies in a city. Obtaining
    fresh seafood supplies in an urban city sometimes can be rather difficult due
    to various factors such as delivery, city location, weather, seasonal pricing,
    etc. Therefore, a fresh seafood supply in a city is often not guaranteed. In order
    to address such issue, Huang et al. [126] have provided a solution by integrating
    two types of cameras for seafood freshness inspection. Camera and near infrared
    spectroscopy are fused through PCA and use NN to classify the freshness index.
    The research gaps in this domain involve developing large scale fish breeding
    and also wide varieties of seafood product such as calm, mussels, abalone, etc.
    A potential solution such as smart fish breeding with IoT has been proposed in
    [180], where it suggests using a moving pod to breed fishes while transporting
    them to destination in a particular destination simultaneously. 3.5. Smart economics
    Smart economics can be defined as the generic commercial activities in an urban
    city ranging from supply chain, logistic, finance center, to tourism. All these
    activities yield potential commercial value to a city, which it depends on the
    unilateral or bilateral trading relationship. In this subsection, we discuss smart
    economics in three major sub-domains, namely, (1) Smart Commerce, (2) Smart Supply
    Chain, and (3) Smart Tourism. 3.5.1. Smart commerce Today, modern e-commerce platforms
    use multi modal data sources to reach and better understand their customers. This
    helps e-commerce vendors to give better product recommendations for their customers
    and it helps customers to make their decisions easily. Fusing customer data such
    as mobility, credit card purchases, and social media interactions is commonly
    used in modern recommender systems. In [87], Breur introduced the fusion of customer
    behavior data and market research data to obtain a holistic picture of the customer.
    Investors can leverage financial data to make investment decisions, as Hassan
    et al. [181] have introduced a fusion model of Hidden Markov Model (HMM), NN,
    and Genetic Algorithm (GA) for stock market prediction. Improving the consumer
    awareness is conducted in [129], by fusing real world (weather, geographical)
    and cyber world (Twitter, Facebook) data. The proposed system has two levels of
    fusion, which relies on hierarchical-based processing architecture. The data combined
    bottom level input and fed it into upper level for further processing to achieve
    its objectives. 3.5.2. Smart supply chain In a smart supply chain, it often involves
    sources and destination tracking in order to understand the flow / processing
    of the objects. As discussed in [182], supply chain management and logistic are
    the fundamental of modern supplies on fulfilling the needs of an urban city. For
    instance in food supply chain, three tiers information fusion framework is proposed
    in [130] such as: (1) to accelerate data processing, (2) shelf life prediction,
    and (3) real-time supply chain planning. The proposed hierarchical information
    fusion architecture (HIFA) includes a process that is intelligently transforming
    the sensor’s data sources into usable decision-making information. Recently, combination
    of blockchain technology has paved a new way for revolutionizing the existing
    supply chain. In [107], Tian has shown the integration of blockchain and supply
    chain in the agri-food supply application. It aids consumers to trace the origin
    of food using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) along with database or WSN.
    The information also includes food origin to help consumers to identify the brand
    authenticity and avoids consuming counterfeit products. The research gap in this
    sub domain concerns with the implementation of smart supply and it needs the involvement
    from various commercial organizations. The consensus and national regulations
    are also parts of the critical factors of smart supply implementation. 3.5.3.
    Smart tourism The advancement of transportation technology has granted accessibility
    for the humans to move around the globe with ease. This phenomenon has caused
    rapid expansion of the tourism commercial values contributed to a city side income.
    Since then, Internet resources such as travel blogs and recommendation systems
    have influenced public to venture different locations. For instance, recommendation
    system [57] has been developed to recommend the place to travel based on user’s
    information such as socioeconomic (e.g. age, education, and income) and psychological
    and cognitive (experience, personality, involvement, and so forth) groups. User
    choices are used as feedback to further fine-tune the recommendation system using
    Rocchio’s method. Apart from that, Miah et al. [77] have combined social media-generated
    big data (geo-tagged photos of tourist attraction places) to predict tourist behavioral
    patterns. Alternately, Viswanath et al. [131] used a smartphone based mobile application
    to passively track tourist location data and obtain user ratings for tourist attraction
    places to better understand the preferences of tourists when they visit tourist
    attractions. The potential research development for smart travel is to focus on
    using a smartphone application for improving travel experience by relying on real-time
    translation and augmented reality (AR) navigation. 3.6. Smart human mobility Human
    mobility has been an important research area as commuting and traveling play big
    roles in modern life. With the help of advanced ICT, plentiful data sources related
    to human mobility have been collected and accessible to researchers, which yields
    deeper insights into the nature of human mobility as well as better improvement
    strategies for transportation systems. Smart human mobility, therefore, means
    collecting, managing, and analyzing (fusing) various data sources related to different
    aspects of residents’ movement in order to better understand and improve the way
    people move. Depending on the purpose of different applications, smart human mobility
    domain can be further divided into three sub-domains:(1) Smart Location-Based
    Services, (2) Human Mobility Understanding, and (3) Smart Transportation Systems.
    3.6.1. Smart location-based services This sub-domain aims to get the accurate
    position of individuals and further to provide services, such as route planning
    and navigation, to help them travel efficiently and comfortably, in both outdoor
    and indoor environments. For outdoor positioning, Global Positioning System (GPS)
    has been the most accurate, reliable and dominant technology since it was allowed
    for civilian use in 1980s [183], [184]. Less-accurate non-GPS positioning approaches,
    such as wifi-based localization and cell-tower triangulation, are sometimes used
    instead of (or together with) GPS, because they consume less energy [132], [133].
    For indoor positioning, since GPS does not work well indoors, other positioning
    approaches have been proposed. The data collection technologies used for these
    approaches mainly include Wi-Fi (WLAN), inertial measurement unit (IMU), RFID
    tags, Bluetooth, global system for mobile communications (GSM), frequency modulation
    (FM), and ultra-wide band (UWB) [185], [186]. Meanwhile, multiple data sources
    are often fused to achieve more accurate localization results [134], [135]. Once
    accurate locations are obtained, either indoors or outdoors, location-based services
    (e.g. route planning and navigation) can be provided to end users by fusing the
    location sequences with other information sources such as geographic information
    system (GIS) data, real-time traffic data, and user preference data [136], [137],
    [187], [188], [189], [190]. Since the outdoor positioning and location-based services
    have been well developed and commercialized, the current research trend in this
    field is mainly focused on improving the performance (accuracy, deployment cost,
    and energy cost) of indoor systems and services. 3.6.2. Human mobility understanding
    Positioning systems not only enable the location-based services for individuals
    but also provide data sources for further monitoring and understanding human mobility
    in a larger and more comprehensive scale. By aggregating and analyzing (fusing)
    the location data of residents along with GIS data of the environment, various
    aspects of human mobility can be monitored and the hidden patterns can be obtained.
    As summarized in [100], the most common subjects of monitoring and understanding
    human mobility include distance and duration distributions [191], origin-destination
    matrices [103], individual activity-based mobility patterns [192], transportation
    mode identification [54], and densities and flows within a building (or a cluster
    of buildings) [138], [193]. Results obtained from these subjects provide clues
    for improving transportation system [194], urban planning [195], and communication
    network [196]. Typical studies in this sub-domain usually fuse one data source
    of people’s movement trajectories with the environment information, such as GIS
    data of the city or floor plan of a building. Although this type of approach has
    produced much deeper insights compared with traditional approach relied on survey
    data, there is a trend to fuse multiple data sources related to people’s movement
    and obtain a more comprehensive picture of human mobility [197], [198]. Moreover,
    social media data sources. such as Tweets, also bring in more information regarding
    the mobility status in cities due to the combination of spatio-temporal data and
    descriptive text [86], [199]. 3.6.3. Smart transportation systems Another large
    part of smart mobility is the improvement of transportation systems, which mainly
    comes from three aspects: relieving traffic congestion, improving public transportation,
    and introducing new transport systems. To relieve traffic congestion, effective
    light control plays an important role. While existing light control systems are
    usually based on hand-crafted rules and do not adjust to the rapid dynamics of
    traffic flows, intelligent light control approaches have been proposed using different
    data sources, data fusion techniques, and decision making (optimization and control)
    algorithms [109], [200]. Challenges in this aspect mainly come from the implementation
    of such intelligent light control approaches. Improvement of the public transportation
    system is mainly conducted through the network and schedule optimization [201].
    Although these two topics have been thoroughly discussed in the literature, new
    insights related to the public transit system (e.g. origin-destination matrices
    and service level obtained from big data) [139], [202] and more advanced transport
    modeling tools enabled by big data [203] have brought new opportunities. Even
    if the existing transportation manner has been optimized, there are still problems
    that cannot be solved, such as last mile issue and driving accidents. Therefore,
    new transport systems, such as bike sharing systems and autonomous vehicle systems,
    are introduced. Advanced ICT and data fusion techniques are the core of the realization
    of these systems. For a bike sharing system, data fusion and analysis helps to
    understand how the system works and evaluate different operational strategies
    [204], [205]. As for the autonomous vehicle system, the control of an autonomous
    vehicle itself is a complex data fusion process, fusing various data sources about
    the vehicle and the road by advanced machine learning and control algorithms [140],
    [206]. Security plays an important role in the autonomous vehicles deployment
    to ensure reliability of the autonomous driving. Examples of such techniques can
    be found in [50], [207]. 3.7. Smart infrastructure In a smart city, infrastructure
    aims to provide convenience for the public by supplying resources (electricity,
    gas, and water) or providing services (public facility or communication systems).
    Here, we outline four different sub-domains for discussion, which are (1) Smart
    Grid, (2) Smart Energy, (3) Smart Facility, and (4) Smart Communication. 3.7.1.
    Smart grid The electrical grid provides an intermediate platform for relaying
    the electricity from the power plant to residential and industrial area. The common
    goal in this sub-domain is to provide reliable and stable electricity supply with
    the integration of ICT, which is commonly known as smart grid. Smart grid has
    been extensively studied in [55], [208], [209], [210] and the goal is to address
    on load and demand balancing of electricity in a particular area, building, or
    even household. Common technique applied in this sub-domain is forecasting, and
    example of such application can be found in [55], which it combines the information
    received from residential meters and predicts the electricity consumption load.
    Wang et al. [88] have proposed a different approach, where the concept of multi
    agent systems (MAS) is used to predict building energy consumption by denoting
    each meter as an agent. The common goal is to use a higher information extraction
    technique such as prediction, where it allows grid operators to forecast the grid
    demand to ensure sufficient electricity load. Test bed currently is the common
    method for testing out the smart grid use case and has been studied in [211].
    Another common research topic is security and reliability of the smart grid system.
    Li et al. [49] have proposed a secure state estimation, which it can be used to
    address single sensor or multi-sensor scenarios. Similar works addressing smart
    grid security also can be found in [212], [213]. On the other hand, advanced metering
    infrastructure (AMI) has been studied along with the smart grid to ensure the
    electrical metering is tamper-proof while able to accurately measure energy consumption.
    For instance, work in [214] uses the clustering algorithm to identify energy theft
    accurately while reducing potential false positives. Meanwhile, work in [105]
    has presented a real-time price estimation by fusing local power and global power
    consumption to understand real-time electric load of the grid. In future, prosumers
    (producer and consumer) will emerge in the smart grid market and sole distributor
    paradigm will be no longer valid. This scenario greatly increase the difficulty
    of the energy demand and load when accounting the energy as a live market 3.7.2.
    Smart energy The search for clean energy resources has been an ongoing effort
    for many researchers in order to cut down the dependency on the fossil fuels.
    Therefore, the clean energy research direction mostly focuses on renewable energy,
    which propose to go for a green and less carbon footprint energy producing approach.
    Nowadays, the most common renewable energy sources emerged in the market are solar
    farm [101], [141] and wind power [215], [216]. Solar energy is generated based
    on the conversion of the sunlight into electricity, but the energy harvesting
    technique suffers from limited energy harvesting time. Thus, solar irradiance
    prediction is crucial to ensure maximum energy throughput in the solar farm within
    the limited time. Huang et al. [141] have proposed to use data driven algorithms
    such as ABB, SVM, BRT, and Lasso, in which the information from neighboring solar
    plants are combined to accurately predict the solar irradiance. Meanwhile in [217],
    Jung and Broadwater have implemented a statistical model to fuse wind speed, direction,
    temperature from forecast station and online measurement to determine the total
    power output of the wind farm. Most of the aforementioned methods focus on improving
    efficiency of the existing energy harvesting methodology. Future research on the
    clean energy relies on various data and energy sources in order to construct a
    high efficiency energy harvesting model. 3.7.3. Smart facility Smart facility
    denotes access of physical facility that provides services to the public such
    as parking facility, water supply, etc. The most vital facility in a smart city
    would be water treatment center as clean water is an important necessity for the
    urban citizens. Any potential leakage or downtime of water supply in a city would
    be proven troublesome. Mounce et al. [104] propose a water leakage detection using
    classification technique, which combines all the district water meter data. Similar
    concept can be applied on other resources such as gas pipe leakage detection or
    electricity theft in smart grid. In the public facility, the wear and tear of
    structures can be a major issue due to the frequent rate of public usage. Hence
    in [99], Park et al. have combined multi-metric sensors to estimate the bridge
    displacement. Through this, a rough estimation of the structural health can be
    determined. Alternately, Khoa et al. [218] have proposed a tensor decomposition
    approach using the facility data sources in order to understand the facility usage
    details. In addition, the emergence of data centers providing various functionalities
    to the smart city applications such as [219], [220], [221] also one of the focuses
    for the ongoing efforts of smart city. There is also a few domains that is highly
    correlated with smart facility such as Smart Maintenance and Governance [56],
    where integration of a web portal is used to report potential damages. 3.7.4.
    Smart communication Communication in an urban city remains an essential infrastructure
    for various application platforms to communicate with each other. Not all communication
    platforms and standards are designed equally as each of them serve different purposes.
    Therefore, different standards and protocols to meet varying requirements have
    been established. Currently, the upcoming 5G technology [28], [222] has promised
    to bring integration of 5G interface with support for older generation spectrum
    such as LTE and Wi-Fi in order to provide seamless user experience. The common
    data source in 5G standards is raw signal, and that is the reason why data fusion
    only happens at the edge level. For example, Huang et al. [27] and Rappaport et
    al. [222] have fused raw signals that are divided through multiple antenna during
    transmission. The receivers will receive multiple signal sources and reconstruct
    the original information being transferred. Further discussion of the energy efficient
    trade-off in wireless communication technology can be found in [223], [224]. In
    the IoT domain, wireless sensor network (WSN) is considered a common communication
    platform because of its wide coverage and low power consumption. WSN is built
    on top of nodes’ network, which is smaller than a wireless ad hoc network. Hence,
    multiple nodes can be combined for encoding and decoding the packets received.
    Kreibich and Co-authors Kreibich et al. [47] and Luo et al. [48] have proposed
    approaches to improve communication between WSN focusing on the communication
    mechanism between nodes. The main objective is to focus on the reliability of
    communication channel while maintaining the coverage (from relay to sink nodes)
    and also low power consumption. The research significance of communication is
    undoubtedly a necessity in smart city as it benefits all domains leveraging communication
    technology. The main goal is to design efficient and reliable communication protocols
    to meet different requirements of applications. Alternately, low power communication
    is yet another goal for IoT in order to achieve long sensing operation. 4. Challenges
    and open research directions After outlining the applications of the smart city
    that use data fusion, we discuss the potential aspects to improve the data fusion
    in the smart city applications observed from previous section. These aspects include
    potential categories or perspectives that are not discussed in Sections 2 and
    3. As shown in Fig. 2, we identify four major research directions, which are (1)
    data quality, (2) data representation, (3) data privacy and security, and (4)
    data fusion technique. Download : Download high-res image (137KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Open Research Directions for Data Fusion in Smart City
    Applications. 4.1. Data quality Quality of the data sources directly determine
    the quality of output results since processing module follows the “garbage in
    and garbage out” theorem in fusing data sources. Thus, we discuss two aspects
    to improve the data sources in the smart city applications, which are sensing
    coverage and sensing longevity. 4.1.1. Sensing coverage Sensing coverage is one
    of the important factors to determine the quality of data sources. Insufficient
    data coverage will generate a result that is not representative, and often it
    implies more sensors need to be installed to increase the sensing coverage. This
    indirectly affects the deployment cost since more physical hardware is required
    to compensate the sensing coverage. Apart from that, it also affects the design
    of communication architecture because more physical sensors are required to transmit
    data, and thus potentially congests the communication platform. These factors
    are common obstacles for a large-scale deployment in smart city applications and
    getting worse when increasing the deployment scale. There are two commonly used
    approaches to address the aforementioned issues, which are crowdsensing and mobile
    sensing platform. As shown in [225], crowdsensing is one of the most cost-efficient
    method as personal mobile devices such as smartphones. Smartphones offer wide
    variety of sensors such as vibration, magnetic field, IMU, GPS, and others. The
    problems with crowdsensing are related to user privacy intrusion and high battery
    consumption when actively collecting data. User privacy is a challenge in collecting
    data as regulations in many countries have been facilitated to prevent applications
    to collect any sensitive information. This issue will be further discussed in
    user privacy and security sub-section. Another problems with crowdsensing are
    the unavailability of geolocations information or random distribution of geographical
    located data. These scenarios lead to inconsistent data quality. Potential way
    to resolve this limitation is to collect data at a fixed time and location only
    when needed, where incentive is provided for valid participants. Also, the trade-off
    problem of the mobile sensing can be further found in [226]. Through this method,
    only qualified data will be included as data sources, while invalid information
    will be automatically filtered. Using similar concept as crowdsensing, mobile
    sensing has offered the same data sensing approach but only follows designated
    route to collect data. The idea is to leverage the mobility of the transportation
    (normally public transports, cabs, and garbage trucks) to conduct data collection,
    where the vehicles are traveling across the city. Example of mobile sensing platform
    can be found in [106], where garbage trucks on duty will collect the ambient data
    across different parts of the city weekly. An identical concept can also be implemented
    with the public transport systems, since majority of them follow fixed schedules.
    The challenge with the mobile sensing is that spatial resolution of the data may
    not have a finer detail when compared to crowdsensing due to fixed data collection
    schedule. The main cause is due to the limited accessibility of the vehicles in
    certain areas (pedestrian path and residential area). Potential workaround of
    this limitation would be combining the mobile sensing and crowdsensing data sources
    to generate data that covers large area within the urban city. Services integration
    also plays an important role in supplying platforms alternate data sources to
    perform data enrichment. By simulating the different IoT services in smart city
    as shown in [227], potential limitation or bottlenecks of smart services can be
    avoided in order to design a better smart city application. 4.1.2. Data sensing
    longevity Long term data collection offers different aspects of knowledge discovery
    as data is able to cover more detail in a larger temporal resolution. The advancement
    of miniaturization has greatly reduced the power consumption of the sensors and
    IoT devices while maintaining the same sensing performance. As a result, combining
    both energy harvesting techniques and low energy devices are able to create a
    long self-sustaining sensing approach. This breakthrough allows physical sensors
    to run independently without the need of external power sources. In order to preserve
    the longevity of physical sensors’ sensing capability, energy harvesting is one
    of the common approach in large area networks. It allows sensors to draw energy
    from solar energy, vibration, or temperature difference. The most widely available
    energy harvesting technique is solar panels and it can be easily obtained. Solar
    panel is affected by the presence of solar irradiance, where the energy harvested
    varies throughout the different time of the day. Contrast to solar farm, the goal
    here is to conserve as much energy, while maintaining the sensing capability of
    the physical sensors. The most notable influence would be the energy management
    architecture as well as the battery capacity and the solar panel efficiency. Apart
    from that, although temperature difference and sensor vibration are capable of
    harvesting energy but it is limited to certain use case and not suitable for general
    usage. Alternately, potential replacement of the traditional energy harvesting
    technique is wireless power transfer. As shown in [228], [229], this method offers
    power to be transferred wirelessly without battery and energy harvesting module.
    Currently, there are different types of wireless power transfer technologies such
    as inductive coupling, capacitive coupling, magnetodynamics coupling, microwaves,
    and light-waves. Each of them has their limitation such as inductive coupling
    only has limited range of transferring energy. That being said, this technology
    is still relatively new, and it requires further investigation in order to guarantee
    its minimum working efficiency for smart city applications. Other than using external
    power sources, low power sensing for carrying out the sensing tasks. In order
    to drive different smart city applications, various standards have been proposed
    for LPWAN, such as LoRaWAN by LoRa Alliance and NB-IoT Release 13 by 3GPP. LoRaWAN
    focuses on the long range IoT connectivity for industrial applications while the
    NB-IoT focuses on the indoor coverage, low cost, long battery life, and stable
    communication in high density communication channel. The main reason to use low
    power sensing approach is due to the high compatibility with large scale deployment
    relying on the low bit rate communication channel usage. However, standardization
    of these protocols remains a challenge in LPWAN due to the possibly of using unlicensed
    spectrum, where organizations may choose not to follow the agreed spectrum. In
    future, low power communication will ensure the long term sensing capability of
    physical sensors in the smart city applications and therefore will improve data
    sources quality. 4.2. Data representation A high speed Internet connection provides
    easy access to many genres of data sources and creates opportunity to study wide
    variety of different data sources. However, large variety of data sources frequently
    indicate the incompatibility of data formats. The problem becomes more obvious
    when there is no standardization on the data format. To tackle such problem, data
    ontology is the building block to represent the data sources to connect different
    sources of data for seamless services integration. If the format of the data source
    cannot be interpreted, it will be marked as useless for the platform integrator.
    Therefore, semantic web has been proposed as an extension to WWW web services
    utilizing Resource Description Framework (RDF) to provide standard data exchange
    formats. It opens the path to create different solutions for the IoT applications
    and it supports the Open Government Data (OGD) principles [230]. To date, there
    are few common ontology languages have been developed such as Delivery Context
    (DCN) [231], Web Ontology Language (OWL) [232], Resource Description Framework
    Schema (RDFS) [233], Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) [234], and others. Majority
    of the ontology languages only focus on one application domain because they are
    not suitable for representing the metadata from other domains. This causes data
    segmentation in the smart city applications, where further increases the gap between
    different smart city domains. Thus, DBpedia [235] is designed to address the aforementioned
    issue using public and private stocks of semantic web. DBpedia has provided solutions
    for the ontology software as it offers different classes and types that are available
    on the Wikipedia. That being said, not all applications adopt the idea of DBpedia
    and there is a fraction of applications remain conservative using proprietary
    data representation. Apart from that, Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)
    [236] v3.1 protocol has been introduced as one of the protocols to address ontology
    problems between brokers. It offers machine to machine (M2M) communication by
    providing lightweight publish and subscribe messaging services, where network
    bandwidth limitation is one of the main constraint. It is possible to combine
    the aforementioned technologies in order to generate a better data integration
    for data fusion purposes across different domains. Therefore, the future agenda
    for the ontology language is to encourage integration of different levels of data
    sources using different system architecture such as edge, fog, and cloud computing.
    4.3. Privacy and security 4.3.1. Privacy Collecting urban residents’ data in a
    smart city application can be challenging due the nature of sensitive data that
    can be misused if poorly managed. As privacy issue has been discussed extensively
    by the authors in [116], [237], [238], misuse of private information may lead
    to catastrophic events such as information theft, or identity fraud. Currently
    in Europe, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as discussed in [239], [240]
    has been proposed to better address the data privacy concern of the Internet.
    In other countries, there are also similar efforts to enforce data privacy protection
    such as Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act
    (PIPEDA), China’s China Data Protection Regulations (CDPR), Singapore’s Personal
    Data Protection Act (PDPA), Japan’s Personal Information Protection Commission
    (PIPC), etc. Meanwhile in USA, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA),
    and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACTA) have been introduced
    to improve with the information flow efficiency across agencies. This is also
    a part of the efforts to prevent sensitive information being available for unauthorized
    parties. Majority of the policies and regulations emphasize on the users’ consent
    for collecting personal data and this can be problematic as not all platforms
    provide ample security for data storage. With insufficient security measurements,
    the data collected may be compromised, which may lead to tainted reputation and
    loss of public faith. For instance, Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal [241]
    has shown potential misuse of user data collected. With that in mind, potential
    right of accessing data sources could be revoked if the data source is not handled
    properly by the right person. Hence, privacy and security should be the responsibility
    for both platforms and users. A thorough review has been conducted in [242], which
    works on the IoT requirements to address privacy issues. Potential solution for
    the aforementioned problem is to use hybrid data fusion technique in a smart city
    application. The idea here is to locally fuse the sensitive information (user
    identity, phone number, bank account number) into generic information, before
    uploading to the cloud for further processing. The benefits of such approach are
    two-folds, which are the ability to offload computational cost and to preserve
    sensitive information at the physical sensor only. In addition, we can leverage
    machine learning approaches such as [243], [244] to generate synthetic datasets
    with identical data characteristic for study purpose. This eliminates the chances
    of private data been leaked out and encourage the openness of datasets to be studied
    by different researchers and data scientists. To draw a clear line between generic
    and sensitive data remains a debate among researchers. In future, the data fusion
    can be applied at the lower level to remove any potential sensitive data. 4.3.2.
    Security According to Kitchin [245], there are two general security concerns in
    the smart city applications, which are security of technology/infrastructure (data
    center, services, and system architecture) and data security (data generation,
    storage, and communication). The security of the technology and infrastructure
    highly relies on the design architecture of the system being deployed. Depending
    on the application requirements, it varies from traditional client server architecture
    to decentralized architecture. The main objective is to deploy a hack-proof/exploit-less
    system architecture. Alternately, there are also ways of improving security of
    system architecture such as incentive/bounty for reporting flaws, simulating injection
    attacks, security assessment from third party, etc. Nowadays, the security enhancement
    focuses towards continuous effort as the technology has been changing rapidly.
    For instance, different security strategies [246], [247], [248] try to enhance
    security of the smart city application''s architecture by focusing on the common
    security standards/practices/protocols. This shows that as the number of smart
    city applications increase rapidly, system architectures implemented with the
    security design in mind become apparent with good practices and standard architecture
    design. Subsequently, regular security assessment and auditing also pave way for
    a safer smart city applications deployment. Meanwhile, data security also contributes
    to the significant part of smart city applications ecosystem from generation,
    storage, and communication. The common method to combat such issue is leveraging
    encryption techniques, where it encodes the data so that only the authorized parties
    have access to it. For instance in [249], Wang et al. have introduced an attribute
    based encryption scheme, which it allows fine-grained access control, scalable
    key management, and flexible data distribution. In addition, encryption also can
    be used in the communication platform between IoT devices in smart city application
    as shown in [250], [251] to prevent information hijacking. Despite constant effort
    of cyber security researchers developing new security schemes, the numbers of
    data breaches and cyber threats increase every year according to David et al.
    [252]. The main culprit of such occurrence is due to negligence of data security
    practices/implementation. Security often appears to be an afterthought in deployment
    of a smart city application. Thus, in order to combat such threat, the smart city
    application should comply with security standards as shown in [253] to mitigate
    the chances of becoming a victim. 4.4. Data fusion techniques Extracting knowledge
    from a smart city application frequently involves data mining techniques in order
    to fuse different data sources. Lower tier data fusion techniques have been well
    explored in [39] and the current research trend focuses more on the machine learning
    approach. The main reason why machine learning approach has gained so much attention
    is due to its capability of handling high dimensional data. The problem of high
    dimensional data is also known as curse of dimensionality as described by Bellman
    [254]. In this context, we discuss two research trends on applying machine learning
    techniques in data fusion as follows: 4.4.1. Explainable deep neural network Lately,
    supervised machine learning techniques focus on the DNN, where the in-depth reviews
    of the recent development can be found in [255], [256], [257]. Major research
    efforts aim to increase the explainability of the model such as NN, CNN, and DNN
    rather than using them as black box models. To this end, explainable AI (XAI)
    [258] is the new motivation for data scientists to explore the interpretable learning
    paradigm of the modeling in order to provide a semantic meaning behind modeling
    logic. This new learning process has driven three big fields in the deep learning
    domains, which are (1) Deep Explanation, (2) Interpretable Model, and (3) Model
    Induction. To develop a deep explanation on the model interpretation, the cognitive
    layers will act as an intermediate layer between learning and explanation layer
    in order to cast the learned abstractions, policies, and clusters information
    into an explainable format. Subsequently, the interpretable model such as Bayesian
    learning [259] can be built to explain the uncertainties required when developing
    the deep learning models to learn the choices of a learning process. Alternate
    approach has proposed to use subspace approximation with an adjusted bias technique
    [260] to build interpretable CNN, which uses feed forward design to better explain
    the model’s choice in allocating certain hyper-parameters. Meanwhile, model induction
    refers to the technique used for inferring the model’s decision and learning progress.
    Through a thorough understanding of the model, parameters can be fine-tuned to
    increase the learning optimization rate in a long-term application deployment.
    Hence, the search of XAI is an important milestone for the data scientists, which
    can be used to explain the learning process and the decision machine learning
    made. An example of potential use case would be trying to understand the reason
    behind (also known as reasoning in some literatures) the predictive maintenance
    decision machine learning rather than performing maintenance due to the result
    of predictive algorithm. 4.4.2. Unsupervised data fusion In the smart city applications,
    collecting the ground truth could be proven challenging due to the uncertainties
    and errors in the collected data sources. Hence, obtaining labels or data annotation
    are another problems with certain data sources. Despite the rapid development
    of advanced modeling tools like DNN, it still requires labels and data annotation
    in order to achieve objectives of extracting higher information. There are a few
    approaches that address the lack of labels such as manual annotation, crowd labeling,
    software annotation, and pattern labeling. However, manual annotation only works
    well with a small dataset while other approaches do not guarantee the correctness
    of end result. This shows a big research gap to seek a better way to label data
    sources accurately. Research works such as Zhou et al. [261], [262] have attempted
    to fix unlabeled data by transforming them into useful features to achieve certain
    objectives. Traditionally, raw data is required to be preprocessed into something
    meaningful, but it still suffers from the need of data cleansing and amputation.
    The simplest method would be to solely depend on the filtering technique. However,
    aggressive filtering may remove large amount of raw data resulting potential loss
    of knowledge. Another simple solution is to increase the number of reliable data
    sources to be fused to create potential annotation. Increasing data sources often
    indicates an increment of the overall deployment cost. Alternative solution to
    the increased deployment cost is to use transfer learning [263], where the knowledge
    from existing domain can be transferred to other domain to learn from it. 4.4.3.
    Emergence of hybrid model The emergence of the hybrid models has become common
    due to wide variety of data sources available. It allows different levels of data
    sources (high, low, or both) to combine in order to create potential insights
    in a particular domain. It also helps to solve the data privacy problem along
    with machine learning technique, which has opened up many opportunities for researchers
    and data scientist to study on these big data collected. One example of the hybrid
    model is shown as follows: an urban planning system has different data sources
    as input such as human comfort factor index (environmental ambient sensors), positive
    urban city factor (feedback data on urban area such as greenery, surrounding amenities,
    recreational parks, and others), and cyber data (social media input) to design
    a fully automated urban planning system by fulfilling predefined criteria. The
    result from the data fusion needs to be explainable as discussed in the previous
    XAI for understanding choices made by the automation software. In this example,
    different tiers of data sources are fused using data sources types (D1, D2) and
    the result is some features. Eventually, these features will be combined to generate
    a potential plan for city through computation modeling (D3, D4). By joining different
    data sources, simulation can be used concurrently to verify the performance of
    urban planning system before deploying to the city. In future, implementation
    of the hybrid model will become a general trend due to wide availability of the
    data sources and processing platforms. As mentioned in the discussion, data ontology
    is another key factor to allow data sources to be connected from different platforms
    to provide knowledge for the smart city applications. 5. Conclusion This paper
    presents an overall view of the data fusion techniques found in the smart city
    applications. Easy accessibility of the data sources has paved way for data fusion
    in different smart city applications in various forms. The increasing trends of
    data fusion in the smart city applications create the need for a new evaluation
    method. Therefore, we propose a multi-perspectives classification for the smart
    city applications that involve data fusion techniques. The data fusion classification
    based on multi-perspectives introduced in this paper are: (1) Fusion Objectives,
    (2) Fusion Techniques, (3) Data Input and Output Types, (4) Data Source Types,
    (5) Data Fusion Scales, and (6) System Architecture. Using the proposed multi-perspectives,
    we evaluated some selected works in the smart city applications and we also discussed
    the research trend for each domain respectively. Next, we also discuss four open
    research directions of data fusion in a smart city application such as data quality,
    data representation, data privacy & security, and data fusion technique. Overall,
    we are certain that generic nature of the multi-perspectives classification is
    able to perform well with various smart city applications for different domains
    that leverage the data fusion techniques. In addition, an in-depth analysis can
    be further extended onto individual domain to study the common requirements and
    techniques applied, which we do not include in this paper due to limited paper
    length. A successful smart city application is built on top of the data (also
    known as data-driven architecture) and data fusion has provided a wide variety
    of techniques to improve the input data for an application. Therefore, data fusion
    has opened the path for various applications to gain insights about the city.
    This also holds the key for a smart city to further understand and improve the
    domains that it is lacking. Acknowledgement The research work was supported in

  explanation: 'The article titled "Application of data fusion techniques and technologies
    for wearable health monitoring" by Rachel King et al. provides a comprehensive
    review of data fusion techniques and algorithms that can be applied to data from
    wearable sensors, with a focus on health monitoring applications. The paper discusses
    the importance of data quality and preprocessing, feature selection, and inference
    algorithms, and presents several examples of data fusion techniques that have
    been used in the context of wearable health monitoring.


    The specific point of focus in the section of the paper covered in your prompt
    is adaptive data preprocessing methods for dealing with varying data quality and
    formats from heterogeneous data sources, such as data normalization, feature scaling,
    and data fusion techniques (e.g., Dempster-Shafer theory, Bayesian inference)
    to account for missing or corrupted data and to enhance the accuracy of the output.


    The paper explains that in order to achieve the most reliable and accurate results
    from data fusion and analysis, data from different sources should be preprocessed
    using appropriate methods. This includes normalizing the data to a common scale,
    scaling the features to a consistent range, and using data fusion techniques to
    handle missing or corrupted data.


    The paper then discusses several adaptive data preprocessing methods that can
    be used for this purpose. These methods are able to automatically adjust to changing
    data conditions, which can be particularly important in the context of wearable
    health monitoring, where data quality and availability can vary significantly.


    One of the adaptive data preprocessing methods discussed in the paper is Dempster-Shafer
    theory. This theory provides a framework for reasoning with uncertain and incomplete
    information, and is particularly useful for handling missing or corrupted data.
    Dempster-Shafer theory has been used in a number of applications, including sensor
    fusion, data fusion, and expert systems.


    Another adaptive data preprocessing method discussed in the paper is Bayesian
    inference. Bayesian inference is a statistical method that allows for the incorporation
    of prior knowledge into the data analysis process. Bayesian inference has been
    used in a number of applications, including data fusion, machine learning, and
    computer vision.


    By using adaptive data preprocessing methods, it is possible to improve the quality
    and reliability of data from wearable sensors, which can lead to more accurate
    and reliable results from data fusion and analysis.'

    • This paper emphasises the growth of interest in wearable technologies that are
    leading to a paradigm shift in personalised healthcare through continuous monitoring
    using body worn sensors. • Data fusion techniques are discussed that provide the
    means to combine data from wearable sensors to infer our activities, at varying
    levels of detail. • This paper studies the attributes of commercial devices in
    light of a continuously changing landscape. • The key challenges that still need
    to be addressed are discussed so as to advance the understanding of what is needed
    to create truly pervasive and invisible wearable health sensing systems. Abstract
    Technological advances in sensors and communications have enabled discrete integration
    into everyday objects, both in the home and about the person. Information gathered
    by monitoring physiological, behavioural, and social aspects of our lives, can
    be used to achieve a positive impact on quality of life, health, and well-being.
    Wearable sensors are at the cusp of becoming truly pervasive, and could be woven
    into the clothes and accessories that we wear such that they become ubiquitous
    and transparent. To interpret the complex multidimensional information provided
    by these sensors, data fusion techniques are employed to provide a meaningful
    representation of the sensor outputs. This paper is intended to provide a short
    overview of data fusion techniques and algorithms that can be used to interpret
    wearable sensor data in the context of health monitoring applications. The application
    of these techniques are then described in the context of healthcare including
    activity and ambulatory monitoring, gait analysis, fall detection, and biometric
    monitoring. A snap-shot of current commercially available sensors is also provided,
    focusing on their sensing capability, and a commentary on the gaps that need to
    be bridged to bring research to market. Previous article in issue Next article

    Many countries, including the United Kingdom, have an ageing population, with
    an increase in the average age and proportion of older people [1]. In 2010, there
    were approximately 10 million people over the age of 65 in the United Kingdom,
    with this number projected to rise by over 50% by 2020 [2]. One consequence of
    the ageing population is an increase in life expectancy implying greater healthcare
    needs. However, the relationship between age and dependency is complicated and
    not determined by age alone. Indeed, the risk factor profile of those born more
    recently is worse than previous generations [3]. This can be attributed, in part,
    to the link between economic development and increased risky behaviours [4]. Risk
    factors such as tobacco and alcohol use, inactivity, and poor diet choices are
    associated with chronic diseases including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and
    diabetes [4]. Recent advances in wearable technology including microelectromechanical
    (MEM) devices, physiological sensors, low-power wireless communications, and energy
    harvesting, have set the stage for a significant change in health monitoring.
    Technology can be discreetly worn and used as a means to monitor health and potentially
    enable older adults to live safely and independently at home. Early detection
    of key health risk factors enables more effective interventions to reduce the
    impact of, or even avoid, serious or chronic illness. Inertial measurement devices,
    such as accelerometers, represent a range of sensors that can be used for healthcare
    monitoring and are being extensively investigated for the monitoring of human
    movement [5] and daily activity [6]. Another application for wearable systems
    is rehabilitation [7]. There are also currently many systems commercially available
    for the monitoring of sports and some aspects of health. The richness of data
    available using wearable sensors presents challenges in the way that it is processed
    to provide accurate and relevant outputs. To fully exploit this data for the purposes
    of healthcare monitoring, data fusion techniques can be employed to make inferences
    and improve the accuracy of the output. Hall and Llinas [8] provide a detailed
    introduction and discussion to multisensor data fusion. A review of data fusion
    techniques is also provided by Castanedo [9] including the different categories
    of data fusion techniques. With a focus on body sensor networks, Fortino et al.
    [10] discuss wearable multisensor fusion with an emphasis on collaborative computing.
    This paper introduces wearable sensors for human monitoring in the context of
    health and well-being, including a snap shot of current commercial wearable sensor
    systems. An overview of data fusion techniques and algorithms is offered, including
    data fusion architecture, feature selection, and inference algorithms. These are
    put into the context of wearable technology for healthcare applications including
    activity recognition, falls detection, gait and ambulation, biomechanical modelling,
    and physiological sensing. Related challenges of data fusion for healthcare are
    presented and discussed. 2. Wearable sensors Wearable sensors can be considered
    in three categories: motion, biometric, and environmental sensors. Sensors used
    to capture human motions include inertial sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes,
    and magnetometers. By combining a tri-axial accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer,
    inertial measurement units can be made for 9 degree of freedom tracking and are
    used for biomechanical modelling. Common biometric sensors are used to measure
    heart rate, muscle activation, respiration, oximetry, blood pressure, galvanic
    skin response, heat flux, perspiration, and hydration level. Electrocardiogram
    (ECG) and electromyography (EMG) detect the electrical activity produced by the
    heart and muscles respectively and are interpreted into heart rate and muscle
    activation. For a wearable monitoring system to be practical it needs to meet
    several key criteria: to be non-invasive, intuitive to use, reliable, and provide
    relevant feedback to the wearer. The number of devices, location, and attachment
    method would be considered during design, and are usually application specific.
    Wearable sensor systems also have to take the target users’ needs, such as dexterity
    or cognitive ability, into account. Devices can be either attached directly to
    the skin using some form of adhesive, mechanically using a clip, strap or belt,
    or incorporated directly into clothing or shoes. Advanced fabrication techniques
    can now create ‘flexible/stretchable electronics’ for integrated circuits, electronics
    and sensors [11]. Such systems can be applied directly to the skin enabling discrete
    sensing possibilities e.g. devices developed by MC10 Inc. [12]. It is essential
    the system is reliable and measures with acceptable accuracy, providing the user
    with relevant feedback. In the research literature this is often presented as
    the accuracy of identifying specific events or health aspects, or in terms of
    selectivity and specificity, the proportion of the data that is positively identified
    correctly and the proportion of the data that is negatively identified correctly,
    respectively. The past decade has seen major advances in sensing technologies,
    including MEMs and physiological sensors. Wireless low power communications, such
    as BLE, enable sensing technology to be integrated into wearable devices, clothing,
    and in the future embedded about the person without the restrictions of wires
    or the need to download data. Low power sensing and communications also enable
    wearable energy harvesting to be a viable option for powering and recharging these
    systems. Commercially, wearable sensor systems are available for human monitoring
    and some of their output features are tabulated in Table 2. Much of the software
    developed for commercial devices is proprietary; however, some systems are able
    to provide raw data, or have been explicitly designed for the purposes of research.
    Table 3 describes wearable devices that are commercially available for activity,
    physiological, and biomechanical monitoring, including both consumer and research
    devices. The table presented gives a snapshot overview of commercial wearable
    devices as this is a wide and rapidly changing landscape, with the features monitored
    and the sensors used for daily monitoring, including a few examples for specific
    applications. Devices that only provide step count have not been included. A large
    proportion of these sensors target the health and fitness industry, and track
    the amount and intensity of activity performed including measures such as an estimate
    of energy expenditure and calories burned. For purposes of research however, a
    much broader range of outputs are being investigated and will be described in
    greater detail, including the techniques used to achieve them, in Section 5. Table

    not featured; * optional. 2.1. Sensor placement The placement of wearable sensors
    for health monitoring is motivated by three main driving forces: (1) what data
    is required or provided by the sensors; (2) where it is considered acceptable
    to wear the sensors; and (3) the number of sensors the user is willing to wear.
    For commercial systems the most common place to wear a sensor is on the wrist
    or arm although many systems can be worn at multiple locations, such as on the
    chest using a clip or as a pendent, and the thigh and ankle (Table 3). The waist
    and wrist are intuitive and unobtrusive places to wear sensors as many people
    are already accustomed to wearing watches or belts. In a study conducted by van
    Hess et al. [13] to investigate the estimation of daily energy expenditure using
    a wrist-worn accelerometer, the acceptability of wearing the device on the hip
    or wrist was also examined. It was found that both sensor placements were rated
    as highly acceptable, however, men on average preferred wearing the sensor on
    the wrist. Systems with more niche applications need to be worn at more specific
    locations relevant to the information being acquired, e.g. the Reebok Checklight
    with MC10 helmet [14] that determines the number and severity of impacts to the
    head while participating in sports. Sensor placement for activity recognition
    has been investigated in several studies. Atallah et al. [15] investigated the
    most relevant features and sensor locations for discriminating activity levels,
    demonstrating the dependence of sensor location on the activities being monitored.
    Liu et al. [16] investigated different combinations of sensors and locations for
    physical activity assessment. The “best” results, i.e. the ones giving the highest
    activity recognition accuracy, were obtained using all the sensors, followed by
    a combination of the wrist and waist worn sensors. Patel et al. [17] also investigated
    the different combinations of sensors for monitoring patients with chronic obstructive
    pulmonary disease (COPD) and again found the “best” results were obtained using
    all the sensors (in this case 10 accelerometers distributed about the body). The
    “best” single sensor location was found to be on the left or right thigh. Pärkkä
    et al. [18] conducted a study to determine which sensors are most information
    rich for activity classification and included both motion and physiological sensors.
    Accelerometers were found to be most informative for activity monitoring, however
    the position of the sensors (on the wrists) did not enable the separation of sitting
    and standing. Interestingly, physiological sensors did not prove as useful for
    activity monitoring due to the delay in physiological reactions to activity changes,
    whereas accelerometers react immediately. Sensor orientation can also effect classification
    accuracy. Thiemjarus et al. [19] compared the performance of the k-NN (k-nearest
    neighbour) classifier using accelerometry data of activities with the sensor orientated
    in different directions. By transforming the signal to eliminate the orientation
    of the sensor an overall accuracy of 91% was achieved. 3. Data fusion This section
    discusses data fusion models and the different levels of data fusion. A description
    of the possible types of features that can be extracted to characterise the data
    and techniques to select them are also described. 3.1. Data fusion models A useful
    data fusion model is The Joint Directors of Laboratory model described by Hall
    and Llinas [8] that was developed to improve communications among military researchers
    and system developers. Work by Luo and Kay [20] define a hierarchical model consisting
    of four levels of abstraction at which fusion can take place; signal level fusion,
    pixel level fusion (for image data), feature level fusion, and symbol level fusion.
    Dasarathy [21] expanded on the hierarchical data fusion models by defining five
    fusion processes characterised by each processes input-output mode, e.g. data
    in - feature out fusion. For the application of healthcare many models have been
    suggested. Lee et al. [22] proposed a hierarchical model for the application of
    pervasive healthcare to minimise the probability of unacceptable error. Fortino
    et al. [10] described a framework for collaborative body sensor networks, C-SPINE.
    Gong et al. [23] proposed a multi preference-driven data fusion model and demonstrated
    its application for a wireless sensor network healthcare monitoring system. Fig.
    1 describes a generic centralised hierarchical data fusion architecture for a
    wearable health monitoring systems, drawing on three of the data fusion levels
    of abstraction (signal, feature, and decision) and elements from the previously
    described models. Data is sampled from the sensors (at a frequency appropriate
    to the sensor type and application) and transferred to the fusion centre which
    may reside on a smart phone or a gateway. An obvious way to do this is by using
    wireless radio communications, such as Low Energy Bluetooth (BLE) or Zigbee. Alignment
    and cleaning of the data takes place at the pre-processing stage to take into
    account differences in sampling rates, timing offsets, and lost or corrupt data.
    Filtering would also take place at this stage. Data can then be processed at the
    appropriate level of fusion. Additionally, some sensors may operate by being activated
    by an event trigger which may be the result of the systems output. Potentially,
    in the case of a suspected fall detected using body worn accelerometry, a camera
    could be activated to gain additional context of the event. Download : Download

    architecture for wearable health monitoring systems incorporating concepts from
    [8] and [20]. To interpret the sensor data three main hierarchical levels at which
    data fusion takes place are commonly used: signal level data fusion (sometimes
    referred to as direct or raw data fusion), feature level fusion, and decision
    (symbolic or inference) level fusion [8]. Signal level fusion can be applied to
    combine commensurate data i.e. data measuring the same property, directly. For
    example, to deduce kinematic parameters for biomechanical modelling, the Kalman
    filter (KF) can be used to estimate the state. For data that is non-commensurate,
    fusion takes place at the feature level [8]. Features are extracted from the sensor
    data and used to form a feature vector that, after fusion, will result in a higher
    level representation of the data. If appropriate, output from the signal level
    fusion can be used as part of the feature vector. There are a wide range of parametric
    and non-parametric algorithms that can be used to classify the data into higher
    levels of abstraction, which will be described in further detail in Section 4.
    Decision level fusion is performed at the highest level of abstraction from sensor
    data and can be based on raw data, features extracted from the raw data, and symbols
    defined at the feature level fusion to make higher level deductions. Probabilistic
    methods are commonly used at the decision level due to the high levels of uncertainty;
    however other methods that are also tolerant of uncertainty can also be used including
    artificial intelligence, fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms. 3.2. Feature extraction
    and selection To combine data for the classification or detection of an activity
    or event characteristics, or features, are extracted from the sensor data as input
    for the data fusion algorithm. The features represent the information in the original
    signal and are usually calculated over fixed time windows that can range from
    0.5 to 10 s long. Using a fixed window, an overlap in the data can be applied,
    with the effect of smoothing the output. Typically, a 1 s window is sufficient,
    with a 50% overlap with the previous window, however this is application dependent
    and a longer or shorter window maybe more appropriate. Features can be summarised
    into two main domains: time and frequency, however some features incorporate both
    temporal and frequency elements, such as wavelets [24]. A summary of some of these
    features can be found in Table 4. Table 4. Example features that can be extracted
    from sensor data. Domain Type Feature Time Signal characteristics Absolute value
    Range Maximum/minimum Zero crossings Derivative Integral Jerk Root mean square

    characteristics Mean Median Variance Standard deviation Skew Kurtosis Interquartile
    range Percentiles Pearson coefficients Cumulative histograms Cross correlation
    Entropy Frequency Fourier coefficients Energy Power Wavelet features Power spectral
    density Feature selection describes the process by which features are chosen.
    This is sometimes based on empirical observation, however, search strategies can
    provide an objective means to select appropriate features. Search strategies fall
    broadly under two types; filter based, where the properties of the data are examined
    without knowledge of the inference algorithms to be used; and wrapper based that
    use the performance of the target learning algorithm to inform the set of features
    [25]. An introduction to feature selection has been provided by Guyon and Elisseeff
    [26]. For wearable sensor applications, selecting the most appropriate features
    can make a great difference to the quality of the inference. Atallah et al. [15]
    compared feature sets for activity recognition compiled using several filter based
    feature selection algorithms including Relief and Simba, that aim to maximise
    the margins between decision boundaries, and minimum redundancy maximum relevance.
    A common problem for multi-sensory systems is high dimensionality feature space
    which leads to increased computational costs and higher demands on memory. Algorithms
    such as independent component analysis and principal component analysis [24] can
    be used to reduce the dimensionality of feature space. Deep learning, offers an
    alternative approach building features at multiple levels of a deep network. While
    deep learning has often been applied to static data, Längkvist et al. [27] provided
    a review of deep learning for time-series data. Plötz et al. [28] compared different
    types of features used to represent human activity data including: statistical
    metrics, fast Fourier transform coefficients, principal component analysis based
    features, and those derived using deep learning methods. A standard nearest neighbour
    classifier, which will be described later, was used to demonstrate the effectiveness
    of the features. For systems reliant on wireless communications, including body
    worn systems, power consumption also requires consideration i.e. the trade-off
    between transmitting raw data to the fusion centre vs. extracting features for
    transmission on the sensing device. 4. Data fusion algorithm overview In the following
    sections an overview of the different types of data fusion algorithms are presented
    and examples given from the research literature. For feature level data fusion,
    non-parametric algorithms (that do not make assumptions regarding the distribution
    of the data) and parametric algorithms are presented. At the decision level, algorithms
    including Bayesian approaches, fuzzy logic, and topic models will be described.
    4.1. Signal level algorithms • Weighted averages - is a simple signal level fusion
    method for combining commensurate information by taking an average of all the
    sensor readings [20]. The contribution of the “worst” sensor’s error will be alleviated
    in the final estimate, although not eliminate it completely. To reduce the impact
    of large erroneous sensor readings weighted averages can be used [24]. For example,
    the weighted average of physiological temperature measurements could be taken
    from an array of body worn thermistors to find a single best estimate. • The Kalman
    filter (KF) - is a popular statistical state estimation method that can be used
    to fuse dynamic signal level data. The state estimates of the system are determined
    based on a recursively applied prediction and update algorithm and assumes the
    state of a system at the current time is based on the state of the system at the
    previous time interval. One of the main advantages of the KF is that it is computationally
    efficient [29]. The KF is often used to fuse accelerometer and gyroscope information
    to provide better estimates, an example of which is the use of the KF to detect
    postural sway during quiet standing (standing in one spot with out performing
    any other activity or leaning on anything) [30] . For non-linear filtering the
    extended KF or unscented KF can be used. • Particle filtering (PF) - Particle
    filtering is a stochastic method to estimate moments of a target probability density,
    when they can’t be computed analytically. The principle is to generate random
    numbers called particles, from an “importance” distribution that can be easily
    sampled. Then, each particle is associated a weight that corrects the dissimilarity
    between the target and the importance probabilities. In the Bayesian context,
    particle filters are often used to estimate the mean of the posterior density.
    They have the benefit of estimating the full target distribution without any assumption,
    which makes them particularly useful for nonlinear /non-Gaussian systems. Djurić
    et al. [31] and Arulampalam [32] both provided a tutorial of PF theory. The PF
    can be used for biomechanical state estimation based on accelerometer and gyroscope
    data. 4.2. Feature level non-parametric algorithms • k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN)
    - One of the simplest classification algorithms, k-NN measures the distance between
    the unlabelled observations and the training samples to infer which class they
    belong to. The unlabelled observation is assigned the label of its nearest neighbours
    where k is the number of training observations to be taken into account. Distance
    measures include the Euclidean and Manhattan distance. Use of k-NN has been widely
    used and reported in the literature for activity classification applications [15],
    [16], [19], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. Bicocchi et al. [37], in particular,
    compared k-NN to several other instance based learning algorithms using a real-life
    activity set and achieved a precision of about 75% with k equal to 1. • Decision
    Trees (DT) - DT or rule-based algorithms are a popular method used for classification.
    Rules are defined in the form of a “tree”, starting at the root that is split
    into decision nodes which refine the class prediction with each level of decision
    nodes. Leaf nodes represent the predicated class of the unknown data [5]. DT can
    be constructed manually by empirically defining rules; however, algorithms are
    available to automatically generate trees based on the data such as ID3 and C4.5.
    Other DT algorithms include CART, random tree, random forest, and J48. Examples
    of the use of DT for activity recognition include [17], [18], [34], [35], [38],
    [39], [40], [41]. • Support Vector Machines (SVM) - SVM have been extensively
    used for human activity classification [16], [17], [36], [39], [42], [43] and
    can be used for both linear and non-linear classification problems. SVM is a binary
    classifier finding separation between two classes. The data is mapped into a high
    dimensional space using a kernel function (such as a Gaussian, sigmoid, or radial
    basis function). A hyperplane is then found that maximises the decision boundary
    between the examples of the classes [44]. In a comparative study by Liu et al
    [16] to determine the best sensor configuration to recognise activities, SVM performed
    better than the k-NN and Naive Bayes classifiers with an accuracy of 76% using
    a single hip worn accelerometer, to 88% using a hip and wrist worn accelerometer
    and a ventilation sensor that measures features associated with breathing. • Artificial
    Neural Network (ANN) and Deep Learning - An ANN is a biologically inspired computational
    model to describe functions consisting of a network of simple computing elements,
    or nodes [45]. An ANN structure is composed of several layers of nodes connected
    by weighted links. Inputs into the ANN are propagated forward through the layers
    to compute the output of the network, as follows: for each node, the sum of the
    weights multiplied by the input value of all inputs is found. The output for this
    node is then calculated by the activation function, such as the sigmoid function.
    To train the network, the internal connective weights are adjusted using techniques
    such as back propagation which minimises the error between the network’s output
    and the target output [45]. ANN have been applied to the problem of classifying
    human activity recognition; some examples include [18], [36], [46], [47]. Pärkkä
    et al. [18], Roy et al. [46], and Altun et al. [36] conducted studies to compare
    the performance of ANN to other algorithms. Yang et al. [47] implemented an activity
    recognition strategy based on two phase neural classification. During the first
    phase, activities are classified as either static or dynamic activities, then
    during the second phase more detailed activity recognition is performed. Recently,
    success with deep learning methods, based on neural networks, have attracted interest
    from many domains including image classification and natural language processing
    [48]. As mentioned previously, deep learning can be used to learn features for
    activity recognition [28], and as well as perform classification. 4.3. Feature
    level parametric algorithms • Gaussian mixture model (GMM) – GMM can be used as
    a parametric classifier by modelling the probability distribution of continuous
    measurements or features. A GMM consists of a weighted sum of Gaussian distributions
    that can be trained with example data using algorithms such as expectation-maximisation
    (EM) [38], [49]. A GMM is trained for each class, then the new data examples are
    classified by determining the GMM that provides the highest likelihood of producing
    the data. Allen et al. [38] used GMM to distinguish postures and movements for
    the monitoring of older patients based on accelerometer data, comparing it to
    the performance of a heuristic DT system. Wang et al. [49] classified five gait
    patterns using GMM. • k-Means – k-means is an unsupervised iterative distance-based
    clustering algorithm. It aims to classify data based on the distance of a data
    point to the mean centroid of each cluster. The classifier is trained by defining
    k centroids, one for each cluster. These can be defined randomly or by defining
    the initial centroid based on all the training data and subsequent centroids using
    the data points furthest away from the initial centre [24]. An iterative process
    is then used to minimise the distance of the centroids from the data points. Each
    data point is assigned to the nearest centroid, after which the centroid is recalculated
    based on the clusters that are formed. This process is repeated until the criteria
    to stop have been met. After this process, data for classification is assigned
    to the closest centroid. Ghassemzadeh et al. [33] used k-means clustering to define
    motion primitives which, in combination, form transcripts that can be used for
    activity recognition. Machado et al. [50] applied k-means clustering to the problem
    of activity recognition using accelerometry successfully predicting activities
    with an accuracy of 89% for the user independent case. 4.4. Decision level algorithms
    • Bayesian inference - Approaches, based on Bayes theorem, relate the posterior
    probability, i.e. the probability of the hypothesis occurring given the observations
    (or features), the prior probability of the hypothesis, and the likelihood, i.e.
    the probability of the observations given the hypothesis. Bayesian methods enable
    the inclusion of prior probabilities that can take into account known information
    and can be updated based on the observations. The Naive Bayes classifier is a
    popular method for inferring activity from sensor data. Despite the assumption
    of independence between features, which is often considered poor, it can perform
    well. Atallah et al. [51] used Bayesian classification for activity recognition
    from an ear worn accelerometer based device. One drawback of Bayesian inference
    is the requirement that competing hypotheses are mutually exclusive, however,
    this is not generally compatible with the way humans assign belief [24]. Dempster–Shafer
    theory, also known as belief function theory or evidential reasoning, provides
    a framework for reasoning with uncertainty by extending the Bayesian approach
    [24]. • Fuzzy logic - or fuzzy set theory, is a fusion technique that can be applied
    at the decision level and have been used for the recognition of human activities
    using both wearable and ambient sensors [52], [53]. Fuzzy logic describes input
    data in terms of possibility, i.e. the possibility the input data describes some
    property [24]. Medjahed et al. [53] describe three main steps for the application
    of fuzzy logic. First, fuzzification takes place converting the data into fuzzy
    sets. Secondly, a fuzzy inference system is applied which consists of fuzzy rules
    that take the IF/THEN form and fuzzy set operators including the union, complement
    and intersection [24]. Finally, defuzzification is applied to convert fuzzy variables
    generated by the process into real values. • Topic models - are an unsupervised
    machine learning algorithm originally designed for aiding understanding of large
    corpuses of text. They allow hidden thematic patterns in a dataset to be discovered
    using latent Dirichlet allocation. Huynh et al. [54] showed that Topic Models
    could be used to discover routine behaviours (e.g. lunch) from other activities
    (e.g. queuing, eating). Seiter et al. [55] further investigated the robustness
    of Topic Models for daily routine discovery by varying the characteristics of
    simulated datasets based on the original data collected by Huynh et al. and identified
    optimal values of dataset properties required to achieve good performance stability.
    5. Applications of data fusion for health monitoring 5.1. Activity recognition
    Activity monitoring using wearable technology has received a vast amount of attention.
    A person’s level of functional mobility can directly reflect quality of life (QoL)
    and overall health. From information provided by wearable sensors, feature level
    data fusion techniques and inference methods can be used for activity recognition
    at different levels of detail: activity intensity levels, static and dynamic postures,
    and activities of daily living (ADL). Static postures refer to activities which
    are globally still, such as lying and sitting, where as dynamic postures refer
    to activities during which someone is actively moving, such as bipedal activities
    and during transitions, e.g. moving from sitting to standing. Standing can be
    referred to as a dynamic activity, e.g. [19], or a static activity, e.g. [56],
    depending on the perspective and application. Standing is a globally stationary
    activity, however, to maintain a standing posture active work is required on the
    part of the person. Corrective movements are continuously made which can be detected
    using a trunk worn accelerometer and have been used to investigate standing balance
    [57]. In contrast to maintain static postures such as sitting or lying, no active
    work is required on the part of the person. There are links between health and
    the amount of dynamic activity a person performs in the form of physical activity,
    such as walking, thus, even simple measures can provide insight into well-being
    [58]. Static and dynamic postural information can be used to determine the time
    spent in various positions and the amount of dynamic activity being carried out.
    ADL describe in greater detail the essential tasks of daily living. The ability
    with which individuals can perform these tasks are commonly assessed using questionnaires
    [59]. The research literature reflects the interest in using body-worn sensors
    to identify these activities, which can be treated either as individual activities
    [37] or by dividing the ADL into the levels of physical intensity each activity
    requires [51]. It can be seen from the research literature that accelerometers
    are the most widely used sensors for these applications. Exceptions include Pawar
    et al. [60], who performed body movement classification using artifacts present
    in wearable ECG signals, and Roy et al. [46] who combined surface EMG with accelerometers
    for activity recognition. Gyroscopes are also used for activity recognition, although
    not as frequently. Potentially this is due to their high power consumption while
    accelerometers can operate at very low power making them attractive for battery
    powered systems. An in-depth review of the technology used in wearable systems
    for health applications can be found in a review by Lowe and OLaighin [61]. It
    is worth noting that heuristic algorithms are often employed and used to great
    effect for activity recognition. These can be used alone or in conjunction with
    other data fusion techniques. For example, thresholds can be used to define the
    limits between one state and another, distinguish between periods of static and
    dynamic activity, and identify posture [19], [56], [62], [63], [64], [65]. Culhane
    et al. [64] used two bi-axial accelerometers attached to the thigh and sternum
    and by applying a threshold to the standard deviation of the sensor data, it could
    be determined if the wearer was static or dynamic. During static activities, posture
    was inferred using the accelerometer by measuring the tilt of the trunk and thigh.
    Dalton et al. [65] compared the mean of accelerometer data to thresholds that
    had been pre-defined to differentiate between activities. There are a wide range
    of approaches used for general activity recognition, however some studies are
    more disease specific. Tsipouras et al. [66] developed a method for the automatic
    assessment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia for patients living with Parkinson’s
    disease. Using data from body worn accelerometers and gyroscopes, levodopa-induced
    dyskinesia could be detected and the severity assessed. Salarian et al. [67] and
    Rodriguez-Martin et al. [43] also investigated the use of activity classification
    for Parkinson’s disease using fuzzy classification and SVM, respectively. Other
    participant cohorts that were the focus of different studies include: those who
    had recently been in hospital [62], rehabilitation [64], stroke [46], and COPD
    [17], [68]. 5.2. Fall detection and prediction Fall detection, often performed
    in conjunction with activity recognition [63], [69], [70], is another widely researched
    application for wearable sensing technology. The incidence of falls and the risk
    of injury due to a fall increases as people age, affecting QoL and confidence.
    After a fall, it may not be possible to call for help or attract attention which
    could result in a sustained period of time without assistance. During this time,
    dehydration, hunger, and injuries sustained during the fall can lead to prolonged
    hospital stays and potentially prove fatal. Heuristics are often employed for
    fall detection including work by Bourke et al. [71] who investigated fall detection
    using 2 tri-axial trunk and thigh worn accelerometers. The resultant was calculated
    for both accelerometers and an upper falls thresholds applied capable of identifying
    100% of falls from normal activities. In subsequent work, Bourke et al. [72] applied
    thresholds to the resultant of the angular velocity from a trunk mounted gyroscope.
    Karantonis et al. [63] used a single waist worn accelerometer and thresholds to
    determine activity, rest, posture and falls. Benocci et al. [73] also conducted
    falls detection using an accelerometer attached to the sacrum and simulated falls
    from standing, walking, out of bed, and sliding down a wall. Wang et al. [74]
    described a three-fold threshold system that combine a trunk worn accelerometer
    and cardiotachometer to detect falls. The thresholds test for high accelerometer
    values, angle of the trunk, and heart rate to detect a fall. One of the greatest
    predictors of a fall is having fallen previously, therefore it is of equal importance
    to be able to predict a fall such that preventative measures can be put in place.
    As well as the detection of falls, work by Giansanti et al. [75] used wearable
    sensors to determine the risk of falls using 60 s balance tests. An accelerometer
    and gyroscope were worn on the trunk and a four layer ANN were used to classify
    participants into fall risk levels. 5.3. Gait and ambulatory monitoring Gait analysis
    can provide insight into functional mobility, ranging from the ability to perform
    various bipedal activities to a detailed account of the gait cycle. Gait analysis
    and biomechanical modelling are traditionally performed in laboratory environments
    using optical motion capture to track body segment motion. More recently body
    worn inertial devices have been investigated as an alternative, eliminating the
    need to collect data in specialised laboratories. Biomechanical modelling of the
    lower body could be used to build unique gait models such that deviations from
    the norm could indicate the need for treatment or intervention. Moe-Nilssen and
    Helbostad [76] used a low back mounted accelerometer to monitor gait variability
    in the anterior-posterior and mediolateral plane, and estimate cadence, step,
    and stride length over a known distance and was used to differentiate between
    fit and frail older adults. Xu et al. [77] examined the walking parameters of
    those recovering from stroke with a hemiparetic gait for rehabilitation purposes.
    A hierarchical approach using Naïve Bayes and dynamic time warping methods were
    used to classify walking, then gait parameters are computed including walking
    speed, cadence, stride length, and distance travelled. In the clinical environment,
    gait has been used to predict the risk of falling using tools such as the Tinetti
    gait and balance assessment [78]. Body-worn sensors could be used as an alternative
    or complementary assessment. Caby et al. [79] collected accelerometry data from
    10 sensors during a walking test and the Timed Up-and-Go for the objective classification
    of fallers and non-fallers. Accelerometry and force sensitive resistors have also
    been used to distinguish between normal and abnormal gait [80]. Ishigaki et al.
    [81] determined pelvic movement from an accelerometer and gyroscope mounted on
    the sacrum during 10m of free walking to find correlations with stability in older
    adults. Less pelvic motion was found for those classed as unstable based on a
    single leg balance test. The differences in bipedal locomotion styles imposed
    by environmental conditions such as a flat or sloped surface, and stairs are subtle.
    The ability to negotiate these conditions can be an indication of physical well-being
    and used to monitor those with limited mobility. To this end, Wang et al. [82]
    decomposed the acceleration data from a single waist mounted sensor into frequency
    features using wavelets to classify the different walking patterns using a multilayer
    perceptron neural network. In further work, Wang et al. [83] included walking
    up and down two different gradients and used GMM for classification. Lau et al.
    [84] focused on walking conditions for those with uni-lateral drop foot and deployed
    two accelerometers and a single gyroscope on the affected side to distinguish
    the aforementioned conditions and compare classification results from several
    data fusion methods. Muscillo et al. [85] adopted an adaptive Kalman-based Bayes
    estimation method to differentiate between locomotor conditions for both young
    and older adults. By analysing gait events, such as heel contact, heel-off, and
    toe-off, body-worn sensors can be used to characterise gait for applications such
    as drop foot stimulation [86]. Kotiadis et al. [87] investigated gait phase detection
    for drop foot, exploring trigger timings for a stimulator. For those suffering
    from Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis gait disturbances, such as freezing
    of gait, can be an indication of a higher risk of a fall. Tripoliti et al. [88]
    used body worn accelerometers and gyroscopes for the automatic detection of freezing
    of gait. Accelerometers can also be used to recognise an individual’s gait [89]
    which in a multi-resident home or scenario where sensors are shared could aid
    identification of the wearer. 5.4. Biomechanical modelling Parametric state estimation
    algorithms, such as the KF and PF, can be used to measure biomechanical motions
    by combining accelerometer and gyroscope data to estimate the kinematic parameters.
    These algorithms come under the banner of signal level fusion methods as they
    combine commensurate data to achieve the best estimation of a parameter. Musić
    et al [90] used an extended KF to fuse inertial sensor data for the reconstruction
    of body segment trajectories in the sagittal plane of sit-to-stand motions. Takeda
    et al. [91] presented a method for gait analysis by calculating the 3-dimensional
    position of each lower body segment using 7 tri-axial accelerometers and gyroscopes,
    joint-range-of-motion, the contribution of gravity to the accelerometer signals,
    and frequency features that describing the cyclic nature of walking. Due to the
    high power consumption of gyroscopes other methods using multiple accelerometers
    are being developed such as the double-sensor difference algorithm presented by
    Liu et al. [92] for the measurement of rotational angles of human segments. Djurić-Jovičić
    et al. [93] used pairs of tri-axial accelerometers for the estimation of leg segment
    angles and trajectories in the sagittal plane through the removal of sensor drift.
    5.5. Physiological monitoring By monitoring physiological aspects of health, an
    insight can be gained into how well our bodies are functioning, and can be used
    to monitor cardiovascular health, and the potential onset of illness (i.e. body
    temperature). A novel use of accelerometers was presented by Lapi et al. [94]
    to detect respiratory rate by positioning sensors on opposite sides of the chest
    wall. Li and Kim [95] developed a patch style sensor for wireless heart rate monitoring
    and movement index incorporating a HR monitor and accelerometer. Stress is another
    area of well-being that has drawn interest by the research community due to its
    impact on health and well-being. A system presented by Healey and Picard [96]
    was able to classify stress during real-world driving tasks into three levels
    based on wearable sensors including two skin conductivity sensors, ECG, EMG, chest
    expansion respiration sensor. Ikehara and Crosby [97] used physiological sensors
    to assess cognitive load. Sensors used in this study included those to measure
    electrodermal temperature and blood flow, an eye tracker extracting related features,
    and an oximeter. Luprano et al. [98] incorporated textile electrodes and an accelerometer
    into a shirt to measure ECG and perform activity recognition. Fletcher et al.
    [99] developed a system for cognitive behavioural therapy for drug addiction that
    monitors for unusual arousal patterns using accelerometer, temperature, and electrodermal
    activity sensors (with optional ECG). When specific arousal events are detected
    a message was automatically sent to the wearer’s phone with an empathetic message.
    Bandodkar et al. [100] described sodium sweat sensors applied as a temporary stick
    on ‘tattoo’ sensor. These sensors were tested in a laboratory during stationary
    cycling activities. Indeed there are many biological MEMs sensors being developed
    that can be applied to physiological monitoring such as the triglyceride biosensor,
    C-reactive protein detector to monitor increases which may cause heart attacks
    or cardiovascular disease, and membrane-based glucose sensors for diabetics [101].
    6. Discussion and further considerations 6.1. Wearable sensors Energy remains
    a dilemma for long term wearable research as it dictates not only how the wearable
    is used by the individual, but also the quality and availability of the data.
    For the application of activity recognition, inertial sensors such as accelerometers
    and gyroscopes provide the most appropriate data. The number of sensors required
    depends largely on the application. If we consider the use of one to five sensors,
    for the purpose of identifying fundamental static and dynamic postures a single
    sensing device can be sufficient. Wrist worn devices, as favoured commercially,
    are not well placed to accurately distinguish between sitting and standing postures
    but can detect overall activity level. For the general population, measuring activity
    intensity may be sufficient, however, for those that live with chronic disease
    or have restricted movement, the distinction between sitting and standing would
    provide further insight into their well-being and health. A single waist or trunk
    worn sensor will provide information on the transitions between sitting and standing
    and the global pose of the body, improving activity recognition accuracy. A single
    waist worn sensor can also be used to monitor gait variability, cadence, step
    and stride length [76] as described in Section 5.3. However, these methods were
    developed for walking in a straight line using a known distance and would not
    be suitable for free living monitoring. A two-sensor scenario would include a
    sensor on the wrist which would provide information related to ADL, e.g. cooking,
    eating and drinking. With the addition of a third sensor on an ankle or foot,
    more detailed parameters regarding gait can be extracted such as unilateral step
    length and height. An optional sensor positioned on the thigh would provide more
    definitive information regarding body posture, however maybe redundant if used
    in conjunction with a waist worn sensor. Five sensors, worn at the waist, wrists
    and ankles, would provide even greater levels of detail regarding both leg and
    arm movement that can be used for bilateral gait analysis and increase the accuracy
    of activity recognition algorithms. For applications that require data from many
    sensors to address specific diseases or conditions, the benefits of an improved
    QoL may well outweigh the inconvenience of wearing multiple sensors. This presents
    several challenges regarding the usability of the system, such as taking the sensors
    on and off, recharging the sensors, and overall adherence of wearing the system.
    With the wide availability of small, cheap, low powered sensors, incorporating
    them directly into clothing where needed could address some of these challenges.
    Further, near field charging would negate the need to directly connect the system
    to a power source. 6.2. Data fusion models and algorithms The data fusion model
    presented in this paper is based on a centralised hierarchical data fusion model
    and can be seen to be the most commonly used model for most commercial health
    monitoring and many research systems. Most of these systems are aimed at personal
    health and well-being monitoring and focus on determining specific features related
    to that individual. For more complex environments and scenarios, this type of
    architecture can be extended, such that the output, i.e. the local view, can be
    used to contribute towards the global view. This is similar to a distributed architecture
    [9] and could be used in the study of epidemiology, e.g. disease surveillance
    in hospitals. This architecture also naturally lends itself towards a decentralised
    architecture where data fusion takes place at each node and does not rely on a
    single fusion centre making it more robust to intermittent or unreliable communications
    services [9]. In this case each personal system becomes part of a community of
    nodes, each contributing information as and when it can and could be implemented
    in situations such as disaster sites. The choice of data fusion algorithm used
    depends on the target application. Influences include the required output, system
    accuracy, computational complexity, available processing power, battery power
    available, and expected operational time. Many of these aspects constitute a direct
    trade off. Low complexity data fusion algorithms, such as heuristic thresholds,
    weighted averages, k-NN, and k-means, are well suited to simple activity recognition
    applications. These include estimating activity intensity and fundamental static
    and dynamic postures. These are ideal for applications where a long battery life
    is expected and on-wearable user feedback is given. These algorithms can be trained
    in advance and could be implemented on the wearable using simple features extracted
    from the sensor data. These type of algorithms are well suited to everyday free
    living situations as targeted by many commercial systems. Medium complexity data
    fusion algorithms, require more computational power, and in turn more energy to
    run. The data can be treated in two ways, (1) implement the algorithm on-wearable,
    or, (2) transmit the data off-wearable to the fusion centre. Both methods require
    more energy and will shorten the battery life of the wearable system. These algorithms
    include activity recognition algorithms that can infer more complex ADL such as
    Naive Bayes, GMM, DT, and NN. Kinematic estimation algorithms such as the KF which
    can be used towards biomechanical and gait analysis, however, require a high sampling
    frequency of typically 50-100Hz, higher than many sampling frequencies required
    for activity recognition. For research applications, data is often collected using
    wearable sensor nodes and then post-processed. Medium complexity, as previously
    mentioned, to high complexity algorithms have been used for activity recognition
    including SVM, deep learning, and Bayesian networks. To extract and process the
    the relevant data for biomechanical and gait analysis, as previously described,
    KF, extended KF, and PF can be used for the kinematic state estimation. Feature
    level algorithms can then be used to extract features such as clinically relevant
    outputs. Depending on the algorithm, there is more or less transparency of how
    the algorithm maps the sensor data to the output features. Algorithms based on
    neural networks and deep learning provide little insight into this process and
    requires training with large example data sets. Where as model based algorithms,
    for example the KF, control how the sensor data maps to the features but requires
    a predefined model. 6.3. Annotation and system validation Collecting accurately
    labelled activity data in a natural environment to apply to machine learning techniques
    is time consuming and expensive. To reduce the amount of labelled data needed
    to train activity recognition algorithms, techniques can be used such as semi-supervised
    training and active learning [102], [103], [104], [105]. Semi-supervised training
    approaches use small amounts of labelled training data to initially train the
    activity recognition algorithms which are then used to label the unlabelled data.
    Stikic et al. [102] demonstrated two approaches to semi-supervised training, self-training
    (the classification model is updated iteratively based on the most confidently
    predicted newly labelled data) and co-training (the same as self-training but
    uses additional information to augment the process). Active learning finds the
    unlabeled data with the most information and queries the user to label them. Various
    strategies can be used to decide what data has the most information such as the
    data that is classified with the least confidence, or the amount of disagreement
    between two classifiers [102]. This reduces the cost of annotating all the data
    and is a good alternative to manual annotation. Hoque and Stankovic [104] used
    a clustering technique to group activities based on data from a smart home environment
    and asked users to label each cluster rather than label all data. Active learning
    techniques can also be used to update a classifier after deployment. Longstaff
    et al. [105] explored active learning as a means to dynamically augment mobile
    activity classifiers. Diethe et al. [106] proposed a Bayesian active transfer
    learning framework for smart home environments. Although there is a wealth of
    research being carried out in the area of body worn sensors for health applications,
    further validation for many of the methods developed is needed using realistic
    conditions such as: matched participant cohorts, target environments, and natural
    behavioural conditions. This is especially true of fall detection where the algorithms
    used are often developed using simulated data from young healthy participants
    by tripping onto a crash mat or mattress. Algorithms based solely on laboratory
    data have been shown to fail and lead to unacceptably high rates of false alarms
    [107]. In a similar way, people rarely perform activities and ambulation in the
    same way as they would naturally when being cued to do it, or carrying out a script.
    Although features and data fusion algorithms may appear to be successful based
    on laboratory training and testing data, they may fail when used in real-world
    situations or from one person to the next. 6.4. Data loss and synchronisation
    Another challenge for data fusion for health monitoring is the imperfection introduced
    throughout the data fusion health monitoring system. Khaleghi et al. [108], in
    an in-depth review of the state-of-the-art in multisensor data fusion, provided
    a taxonomy of data imperfection including uncertainty, imprecision (vagueness,
    ambiguity and incompleteness), and granularity. Transferable belief models could
    be used as a method for modelling sensor reliability [109]. As well as error introduced
    by the sensors, wireless communications present another source of system error.
    For the application of body worn sensors, wireless transmission of data to a fusion
    centre is a desirable and practical option allowing it to be analysed continuously
    without unnecessary user interaction. Disruption in the communication of data
    to the fusion centre could severally affect the quality of the received data and
    be caused by: operation outside the range of the receiver; loss of power; receiver
    error, and packet loss. Retransmission of lost or corrupted packets can increase
    data reliability using two way communications, i.e. acknowledgement of received
    packets [69], however, there is a power trade off associated with receiving and
    resending packets and there will be a time delay introduced. Data transmitted
    from different sources will arrive to the fusion centre at different times and
    need to be aligned prior to analysis. This raises the issue of data synchronisation.
    Sensor data that is collected using more than one stand alone module can be synchronised
    by providing an input that each sensor can pick up, e.g. a series of taps made
    during recording. Any drift can then be calculated and the data resampled. Systems
    employing wireless communications can correct for clock drift by broadcasting
    a regular beacon from a master clock which can be used determine drift. Including
    this additional information with the time stamp of when the data was received
    can be used to reorder the data before fusion. The synchronisation of sensors
    is an open and often overlooked area of research and methods are restrained by
    the target application requirements, power consumption, sampling and transmission
    frequency, and robustness to data loss. Alemdar and Ersoy [110] presented a survey
    on wireless sensor networks for healthcare and discussed design considerations.
    The wireless sensor network system was broken down into five subsystems including:
    body area network, personal area network, gateway to the wide area network, and
    the end-user healthcare monitoring application. Each subsystem has a different
    set of design considerations. Gravina et al. [111] presented a framework called
    SPINE that can be used for multiple body worn sensor applications. Baker et al.
    [112] described wireless sensor network prototypes for home healthcare. 7. Conclusions
    This paper outlined the state-of-the-art and future concepts for using wearable
    sensors in healthcare applications. It describes some principles of data fusion
    and many of the foundation techniques that can be used to perform data fusion
    on wearable sensor data. The commercial landscape of wearable sensors is constantly
    changing, however a snap shot of some of the currently available products has
    been given, providing context for an overview of the research literature conducted
    in the area of wearable sensors for healthcare applications. Applications of wearable
    technology for healthcare has been described including activity recognition, falls
    detection, ambulatory monitoring, and biomechanical monitoring. A discussion of
    other considerations that need to be addressed to augment wearable sensor technology
    has been provided, highlighting potential directions for research and issues such
    as data collection, algorithm training, quality of data, infrastructure and the
    potential fusion of wearable sensors with other external data sources. Conflict
    of interest There are no known conflicts of interest. Acknowledgements This work

  relevance_evaluation: 'The paper, titled “Application of data fusion techniques
    and technologies for wearable health monitoring”, is highly relevant to the specific
    point of focus mentioned in the prompt because it comprehensively discusses adaptive
    data preprocessing methods for dealing with varying data quality and formats from

    \ Kempa‑Liehr2,3*  and Kevin I‑Kai Wang1\nIntroduction\nWith the emergence of\
    \ the Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks \n(WSNs), sensor devices\
    \ are deployed across the globe in a variety of fields such as \nhealthcare, industry,\
    \ agriculture, home, and transport [1]. Recently, Cisco [2] estimated \nthat there\
    \ would be approximately 850 zettabytes (1 zettabyte is 1021 bytes) of data gen-\n\
    erated from devices. An IoT application may have hundreds or thousands of sensors\
    \ \nwhich produces vast amounts of data, but the data is rendered useless if it\
    \ is riddled \nwith errors as poor sensor data quality caused by the errors may\
    \ lead to wrong deci-\nsion-making results. In this paper, the term sensor refers\
    \ to a physical sensor [3, Chap 3], \nwhich measures the changes in physical quantity\
    \ e.g. temperature, humidity, and light \nAbstract \nSensor data quality plays\
    \ a vital role in Internet of Things (IoT) applications as they are \nrendered\
    \ useless if the data quality is bad. This systematic review aims to provide an\
    \ \nintroduction and guide for researchers who are interested in quality‑related\
    \ issues of \nphysical sensor data. The process and results of the systematic\
    \ review are presented \nwhich aims to answer the following research questions:\
    \ what are the different types of \nphysical sensor data errors, how to quantify\
    \ or detect those errors, how to correct them \nand what domains are the solutions\
    \ in. Out of 6970 literatures obtained from three \ndatabases (ACM Digital Library,\
    \ IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect) using the search string \nrefined via topic modelling,\
    \ 57 publications were selected and examined. Results show \nthat the different\
    \ types of sensor data errors addressed by those papers are mostly \nmissing data\
    \ and faults e.g. outliers, bias and drift. The most common solutions for \nerror\
    \ detection are based on principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural\
    \ \nnetwork (ANN) which accounts for about 40% of all error detection papers found\
    \ in the \nstudy. Similarly, for fault correction, PCA and ANN are among the most\
    \ common, along \nwith Bayesian Networks. Missing values on the other hand, are\
    \ mostly imputed using \nAssociation Rule Mining. Other techniques include hybrid\
    \ solutions that combine \nseveral data science methods to detect and correct\
    \ the errors. Through this systematic \nreview, it is found that the methods proposed\
    \ to solve physical sensor data errors can‑\nnot be directly compared due to the\
    \ non‑uniform evaluation process and the high use \nof non‑publicly available\
    \ datasets. Bayesian data analysis done on the 57 selected pub‑\nlications also\
    \ suggests that publications using publicly available datasets for method \nevaluation\
    \ have higher citation rates.\nKeywords: Systematic review, Sensor data quality,\

    \ Furthermore, the term error relates to the soft \nfaults that occur in sensor\
    \ data found commonly in the systematic review such as outli-\ners, bias, drifts,\
    \ missing values, and uncertainty, which should be detected or quantified \nand\
    \ removed or corrected in order to improve sensor data quality.\nThis is slightly\
    \ different from the data quality (DQ) dimensions introduced by Wang \nand Strong [4],\
    \ which categorize the quality of data in databases or high-level application\
    \ \narchitecture (Application Layer in Fig. 1) that are important to data consumers.\
    \ They are \nmostly used to describe data in enterprise-level systems and are\
    \ used for modelling how \ndata errors propagate to the consumer’s end. Therefore,\
    \ apart from incomplete (miss-\ning data) and inaccurate data (uncertainty), which\
    \ are sensor data quality-related issues, \nother DQ dimensions such as inconsistent\
    \ data and timeliness are not considered in this \nreview paper as they are more\
    \ specific to the topics of database design or communica-\ntion data quality.\
    \ A survey related to DQ dimensions is presented in the works of Kark-\nouch et al. [5].\n\
    Figure 1 shows an overview of the data flow of a typical IoT application. A physical\
    \ sen-\nsor such as a temperature or humidity sensor measures and collects readings\
    \ (changes \nin the observed property) in the Perception layer. The readings are\
    \ then transmitted \nthrough the Network layer, which determines the routes to\
    \ send the sensor data and is \nimplemented using wireless technologies such as\
    \ WiFi, 2G/3G/4G, Bluetooth, and LoRa. \nNext, the Application layer receives\
    \ data from the network layer and it is where the data \nprocessing, predictive\
    \ analytics  [6], and storage takes place. The application layer is \ndesigned\
    \ and implemented using big data architectures such as Apache Hadoop, Spark, \n\
    or Kafka. The added complexity of the architecture causes new errors to be potentially\
    \ \nintroduced in each layer. For example, in the Network Layer, poor data quality\
    \ arises \nfrom congested and unstable wireless communication links in sensor\
    \ networks which \ncauses data loss and corruption [7]. In the Perception Layer,\
    \ damage or exhaustion of \nbattery in sensor devices also causes data quality\
    \ to degrade, as towards the end of its \nbattery life, sensors tend to produce\
    \ unstable readings [8]. The hostile environment in \nwhich in-situ sensors are\
    \ deployed also plays a big part in the quality of the transmitted \ndata. For\
    \ example, sensors for temperature, light, or humidity measurements are often\
    \ \nplaced outdoors and are subjected to extreme local weather conditions such\
    \ as strong \nwinds and snow, which might affect the operation of the sensor.\n\
    Fig. 1 IoT architecture. A high‑level view of a typical IoT architecture which\
    \ shows the data flow\nPage 3 of 49\nTeh et al. J Big Data            (2020) 7:11\
    \ \n \nAlthough the factors that cause errors and affect sensor data quality are\
    \ known, sim-\nple strategies to overcome data quality problems, such as using\
    \ industry grade sensors, \nwhich are more accurate, stable and robust, are not\
    \ feasible for applications that require \nthe deployment of large and dense sensors\
    \ networks, which is the case for many IoT \napplications. For example, in horticulture,\
    \ sensors need to be deployed such that they \nhave high coverage and accuracy\
    \ through large and dense sensor networks. Having to \ndeploy many highly accurate\
    \ but expensive sensors will incur higher deployment costs. \nTherefore, most\
    \ IoT applications use low-cost sensors, though at the expense of data \nquality.\
    \ The use of both industry grade or low-cost sensors also results in high time\
    \ and \nmaintenance cost as experts would have to go out to the field themselves\
    \ to test and \ncalibrate the entire network of in-situ sensors to ensure data\
    \ quality. Other than that, \nre-transmitting the data when experiencing data\
    \ quality errors (e.g. missing data) also \ndoes not work well in an IoT application.\
    \ This is because the nodes in the network are \npowered on limited battery and\
    \ memory which makes it expensive in terms of power \nand computational resources\
    \ to resend the missing data across the network, especially \nif there is a big\
    \ load of data to re-transmit. Retransmission also delays decision-making \nwhich\
    \ in turn may lead to inaccurate results [9].\nOther than that, though studies\
    \ in previous years tend to focus on high-level solutions \nin the Application\
    \ Layer for solving data quality issues [4, 10], it is not possible nowadays \n\
    due to the separation of the layers and complexity of the architecture. The advance\
    \ of \nBig Data where the sheer volume of data hinders the transport to the central\
    \ system [1] \nalso encourages edge computing, or a decentralized solution, where\
    \ the processing of \ndata quality is done in the Perception Layer i.e. in the\
    \ sensor devices themselves and only \ndata with good quality is passed to the\
    \ central server. Since sensor data errors may be \npresent and propagated in\
    \ all layers, this review paper focuses on algorithms that solves \nthe fundamental\
    \ issue of sensor data quality by detecting and correcting those errors \nregardless\
    \ of the IoT (or big data) architecture and layers. As such, the high-level design\
    \ \nand decision of the IoT architecture is not discussed in this paper, however,\
    \ it is available \nin [5, 11–13].\nTherefore, the purpose of this systematic\
    \ review paper is to investigate the different \ntypes of sensor data errors which\
    \ contribute to the degradation of sensor data quality \nand the existing solutions\
    \ to detect and correct those errors which can be applied in any \nlayer of the\
    \ IoT architecture. The different domains the solutions are presented in and \n\
    the datasets used for evaluation are also studied. This systematic review acts\
    \ as an intro-\nduction for new researchers to the field of sensor data quality\
    \ or as a guide for research-\ners who are interested in the techniques used to\
    \ solve problems related to the sensor \ndata quality topic. In short, a systematic\
    \ review is a rigorous and structured way of con-\nducting a literature review\
    \ which allows it to be reproducible. It also helps researchers \nidentify knowledge\
    \ gaps in the area of interest by extracting and analysing existing solu-\ntions.\
    \ Other review papers about sensor data quality are present, such as the works\
    \ of \nLi et al. [14] and Prathiba et al. [15]. However, those review papers do\
    \ not mention the \nmethods used with respect to the different type of sensor\
    \ errors and are not systematic \nreviews.\nThis systematic review also focuses\
    \ on stationary wireless sensor networks. This \nis because many of the mobile\
    \ sensor network problems are related to network \nPage 4 of 49\nTeh et al. J\
    \ Big Data            (2020) 7:11 \nconnectivity issues rather than sensor data\
    \ quality. The field of imaging has also been \nexcluded as it is found that the\
    \ methods used to improve image data quality varies sig-\nnificantly compared\
    \ to other physical sensor data. The remainder of this paper is organ-\nized as\
    \ follows: “Research methodology” section describes the methodology used in the\
    \ \nsystematic review and the results from the review are provided in “Results”\
    \ section. A \ndiscussion about the challenges found in the research area is presented\
    \ in “Discussion” \nsection. Lastly, “Conclusion” section concludes the study.\n\
    Research methodology\nA systematic review is a standardized way of extracting\
    \ and synthesizing information \navailable from existing primary studies with\
    \ respect to a set of defined research ques-\ntions. It helps researchers focus\
    \ on the topic at hand and to identify knowledge gaps in \na research area. It\
    \ is frequently used in the field of medicine and though not as common \nin the\
    \ field of computer science [16], a systematic review is still applicable and\
    \ beneficial \nin terms of providing a formal way of conducting a computer science-related\
    \ literature \nreview.\nThe systematic review in this paper follows the guidelines\
    \ of Kofod-Petersen [16] and \nSilva and Neiva [17] for conducting a systematic\
    \ review in computer science-related \nfields. It is also done in accordance with\
    \ the PRISMA [18] (Preferred Reporting Items \nfor Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)\
    \ checklist which is an “evidence-based \nminimum set of items for reporting in\
    \ systematic reviews and meta-analyses”. Since the \nPRISMA checklist is constructed\
    \ mostly for medical review literature, some of the items \nsuch as the meta-analyses\
    \ criteria are not considered in this review paper.\nThe systematic review process\
    \ is broken down to several steps, starting with the defi-\nnition of research\
    \ questions in which this paper aims to answer. Next, the search pro-\ncess and\
    \ strategy are described, which specifies the keywords and search string used\
    \ to \nfind the relevant and available publications literature databases. The\
    \ search strategy also \ninvolves a topic modelling step which was carried out\
    \ to help refine the keywords and \nsearch string. The inclusion and exclusion\
    \ criteria, as well as the quality criteria, are then \ndefined to assist with\
    \ the selection of relevant literature. Next, data extraction is carried \nout\
    \ which extracts data such as the title, abstract and publication year of the\
    \ literature as \nwell as the types of sensor errors addressed, types of methods\
    \ for detecting or correcting \nerrors and the domain from the selected studies\
    \ after screening which is then synthe-\nsized and presented in the next section,\
    \ “Results”. Finally, the risk of bias or limitations of \nthis review process\
    \ is discussed. The steps for the systematic review and its risk of bias \nare\
    \ described in detail in the following subsections.\nResearch questions\nThe motivation\
    \ for this systematic review is to provide new researchers an introduc-\ntion\
    \ to the field of sensor data quality and the errors that might occur, or as a\
    \ guide for \nresearchers who are interested in solving sensor data quality related\
    \ issues. Thus, the fol-\nlowing research questions (RQs) are designed in which\
    \ this paper aims to answer:\n• RQ1: What are the different types of errors in\
    \ sensor data?\n• RQ2: How to quantify or detect errors in sensor data?\nPage\
    \ 5 of 49\nTeh et al. J Big Data            (2020) 7:11 \n \n• RQ3: How to correct\
    \ the errors in sensor data?\n• RQ4: What domains are the different types of methods\
    \ proposed in?\nWith RQ1, we are able to investigate the common errors that leads\
    \ to the degradation \nof sensor data quality in this field. Moreover, RQ2 allows\
    \ us to find existing solutions to \nquantify or detect the aforementioned errors\
    \ and RQ3 takes it one step further by find-\ning techniques to correct them.\
    \ RQ4 on the other hand, gives an insight to how various \ndomains use different\
    \ (or similar) techniques to solve sensor data quality problems and \nthe datasets\
    \ used to evaluate the methods.\nSearch process\nFor this review paper, three\
    \ computer science-related literature databases are used to \nsearch for relevant\
    \ literature about sensor data quality. The three databases are:\n• ACM Digital\
    \ Library1\n• IEEE Xplore2\n• ScienceDirect3\nThese databases are last searched\
    \ on the September 27th 2018 and the search results \nare exported into BibTeX\
    \ format which is then downloaded and stored in the reference \nmanager Zotero.\
    \ 4 For ACM Digital Library, the export function for BibTeX format only \nexports\
    \ the citation data of the literature, but not the abstracts. Thus, Zotero’s Google\
    \ \nChrome plugin is used which allows the citation information, including the\
    \ abstract, to \nbe imported directly into Zotero.\nImproving search strategy\
    \ by topic modelling\nAt the start of the search process, the keywords defined\
    \ are “sensor data” and “data qual-\nity” which are used in the initial search\
    \ string:\nThe initial search results using query (1) returned 13,057 publications\
    \ from three data-\nbases, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect.\
    \ In order to check, if this \ninitial search query retrieves publications which\
    \ match the scope of this review, we are \nusing a text mining approach from natural\
    \ language processing known as topic mod-\nelling. Topic models are “probabilistic\
    \ models for uncovering the underlying semantic \nstructure of a document collection\
    \ based on a hierarchical Bayesian analysis of the origi-\nnal texts” [19, p.\
    \ 71]. The idea of the topic modelling step is to identify keywords and \ngroups\
    \ of keywords that describe the content of the initial set of publications returned\
    \ \nby search query (1). In order to do so, topic modelling via Latent Dirichlet\
    \ Allocation \n(LDA) [20] is used to find groups of words that are likely to occur\
    \ together and represent \n(1)\n“sensor data′′ AND (quality OR “data quality′′\
    \ OR “sensor data quality′′)\n1 https ://dl.acm.org.\n2 https ://ieeex plore .ieee.org/Xplor\

    \ of 49\nTeh et al. J Big Data            (2020) 7:11 \na specific topic. For\
    \ example, assume that the researcher decides to model three topics, \nnamed Topic\
    \ A, B, and C for convenience. After fitting, the LDA model assigns each \ndocument\
    \ the probability of it covering a specific topic, e.g. Document 1 has a 20% prob-\n\
    ability of being in Topic A, 75% being in Topic B and 5% being in Topic C. The\
    \ LDA \nlearns these topic models by going through each document and cluster words\
    \ that have a \nhigh likelihood of term co-occurrence. By analysing the words\
    \ that describe the cluster, \nthe researcher can then interpret the topic for\
    \ each cluster.\nHere, the LDA model is implemented using scikit-learn’s [21]\
    \ estimator Latent-\nDirichletAllocation. For the purpose of this analysis, the\
    \ title and abstract \nof the publications, which have been identified from search\
    \ query (1), are used for \nmodelling the underlying topics. The visualization\
    \ of the LDA model with 12 top-\nics obtained from the 13,057 documents (title\
    \ and abstracts) of search string (1) is \nshown in Fig.  2a with the intertopic\
    \ distance showing the marginal topic distribu-\ntion. Figure 2b–d lists the top\
    \ 30 most relevant terms for Topic 1, Topic 2 and Topic \nFig. 2 Topic modelling\
    \ with LDA. Topic model of 13,057 titles and abstracts found from the search string\
    \ 1. \nTopic modelling is performed using a LDA model with 12 topics: a intertopic\
    \ distance showing the marginal \ntopic distribution of each topic, b–d top 30\
    \ most relevant terms for Topic 1, 2 and 8 respectively, along with \nits estimated\
    \ term frequencies. Topic 1 and 2 have terms related to sensor and data, but Topic\
    \ 1 is more \nfocused on systems and applications whereas Topic 2 is associated\
    \ with methods and algorithms. Topic 8 \nconsists mostly of keywords related to\
    \ imaging and satellite imaging\nPage 7 of 49\nTeh et al. J Big Data         \
    \   (2020) 7:11 \n \n8 respectively. Topic 1 and Topic 2 both have top terms related\
    \ to sensor and data. \nHowever, Topic 1 seems to be more focused on systems and\
    \ applications, whereas \nTopic 2 is more related to methods and algorithms. Looking\
    \ at the top 30 keywords of \nTopic 8, one might classify that topic as “Imaging”\
    \ or “Satellite Imaging” since words \nsuch as “image”, “video”, “resolution”,\
    \ “camera”, “satellite” and “pixel” occur in that \ncluster. Through this topic\
    \ modelling step, it can be seen that there are a handful of \npapers related\
    \ to “imaging” in the initial search results. Because imaging is a topic we \n\
    do not want to focus on, we are using the terms of Topic 8 to refine the search\
    \ string \nand set them to be one of the exclusion criteria in this paper.\nThrough\
    \ the topic modelling, we decided that the field of imaging is not to be con-\n\
    sidered in this paper as the techniques used for improving image data quality\
    \ is very \ndifferent compared to other physical sensor data. It is made an exclusion\
    \ criterion \n(see “Inclusion and exclusion criteria”) and the final search string\
    \ used to search the \nliterature databases is defined as:\nHowever, readers interested\
    \ in that field of research can look at review papers [22–24] \nthat investigates\
    \ data quality in imaging, e.g. camera captured document images and \nhealthcare\
    \ imaging.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nThe eligibility criteria are criteria\
    \ used for screening and selecting relevant literature \nfrom the search results.\
    \ The eligibility criteria are composed of the inclusion and \nexclusion criteria.\
    \ As mentioned in “Introduction” section, this systematic review \nfocuses on\
    \ stationary wireless sensor networks as mobile sensor networks tend to \nlean\
    \ towards network connectivity issues. Moreover, the field of imaging is to be\
    \ \nexcluded as the techniques used for improving data quality for images vary\
    \ signifi-\ncantly from physical sensor data.\nInclusion criteria (IC): \nIC1\
    \ \n Papers that involve sensor data,\nIC2 \n Papers that mainly focus on data\
    \ quality of sensor data,\nIC3 \n Papers about stationary wireless sensor network,\n\
    IC4 \n Papers that consider different types of sensors.\n Exclusion criteria (EC):\
    \ \nEC1 \n Papers that are duplicates,\nEC2 \n Papers not in English,\nEC3 \n\
    \ Papers without methodology,\nEC4 \n Papers that are secondary studies (e.g.\
    \ survey, reviews, demos, posters, \ntutorials),\nEC5 \n Papers about imaging\
    \ (camera images, 3D images, video streams) or satellite \nimaging.\n(2)\nsensor\
    \ data AND (quality OR “data quality\" OR “sensor data quality\")\nAND NOT (“imaging\"\
    ) AND NOT (“satellite imaging\")\nPage 8 of 49\nTeh et al. J Big Data        \
    \    (2020) 7:11 \n Even though imaging-related publications are directly filtered\
    \ from the search query (2), \nEC5 is added as an exclusion criterion because\
    \ there are still publications with imag-\ning-related topics present in the result\
    \ obtained from the search. This is due to the use \nof the same search string\
    \ for all databases, which produces different results in different \ndatabases.\
    \ For example, in the substring “ ...AND NOT (“imaging”) ...” of search string\
    \ \n(2), ACM Digital Library removes all lemmatized terms related to “imaging”\
    \ e.g. images, \nimage, imaging but IEEE Xplore removes only the specified word\
    \ “imaging”.\nStudy quality assessment\nIn addition to the inclusion and exclusion\
    \ criteria, the quality criteria are defined to \nevaluate the quality of papers\
    \ selected after full-text screening. Using these criteria, the \nquality of the\
    \ selected literature can be assessed to see if they are fully appropriate for\
    \ \nthis systematic review, based on their importance with respect to answering\
    \ the research \nquestions. The following are the quality criteria (QC): \nQC1\
    \ \n Does the study contain validation?\nQC2 \n Does the study propose a way to\
    \ quantify/detect uncertainty?\nQC3 \n Does it propose a solution to correct the\
    \ uncertainty/erroneous data?\n The papers are scored according to whether they\
    \ are able to meet the above quality \ncriteria i.e. Yes, No, or Partially. The\
    \ scores are Yes = 1, No = 0 and Partially = 0.5. It is \nseen that 54 out of\
    \ 57 publications have a QC score of two or above and only three pub-\nlications [25–27]\
    \ have QC scores of one, which shows that the quality of the majority of \nthe\
    \ selected literature is of good quality and they are relevant to the systematic\
    \ review. \nThe three publications with a QC score of one are still included in\
    \ this systematic review \nas two of them are related to enterprise-level systems,\
    \ which gives an insight into how \nexisting methods are integrated into practice.\
    \ The third paper, which is one of the earli-\nest publications that presented\
    \ a PCA-based solution for sensor fault detection, is also \nincluded as it is\
    \ highly cited by other papers that proposed PCA-based methods.\nStudy selection\n\
    The initial search query (1) returned 13,057 publications. After the process of\
    \ topic mod-\nelling, the refined search query (2) resulted in 6970 publications.\
    \ The 6970 publications \nobtained from the three literature databases are then\
    \ screened to remove duplicates. \nThere are 107 duplicates which are removed.\
    \ Next, the duplicate-free set of papers are \nscreened based on their title and\
    \ abstract. Irrelevant papers, based on the inclusion and \nexclusion criteria,\
    \ are excluded and this resulted in the selection of 285 papers. Those \nscreened\
    \ papers are then read and evaluated in full-text to assess based on their abil-\n\

    \ Data            (2020) 7:11 \nData synthesis\nAfter the data extraction step,\
    \ the extracted data is analysed to answer the research ques-\ntions. For RQ1,\
    \ the definitions of the different types of errors addressed in the papers \n\
    were analysed as they might have been termed differently in different publications\
    \ but \nreferred to the same type of error (“Types of errors in sensor data”).\
    \ Once establishing \nthe definitions of each error, they are then classified\
    \ so that the errors with the same def-\ninition are in the same category. For\
    \ RQ2 and RQ3, the different types of methods pro-\nposed in the literature are\
    \ analysed and their state-of-the-art techniques are categorized \nand studied\
    \ (“Methods for detecting and quantifying errors in sensor data”, “Methods \n\
    for correcting errors in sensor data” and “Methods for detecting and correcting\
    \ errors \nin sensor data”). The extracted domains are extracted along with publicly\
    \ available data-\nsets used for method evaluation in those domains to answer\
    \ RQ4 (“Types of domains”). \nMoreover, for literature with validation, the evaluation\
    \ conditions and results of the \nmethods are also analysed to compare and identify\
    \ the gaps in knowledge (“Discussion”).\nRisk of bias\nThis systematic review\
    \ is not without bias. Firstly, there is a risk of bias in the review \nprocess\
    \ as only one reviewer screening the literature where the subjectivity of the\
    \ inclu-\nsion and exclusion criteria may affect the selection of relevant publications.\
    \ Moreover, \nthe year range was not specified during the search process. This\
    \ means that the search \nresults returned are from all available years, that\
    \ is from the earliest publication found \nin the respective databases until recently\
    \ (September 2018). The databases returned dif-\nferent earliest start years e.g.,\
    \ the earliest publication from ACM Digital Library is from \n1998, IEEE Xplore\
    \ is from 1979, and ScienceDirect is from 1995.\nFurthermore, there are publications\
    \ missed in the search process because the search \nwas done only on three databases,\
    \ and there are many more databases (e.g., Google \nScholar, Scopus, SpringerLink)\
    \ that might have other literature addressing the men-\ntioned sensor data quality\
    \ problems. Thus, this systematic review paper is not an exhaus-\ntive list of\
    \ methods available for detecting and correcting sensor data errors. Other than\
    \ \nthat, there was no snowballing done in this systematic review, i.e. the review\
    \ process \ndid not include searching and extracting information from the references\
    \ of the selected \npapers for the purposes of this systematic review.\nResults\n\
    This section presents the findings from the extracted data with respect to the\
    \ research \nquestions formulated in “Research questions” section. In “Types of\
    \ errors in sensor data” \nsection, RQ1 is addressed to discuss the different\
    \ types of errors that exist in sensor data \nwhich leads to the degradation of\
    \ sensor data quality. Next, in “Methods for detecting \nand quantifying errors\
    \ in sensor data”, “Methods for correcting errors in sensor data”, and \n“Methods\
    \ for detecting and correcting errors in sensor data” sections, RQ2 and RQ3 are\
    \ \nanswered with respect to the type of errors. The nomenclature in Table 1 is\
    \ used in those \nthree subsections. “Methods for detecting and quantifying errors\
    \ in sensor data” sec-\ntion addresses methods proposed only for fault detection\
    \ and uncertainty quantification \n(RQ2) and “Methods for correcting errors in\
    \ sensor data” section discusses solutions \nPage 11 of 49\nTeh et al. J Big Data\

    \ As for methods that address both \nresearch questions simultaneously i.e. fault\
    \ detection and correction (RQ2 and RQ3), \nthe results are presented in “Methods\
    \ for detecting and correcting errors in sensor data” \nsection. This is followed\
    \ by “Types of domains” section where the domains in which the \nmethods are proposed\
    \ in (RQ4) are detailed.\nTypes of errors in sensor data\nAccording to the International\
    \ Standardization Organization (ISO) [29], an error is \ndefined as “the result\
    \ of a measurement minus the true value of the measurand”. There \nare several\
    \ types of errors related to sensor data quality. Table 2 shows the different\
    \ types \nof errors extracted from the selected literature (RQ1), along with the\
    \ papers that address \nTable 1 Nomenclature used for “Methods for detecting and\
    \ quantifying errors in sensor \ndata”,“Methods for correcting errors in sensor\
    \ data” and  “Methods for detecting and \ncorrecting errors in sensor data” sections\n\
    Depending on how the samples are obtained, the variables in sensor data vector\
    \ ⃗x might be produced by more than one \nsensor. For example, in environmental\
    \ monitoring, the data may be produced by several sensors, each measuring one\
    \ \nvariable e.g. temperature and humidity. On the other hand, some variables\
    \ are produced by one sensor alone, such as an \naccelerometer which produces\
    \ readings for three variables i.e. the acceleration in the direction x, y, and\

    \ \nthem and the total number of papers. Note that some literature address different\
    \ types of \nerrors in the same paper, for example, [30–32] addressed both outliers\
    \ and bias in their \nproposed solution.\nThe type of error that is most commonly\
    \ addressed in publications related to sensor \ndata quality is outliers and is\
    \ addressed by 32 papers, which is more than half of the total \nnumber of selected\
    \ studies. Outliers, also known as anomalies [82] and spikes [36, 83], \nare values\
    \ that exceed thresholds or largely deviate from the normal behaviour provided\
    \ \nby the model. A sensor data measurement is also considered an outlier if it\
    \ is signif-\nicantly different from its previous and next observations or observations\
    \ from neigh-\nbouring sensor nodes [38, 45, 48]. Outliers are also known as faults,\
    \ though faults also \ninclude other types of errors such as bias, drifts, noise,\
    \ constant value, and stuck-at-zero. \nThough some papers [50, 55] might not have\
    \ specified the type of fault, most of them \nbreakdown the fault error to the\
    \ different types of errors as mentioned previously.\nThe second most commonly\
    \ found error in sensor data is missing data, which is \naddressed in 16 publications.\
    \ It is also known as incomplete data, and it is one of the \ndata quality (DQ)\
    \ dimensions introduced by Wang and Strong [4]. DQ dimensions cat-\negorize the\
    \ quality of data in databases that are important to data consumers. They are\
    \ \nmostly used to describe data in enterprise-level systems and are used for\
    \ modelling how \ndata errors propagate to the consumer’s end. However, apart\
    \ from incomplete (missing \ndata) and inaccurate data (uncertainty), which are\
    \ sensor data quality-related issues, \nother DQ dimensions such as inconsistent\
    \ data and timeliness are not considered in this \nreview paper as they are more\
    \ related to the topics of database design or communication \ndata quality. According\
    \ to Li and Parker [9], missing data is caused by various factors \nsuch as unstable\
    \ wireless connection due to network congestion, sensor device outages \ndue to\
    \ its limited battery life, environmental interferences e.g. human blockage, walls,\
    \ \nand weather conditions, and malicious attacks. There are cases where sensor\
    \ data is \nmissing for extended periods of time, which might lead to incorrect\
    \ decision making on \nthe consumer side. Though the simplest way to solve this\
    \ problem is to re-transmit the \ndata, most IoT applications are in real-time,\
    \ which would render the data useless if there \nis a delay. Besides that, the\
    \ computational and energy cost causes it to be inefficient as \nthese sensor\
    \ devices are usually limited in terms of battery, memory, and computational \n\
    resources.\nBias, also known as an offset, is a fault with a constant offset or\
    \ as Rabatel et al. [84] \ndefines, “a value that is shifted in comparison with\
    \ the normal behaviour of a sensor”. \nThis type of error would usually require\
    \ calibration to subtract the offset from the \nobserved reading to get its true\
    \ value. Drifts are readings that deviate from its true value \nover time due\
    \ to the degradation of sensing material which is an irreversible chemi-\ncal\
    \ reaction [60] whereas constant values are readings with a constant value over\
    \ time, \nthough it might belong to a normal range. It is usually caused by a\
    \ faulty sensor or trans-\nmission problems [84]. Another type of fault is a stuck-at-zero\
    \ or dead sensor fault. As \nits name implies, it refers to values that are constantly\
    \ at zero over an extended period \nof time. Lastly, noise is also a type of fault,\
    \ and they are small variations in the data-\nset. Noise is similar to uncertainty,\
    \ which is another type of error and DQ dimension. \nAccording to the ISO [29],\
    \ the definition of uncertainty is, “a parameter, associated with \nthe result\
    \ of a measurement, that characterizes the dispersion of the values that could\
    \ \nPage 13 of 49\nTeh et al. J Big Data            (2020) 7:11 \n \nreasonably\
    \ be attributed to the measurement”. Thus, uncertainty can also be seen as the\
    \ \nquantification of an error in statistical terms. Moreover, Mansouri et al.\
    \ [47] states that \nsensor data uncertainty includes “measurement noise, sensor\
    \ imprecision and variabil-\nity of measured quantity”. According to that definition,\
    \ noise contributes to uncertainty. \nHowever, the methods of correcting those\
    \ two errors are relatively different where noise \ncorrection techniques mostly\
    \ includes signal processing solutions whereas uncertainty \nquantification and\
    \ correction involves ontology-based methods (refer to “Methods for \ndetecting\
    \ and quantifying errors in sensor data”, “Methods for correcting errors in sen-\n\
    sor data” and “Methods for detecting and correcting errors in sensor data” sections).\n\
    Methods for detecting and quantifying errors in sensor data\nMost solutions suggest\
    \ ways to quantify or detect errors in existing literature either address \nthe\
    \ detection of faults i.e. outliers, bias, drifts, constant values, or to quantify\
    \ the uncertainty \nin the sensor data. These publications only address the problem\
    \ of detecting those errors, \nbut not correcting them. There are 32 publications\
    \ that proposed methods to solve this \nproblem, which is 56% of the total number\
    \ of selected literature. Table 3 obtained from the \ndata extraction process\
    \ of the 32 papers shows the different existing methods to quantify \nor detect\
    \ sensor data errors (RQ2), along with the errors addressed, the respective papers\
    \ \nthat presented the method and the total number of papers. It can be seen that\
    \ the three \nmost common approaches are principal component analysis, artificial\

    \ error detection and quantification methods, with 7, 6 and 4 papers proposing\
    \ \nthose methods respectively. There are also hybrid approaches, which incorporates\
    \ more \nthan one type of method in detecting sensor data errors. The following\
    \ is a brief overview \nof each method, where “Anomaly/fault detection” section\
    \ discusses methods for detecting \nanomalies or faults in the sensor data and\
    \ “Uncertainty quantification” section presents \napproaches for quantifying the\
    \ quality of the data.\nAnomaly/fault detection\nFirstly, to detect faults, several\
    \ methods such as statistical and machine learning, clustering, \nontology, and\
    \ hybrid approaches have been suggested.\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) Principal\
    \ component analysis (PCA) [27] is com-\nmonly used to find patterns in the data\
    \ i.e. the correlation between variables, by gener-\nating orthogonal principal\
    \ components. Therefore, other than being used as a feature \nreduction technique,\
    \ PCA can also be used for fault detection. In sensor data matrix X \nwith N rows\
    \ (measurements at different points in time) and V columns (measurement of \n\
    different sensors), PCA is done by firstly standardizing the matrix X if the variables\
    \ are \nof different units of measurements (e.g. oC , lux, km/h) or if each variable\
    \ is to receive \nequal weight in the analysis. To standardize the matrix, each\
    \ data point xj,i of matrix X \nis subtracted by the mean of the respective column\
    \ µi and the differences (xj,i − µi) are \ndivided by the column’s standard deviation\
    \ σi . This process is known as whitening in sta-\ntistics. Next, the covariance\
    \ matrix XTX , which quantifies the correlation between each \nof the variables,\
    \ is calculated by multiplying the transpose of the standardized sensor data \n\
    matrix with itself. The eigenvectors and their corresponding eigenvalues of the\
    \ covari-\nance matrix are calculated [85, Chap 11], which produces two matrices:\
    \ P , which is the \nmodal matrix where the columns are eigenvectors and D = P−1XTXP\
    \ , which is the spec-\ntral matrix where the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues.\
    \ The pairs of eigenvalues and \neigenvectors are sorted from largest to smallest\
    \ eigenvalue, such that the first eigenvector \n(or principal component) accounts\
    \ for the largest amount of variance, which is given by \nthe corresponding eigenvalue.\
    \ The orthogonal transformation\nconverts the sensor data matrix X into a set\
    \ of values from linearly uncorrelated vari-\nables, the so-called principal components.\
    \ The top few principal components capture \nmost of the variability in the dataset.\
    \ This is also how it is used as a dimension-reduction \ntechnique, because it\
    \ projects the dataset into a lower-dimensional subspace.\nFollowing the steps\
    \ for PCA, two orthogonal projection subspaces are obtained from \nthe selection\
    \ of the top few principal components and the standardized data matrix X \ncan\
    \ then be decomposed into the following:\nwhere ˆX is the principal component\
    \ subspace which is the modelled variations of X \nand includes the signal in\
    \ the dataset, containing the first l eigenvectors i.e. the first \nl columns\
    \ of P (where l is the number of selected principal components) and E is the \n\
    T = XP\nX = ˆX + E ,\nPage 15 of 49\nTeh et al. J Big Data            (2020) 7:11\
    \ \n \nunmodelled variations of X , also known as the residual matrix which includes\
    \ mainly \nnoise and useless information and consist of the last V − l columns\
    \ of P . They are repre-\nsented as the following:\nwhere C = PPT and similarly,\n\
    Therefore, a new sample vector, ⃗x can be projected into the principal component\
    \ \nsubspace:\nand into the residual subspace:\nC and (I − C) are also known as\
    \ the model projection matrix and residual projection \nmatrix respectively. Fault\
    \ detection can be done by monitoring the residual subspace of \nthe PCA as it\
    \ increases in magnitude when there is a change in the correlation among \nthe\
    \ variables in x. The squared prediction error, also known as Q-statistic, defined\
    \ as:\nwhere Qa is the Q-statistic threshold. Details on how to obtain Qa is found\
    \ in [32, 42, 69].\nDunia et al. [27] proposed a Sensor Validation Index (SVI)\
    \ as a means for fault detec-\ntion and isolation (identifying faulty sensors)\
    \ through an iterative reconstruction process \nthat assumes each sensor fails,\
    \ reconstructs the faulty sensor and compare the Q-statis-\ntics before and after\
    \ reconstruction. The SVI, which ranges from 0 to 1, shows that when \na sensor\
    \ is faulty, it is close to zero and vice versa. Alawi et al. [69], on the other\
    \ hand, \nintroduced a combined contributions index using the Q-statistics, which\
    \ measures the \nvariance of random noise in the residual subspace and Hotelling’s\
    \ T 2-statistics, which \nrepresents the variance in the model subspace. This\
    \ is because an occurrence of a fault \n(bias and constant value mentioned in\
    \ this paper) usually leads to changes in either sta-\ntistical metric.\nRassam\
    \ et al. [48] proposed a variation of PCA called the One-Class Principal Com-\n\
    ponent Classifier for local and unsupervised anomaly detection. The approach is\
    \ divided \ninto two parts, with the first being the offline training phase which\
    \ trains a PCA model \nusing normal data collected from each sensor to build the\
    \ normal behaviour model and \nit is stored locally in each sensor node. The dissimilarity\
    \ measure is calculated using \nthe sum of squares of the normalized principal\
    \ components, and this represents the \nˆX = TPT\nℓ =\nl\n\x1F\ni=1\ntipT\ni =\

    \ second phase is the \nonline detection phase where current observations would\
    \ be projected into the fea-\nture subspace and compared with normal behaviour\
    \ model based on its the dissimilar-\nity matrix. The normal PCA model is also\
    \ updated and retrained with new mean and \nstandard deviation of the new data.\
    \ In order to deal with non-linear systems, Sharifi and \nLangari  [50], suggested\
    \ a Mixture Probabilistic PCA model for fault diagnosis which \nseparates the\
    \ input space into several local linear regions and subsequently has linear \n\
    sensor fault diagnosis applied to each linear region.\nMoreover, Zhao and Fu [59]\
    \ have also proposed a sensor fault detection for outliers \nand bias using PCA\
    \ by modelling the normal behaviour for continuous glucose moni-\ntoring applications.\
    \ Harkat et al. [32] also applied the PCA technique to detect outliers, \ndrifts,\
    \ bias, stuck-at-zero faults. However, rather than just using the SVI [27], a\
    \ test on \nthe sum of squares of the residual matrix, i.e. the last (V − l) principal\
    \ components is \ndone to detect faults. Recently, Mansouri et al. [47] came up\
    \ with another variation of \nPCA called the Midpoint-radii PCA for fault detection.\
    \ The Midpoint-radii PCA allows \ninterval-valued data, which considers the uncertainty\
    \ in the data, to be modelled.\nPCA is a powerful technique used for many applications,\
    \ including fault detection in \nwhich 7 out of 32 methods proposed are based\
    \ on. It can be adapted to multiple varia-\ntions, which have their own advantages\
    \ such as the One-Class PCA classifier, which is \nable to perform locally with\
    \ no extra communication overhead, making it suitable for \nEdge Computing applications.\
    \ However, PCA requires fault-free training data which is \nrare and difficult\
    \ to obtain. There is also a need to choose the optimal number of princi-\npal\
    \ components, which differs from one application to another.\nArtificial neural\
    \ network An artificial neural network (ANN) is a framework that is \nvaguely\
    \ modelled upon the biological neural network of a brain. It is mainly used to\
    \ learn \npatterns or models from complex processes such as pattern recognition.\
    \ ANNs consist of \na densely interconnected set of neurons, also known as perceptrons,\
    \ whereby each unit \ntakes several real-valued inputs (combined using an input\
    \ function), runs it through its \nactivation function e.g. linear, sigmoid and\
    \ rectified linear unit, and produces a single \nreal-valued output. Each input\
    \ has a weight related to it, which determines the contri-\nbution of the inputs\
    \ to the output. Learning the weights of the input values such that it \nproduces\
    \ the correct output value is the basis that trains an ANN to learn. There are\
    \ also \nmany ways of doing so, such as the perceptron rule for linearly-separable\
    \ datasets, gradi-\nent descent for non-linear datasets and backpropagation.\n\
    Jäger et al. [78] introduced a framework to detect four different types of fault:\
    \ outliers, \noffset, noise and stuck-at-zero, using a supervised time-delay neural\
    \ network (TDNN). \nIt is a type of multi-layer feed-forward ANN that allows the\
    \ mapping between past and \npresent values by analysing the sliding windows of\
    \ a signal. The difference between \nTDNN and the classic multilayer perceptron\
    \ is that the neurons receive not only the \noutput from the neurons below but\
    \ also the delayed (past) outputs of those neurons. \nHowever, it is seen that\
    \ TDNN is only able to detect 2 out of the 4 fault types reliably, \nnamely the\
    \ offset and stuck-at-zero. Bosman et al. [36] proposed a decentralized learn-\n\
    ing approach for fault detection i.e. for anomalies such as outliers, drift, noise,\
    \ and con-\nstant values, which learns the normal sensor behaviour model in each\
    \ sensor node, while \nPage 17 of 49\nTeh et al. J Big Data            (2020)\
    \ 7:11 \n \nincorporating neighbourhood information. The approach uses Recursive\
    \ Least Squares \nto learn linear models and so-called Extreme Learning Machines\
    \ (see “Artificial neural \nnetwork” section) for learning non-linear models.\n\
    Smarsly and Law [70] suggested a decentralized fault detection and isolation software\
    \ \npackage framework for bias and drifts using backpropagation feedforward neural\
    \ net-\nwork, which is embedded in each wireless sensor nodes of the system. Once\
    \ again, the \nNeural Network learns the normal behaviour model of the system\
    \ and outputs an esti-\nmated value in which the current observed value will be\
    \ compared against and detected \nif it is anomalous. Xiao et al. [54], on the\
    \ other hand, introduced an Auto-associative \nNeural Network (AANN) solution\
    \ for fault detection and prognosis for outliers and \ndrifts. AANN is a feedforward\
    \ neural network with an odd number of hidden layers that \nare used to produce\
    \ an approximation of the identity mapping between input and output \nlayers (auto-encoder)\
    \ [86]. It has a bottleneck hidden layer which compresses informa-\ntion, which\
    \ forces it to eliminate redundancy and capture the input patterns. The faults\
    \ \nare detected using shallow and deep AANN, and the prognosis is done using\
    \ Autore-\ngressive Moving Average.\nAhmad et  al.  [34] proposed a framework\
    \ for anomaly detection using hierarchical \ntemporal memory (HTM), a type of\
    \ unsupervised artificial intelligence learning method \nbased on neuroscience\
    \ research. It is similar to an artificial neural network, but unlike \nmost neural\
    \ networks, HTM can learn time-based patterns in an unlabeled data stream. \n\
    It is firstly described in the book “On Intelligence” by Hawkins and Blakeslee\
    \ [87] in 2004 \nand has since been continuously developed by his company, Numenta [88].\
    \ Numenta \nalso provides an open-source anomaly detection benchmark, numenta\
    \ anomaly bench-\nmark (NAB) for evaluating anomaly detection algorithms in real-world\
    \ streaming data \nwhich consists of labelled anomalies. The steps of a HTM is\
    \ seen in Fig. 4, where the \ninput of the data stream, ⃗xt which is an observed\
    \ data vector at time t is sent to the HTM \nsystem. Then, the HTM returns a sparse\
    \ binary vector representing the current input, \n⃗a(⃗xt) and the prediction for\
    \ the next time step, ⃗π(⃗xt) , which is the estimation of \x1Fa(\x1Fxt+1) \n\
    in sparse binary vector form. The prediction error, st is calculated and the probabilistic\
    \ \nmodel of it is used to compute the likelihood of the data being an anomaly,\
    \ Lt.\nAlong with PCA, ANN is also another common technique for fault detection\
    \ and it \nalso has multiple variations such as TDNN, AANN and HTM. There are\
    \ 6 out of 32 \npapers that have presented an ANN-based approach, which has its\
    \ own pros and cons. \nThe advantages and disadvantages depend heavily on the\
    \ type of Neural Network \napplied. For example, TDNN has several disadvantages\
    \ such as not being able to detect \nFig. 4 Framework of HTM for anomaly detection\

    \ and requires many parameter decisions, whereas AANN is \nrobust against training\
    \ data with missing values.\nEnsemble classifiers Ensemble learning use multiple\
    \ machine learning classifiers to \narrive at a better predictive performance\
    \ compared to when using those algorithms \nindividually by aggregating the results\
    \ of the classifiers. Bosman et al. [35] proposed a \ndecentralized, online fault\
    \ detection for anomalies, drifts, noise and constant value using \nensemble classifiers\
    \ where each classifier will learn a normal behaviour model and com-\npare it\
    \ with the current reading to identify if it is an anomaly. The results are then\
    \ aggre-\ngated using simple heuristic rules or applying algebraic combiners e.g.\
    \ median or Fisher’s \nmethod [89]. The classifiers mentioned in the paper are\
    \ Sliding Window Mean, Recur-\nsive Least Squares, Extreme Learning Machines,\
    \ Polynomial Function Approximation. \nCuriac and Volosencu [37] also suggested\
    \ an anomaly detection technique using ensem-\nble-based classifiers which models\
    \ the normal behaviour of the sensors whose votes (if a \nsensor reading is anomalous\
    \ or not as compared with the normal behaviour model) are \nthen collected and\
    \ aggregated. The types of classifiers used in the paper are the Average-\nbased\
    \ classifier, Auto-Regressive Linear Predictor-based classifier, Neural Network-based\
    \ \nclassifier, Neural Network Auto-Regressive Predictor-based classifier and\
    \ the Adaptive \nNeuro-Fuzzy Inference System-based classifier.\nAbuaitah and\
    \ Wang  [33] introduced a distributed anomaly detection framework \nto detect\
    \ anomalies using feature extraction and classification algorithms. The feature\
    \ \nextraction is carried out on the child nodes, which incrementally learns new\
    \ statistical \nsummaries. The features proposed that can be useful to detect\
    \ anomalies are mean, vari-\nance, rate of change, spatial distance, temporal\
    \ and spatial correlations. The statistical \nsummaries are then sent to the base\
    \ station (parent node) instead of raw data. There, \na classification algorithm\
    \ such as AdaBoost, Support Vector Machines or simple deci-\nsion trees is applied\
    \ to the set of feature vectors received from child nodes. The study \nshowed\
    \ that AdaBoost performs the best (lowest false positives and negatives) for anom-\n\
    aly detection in their case study. Adaboost converts a collection of weak classifiers\
    \ (error \nrate slightly better than random guessing) into a strong one by the\
    \ weighted combina-\ntion of the weak classifiers. During classification, the\
    \ child node is labelled as “normal” \nor “misbehaving”, and the parent nodes\
    \ will stop using data from “misbehaving” child \nnodes.\nEnsemble classifier\
    \ is a supervised method and though it mostly achieves better pre-\ndictive performance\
    \ than its individual classifiers, it is a complex task to build an ensem-\nble\
    \ classifier. This is due to the need to choose suitable base classifiers, which\
    \ may be \ndifficult and complicated, depending on the type of application. Also,\
    \ based on the indi-\nvidual classifiers chosen, some may require feature extraction\
    \ and fault-free training \nexamples. Large datasets are also needed to train\
    \ the supervised classifiers.\nSupport vector machine A support vector machine\
    \ (SVM) is a machine learning \nalgorithm that aims to find a hyperplane to separate\
    \ and classify the data points in an \nF-dimensional space, where F is the number\
    \ of features. The features are obtained either \ndirectly as the variables themselves,\
    \ or via a process called feature engineering, which \nproduces new features based\
    \ on the data and its set of variables. The hyperplane (a line in \nPage 19 of\
    \ 49\nTeh et al. J Big Data            (2020) 7:11 \n \n2D, a plane in 3D, and\
    \ so on) is a decision boundary in which data points on one side of \nthe hyperplane\
    \ belong to one class, and data points on the other side belong to another \n\
    class. The objective is to find a hyperplane that has the widest margin, i.e.\
    \ the maximum \ndistance between the two data points from the two different classes.\
    \ Support vectors \nare data points that are close to the hyperplane and they\
    \ are the data points that deter-\nmine the hyperplane by maximizing the margin\
    \ of the classifier. For anomaly detection, \nthe decision boundary or hyperplane\
    \ of the normal data is found such that it encom-\npasses most of the data in\
    \ the feature space. Then, newly observed data that fall out of the \nboundary\
    \ are classified as outliers.\nIn 2009, Zhang et al. [57] proposed an online outlier\
    \ detection technique using One-\nClass (unsupervised) Centered Quarter-Sphere\
    \ SVM which updates the normal behav-\niour model of the sensed data based on\
    \ three time windows. The quadratic optimization \nproblem of modelling the SVM\
    \ is converted into a linear optimization problem by fixing \nthe center of the\
    \ mapped data at the origin in the feature space. Here, the data vectors \n⃗x\
    \ in sensor data matrix X is mapped into a feature space using a non-linear mapping\
    \ \nfunction such as PCA, which returns the top few principal components that\
    \ can be used \nas features. Other than that, a Python package for feature engineering\
    \ and selection, \ntsfresh [90] can also be used to obtain time series features.\
    \ The normal behaviour at \neach time window is learned using One-Class Centered\
    \ Quarter-Sphere SVM to find the \nminimum radius (hyperplane), which helps detect\
    \ temporal anomalies. Then, the radius \nis broadcasted to all spatially neighbouring\
    \ nodes i.e. sensor nodes that are within com-\nmunication range, and the median\
    \ radius is calculated. The online characteristic allows \nthe data can be checked\
    \ against other neighbouring nodes to identify if the temporal \nanomaly is also\
    \ spatially anomalous, thus confirming the detection of an actual anomaly.\nIn\
    \ 2013, Zhang et al. [58] presented another type of SVM called the One-Class Cen-\n\
    tered Hyper-Ellipsoidal SVM for anomaly detection. The difference between the\
    \ Quar-\nter-Sphere and Hyper-Ellipsoidal SVM is that the former uses Euclidean\
    \ distance as a \ndistance measure, whereas the latter uses the Mahalanobis distance\
    \ to model the SVM. \nThose two types of distance measures are commonly used to\
    \ measure the similarity of \nthe data points. However, the Euclidean distance\
    \ does not take into account the correla-\ntion between variables and only calculates\
    \ the distance in terms of individual variables. \nOn the other hand, the Mahalanobis\
    \ distance takes into account the correlation between \nvariables and calculates\
    \ the distance by combining all variables together, forming a \ncovariance matrix.\
    \ It is also scale-insensitive, but it comes with a higher computational \ncomplexity\
    \ compared to Euclidean distance. The two variations of SVM are unsuper-\nvised,\
    \ adaptive and distributed.\nClustering Clustering is an unsupervised technique\
    \ for fault detection which has the \nadvantage of not requiring prior knowledge\
    \ of the system model or underlying data dis-\ntribution. However, the optimal\
    \ number of clusters or cluster width has to be determined \nby the user. One\
    \ of the clustering-based outlier detection technique is proposed by Fawzy \n\
    et al. [39] for WSNs. The algorithm uses an in-network fixed-width clustering\
    \ algorithm \nalong with nearest neighbor and timestamps which helps to identify\
    \ if it is an erroneous \ndata or an actual event. It consists of a few steps,\
    \ starting with pre-processing, where the \nfixed-width clustering algorithm is\
    \ applied to the dataset to separate and group the data. \nPage 20 of 49\nTeh et al.\
    \ J Big Data            (2020) 7:11 \nIn the fixed-width clustering algorithm,\
    \ each data point is assigned to a cluster and the \ndata point is within a pre-defined\
    \ distance from the cluster’s center. If there is no such \ncluster, then a new\
    \ cluster is created with that data point being its center. Next, the outlier\
    \ \ndetection step labels each cluster formed as “normal” or “outlier”. This is\
    \ done by calculat-\ning the Euclidean distance between one cluster to the other\
    \ clusters. A cluster is detected \nas an outlier if its average inter-cluster\
    \ distance is more than one standard deviation away \nfrom the mean inter-cluster\
    \ distance. The data points in the outlier clusters are then fur-\nther examined\
    \ by looking at the neighbouring nodes and timestamps to see if those data \n\
    points are events or actual anomalies.\nLiu et al. [45] presented another example\
    \ of the clustering method used for outlier \ndetection using Time-Relevant k-Means\
    \ clustering for electric power sensor data. The \nk-means clustering algorithm\
    \ is used to form initial clusters. The k-means algorithm can \nbe done in the\
    \ following steps, for an input k, which is the user-defined number of clus-\n\
    ters and a dataset, X = { \x1Dx1, \x1Dx2, . . . , \x1D\nxN} where N is the number\
    \ of samples: \n1. Set centroids (centers of clusters), c1, c2, . . . , ck at\
    \ random locations.\n2. Repeat until convergence: \n(a) For each sample ⃗xj ,\
    \ assign the sample to the cluster, s with the nearest centroid, \ncs : \n where\
    \ D is the distance function.\n(b) Update the centroids of each cluster cs , where\
    \ s = 1, . . . , k after adding the new \nsample in the cluster: \n where ns is\
    \ the number of points in that cluster s.\n3. Stop when none of the cluster assignments\
    \ change, i.e. converge.\nIn order to choose the appropriate k number of clusters,\
    \ the quality of the clusters is \nmeasured by the Mean Index Adequacy, which\
    \ calculates the average distance between \nthe cluster center and all the other\
    \ data points in that cluster. The smaller the Mean \nIndex Adequacy, the better\
    \ the clustering results. After performing k-means clustering \nusing the appropriate\
    \ number of clusters, the data within each cluster are re-clustered \naccording\
    \ to the temporal attribute of the data. Outliers are then detected by comparing\
    \ \nthe current value with the minimum and maximum data value from each refined\
    \ cluster. \nAn outlier correction method is also considered in that framework,\
    \ though it is by sim-\nple statistical approaches such as imputing the erroneous\
    \ data using the mean, median \nand mode values.\nUnivariate autoregressive models\

    \ environmental data streams. The different models used and compared \nare the\
    \ nearest cluster, single-layer linear network, and multilayer perceptron. The\
    \ near-\nest cluster estimates the next value as the average of k most similar\
    \ (based on Euclidean \ndistance) sensor measurements in the dataset, whereas\
    \ the single-layer linear network \npredicts the next value based on the linear\
    \ combination of the q previous measurements. \nAfter the predictive modelling,\
    \ the next sensor data observation can be classified as \nanomalous by comparing\
    \ it with the threshold calculated by the prediction interval value. \nThough\
    \ it is found that the multilayer perceptron works best in their case study, it\
    \ might \nnot be the case for other applications.\nStatistical generative models\
    \ Statistical generative models are probabilistic models that \nattempt to describe\
    \ how data is generated by learning the statistical distribution of the \ndataset.\
    \ For anomaly detection, Sallans et al. [49] presented a statistical generative\
    \ mod-\nelling technique in which new observations will be compared against, and\
    \ if that new \nobservation has a low probability in that model, then it is counted\
    \ as anomalous. Exam-\nples of statistical generative models used in the paper\
    \ are the Gaussian model, Hidden \nMarkov model, and Histogram.\nGrey prediction\
    \ model Grey systems theory, initially proposed by Deng [91] in 1982, is \ndeveloped\
    \ to cope with the uncertainty of a system and has the advantage of being able\
    \ to \nmodel a discrete time series with a small sample size. It does not require\
    \ prior knowledge \nof the underlying data distribution and requires only a small\
    \ set of training data. In grey \nsystems, some part of the information is known\
    \ and some part is unknown, thus having \nincomplete information. The subsequence\
    \ of the original time series data Z helps predict \nthe future value and can\
    \ be defined as:\nwhere Z(0) consist of the q subsequent observed values up to\
    \ time t and c is a constant \nthat satisfies x(0)(u) + c ≥ 0.\nThe original subsequence\
    \ is firstly smoothed by an accumulate generating operation \n(AGO). The first-order\
    \ AGO is defined as:\nThe data series obtained after AGO smoothing can be modelled\
    \ by a simple first-order \ndifferential equation to give a grey system model\
    \ GM(1,1). The grey differential equation \nis as follows:\nwhere a and b are\

    \ data validation technique involving outliers, \nnoise and constant values using\
    \ grey models where sensor values are compared to the \npredicted value of the\
    \ grey model. The parameters, a and b of the GM(1,1) model is esti-\nmated using\
    \ the recursive orthogonal least-squares estimation algorithm.\nParticle filtering\
    \ Particle filtering is a state estimation technique given partial and noisy \n\
    observations in a dynamic system. It is a Monte Carlo algorithm which uses a set\
    \ of sam-\nples called particles, to represent the posterior probability distribution\
    \ of a stochastic \nprocess. Essentially, the samples from the distribution are\
    \ rendered as particles and each \nparticle has a weight assigned to it that represents\
    \ the probability of drawing that particle \nsuch that it is close to the actual\
    \ observed value. It is thus able to model non-linear or \nnon-Gaussian data.\n\
    Tadić and Ðurović [71] proposed a sensor fault diagnosis technique for bias and\
    \ scal-\ning errors using particle filtering. Particle filtering is used to estimate\
    \ the states of the \nnon-linear model, and new observations are compared with\
    \ the estimated particle to \ndetect whether it is a calibration (bias and scaling)\
    \ fault. This is done by calculating the \nresiduals, which is the difference\
    \ between the particle filter’s estimate and the current \nobserved data and a\
    \ fault is detected if it is more than a user-specified threshold, since \nthe\
    \ residuals are expected to stay close to zero.\nAssociation rule mining Association\
    \ rule mining is a rule-based machine learning algo-\nrithm which can be used\
    \ for error detection and also missing data imputation (see sub-\nsection “Methods\
    \ for correcting errors in sensor data”). Association rule mining detects \nfrequent\
    \ patterns, correlations, or causal structures by revealing how items are associ-\n\
    ated with each other. It helps in predicting the occurrence of a specific item\
    \ based on the \noccurrence of other items and is traditionally used for transactional\
    \ items e.g. product \nplacements in supermarkets. It comprises of the antecedent\
    \ which is something that is \nfound in the dataset, A, and the consequent, B,\
    \ which is something that is found in com-\nbination with the antecedent. In time\
    \ series analysis, an association rule A =⇒ B means \nthat if event A occurs somewhere\
    \ in the dataset, it will most likely be followed by B. \nHowever, to use association\
    \ rule mining in time series analysis, the data has to firstly be \ndiscretized\
    \ into a pattern e.g. a string of symbols.\nThere are many different ways to measure\
    \ association and the most used ones are sup-\nport and confidence. Support is\
    \ the measure of how frequent an itemset (or an event fol-\nlowed by another event)\
    \ is in the dataset whereas the confidence of a rule is the measure \nof how likely\
    \ an event A occurs when event B occurs. For time-series analysis, the sup-\n\
    port of a rule is calculated by:\nwhere k is the length of the discretized pattern\
    \ and |AB| is the length of the pattern AB \n(A followed by B). The confidence\
    \ of a rule is:\nsup(A =⇒ B) = Count of A followed by B occuring\n(k − |AB| +\

    \ method to improve data \nquality by detecting anomalies (unusual change in time\
    \ series patterns) in soil moisture \nprobes. The events are discretized and Dynamic\
    \ Time Warping is used firstly to align \nand compare the events of different\
    \ lengths. The Apriori algorithm is a method that \nreduces the computational\
    \ complexity of finding rules that are above the support and \nconfidence thresholds\
    \ (strong rules) by reducing the number of candidate itemsets. The \nApriori principle\
    \ states that if an itemset is frequent, then all of its subsets must also be\
    \ \nfrequent, and vice versa. By comparing the current observed event to historical\
    \ records \nvia association rules, anomalies are detected.\nBayesian network A\
    \ Bayesian network, also known as a belief network, is a probabil-\nistic graphical\
    \ model that uses a directed acyclic graph to model a set of variables and \n\
    their conditional dependencies based on Bayesian inference. It can be used to\
    \ obtain the \nposterior probabilities of an unknown variable given evidence from\
    \ other measured vari-\nables. The joint probability distribution of the variables,\
    \ A, B, C, and D is represented as, \naccording to the Chain Rule of probability:\n\
    It also follows the Local Markov property, which states that each variable is\
    \ condition-\nally independent of its non-descendants given its parent variables,\
    \ which simplifies the \nChain Rule into a simpler form.\nIbarguengoytia et al. [44]\
    \ proposed a Bayesian network approach for detecting and \nisolating faults e.g.\
    \ outliers in sensor networks for a gas turbine using two Bayesian net-\nworks,\
    \ one for validation and another one for isolation. For validation i.e. detection\
    \ of \nfaults, the fitted Bayesian network model is used to produce an estimate.\
    \ This is done \nby taking the particular sensor as a hypothesis while the other\
    \ related sensors act as the \nevidence. The output, which is the posterior probability\
    \ distribution of the specific vari-\nable, is used to estimate the probability\
    \ of measuring the recorded sensor data value. If \nthe probability is less than\
    \ a user-defined threshold, then it is identified as anomalous. \nIn this case,\
    \ another Bayesian network is created to isolate the fault i.e. to evaluate if\
    \ it \nis an event or an actual anomaly. When a faulty sensor actually exists,\
    \ the fault will be \nmanifested in all the related variables. This can be detected\
    \ in its Markov blanket, which \nis the set of variables that makes the variable\
    \ independent from the others, such as the \nparents, children, and spouses of\
    \ the variable. However, the downside to Bayesian Net-\nworks is that it requires\
    \ expert knowledge to form the probabilistic model of the rela-\ntions between\
    \ the variables.\nEuclidean distance For systems which use PCA for fault detection,\
    \ Hu et al. [42] pro-\nposed a data-cleaning solution using an Euclidean distance\
    \ approach. The data-clean-\ning solution aims to remove outliers in the training\
    \ data as they can strongly affect the \ncovariance structure of the PCA method,\
    \ which in turn affects the performance of the \nPCA-based fault detection. This\
    \ can be done by calculating the z-score of the Euclidean \ndistances of the samples,\
    \ which converts the multivariate problem into a univariate data \ncomparison.\
    \ After standardizing the original data matrix, X , the training data is now \n\

    \ technique using \npredictive polynomial filters to model the behaviour of normal\
    \ sensor data and fuzzy rules \nto detect faults such as outliers, random error\
    \ and sensor failure from the error sequence \ngenerated from the model. Predictive\
    \ polynomial filters divide the signal into small seg-\nments and the small segments\
    \ are modelled by low degree polynomials. Another hybrid \napproach for fault\
    \ detection uses mathematical modelling and Dempster–Shafer Theory, \nproposed\
    \ by Zahedi et al. [75]. It is an online approach for detection drifts and noise,\
    \ \nwhich consist of local and global tiers. For local tiers, fault analysis is\
    \ done and fault vec-\ntors are generated by First Order Linear model. For global\
    \ tiers, fault analysis is done by \nrefining the result from local tiers using\
    \ the spatial correlation between sensors, Demp-\nster–Shafer theory for sensor\
    \ fusion which uses the faulty behaviour information to gen-\nerate a robust estimate\
    \ of the event of interest. The generated reference signal (ground \ntruth) is\
    \ fed back to the local tier.\nUncertainty quantification\nIn order to quantify\
    \ the uncertainty in the sensor data, the following approaches have \nbeen introduced.\n\
    Artificial neural network For the purpose of uncertainty quantification, Wang\
    \ et al. [81] \nused a special type of learning algorithm for artificial neural\

    \ J Big Data            (2020) 7:11 \n \nlayer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs)\
    \ proposed by Guang-Bin Huang et al. [92], \nwhich randomly assigns input weights\
    \ and analytically determines the output weights of \nSLFNs. For an SLFN, the\
    \ output function of the kth hidden node, hk is\nwhere wk and bk are the parameters,\
    \ i.e. the weight and the bias or impact factor of the \nkth hidden node from\
    \ the input node. The activation function, G is a non-linear piece-\nwise continuous\
    \ function such as the Sigmoid function and Fourier function. Thus, the \noutput\
    \ vector of the SLFN with respect to xj , ⃗o(xj) is:\nwhere L is the number of\
    \ hidden nodes and βk is the output weight of node k in the hid-\nden layer to\
    \ the output layer. Eq. 3 can be re-written as:\nwhere O is the output matrix\
    \ of the SLFN, β is the weight matrix of the hidden layer \nnodes to the output\
    \ layer nodes and H is the the hidden layer output matrix. H, given N \ntraining\
    \ samples is composed of the following:\nThe purpose of the SLFN is to minimize\
    \ the cost function ||O − T|| where T is the target \nlabel matrix for the respective\
    \ samples. This allows us to approximate the target class as \naccurately as possible,\
    \ given the samples. However, conventional methods for building \nand training\
    \ neural networks involves gradient-based learning algorithms and the tuning \n\
    of parameters e.g. the learning rate and the number of iterations, which are time-con-\n\
    suming. ELM, on the other hand, is claimed to be able to learn at a much faster\
    \ speed. It \nstarts by randomly assigning values to the weight and bias parameters\
    \ of the input nodes \nto the hidden layer nodes, wk and bk . Then, the hidden\
    \ layer output matrix, H of the \nSLFN is calculated and finally, the output weight\
    \ of the hidden layer nodes to the output \nlayer, β can be mathematically determined\
    \ by finding the least-squares solutions of the \nlinear system:\nwhere H† is\
    \ the Moore–Penrose generalized inverse of H. This removes the need for the \n\
    tuning of parameters and slow learning algorithms, thus speeding up the training\
    \ pro-\ncess of the SLFN.\nWang et al. [81] used this ELM method to evaluate the\
    \ uncertainty in sensor measure-\nments. The ELM model the process in which the\
    \ input values not only consist of raw \nsensor data but also the system state,\
    \ which affects the “ground truth” value. The paper \nstates that the approximation\

    \ a supervised classification framework \nfor automatic quality assessment through\
    \ ensemble Decision Trees and Bayesian Net-\nwork classifiers. The uncertainty\
    \ in the data is represented as quality flags, e.g. “Good \ndata”, “Bad data”,\
    \ “Probably good data” and “Bad but correctable data”. The classifier is \ntrained\
    \ on training data labelled with quality flags by domain experts. However, since\
    \ \nclass imbalance exists (a small number of anomalies), it is trained on under-sampled\
    \ data \nwhich is sampled on clusters obtained from k-means clustering. The sampling\
    \ from the \nclusters formed by the k-means clustering algorithm ensures that\
    \ it is representative of \nthe significant areas of the data. The decisions by\
    \ the base classifiers are fused using a \nmajority voting fusion rule based on\
    \ the mode of the decisions.\nOntology/knowledge-based systems Kuka and Nicklas [26]\
    \ proposed a framework for \nquality indicators for inaccurate and incomplete\
    \ data, and also other quality indicators \nsuch as inconsistent data and timeliness\
    \ using ontology (Sensor Network Ontology) to \nenrich sensor data streams by\
    \ propagating quality semantics. The paper defines the qual-\nity indicators as:\
    \ \n1. Timeliness—the timestamp (start timestamp of the measured data to the time\
    \ when \nthe data reaches the system) divided by the frequency of sensing device.\n\
    2. Accuracy—the variance of the observation and uncertainty, modelled as a mixture\
    \ of \nGaussian models with mean and variance.\n3. Completeness—the number of\
    \ attribute values that are not null, for probabilistic \nattributes i.e. ones\
    \ with the Accuracy property, Cumulative distribution functions are \nused.\n\
    4. Consistency—the similarity of two observations measuring the same variable\
    \ from \ndifferent sensing devices are valid at the same time.\nBamgboye et al. [25]\
    \ also suggested a software architecture solution based on semantic \ntechnology\
    \ for Smart Spaces applications, a part of the Smart Cities ecosystem, which \n\
    improves data stream quality by quantifying inaccurate and incomplete data, (along\
    \ with \nother DQ dimensions e.g. inconsistent data, availability, and timeliness)\
    \ based on expert \nknowledge. The semantic framework aims at homogenizing, annotating\
    \ and reasoning \nover the sensor data and it consists of 4 layers: \n1. Data\
    \ abstraction layer—collects raw data from sensor devices using the Global Sen-\n\
    sor Network middleware and uses static knowledge base to perform filtering of\
    \ data \npoints with quality related problems.\nPage 27 of 49\nTeh et al. J Big\

    \ the 57 publications found in this systematic review, there are ten publications\
    \ \nwhich presented approaches focused on correcting errors in sensor data. The\
    \ methods \nsuggested focus only on correcting errors such as missing data and\
    \ noise but do not \nattempt to detect or quantify them. The correctional methods\
    \ can be termed as missing \ndata imputation, which tries to estimate sensor measurement\
    \ values that are missing \nand de-noising, which tries to remove the noise associated\
    \ with a measurement signal. \nTable  4 shows the different existing methods proposed\
    \ to correct sensor data errors \n(RQ3), which consists of missing data and noise,\
    \ along with the errors addressed, the \ncorresponding papers that proposed the\

    \ 7:11 \nAssociation rule mining Gruenwald et al. [64] came up with an association\
    \ rule mining \napproach called FARM (Freshness Association Rule Mining) to estimate\
    \ missing values in \nsensor data. The central idea of this approach is that more\
    \ recent sensor data values should \nhave a higher contribution to the association\
    \ rule, that will be used for imputing missing \ndata at a specific point in time.\
    \ This is because usually, the current state of a sensed physi-\ncal environment\
    \ is more dependent on its nearest previous states, rather than historical \n\
    states that are obtained long ago. For this purpose, round weights are added to\
    \ each row \nof data. The FARM approach also uses the Apriori Association Rule\
    \ mining algorithm to \nestimate the missing sensor value based on the weighted\
    \ average of the current reading \nof the sensors related to the sensor with the\
    \ missing readings (obtained by the Associa-\ntion Rule Mining). Since the freshness\
    \ concept is introduced, the weighted support and \nconfidence measure is modified\
    \ to the following:\nIn 2009, Chok and Gruenwald [61] refined the approach to\
    \ cope with the complexity \nof data streaming environments using a MASTER-Tree\
    \ data structure. Moreover, Wang \net al. [66] proposed the Time-Space relationship\
    \ and Association Rule Mining method \nfor interpolating missing data in activity\
    \ recognition applications. This differs from the \nFARM approach  [64] as it\
    \ incorporates the spatial correlation between sensor nodes \nusing Pearson’s\
    \ correlation coefficient. This reduces complexity for the Association Rule \n\
    Mining algorithm as it only needs to search for rules from sensors that have a\
    \ correlation \ncoefficient above a certain user-defined threshold.\nD’Aniello\
    \ et al. [62] incorporated association rule mining in their virtual sensor frame-\n\
    work to impute missing data values. Their framework also uses ontology to represent\
    \ \nsensors and data quality along with fuzzy logic to evaluate the quality of\
    \ data received. \nFor example, the sensor is characterized by several quality\
    \ criteria such as those declared \nin the manufacturer specifications e.g. accuracy,\
    \ precision and time since last calibra-\ntion. Users can also specify their quality\
    \ requirements, e.g. requiring response time ≤ \n30 ms ± 2 ms, which can be expressed\
    \ in fuzzy sets, e.g. low response time. The virtual \nsensor thus attempts to\
    \ meet those quality requirements of the users by providing the \nreal reading\
    \ if it meets those criteria or the reconstructed value if the value is missing\
    \ or \nif it does not meet the criteria. The reconstructed value is computed using\
    \ association \nrule mining, which exploits the spatio-temporal correlation among\
    \ sensor readings to \nestimate missing data.\nClustering Tang et  al.  [65] introduced\
    \ a method for missing data imputation using \nfuzzy C-means clustering, which\
    \ has its parameter optimized using Genetic Algorithm. \nThe fuzzy C-means clustering\
    \ algorithm aims to classify data into different clusters to \nmaximize their\
    \ similarity. The weekly traffic volume data from sensors are analysed and \n\
    converted from a vector-based data structure into a matrix data structure. The\
    \ Fuzzy \nC-means clustering model is then built using Genetic Algorithm to optimize\
    \ the mem-\nbership degrees and cluster centers.\nsupw(A =⇒ B) =\n\x1F round weights\

    \  (2020) 7:11 \n \nk-Nearest Neighbour Li and Parker [9] proposed an imputation\
    \ technique for missing \ndata using the Nearest Neighbour approach which takes\
    \ advantage of spatio-temporal \ncorrelations in the sensor data. The method uses\
    \ a kd-tree structure to search for the \nnearest neighbours, formed using weighted\
    \ Euclidean metric which takes into account \nthe percentage of missing data for\
    \ each sensor. Then, the algorithm searches the tree to \nfind the nearest neighbours\
    \ and impute missing values based on the values obtained from \nits neighbours\
    \ (hot deck imputation).\nSingular value decomposition Xu et  al. [67] presented\
    \ a mathematical approach for \nrecovering missing data by representing the spatio-temporal\
    \ sensor data as a multi-\ndimensional tensor (tensors are a multi-dimensional\
    \ extension of a matrix) and intro-\nduced a tensor-based recovery method i.e.\
    \ tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) \nto recover the missing values.\
    \ One of the advantages of this method is that it does not \nrequire non-missing\
    \ training data. The spatial correlations between the sensors are \nfirstly obtained\
    \ using Nearest Neighbour search, which forms a two-dimensional, \nlat × long\
    \ matrix, which represents its latitude and longitude. Apart from the spa-\ntial\
    \ correlation, the temporal correlation is also represented in the same tensor.\
    \ This is \ndone by either formulating it as a three-order, lat × long × hour\
    \ tensor, or a four-order, \nlat × long × hour × day tensor which includes the\
    \ models of the same hours in a day, \nor a five-order, lat × long × hour × day\
    \ × week tensor, which models the similarity of \nthe same hours in different\
    \ days, and the same day in different weeks. After having the \nappropriate tensor\
    \ representation of the data, t-SVD is applied, which recovers the miss-\ning\
    \ values.\nHybrid methods Fekade et  al. [63] proposed a k-means clustering and\
    \ Probabilistic \nMatrix Factorization (PMF) approach to recover missing values.\
    \ Firstly, k-means cluster-\ning is done to divide the data into clusters, and\
    \ within each cluster, PMF is applied. PMF \ndecomposes a single matrix into a\
    \ product of two matrices, which has the property to \nobtain the original matrix\
    \ by computing the product of two matrices, thus enables the \nrecovery of missing\
    \ values in the original matrix.\nDe‑noising\nOther than handling missing data,\
    \ there are two publications found in the 57 selected \nstudies that presented\
    \ noise error correction (de-noising).\nSignal processing Omitaomu et al. [76]\
    \ suggested an approach for de-noising sensor \nsignals using the shrinkage method\
    \ (thresholding) to de-noise high-frequency intrinsic \nmode functions (IMF).\
    \ IMF is an oscillatory signal which is a subset of the frequency \ncomponents\
    \ from the original signal. It can be obtained by applying Empirical Mode \nDecomposition,\
    \ which forms low-frequency and high-frequency IMFs. They can then be \nseparated\
    \ by mutual information. The method studied in this paper only considers appli-\n\
    cations with signals that are corrupted by high-frequency noise, whereby de-noising\
    \ the \nlow-frequency IMF can lead to loss of signal information.\nPage 30 of\

    \ approach for a healthcare application, specifically continuous glu-\ncose monitoring\
    \ systems, using Savitzky–Golay Filter and Simple Multivariate Thresh-\nolding.\
    \ The Savitzky–Golay Filter is a method of data smoothing based on local least-\n\
    squares polynomial approximation whereas the Simple Multivariate Thresholding\
    \ is a \nmultivariate extension of a wavelet de-noising strategy which combines\
    \ univariate (one-\ndimensional) wavelets de-noising algorithms and PCA for dimensionality\
    \ reduction.\nMethods for detecting and correcting errors in sensor data\nThere\
    \ are 15 out of 57 publications that answer both RQ2 and RQ3 simultaneously by\
    \ \ndetecting the error and correcting them. They are usually termed as fault\
    \ detection, iso-\nlation, and recovery. Those introduced methods usually come\
    \ in the form of building a \nnormal behaviour model of the system and comparing\
    \ the new observed values with the \nnormal model. If the current observed data\
    \ is significantly different from the estimated \nvalue, it is identified as anomalous\
    \ and is imputed with the estimated value from the \nmodel. Table 5 shows the\

    \ Liu et  al. [55] presented a PCA-based self-validating \nsensor approach for\
    \ wastewater treatment plants which is able to identify faulty sensors \nbefore\
    \ soft sensor prediction, using the Squared Prediction Error (Q-statistic) and\
    \ Sen-\nsor Validity Index (SVI) [27]. The reconstructed vector, \x1Fx∗ of a faulty\
    \ sensor data can be \nobtained by subtracting the fault from the observed data,\
    \ ⃗x:\nwhere fi is the magnitude of the fault and ⃗ǫi is the direction of the\
    \ fault. Thus, the goal is \nto find fi such that Eq. 4 is most consistent with\
    \ the PCA model. The approach is further \nrefined in [46] where another variation\
    \ of PCA called the Variable Bayesian PCA is sug-\ngested to handle missing data\
    \ in the training set, which can cause over-fitting and locally \nbad optimal\
    \ solutions.\nArtificial neural network Huang [43] introduced a technique for\
    \ sensor fault e.g. outliers \nand bias diagnosis and reconstruction using auto-associative\
    \ neural networks (AANN) \nwhich learn the internal relationship between all inputs\
    \ by encoding (compressing) and \ndecoding (decompressing) the data. Moreover,\
    \ Hou et al. [41] came up with a technique \nfor sensor fault diagnosis and validation\
    \ using rough sets for pre-processing (for dimen-\nsionality reduction and to\
    \ learn classification rules) and artificial neural networks to learn \nthe normal\
    \ behaviour model.\nBayesian network Dereszynski and Dietterich [38] proposed\
    \ a data imputation method \nfor missing values and anomalies based on a dynamic\
    \ Bayesian network which learns the \nnormal behaviour model of sensor measurements.\
    \ The discrepancy between the current \nestimate from the Bayesian network model\
    \ and the current observed reading detects if \nthe reading is anomalous. Since\
    \ a normal static Bayesian network only models the spatial \ncorrelation in the\
    \ dataset, a dynamic Bayesian network is used to also incorporate the \ntemporal\
    \ correlations, since environmental data tend to be temporally correlated e.g.\
    \ pat-\nterns for the 24-h cycle is relatively similar. It relates variables to\
    \ each other over adjacent \ntime steps. Zhang et al. [7], also suggested a data\
    \ reconstruction technique for missing \ndata and inaccurate values in medical\
    \ body sensor networks by learning a Bayesian net-\nwork. The Bayesian network\
    \ learns the probabilistic graphical model and estimates the \nsensor value by\
    \ calculating its conditional probability.\nGrey prediction model Chen et al.\
    \ [30] proposed a self-validating strategy for multi-\nfunctional sensors using\
    \ the Grey Bootstrap model (GM(1,1) with bootstrap) which pro-\nduces a prediction\
    \ model. Current observations will then be compared to the predicted \nvalue to\
    \ detect, isolate, and recover faults such as outliers, bias, constant value,\
    \ and near-\nzero values. Bootstrapping can be done by drawing random samples\
    \ from the dataset \nwith replacement to generate B bootstrap samples and calculate\
    \ the estimate for each \nresample, which gives the approximation of uncertainty.\
    \ The bootstrap method allows \nthe uncertainty to be estimated without having\
    \ prior information about the probability \ndistribution of the measurements.\
    \ For each bootstrap sample, a grey predictive model, \nGM(1,1) is used to predict\

    \ \nThe Dempster–Shafer theory combines evidence gathered from multiple sources\

    \ compared to the bench-\nmark and calibrated via a mapping to the benchmark.\
    \ However, this method requires an \naccurate environment evaluation.\nPrincipal\
    \ component analysis-based hybrid methods Wang et al. [74] presented methods \n\
    for online blind detection and automatic calibration of sensor drifts via signal\
    \ space pro-\njection using Principal component analysis to learn the normal sensor\
    \ behaviour model \nand detect the sensor drifts. Then, Kalman filter is applied\
    \ to estimate the sensor drift \nvalue and the drift value is subtracted from\
    \ the sensor reading to give a better estimate of \nthe true value. Yang et al. [60]\
    \ suggested a data validation technique to detect, identify and \ncorrect faults\
    \ such as bias, drifts, and impacts in a multifunctional sensor. The technique\
    \ \nseparates (using Maximal Information Coefficient) the variables into independent\
    \ and \ndependent variables. Different fault detection, identification, and correction\
    \ techniques \nare used for the two types of variables. For independent variables,\
    \ k-Nearest Neighbour is \nused for fault detection and identification and a Grey\
    \ Predictive Model GM(1,1) is used \nfor fault correction. For related variables,\
    \ kernel Principal component analysis is used for \nfault detection. Iterative\
    \ Reconstruction-Based Contribution is used for fault identifica-\ntion which\
    \ assumes that the sensors are faulty and iteratively reconstruct the data until\
    \ its \nSquared Prediction Error (Q-statistics) is below a certain threshold and\
    \ finally, variables \nin the estimated fault direction are deemed to be faulty.\
    \ For fault correction of the related \nvariables, fuzzy similarity is used, which\
    \ involves reconstructing the faulty variable based \non the relationships between\
    \ the related variables. Furthermore, Uren et al. [72] proposed \na PCA-based\
    \ sensor fault detection, isolation, and reconstruction for bias, drifts, noise,\
    \ \nconstant value, and stuck-at-zero errors. For fault detection, non-temporal\
    \ parity space \nis used to check for inconsistencies among a set of redundant\
    \ sensors. With the assump-\ntion that not all sensors may fail simultaneously\
    \ in a particular channel, the non-temporal \nparity space technique compares\
    \ and validates the sensor measurements with a set of \nredundant measurements.\
    \ An estimate is obtained from the most consistent subset of \nredundant measurements\
    \ of a process variable and the faulty sensor can be identified via \nparity checks.\
    \ Fuzzy rule base is then used for fault isolation and Principal Component \n\
    Analysis is used to model and reconstruct the sensor measurements.\nPage 33 of\

    \ methods Solomakhina et  al.  [51] suggested an approach \nfor detecting and\
    \ correcting anomalous sensor data using Kalman Filter, Autoregressive \nIntegrated\
    \ Moving Average (ARIMA), smoothing operators and knowledge-based systems. \n\
    The errors, e.g. missing data and outliers, are detected using the ARIMA and Kalman\
    \ fil-\nter, and the Knowledge-based system is consulted to confirm the error.\
    \ In the healthcare \ndomain, Feng et al. [31] also introduced a Kalman filter-based\
    \ hybrid approach for sensor \nfault identification and correction for missing\
    \ data, bias, drifts and outliers. The method \nuses Outlier Robust Kalman filter\
    \ (ORKF) and locally-weighted partial least squares (LW-\nPLS) for artificial\
    \ pancreas control systems. Both algorithms are used to model the nor-\nmal sensor\
    \ behaviour to provide a more robust fault detection since one might report an\
    \ \nerror, but the other might not. The ORKF has the advantage of fast detection\
    \ and online \nauto-smoothing i.e. de-noising ability, which works well for short-duration\
    \ errors such as \noutliers. For long-duration errors, such as drifts, LW-PLS\
    \ is more advantageous as it is \nbased on historical data. The errors are then\
    \ replaced by the estimated value which has \nthe highest performance score e.g.\
    \ model accuracy, smoothness from the models.\nDempster–Shafer theory-based hybrid\
    \ method To evaluate the quality of sensor data \nbased on inaccurate and incomplete\
    \ data, (as well as inconsistent data and timeliness), \nHermans et al. [68] presented\
    \ a framework using heuristics in the local and cluster heads, \nand an inference\
    \ engine in the cluster head which fuses correlated sensor readings using \nDempster–Shafer\
    \ theory to arrive at a more accurate estimate.\nTypes of domains\nThe domains\

    There are several publicly available datasets that are used in method evaluation\
    \ and \nare domain-specific. The nine publicly available datasets are: SensorScope\
    \ dataset [93, \n94], which includes the Grand St. Bernard (GSB), FishNet and\
    \ Lausanne Urban Canopy \nExperiment (LUCE) deployments, Intel Berkeley dataset\
    \ [95], University of California \nIrvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository’s\

    \ evaluation and the total number of papers are listed in Table 7. These \ndatasets\
    \ are last searched on May 8th 2019.\nThe following are brief descriptions of\
    \ the publicly available datasets. SensorScope \nhas deployed many outdoor networks\
    \ for environmental monitoring which produced \ndatasets, three of which have\
    \ been used by seven of the selected papers for method \nevaluation. Those publications\
    \ include ones without a specific domain (general \npapers) such as [57] or papers\
    \ that are environmental sensing domain-specific such as \n[38]. The GSB SensorScope\
    \ network has been deployed at the Grand St. Bernard pass, \nlocated at the border\
    \ of Switzerland and Italy, in late 2007 for approximately 1 month \n(September–October).\
    \ It comprises of 23 stations. Another SensorScope network is \nthe FishNet deployment,\
    \ which is deployed 1 month before GSB (August–September) \nfor around a month\
    \ as well, but only with six stations. It is used to monitor a river to \nimprove\

    \ environments better.\nAnother dataset related to indoor environmental monitoring\
    \ is the Intel Berkeley \nResearch Lab dataset. There are six papers in total\
    \ that have used this dataset to test \ntheir proposed methods. The Intel Lab\
    \ data has 54 sensors deployed indoors in the \nlab itself, collecting data about\
    \ the environment such as the temperature, humid-\nity, and light. It also consists\
    \ of the date, time, epoch, sensor ID, and voltage values. \nThe units for the\
    \ data types are also specified, where the temperature is recorded in \ndegrees\
    \ Celsius ( oC ), the humidity is in percentage ( % ), which is the relative humid-\n\
    ity, and the light intensity is measured in Lux. The dataset consists of 2.3 million\
    \ \nreadings, obtained every 30 seconds from the sensors for about a month (February\
    \ \n28th to April 5th 2004). MERLSense is also another environmental sensing dataset,\
    \ \nwhere it captured and recorded motion data. It is also deployed in a research\
    \ lab, and \ndata of the people working in the lab is collected for 2 years from\
    \ March 2006 and \nMarch 2008, totalling up to 50 million raw records from 200\
    \ sensors. However, Wang \net al. [66] has used the temperature attribute to evaluate\
    \ their missing data imputa-\ntion technique.\nThe NAMOS and TasMAN datasets are\
    \ both marine datasets, collected to moni-\ntor marine environments. NAMOS consists\
    \ of several datasets from devices deployed \nby the University of Southern California\
    \ at different locations e.g. buoys, boats and \nweather stations around California.\
    \ It is one of the three datasets, along with the Intel \nLab and SensorScope\
    \ LUCE datasets that Rassam et al. [48] used to evaluate their \nmethod for outlier\
    \ detection. The NAMOS dataset used is from the buoy no. 103 col-\nlected in August\
    \ 2006 in Lake Fulmor. The TasMAN dataset, on the other hand, is \nfrom Sullivans\
    \ Cove, Hobart, Tasmania. The dataset consists of the seawater tempera-\nture\
    \ and conductivity from February 2008 to July 2012. Numenta anomaly benchmark\
    \ \n(NAB) is an open-sourced benchmark for evaluating techniques for anomaly detec-\n\
    tion for streaming data. It provides numerous real-world streaming datasets such\
    \ as \nAmazon’s AWS server metrics, online advertisement clicking rates, temperature\
    \ sens-\ning, and traffic monitoring datasets. The datasets provided by NAB are\
    \ the only ones, \namong the other datasets found in this systematic review, complete\
    \ with labelled \nstreaming data comprising of normal and erroneous measurements\
    \ e.g. spatio-tem-\nporal outliers, noise and drift. It also has a novel scoring\
    \ system called the NAB score, \nwhich takes into account true positives, true\
    \ negatives, false positives, false negatives, \nand windows to reward early detection.\n\
    Moreover, another publicly available dataset comes from the University of Cali-\n\
    fornia, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository. The repository contains a wide\
    \ \nrange of 468 different datasets, from healthcare to games, robotics to social\
    \ science, \nenvironmental sensing and many more. There are two of the selected\
    \ papers [46, 55] \nthat have used water treatment plant dataset from this repository.\
    \ It has 527 sam-\nples and 38 attributes, which consists of the daily measurement\
    \ from sensors in an \nurban wastewater treatment plant. It is a relatively complex\
    \ system, where the aim is \nto predict faults through the operational state of\
    \ the process. Another publicly avail-\nable smart city dataset comes from California’s\
    \ Department of Transportation, who \nreleased their traffic monitoring datasets.\
    \ However, a user has to sign up for a free \nPage 36 of 49\nTeh et al. J Big\
    \ Data            (2020) 7:11 \naccount to access those datasets. It provides\
    \ an extensive traffic monitoring dataset, \nwhere users can choose to obtain\
    \ data from up to almost 100 freeways in Califor-\nnia gathered by 18,305 stations.\
    \ The website also provides real-time information dis-\nplayed on a dashboard.\
    \ The last publicly available dataset found to be used for method \nevaluation\
    \ for one of the 57 selected papers is PhysioNet. It provides healthcare-based\
    \ \nsets of data, which is split into two categories: clinical databases and waveform\
    \ data-\nbases. The former provides data such as demographics, images and vital\
    \ sign meas-\nurements where Zhanget al. [7] used one of the datasets, whereas\
    \ the latter presents \na digitalized signal or waveforms of physiologic data,\
    \ such as the heart monitoring \nelectrocardiogram device signal.\nDiscussion\n\
    In this section, we discuss the challenges found through the systematic review,\
    \ which \naffects the comparability of methods introduced in this research area.\
    \ The evaluation \nof the performances of methods presented in the selected studies\
    \ are done on a wide \nrange of datasets and have different dataset pre-processing\
    \ conditions. This makes it \nimpossible to compare the efficiency of these methods\
    \ just by reading the respective \npublications. Furthermore, there are various\
    \ evaluation metrics used in the literature \nand even within the same problem,\
    \ e.g. outlier detection, the evaluation metrics used \nare different. This shows\
    \ that there is no generally accepted way of comparing differ-\nent methods. An\
    \ analysis of the problems is detailed in the subsections that follow. \n“Datasets\
    \ and error imputation and labelling” section discusses the different datasets\
    \ \nused and their availability online or reproducibility, and the preparation\
    \ or pre-pro-\ncessing of the dataset which includes error introduction for evaluating\
    \ the methods. \n“Evaluation metrics” section, on the other hand, details the\
    \ different evaluation met-\nrics used and the situations they are used in.\n\
    Datasets and error imputation and labelling\nThere are many different datasets\
    \ used in the performance evaluation of methods found \nin the literature. They\
    \ can be categorized into two types of datasets: real-world datasets \nand simulated\
    \ datasets. Real-world datasets consist of data from real-world experiments \n\

    \ contain data that have been synthetically \nproduced. Within those two categories,\
    \ the datasets can be further split into published \nor unpublished datasets.\
    \ Published datasets are datasets that are currently publicly avail-\nable (last\
    \ checked on May 8th 2019) or reproducible datasets, by having the dataset \n\
    itself or source code published online. The published datasets are described in\
    \ “Types of \ndomains” section with respect to their domains. Unpublished datasets\
    \ refer to the data-\nsets that are not currently available publicly or cannot\
    \ be reproduced. Table 8 shows the \ndifferent types of datasets and the number\
    \ of papers that used them for evaluation. Out \nof the 57 final selected publications,\
    \ 52 publications have proper validation and from \nthese, there are a total of\
    \ 72 datasets used for evaluating the introduced algorithms. \nFrom these 72 datasets,\
    \ there are 54 real-world datasets of which only 21 of them are \npublished datasets.\
    \ Furthermore, among the 18 simulated datasets, only two can be \nreproduced as\
    \ the simulator is publicly available. Note, that some papers evaluated their\
    \ \nmethods on more than one dataset, such as the work of Bosman et al. [35],\
    \ who used \nfour datasets: the published real-world datasets Intel Lab and SensorScope\
    \ GSB, an \nunpublished real-world dataset, and a simulated dataset.\nFrom the\
    \ 72 datasets used for method evaluation, it is seen that around 68% of the \n\
    datasets are not published nor reproducible, consisting of both real-world and\
    \ simulated \ndatasets. This makes it hard for the comparison of different methods\
    \ in this research \narea. Besides that, even for literature working on publicly\
    \ available datasets, they have \ndifferent techniques of imputing errors to evaluate\
    \ their suggested methods. For exam-\nple, in anomaly detection, Bosman et al. [35]\
    \ labelled the errors in the Intel Lab and Sen-\nsorScope GSB datasets using a\
    \ semi-automated approach. Anomalies were identified by \nheuristics (e.g. a value\
    \ that is not changing for over ten samples is labelled as a con-\nstant-value\
    \ error), which will then be corrected manually by a person. Rassam et al. [48],\
    \ \non the other hand, also used the Intel Lab dataset and the SensorScope dataset\
    \ (LUCE, \nNAMOS) to evaluate their proposed method but have a different heuristics\
    \ of histo-\ngram-based labelling. They assessed their solution on simulated errors\
    \ whereby they \nartificially injected 100 anomalies. For missing data imputation,\
    \ the Intel Lab dataset has \nalso been used by D’Aniello et al. [62] and Fekade\
    \ et al. [63], where the former simulated \nthe missing errors at 5%, 10%, 20%,\
    \ 30%, 40% and 50% rates and the latter simulated the \nmissing error by making\
    \ 10% of the total data empty.\nOther than having different error injection and\
    \ labelling methods, though even if two \npublications might use the same online\
    \ dataset, it is still not directly comparable as \nthey might have pre-processed\
    \ the dataset. For example, Bosman et al. [36] and Fawzy \net al. [39] both used\
    \ the entire Intel lab dataset for evaluation, though with different \nerror introduction\
    \ techniques, whereas Rassam et al. [48] only used 3 out of the total 54 \nsensor\
    \ nodes. D’Aniello et al. [62] also removed known errors from the dataset before\
    \ \nproceeding to test their missing data imputation methods on a subset (March\
    \ 1st–14th) \nof the Intel Lab dataset. Although the NAB is a unified benchmark\
    \ that provides publicly \navailable datasets complete with labelled errors, it\
    \ is only for the comparison of anomaly \ndetection algorithms. It does not provide\
    \ a benchmarking system for missing data impu-\ntation and fault correction, which\
    \ is the other two main types of errors found in the liter-\nature. There is also\
    \ only one publication [34] among the 52 publications with validation \nthat has\
    \ used this benchmarking system.\nPage 38 of 49\nTeh et al. J Big Data       \
    \     (2020) 7:11 \nIn order to analyse the problem of the availability of the\
    \ datasets used in the literature, \nwe are introducing two data set metrics,\
    \ which are retrieved for each of the 57 reviewed \npublications. The first metric\
    \ is the number Pk of publicly available data sets, which \nhave been used for\
    \ evaluating purposes in the kth paper. The second metric is the total \nnumber\
    \ of data sets Dk , which have been used for the evaluation of algorithms in the\
    \ \nkth paper. Consequently, the difference (Dk − Pk) is the number of datasets,\
    \ which have \nbeen evaluated in the kth paper but are not publicly available.\
    \ However, up to this point, \nour model does not take into account the possible\
    \ influence of open access publications \nof the respective papers on its citation\
    \ rate.\nFigure 5a shows a heatmap of the number of publicly available datasets\
    \ Pk against the \ntotal number of datasets Dk used in the sensor data quality\
    \ literature. The heatmap vis-\nualizes the joint distribution of P = (P1, . .\

    \ to the number of publications that have used the respective \nnumber of publicly\

    \ darker colour (higher numbers) in the lower quadrant shows that \nthe majority\
    \ of the reviewed sensor data quality publications evaluate their methods on \n\
    fewer datasets and more importantly, on datasets that are not publicly available.\
    \ How-\never, a problem found through this systematic review, which is the direct\
    \ comparabil-\nity of the methods introduced, can only be solved if researchers\
    \ in the research area \nevaluate their techniques on the same datasets (given\
    \ the same error injection and pre-\nprocessing conditions). Thus, having used\
    \ publicly available datasets might prove to be \nbeneficial to the research area.\
    \ This prompts for a need to further analyse the effects of \nusing publicly available\
    \ datasets for method evaluation.\nIn order to do so, we are analysing the citation\
    \ rate Rk of the reviewed publications. The \ncitation rate Rk is computed as\
    \ the quotient of the number of citations of the kth paper \nand its years since\
    \ publication. The number of citations for each publication has been \nobtained\
    \ from Google Scholar5 on April 5th 2019. Google scholar was chosen because it\
    \ \ncan be accessed without a license fee. Note, that Google Scholar’s citation\
    \ count includes \ncitations from various sources including self-citations and\
    \ preprint repositories. Thus, \nthe citation count might differ from other citation\
    \ databases, e.g. Web of Science. The \ncitation rates Rk are binned with respect\
    \ to their total number of datasets Di and number \nof publicly available data\
    \ sets Pj and are averaged for each bin:\nFrom this observation, the heatmap in\
    \ Fig. 5b is plotted to study the effects of using \npublicly or non-publicly\
    \ available datasets on the citation rate of a publication. The cita-\ntion rate\
    \ is used to study the effects of using publicly or non-publicly available datasets\
    \ \nas a high citation rate might imply that researchers working on the same research\
    \ area \ncan compare their results with those studies using the same dataset.\
    \ If the dataset is not \npublicly available, it makes it hard for comparison.\
    \ The heatmap shows that the average \ncitation rate for the literature involving\
    \ publicly available datasets tends to be higher. \nTo confirm this observation,\
    \ a Bayesian analysis [104] is carried out to test if there is a \nsignificant\
    \ difference in the citation rate between two groups: the available group, which\

    \ that the mean citation rate of publications, which \nare using public datasets,\
    \ is larger than the mean citation rate of publications, which \nare not using\
    \ public datasets. This suggests that the publicly available datasets are easier\

    \      (2020) 7:11 \nwhereas the latter uses a regression metrics such as root\
    \ mean squared error and mean \nabsolute error that would quantify the difference\
    \ in the estimated value and actual value. \nIn the 39 papers out of the 57 papers\
    \ that have quantitative measurements, Table 10 \nshows the different evaluation\
    \ metrics used in those 39 papers.\nClassification metrics\nRecall, also known\
    \ as sensitivity or true positive rate (TPR), is commonly used in error \ndetection\
    \ to calculate the number of correctly detected faults (TP) over all faults, which\
    \ \nincludes both faults that are correctly detected (TP) and faults that are\
    \ incorrectly \ndetected as a normal data point (FN). It is used as an indication\
    \ of the method’s abil-\nity to detect faults, which places more importance on\
    \ false classification of normal data \npoints, which are supposed to be faults,\
    \ i.e. false negatives. For example, if fault detec-\ntion is being used as a\
    \ data-cleaning solution for the training dataset which will then be \nused for\
    \ some other machine learning methods e.g. for prediction or analysis [31, 42],\
    \ \nincorrectly labelling a fault as a normal data point (FN) might have some\
    \ adverse effect \non the next machine learning model. Other than that, precision\
    \ is also used as a classifi-\ncation metric for fault detection. It is the number\
    \ of correctly identified faults (TP) over \nthe total faults identified, which\
    \ includes both faults that are correctly detected (TP) and \nincorrectly detected\
    \ (FP). It shows how precise the model is, by measuring in terms of \nall the\
    \ detected faults, how many of them are actual faults. Precision differs from\
    \ recall \nas it places more weight on the false positives instead, which is the\
    \ incorrect detection \nof faults. This metric might be used for example, in environmental\
    \ sensing applications \n[38] where it penalizes incorrect fault detection as\
    \ this might lead to waste of manpower, \ncost and time, as a technician might\
    \ be sent out to the deployed sensor to test and cali-\nbrate the sensor device.\n\
    The False Positive Rate (FPR), also known as the Type I error rate, is the probability\
    \ \nof a false alarm. It is the ratio of incorrectly labelling a normal data point\
    \ as a fault (FP), \nover all normal data points, either correctly or incorrectly\
    \ labelled (TN, FP). This metric \nis used when Type I errors (FP) should be given\
    \ higher weights. For example, in [59], \nFPR is used in evaluating a method for\
    \ fault detection of a continuous glucose monitor-\ning device used an artificial\
    \ pancreas system. A continuous glucose monitor should not \nraise too many false\
    \ alarms (FP) as it might cause a panic, or increase the level of distrust \n\
    towards the device. False Negative Rate (FNR), on the other hand, is known as\
    \ a Type \nII error rate or miss rate and it is the number of incorrectly labelled\
    \ faults (FN) over all \nfaults, either correctly or incorrectly labelled (TP,\
    \ FN). For applications which penalize \nType II errors (FN), this metric is used\
    \ to evaluate the proposed method. In industrial \npower plants, faults that are\
    \ incorrectly classified as normal data points (FN) might be \ndetrimental to\
    \ the system, as it might lead to a complete system failure. Thus, papers \nsuch\
    \ as [44] have used FNR as a performance metric for their method, along with FPR.\n\
    Other performance metrics for fault detection includes accuracy, F-score, and\
    \ Mat-\nthew’s correlation coefficient. The accuracy takes into account all four\
    \ categories of \nthe confusion matrix: true positives, true negatives, false\
    \ positives, and false negatives. \nHowever, for imbalanced datasets where the\
    \ class distribution is uneven, the accuracy \nmetric is not an ideal performance\
    \ measure of a model. In sensor data, there might be \nmore normal data points\
    \ than anomalous one, contributing to the true negatives, thus \nPage 43 of 49\n\
    Teh et al. J Big Data            (2020) 7:11 \n \nmaking the accuracy metrics\
    \ unfair for performance evaluation. F-score, on the other \nhand, is a function\
    \ of precision and recall which balances between the two and does not \ntake into\
    \ account the number of true negatives. However, this is also a down-side to the\
    \ \nF-score, as not including the true negatives in the calculation might give\
    \ a misleading \nresult. Moreover, both of the metrics i.e. accuracy and F-score,\
    \ do not take into account \nthe proportion of each category in the confusion\
    \ matrix.\nTo solve this, Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC) is a metric\
    \ that correctly con-\nsiders the ratio of the size of all four confusion matrix\
    \ categories, allowing a higher score \nonly if the model does well on both positive\
    \ and negative categories [106]. It ranges \nfrom −1 to 1, which indicates perfect\
    \ disagreement and agreement between the pre-\ndiction and actual class respectively.\
    \ An MCC score of 0 indicates a by chance result, \nwhich could be achieved by\
    \ simply guessing that there are not any faults at all. Based \non the example\
    \ discussed by Chicco [106], assume that a classifier is trained on a heav-\n\
    ily imbalanced dataset with 95 normal data and 5 anomalous data. Let the normal\
    \ data \nbe the positive class and the anomalous data be the negative class. Thus,\
    \ TP = correct \ndetection of normal data, FP = incorrect detection of fault as\
    \ normal data, TN = correct \ndetection of fault and FN = incorrect detection\
    \ of normal data as fault. Suppose a model \nthat randomly guesses all data points\
    \ as normal is built. Thus, it classifies all points as \npositive and we have\
    \ TP = 95 , FP = 5 , TN = 0 and FN = 0 . Following the formulas for \naccuracy\
    \ and F-score in Table  10, we have Accuracy = 95% and F − score = 97.44% . \n\
    However, this random guessing will be detected by MCC as it will be undefined\
    \ (since \nthe denominator will return 0), giving an indication that the classifier\
    \ is not working as \nintended, opposed to the accuracy and F-score, which gave\
    \ a false illusion that the clas-\nsifier is doing well. In another example, suppose\
    \ now the classifier does classify some \npoints as faults, where TP = 90 , FP\
    \ = 4 , TN = 1 and FN = 5 , but it poorly classifies the \nfaults as it only correctly\
    \ detects 1 out of 5 faults. The accuracy and F-score are still high, \nresulting\
    \ in Accuracy = 91% and F − score = 95.24% . However, the MCC has a value of \n\
    MCC = 0.14 , which shows that it is performing poorly and there is a low correlation\
    \ \nbetween the predicted class and the actual class. Thus, MCC is evidently more\
    \ robust \nthan the other two metrics and should be used more frequently to quantify\
    \ fault detec-\ntion method performance.\nRegression metrics\nThese metrics are\
    \ used in order to quantify the performance of methods for fault correc-\ntion\
    \ or missing data imputation. These metrics include the Mean Squared Error (MSE),\
    \ \nRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Relative\
    \ \nError (MRE). MSE measures the average squared errors of the predicted values\
    \ com-\npared to the true values. However, squaring the error gives more weight\
    \ to large errors. \nIt is more useful when large errors are particularly unacceptable,\
    \ but might underesti-\nmate the model’s accuracy, because one large error might\
    \ increase the MSE significantly. \nRSME is the square root of MSE, which has\
    \ the same units as the quantity plotted on \nthe vertical axis, making it more\
    \ interpretable. Another metric used to evaluate the pre-\ndiction of the model\
    \ is the MAE and MRE. MAE measures the average of the absolute \nerrors between\
    \ the predicted values and true values. It is less sensitive to huge differ-\n\
    ences, unlike MSE or RMSE, as it takes the absolute value, not the square, of\
    \ the errors. \nPage 44 of 49\nTeh et al. J Big Data            (2020) 7:11 \n\
    MRE is similar to MAE, however, every data point is divided by its true value.\
    \ Thus, it \nindicates how large the absolute error is with respect to the size\
    \ of the actual data point. \nHowever, the MRE is problematic for sensor data,\
    \ for which the true measurement value \nmight be zero.\nConclusion\nThis paper\
    \ presents the results of a systematic review of sensor data quality problems.\
    \ \nIt aims to answer the following research questions: what are the different\
    \ types of errors \nin sensor data, how to quantify or detect and correct those\
    \ errors and what domains are \nthe different types of methods proposed in. The\
    \ initial search process resulted in 13,057 \npublications, and by refining the\
    \ search string through topic modelling, the final search \nstring returned 6970\
    \ publications. Through the screening of these 6970 publications, 57 \npapers\
    \ have been selected for data extraction and synthesis. The analysed publications\
    \ \ndiscuss sensor data quality problems that are caused by errors in sensor data\
    \ such as \nmissing data, uncertainty, and faults, which include outliers, bias,\
    \ constant values, stuck-\nat-zeros, and noise.\nResults also show that there\
    \ is a huge variety of methods suggested to detect or \nquantify those errors,\
    \ as well as to correct them. There are 16 different types of meth-\nods presented\
    \ for error detection, which are obtained from 32 papers out of the 57 \nselected\
    \ papers that introduced techniques for the respective problem. The two most \n\
    common approaches are principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural\
    \ net-\nworks (ANN). They are both used to model the normal sensor behaviour and\
    \ the newly \nobserved readings will be compared to the model to determine if\
    \ it is anomalous. Other \ntechniques for fault detection include Ensemble Classifiers,\
    \ Support Vector Machines, \nClustering, and hybrid methods.\nFor error correction,\
    \ there are ten publications that proposed methods for missing \ndata imputation\
    \ and noise correction. The most common missing data imputation tech-\nnique is\
    \ Association Rule Mining, with half of the respective papers proposing variations\
    \ \nof that approach. Other approaches comprise of k-Nearest Neighbor, clustering,\
    \ ten-\nsor-based singular value decomposition, and Probabilistic Matrix Factorization\
    \ (PMF). \nOn the other hand, 15 publications simultaneously address error detection\
    \ and correc-\ntion problems, usually termed as Fault Detection, Isolation, and\
    \ Recovery (FDIR). The \nPCA-based approach is the most common technique for FDIR,\
    \ though there are other \napproaches such as ANN, Bayesian Network, and hybrid\
    \ methods involving Kalman fil-\nter and Dempster–Shafer theory with Ontology.\n\
    However, through this systematic review, there are several challenges that are\
    \ found in \nthis research area. From the two subsections, “Datasets and error\
    \ imputation and label-\nling” and “Evaluation metrics”, it is seen that methods\
    \ from the selected literature were \nevaluated on different datasets, along with\
    \ different pre-processing conditions and fault \ninjection processes. The availability\
    \ and ease of access of the datasets also play an essen-\ntial part in helping\
    \ researchers compare and evaluate their methods with other existing \ntechniques\
    \ for a particular sensor data quality problem. The Bayesian analysis of citation\
    \ \nrates done on the 57 selected papers shows the effects of using publicly available\
    \ datasets \nfor method evaluation. There is a 99.9% probability that papers that\
    \ use publicly availa-\nble datasets have a higher citation rate than those that\
    \ used datasets that are not publicly \nPage 45 of 49\nTeh et al. J Big Data \
    \           (2020) 7:11 \n \navailable, which suggests that more people are able\
    \ to cite and compare their methods \nwith those papers due to their availability\
    \ online and easy access.\nHowever, about 68% of the datasets used for evaluation\
    \ are not publicly available nor \nreproducible. Even for the remaining 23 datasets\
    \ that are used from nine publicly avail-\nable sources, the data pre-processing\
    \ and the error introduction step, whether by man-\nual labelling or simulating\
    \ faults artificially, are done differently. Furthermore, even for \nthe same\
    \ problem domain e.g. fault detection, fault correction, or missing data impu-\n\
    tation, different classification and regression evaluation metrics are being used\
    \ to pro-\nduce a quantifiable performance measure. This provides no formal way\
    \ of comparing the \nmethods. Other than that, the use of Matthew’s correlation\
    \ coefficient is also shown to \nbe more robust towards imbalanced datasets and\
    \ optimistic misinterpretations. How-\never, only one paper from the 57 selected\
    \ papers is seen to have used that performance \nmetric.\nBoth challenges pose\
    \ a problem for this research area as they make it more difficult \nfor researchers\
    \ to compare their proposed methods with existing techniques, which \nmay lead\
    \ to counterproductive results. These two challenges show the need for an open\
    \ \nsource benchmarking system for techniques that solve sensor data quality problems.\
    \ \nThe benchmark should provide datasets complete with all the different types\
    \ of errors \n(that is either labelled or injected artificially) and a proper\
    \ scoring system that uses the \nappropriate evaluation metrics to allow comparability\
    \ of methods in terms of their per-\nformance to solve sensor data quality issues.\n\

    Get rights and content Abstract The objective of this study is to present a fusion
    method based on the Bayesian inference to combine the outputs of various sensors.
    The sensors studied here are aroma sensors, FT-IR and UV spectrometers. The application
    deals with classifying musts of white grapes according to their variety. The fusion
    procedure is not based on the combination of the signals, but of the class assignments
    provided individually by each sensor. Two methods have been developed based on
    the Bayesian inference: the Bayesian minimum error fusion rule and the minimum
    risk rule. The latter involves both experimental knowledge, in computing error
    probability values, and expert knowledge, through the level of error costs. The
    paper presents the mathematical theory concerning the Bayesian approach and the
    results obtained on white grape classification. This effective fusion method leads
    to a significant improvement in the grape variety discrimination: the final misclassification
    error is 4.7%, whereas the best individual sensor (FT-IR) gave a misclassification
    error twice as high, i.e. 9.6%. Bayesian fusion proved to be very well suited
    to the combination of all kinds of analytical measurements or sensors (curves
    or single value outputs), as long as they provide individual classification outputs.
    Furthermore, Bayesian fusion is able to cope with sensors providing large, noisy
    and redundant data as well as sensors showing very dissimilar efficiency levels.

    1. Introduction Due to increasing consumer demand for information on food product
    quality and origin, food industry operators are increasingly anxious to guarantee
    the authenticity of their products. This is even more important for food products
    that are guaranteed to come from a precise geographic origin or to belong to a
    specific vegetal variety. In wine production, variety-based wine is increasingly
    popular with consumers. The ability to guarantee that a grape is, or is not, from
    an expected variety is of prime interest to wine makers. To certify the origin
    or the variety of products, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based technology can
    be used, which gives highly accurate results but is time consuming and costly.
    The alternative is to use several high-speed non-specific techniques and to combine
    their outputs [1]. This alternative is also called sensor or data fusion. Sensor
    fusion is analogous to the cognitive process used by humans to constantly integrate
    data given by their senses to make inferences about the external world. So far,
    in agriculture and food areas, it has been widely applied to robotics [2], [3]
    or remote sensing [4], [5]. Less common is sensor or data fusion applied to food
    quality control [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Ref. [7] propose to organise data fusion
    methods in three levels. 1. The first and most basic level involves concatenating
    raw sensor outputs and then processing them as if they were a single signal. This
    method, called low-level fusion, was applied beforehand to the data presented
    here and did not lead to significant improvement [11]. At present, the main difficulty
    in the application of the low-level fusion method concerns the manipulation of
    raw signals, frequently made up of noisy and redundant data, and which have an
    adverse effect on the classification results. 2. Mid-level fusion consists of
    extracting features from the signal of each sensor and in processing them. Mid-level
    fusion has been quite thoroughly explored [12], [13], [14]. It is particularly
    pertinent when few features are sufficient to provide all the information, for
    instance, when a curve can be modelled by a simple function. Spectra cannot be
    easily modelled using few features. However, “feature extraction” can be carried
    out, for instance, through wavelength selection. We have successfully applied
    it on this databank to FT-IR spectra [11]. 3. High-level fusion is carried out
    on the classification outputs of all the individual sensors. The classification
    output, i.e. the quality class that is assigned to the measured product based
    on the sensor signal, is called the “identity declaration”. In high level fusion,
    the identity declarations of each sensor are combined in order to give the final
    identity declaration. This method can be applied to all types of analytical measurements,
    since it combines class assignments and not analytical signals. Various techniques
    are used in high-level fusion [15]. They are either heuristic (elementary voting
    techniques), based on probability estimation such as the Bayesian inference [16],
    or methods based on possibility (or evidence theory), like the Dempster–Shafer
    theory [17], which is a generalization of Bayesian techniques applied to data
    with a high level of uncertainty. The Bayesian approach has been adopted in this
    study because probability values can be directly computed from the results of
    individual sensor classifications. Thus, this method is particularly well suited
    to pattern recognition issues. However, the Bayesian approach has rarely been
    applied to multisensor fusion [5], [18], [19]. The objective is to present two
    data fusion methods derived from the Bayesian inference. The application deals
    with classifying musts of white grapes according to their variety. The devices
    used are aroma sensors, FT-IR and UV spectrometers. The first step of these research
    studies has been published previously [11]. After a rapid description of material
    and classification methods—which can be fully retrieved in Ref. [11]—this paper
    presents the Bayesian inference used to establish the two multisensor fusion rules:
    the Bayesian minimum error fusion rule and the Bayesian minimum risk fusion rule.
    These high-level fusion procedures are then applied to the identity declarations
    given by the individual sensors. Finally, these results are compared to those
    produced by each individual sensor and the low-level fusion (tested in Ref. [11]);
    a discussion is proposed on the potential of high-level fusion rules to deal with
    an array of sensors capable of generating individual identity declarations. 2.
    Experimental This part is not thoroughly detailed as every experimental point
    has been described in Ref. [11]. 2.1. Samples Must samples (107) of white grapes
    have been collected and divided in four classes with regards to variety: 44 “Sauvignon”,
    14 “Mauzac”, 14 “Colombard” and a fourth class made of 35 samples of various other
    white varieties (“Chardonnay”,“Loin de l''œil”, “Riesling”, etc.). This class
    distribution mirrors the grape population distribution in the south of France.
    Each must sample has been prepared following the French Technical Institute for
    Wines (ITV) methodology [20]. 2.2. Materials 2.2.1. Aroma sensors The aroma sensor
    device was an upgraded LCA 1000 prototype (Midivaleur, Toulouse, France) based
    on five SnO2 gas sensors; the apparatus and the optimal experimental conditions
    used were described in a previous study [21]. The temperature of both measurement
    cell and headspace was set at 60 °C; 50-ml headspace was injected with a syringe
    into the 500-ml cell; then, each sample was measured. The cell was cleaned using
    desiccated and filtered air at a 500 ml min−1 flow rate. The five output curves
    were concatenated after removing the baseline value in order to create a unique
    aroma sensor curve. 2.2.2. FT-IR spectrometer The absorbance signal was acquired
    in the 4000–800 cm−1 range, with a 4 cm−1 acquisition step, using a Fourier-Transform
    mid-Infrared spectrometer (Bruker IFS 25, Bruker, Wissembourg, France). The samples
    were analyzed in an ATR cell (ZnSe, 10 reflections). The reference was distilled
    water. A triangular apodisation function was applied. Spectra were pre-processed
    using genetic algorithms (GA) to select the most suitable wavelengths for pattern
    recognition. 2.2.3. UV spectrometer The UV spectrometer (Secomam S1000, Secomam,
    Ales, F) measures the UV absorbance between 200 and 500 nm, including parts of
    UV and visible bands with a 1-nm resolution. Spectra were pre-processed using
    genetic algorithms. 2.3. Pre-processing and pattern recognition methods In a previous
    work [11], different pre-processing and pattern recognition methods were tested
    to provide the best classification results based on the outputs of each sensor.
    The FT-IR and UV spectra were pre-processed using Genetic Algorithms (GA) in order
    to select the most discriminant wavelength subset from the whole spectra. GA is
    now a well-known evolutionary-based technique used for feature (wavelength) selection
    to improve the robustness and the accuracy of multivariate models based on numerous
    correlated data [22], [23], [24]. A population of chromosomes, representing the
    various selected variable subsets, evolves using crossover during reproduction
    and mutations to produce the feature selection producing the best classification
    model. The genetic algorithm selection procedure as well as the parameters used
    in this application (population size, mutation rate, stop criterion, etc.) have
    been detailed in a previous paper [11]. The most accurate classification technique
    was based on Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression technique, adapted to pattern
    recognition by predicting the four classes of grapes using PLS2 algorithm with
    an exclusive binary coding scheme (four columns with 0:1): PLS-Discriminant Analysis
    (PLS-DA) [25]. For each sample, the PLS-DA model provides four figures, i.e. prediction
    values for the four grape variety classes; the sample is then assigned to the
    class predicted with the highest rate. For each sensor, the global classification
    error rate is computed using a leave-one-out cross-validation. 3. Theory In order
    to combine the information coming from each sensor, Bayesian inference is employed.
    Bayesian methods explicitly use probabilities for quantifying uncertainty in inference
    based on statistical data analysis. In this paper, the Bayesian inference method
    will first be described using one sensor, and then generalized for multisensor
    fusion. The population of the white grape samples is divided into g classes (or
    hypotheses) (k∈G={1,…,g=4} varieties), which are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.
    3.1. Bayesian minimum error fusion 3.1.1. Bayesian minimum error rule The Bayesian
    minimum error rule (Eq. (1)) aims at classifying the sample x into the most probable
    class k, based on its description Pr(k∣x), that is the conditional posterior probability
    of the hypothesis k, after considering the effect of evidence x: (1) This expression
    means that Ŷ(x)=k, for the hypothesis k which maximizes Pr(k∣x), i.e. the sample
    x is assigned to the most probable class (with the highest probability Pr(k∣x)).
    However, the conditional posterior probability Pr(k∣x) is not a direct output
    of the experiments. The aim of Bayes'' theorem is to express it using probability
    values that can be determined from the experiment. Thus, the posterior probability
    Pr(k∣x) is expressed using the probability of evidence x assuming the hypothesis
    k, Pr(x∣k) (also called likelihood function or conditional prior probability),
    the prior probability of the hypothesis k independent of the evidence x, pk and
    the evidence x probability Pr(x), which is independent from the hypotheses. (2)
    Using Bayes'' theorem (Eq. (2)), Eq. (1) becomes: (3) ∀k∈G Pr(x) is constant,
    being independent from the hypotheses.Thus, Eq. (3) gives: (4) As we will see
    in the “Application paragraph” (Section 3.3), Pr(x∣k) can be directly computed
    from the confusion matrix experimentally obtained for each sensor and pk depends
    on the sample population. 3.1.2. Bayesian minimum error fusion rule As far as
    N sensors are concerned, Eq. (4) can be generalized as the Bayesian minimum error
    fusion rule (Eq. (5)). It deals with a set of N identity declarations for sample
    Xt={X1,…,XN}. (5) To express the joint probability of N identity declarations
    (Pr(X1,…, XN)), several aggregation operators can be used (AND, OR, MAX, MIN,
    etc.). Following previous studies [18], [19], we have adopted the intersection
    operator AND. (6) The joint probability can be broken down into conditional probabilities,
    as shown in the following equation: (7) However, if the sensor independence hypothesis
    is assumed, the joint probability is the simple product of the individual probabilities,
    as shown in the following equation: (8) The independence hypothesis between sensors
    measuring similar characteristics of the same samples is difficult to ascertain.
    Nevertheless, Eq. (8) will be used to design a simplified Bayesian model, based
    on the independence assumption. If this model is not efficient enough, a more
    complex model could be built, taking into account conditional probabilities (Eq.
    (7)). Following Eq. (8) which states the sensor independence, Eq. (6) becomes
    the Bayesian minimum error fusion rule: (9) 3.2. Bayesian minimum risk fusion
    rule 3.2.1. Bayesian minimum risk rule The assignment rule based on Bayesian minimum
    risk does not attempt to minimize the classification error but the consequence
    of this error, i.e. the risk induced by the error. For instance, if you classify
    mushrooms in toxic/non-toxic classes, the risk is very high when a toxic mushroom
    is assigned to the nontoxic class. The more serious the consequence of affecting
    a sample belonging to class k, to class h, the higher the risk value C(k,h). The
    risk function is defined as follows: (10) The Bayesian minimum risk rule consists
    of minimizing the error risk average on the g classes: (11) When applying Bayes''
    Theorem (Eq. (2)), Eq. (11) leads to the Bayesian minimum risk classification
    rule involving prior probabilities, able to be applied: (12) where Pr(x∣k) is
    obtained with the confusion matrix and ph is determined by the structure of the
    population. 3.2.2. Bayesian minimum risk fusion rule In the same way as before,
    Eq. (12) can be generalized to N sensor measurements. If the same intersection
    operator is used to combine the conditional probabilities, Eq. (12) becomes: (13)
    The error risk C(k,h) is the same whatever the sensor used. Assuming the sensor
    independence, Eq. (8) stands and then Eq. (13) is changed into Eq. (14), i.e.
    the Bayesian minimum risk fusion rule: (14) 3.3. Application example 3.3.1. Conditional
    probability assessment To apply the Bayesian rules, the class probabilities pk
    and the likelihood values Pr(h∣k) must be assessed. Pr(h∣k) is based on the error
    frequency supplied by the individual sensor classification results. These results
    are gathered in a “confusion matrix”, in which each element (h,k) is the number
    of samples belonging to the class k and assigned to the class h for each of the
    three sensors (aroma sensors, FT-IR and UV spectrometers); these confusion matrices
    are given in Ref. [11]. All the likelihood values are computed by dividing the
    value of (h,k) by the class size. They are all assembled in a “Causality Matrix”
    Mi={Pr(Xi∣k)}; an example is shown in Table 1. The causality matrices computed
    for the three sensors are given in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4 based on the results
    of Ref. [11]. Table 1. Causality matrix Mi, for the sensor i Empty Cell Real classes

    the Bayesian minimum risk fusion rule (Eq. (14)) requires the definition of classification
    error risks C(k,h). These risks, also called costs, are determined using the expert
    knowledge about the problem being considered. The main goal of this classification
    is to distinguish the “Sauvignon” variety from all the others, since it is the
    most appetizing and expensive of all the grape varieties tested. Thus, the most
    important point is to avoid mistaking grapes from all other varieties ( ) with
    that of the “Sauvignon” (Sa); therefore, the risk is very high =100 in Eq. (14).
    But it is also important to recognize the “Sauvignon” samples (cost effectiveness),

    results provided by the FT-IR and UV spectrometers, which are the discriminations
    based on the spectra pre-processed by genetic algorithms (cf. Fig. 1). Second,
    the aroma sensor classification is combined with them, whereby three-sensor fusion
    is obtained. All the individual classification results as well as the sensor fusion
    results are gathered in Fig. 1. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. White

    rule The Bayesian minimum error fusion rule (Eq. (9)), when applied to the FT-IR
    and UV identity declarations, produces different decisions displayed in the “decision
    matrix” (Table 6). When there is a conflict between their decision, the FT-IR
    judgement is given more weight (10 white boxes) than the UV one (1 gray box).
    This is due to the difference between the individual classification performances:
    the error rate of variety discrimination using FT-IR data is 9.6%, whereas it
    is as high as 22.9% with UV data (cf. Fig. 1). Thus, confidence in the FT-IR decision
    is higher. Table 6. Decision matrix computed by the Bayesian minimum error fusion
    based on FT-IR and UV spectra The empty box (∅) corresponds to a case that never
    happens in this prediction procedure. aAttribution that is altered by the introduction
    of error risks. This Bayesian minimum error fusion obviously improves the grape
    classification, achieving a 6.5% error rate, with seven misclassified samples
    among 107 (cf. Table 7). Table 7. Confusion matrix of the FT-IR and UV spectra
    fusion based on Bayesian minimum error rule 4.2. Spectral fusion based on Bayesian
    minimum risk rule Even though sensor fusion leads to a significant improvement
    compared to individual classification error rates, there remains one “Sauvignon”
    sample misclassification and three “Other varieties” samples which are affected
    to the “Sauvignon” class. The involvement of classification error costs in the
    Bayesian minimum risk fusion rule (Eq. (14)) should rule out this type of error,
    which induces severe consequences (and thus high error costs, cf. Eq. (15)). In
    fact, the introduction of risks in the decision rule alters only one assignment:
    when the FT-IR measurement assigns the sample to the “Sauvignon” class and the
    UV indicates that it belongs to the “Other varieties” class, then the decision
    based on the sensor fusion agrees now with the UV spectra (* in Table 6). The
    misclassification of non-“Sauvignon” samples to the “Sauvignon” class is therefore
    diminished. Table 8 shows the difference induced by this decision change in the
    grape classification: the global error rate is the same, but no “Other varieties”
    sample is attributed to the “Sauvignon” class (gray box); on the contrary, three
    “Sauvignon” samples are not recognized any longer (black box). Table 8. Confusion
    matrix of the FT-IR and UV spectra fusion based on Bayesian minimum risk rule
    In conclusion, in the classifications established by the two Bayesian rules, six
    samples appear to be ambiguous (black boxes in Table 7, Table 8). In reality,
    three samples belong to the “Sauvignon” class and the three others to the “Other
    varieties” class; they are all assigned to the “Sauvignon” class by the FT-IR
    sensor and to the “Other varieties” class by the UV one. Thus, the present Bayesian
    rules will inevitably misclassify three samples (whatever the sensor fusion decision).
    4.3. Spectral and aroma sensor fusion based on Bayesian minimum error Although
    insufficient for grape variety classification, aroma sensors might improve the
    high-level fusion decision based on FT-IR and UV sensors. Introducing aroma sensor
    identity declaration in the final decision alters only two decision cases which
    concern the fusion carried out on the spectral data alone (Table 9). These two
    changes slightly improve the classification error rate, which falls to 4.7%, thanks
    to two additional samples correctly classified. Table 9. Confusion matrix of the
    aroma sensor, FT-IR and UV data fusion based on Bayesian minimum error rule All
    the “Sauvignon” and “Mauzac” samples are now accurately identified. However, three
    samples belonging to “Other varieties” are still affected to the “Sauvignon” class,
    as in the case where only the spectrometer results and the Bayesian minimum error
    rule were combined (Section 4.2). This problem should be overcome when the minimum
    risk rule is applied. 4.4. Spectral and aroma sensor fusion based on Bayesian
    minimum risk The aroma sensor introduction in the Bayesian minimum risk classification
    leads to a 5.6% error rate (cf. Table 10). Table 10. Confusion matrix of the aroma
    sensor, FT-IR and UV data fusion based on Bayesian minimum risk rule The introduction
    of classification error costs alters some sample attributions with respect to
    the Bayesian minimum error decision. No sample is misclassified in the “Sauvignon”
    variety, thanks to the high cost associated with this kind of mistake, whereas
    four “Sauvignon” samples are affected to the “Other varieties” class. 5. Discussion
    and conclusion High-level multi-sensor fusion significantly improves the white
    grape must variety classification with regards to individual discriminations.
    The error rate falls to 4.7% or 5.6%, respectively, for the Bayesian minimum error
    fusion or the Bayesian minimum risk fusion. Although olfaction does not seem to
    be the best way to discriminate grape varieties—and therefore the “Sauvignon”
    flavour—the adjunction of the aroma sensor identity declaration slightly improves
    FT-IR and UV spectral classification efficiency. Thus, unlike with low-level fusion,
    the combination of data coming from rather inefficient sensors (in this case,
    aroma sensors) does not worsen the overall performance (cf. Fig. 1). The aroma
    sensor even improves (although only slightly) fusion results, whereas the addition
    of its signals in low-level fusion completely disabled the discrimination outputs.
    Accordingly, this high-level fusion procedure is very well suited to combining
    the outputs of all sensors, even those with very divergent performance levels,
    since the probability assessment reflects the confidence attached to each sensor
    (the more accurate the sensor, the more the fusion process relies on its classification
    results). High-level fusion is definitively better suited to white grape variety
    classification than the low-level one; this assumption can be generalized to most
    of the discrimination problems based on analytical methods or sensors providing
    numerous noisy and redundant data as well as dissimilar efficiency levels. In
    this pattern recognition application, the unbalanced class size might have enhanced
    the problems linked to noise and redundancy. Furthermore, the high-level fusion
    process can be applied to all kinds of analytical measurements capable of providing
    identity declarations. Moreover, the introduction of expert knowledge using classification
    error costs is an original and important step forward, which combines experimental
    and expert information. The Bayesian minimum risk rule makes the discrimination
    more specific, by allowing some kinds of errors and forbidding others. This risk
    assessment is based on expert knowledge. This would be particularly suited for
    an authentication process using different analytical techniques. For instance,
    when dealing with white grape variety classification, “Sauvignon” was the most
    important variety; thus, the first- and second-order errors in “Sauvignon” variety
    discrimination had to be avoided. The risk values must be carefully adjusted,
    since a too high-risk value can lead to systematically avoiding assigning grapes
    to the “Sauvignon” class. During the Bayesian inference development, the sensor
    independence hypothesis has been assumed in order to simplify the joint probability
    computation of the different sensor measurements. Data correlation analysis showed
    that small wavelength bands of UV and FT-IR spectra are redundant. However, since
    the classification results based on this “simplified” model are very satisfying
    (4.7% error rate), only slight improvements could be expected from a more complex
    model. In a further study, Bayesian inference application to fusion processes
    might be somewhat improved in three ways: 1. in taking into account the conditional
    probability values with regards to all the sensors involved in the fusion to express
    the joint probability; 2. in adjusting more accurately the decision to each sample.
    The current sensor–fusion decisions were established in a global and Boolean way
    by using the whole database with a 0:1 classification, once and for all the samples.
    However, every sample is assigned to a class by each sensor with a decimal number
    prediction (not a 0:1, but for e.g. 0.2 or 0.8). Consequently, it would make good
    sense to allow for the sensor classification confidence for each sample, that
    is the membership level to every class instead of a simple Boolean assignment;
    3. in selecting the best suited aggregation operator used to combine the likelihood
    values of the different sensors , with regards to the classification problem.
    These different generalization procedures of the current Bayesian fusion rules
    can help in improving the classification results in very complex discrimination
    issues. Acknowledgements This work received financial support from Association

    Metrics Abstract: The aim of this paper is to show that Dempster-Shafer evidence
    theory may be successfully applied to unsupervised classification in multisource
    remote sensing. Dempster-Shafer formulation allows for consideration of unions
    of classes, and to represent both imprecision and uncertainty, through the definition
    of belief and plausibility functions. These two functions, derived from mass function,
    are generally chosen in a supervised way. In this paper, the authors describe
    an unsupervised method, based on the comparison of monosource classification results,
    to select the classes necessary for Dempster-Shafer evidence combination and to
    define their mass functions. Data fusion is then performed, discarding invalid
    clusters (e.g. corresponding to conflicting information) thank to an iterative
    process. Unsupervised multisource classification algorithm is applied to MAC-Europe''91
    multisensor airborne campaign data collected over the Orgeval French site. Classification
    results using different combinations of sensors (TMS and AirSAR) or wavelengths
    (L- and C-bands) are compared. Performance of data fusion is evaluated in terms
    of identification of land cover types. The best results are obtained when all
    three data sets are used. Furthermore, some other combinations of data are tried,
    and their ability to discriminate between the different land cover types is quantified.

    1669 Full Text Views Abstract Authors References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract:
    In most data fusion systems, the information extracted from each sensor (either
    numerical or symbolic) is represented as a degree of belief in an event with real
    values, taking in this way into account the imprecise, uncertain, and incomplete
    nature of the information. The combination of such degrees of belief is performed
    through numerical fusion operators. A very large variety of such operators has
    been proposed in the literature. We propose in this paper a classification of
    these operators issued from the different data fusion theories with respect to
    their behavior. Three classes are thus defined. This classification provides a
    guide for choosing an operator in a given problem. This choice can then be refined
    from the desired properties of the operators, from their decisiveness, and by
    examining how they deal with conflictive situations. Published in: IEEE Transactions

    \ more industrialized and intensive due to the rising demand for food in quality\
    \ and quantity. Agricultural\nmodernization will be made possible by the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT), a technology with a great promise for revolutionizing the\n\
    industry. Agricultural products will be in high demand by 2050 due to a 30% increase\
    \ in the global population, so there is a\nneed to devise new mechanisms for agriculture,\
    \ and smart agriculture is one of those mechanisms; however, smart agriculture\n\
    needs to be explored further to realize its potential fully. So, to explore the\
    \ potential of this ﬁeld, the researchers have used a\ncorpus that is extracted\
    \ from the Scopus database from the year 2008 to the year 2022 and applied the\
    \ LDA technique. A\ncorpus of 4309 articles was selected from the Scopus database\
    \ to apply the latent Dirichlet analysis (LDA) model to predict\nresearch areas\
    \ for smart agriculture. Using IoT technology, farmers and producers may better\
    \ manage their resources, such as\nfertilizer consumption and the number of trips\
    \ made by farm vehicles, while minimizing waste and maximizing productivity,\n\
    including water, electricity, and other inputs. This data-driven experimental\
    \ study identiﬁes smart agriculture research trends\nby implementing a topic modeling\
    \ technique previously used in smart agriculture. The authors have created seventeen\
    \ research\nthemes in smart agriculture based on the LDA topic modeling. This\
    \ analysis suggests that the indicated areas are in the growth\nphase and require\
    \ further research and exploration.\n1. Introduction\nDigital technologies like\
    \ the Internet of Things (IoT) are\nreshaping agriculture. When it comes to farming,\
    \ what is\nIoT? The IoT connects “dumb” devices. IoT is all about data\n[1]. Data\
    \ is becoming a valuable resource for our world.\nFarmers may become more intelligent\
    \ and safe by using data\nfrom gadgets to adapt to changing conditions more readily\n\
    and farm more eﬃciently [2]. To free up resources, farmers\ncan use the ability\
    \ to monitor agricultural conditions and\ninfrastructure from afar [3]. Many sectors\
    \ and industries\nhave adopted IoT to reduce errors and improve performance\n\
    in manufacturing, energy, health care, and communication\n[1]. Farm devices can\
    \ collect and deliver data remotely to\ntheir owners using IoT.\nFarmers can save\
    \ time and money using IoT to keep tabs\non-farm operations and eﬃciency, make\
    \ more informed deci-\nsions about boosting productivity, and respond more quickly\n\
    to changing conditions. In this case, it is putting data ahead\nof the farmer’s\
    \ intuition [2]. A trough’s water supply, the\namount of fertilizer to use on\
    \ a crop, and which ewe to check\nwhen lambing are all things a farmer could know\
    \ about.\nSmart agriculture is necessary since 70% of the farming\ntime is spent\
    \ monitoring and analyzing crop status rather\nthan performing actual ﬁeld labor\
    \ [3]. Given the industry’s\nsize, it needs various technology and precise solutions\
    \ to\nensure sustainability while reducing environmental damage.\nSensors and\
    \ communication technologies have provided\nfarmers with a remote sight of their\
    \ ﬁelds, allowing them\nto watch what is happening without leaving home. Wireless\n\
    sensors make monitoring crops in real-time with greater\nprecision and, more importantly,\
    \ detecting the early stages\nof undesirable conditions easier [4]. This is why\
    \ “smart agri-\nculture uses innovative equipment and kits from seeding to\nHindawi\n\
    Journal of Sensors\nVolume 2022, Article ID 5442865, 19 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2022/5442865\n\
    crop harvesting, storage, and transportation. The operation is\nsmart and cost-eﬀective\
    \ due to its accurate monitoring capa-\nbilities and prompts reporting using a\
    \ variety of sensors. Var-\nious autonomous tractors, harvesters, robotic weeders,\
    \ drones,\nand satellites supplement agriculture equipment [5]. Sensors\ncan be\
    \ instantly deployed, started collecting data, and made\navailable for further\
    \ online study. By enabling precise data col-\nlection at each area, sensor technology\
    \ allows crop and site-\nspeciﬁc agriculture”. IoT and its apps are only scratching\
    \ the\nsurface of what they can do and have yet to impact people’s\nlives signiﬁcantly,\
    \ and everyone can see this. However, given\nthe recent rise in IoT technology\
    \ in agricultural applications,\nwe can expect it to play a signiﬁcant role. Figure\
    \ 1 summarizes\nthe key factors driving agricultural technology.\nThere are reasonable\
    \ eﬀorts to emphasize the importance\nof IoT in agriculture; most published work\
    \ [6] focuses solely\non applications. However, in light of the most recent facts\n\
    and data, most current publications either give little insight\nor place a limited\
    \ emphasis on diverse IoT-based designs, pro-\ntotypes, advanced approaches, IoT\
    \ for food quality, and other\nfuture issues. The current state of IoT-based agriculture\n\
    research is examined in this paper. Farmers are either delaying\nor refusing to\
    \ change their traditional techniques, which might\nfurther depress India’s GDP.\
    \ Recently skilled migrants from\nall across India who returned to their homelands\
    \ during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic selected farming as a profession and\nhad no plans\
    \ to return. These migrants may move closer to\nsmart agricultural systems since\
    \ it takes less time to persuade\nthem to use them than traditional farmers.\n\
    (i) Remote monitoring of agricultural infrastructure\nand conditions can save\
    \ farmers time and labor by\nreducing the frequency of on-site ﬁeld inspections\n\
    (ii) Farmers beneﬁt from data analysis\n(iii) Gaining insights from real-time\
    \ data throughout a\nvalue chain allows farmers to respond faster to\nmarket requests\n\
    (iv) The food manufacturing process should improve\neﬃciency to lower food waste,\
    \ speed up the time\nto market, and improve traceability. This will allow\nus\
    \ to demonstrate to our consumers that our food is\nsafe and sustainable\n(v)\
    \ Research, development, and adaptation to new\ntechnologies ensure continued\
    \ productivity and\ninnovation\nThe ﬁrst objective of this study is to do a meta-analysis\n\
    of the collected corpus. The second objective is to forecast\nthe present research\
    \ areas and trends as 2, 5, and 10 topics,\nas highlighted in Table 1. The third\
    \ objective is to examine\nin-depth the current research trends to assist future\n\
    researchers in determining the correct research directions\nin the ﬁeld of smart\
    \ agriculture.\n2. Review of Literature\nIoT is revolutionizing agriculture by\
    \ bringing together vari-\nous approaches, such as accuracy and conservative farming,\n\
    to help farmers overcome obstacles in the ﬁeld. Jayaraman\net al. [7] discussed\
    \ using IoT, cloud computing, mobile\ncomputing, and smart agriculture to develop\
    \ a “phononet”\nsystem, an open system of wireless sensors that share infor-\n\
    mation and communicate. For many years, devices presently\nlabeled as IoT have\
    \ been deployed in agriculture. The Bosch\ntechnology corporation provides IoT-based\
    \ data manage-\nment strategies to monitor agricultural yield and diseases\n[8].\

    \ [9]. As part of the MIT Media\nLab Open Agriculture Initiative, Google has shared\
    \ its vision\nfor a more sustainable food system [10]. For eﬃcient seed\nplanting,\
    \ “sensors and vision-based technology” help deter-\nmine the distance and depth.\
    \ An autonomous robot named\nAgribot is being developed to sow seeds using sensors\
    \ and\na vision-based [11]. Technology and economic sustainability\ngo hand in\
    \ hand. A study was conducted in Pakistan to\ndetermine the commercial viability\
    \ of a proposed crop\ninsurance plan and assess the demand for crop insurance\n\
    in various ﬂood-prone rural districts of Khyber Pakh-\ntunkhwa Province [12].\
    \ Additional research revealed that\nfarm households in the study area faced several\
    \ barriers\nto adapting to climate variability, including a lack of labor,\nan\
    \ insecure land tenure system, a lack of market access,\npoverty, a lack of governmental\
    \ support, a lack of access\nto assets, a lack of water sources, a lack of credit\
    \ sources,\nand a lack of knowledge and information [13]. One study\nfound a link\
    \ between poverty reduction and natural and\nsocial capital for sustainable livelihood.\
    \ The research\nprovides empirical and quantitative evidence on poverty\nalleviation,\
    \ and the conclusions will improve agricultural\nhouseholds’ sustainability [14].\
    \ A study also uses natural\nand agricultural resources in Northwestern Pakistan\
    \ to\ncreate a livelihood vulnerability index (LVI), LVI-IPCC,\nand livelihood\
    \ eﬀect index [15].\nFurther, several noncontact sensing methods for deter-\n\
    mining the seed ﬂow rate are proposed in [16], “where the\nsensors were equipped\
    \ with LEDs, infrared, visible light,\nlaser-LED, and a radiation reception element”.\
    \ The output\nvoltage ﬂuctuates depending on how the seeds move through\nthe sensor\
    \ and band of light rays and how the shades fall on\nthe reception parts [17].\
    \ Therefore, the seed ﬂow rate is cal-\nculated based on the signal information\
    \ about the passing\nseeds. Researchers oﬀer an expert system for evaluating the\n\
    viability of agricultural land in a 2019 study by combining\nsensor networks with\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence systems such as\nneural networks and multilayer perceptron\
    \ [18]. The pro-\nposed method is intended to assist farmers in categorizing\n\
    agricultural land for cultivation into the most suitable, suit-\nable, somewhat\
    \ suitable, and unsuitable categories. In a\nrecent study, researchers used citrus\
    \ fruits data labeled by a\ndomain expert with four severity levels (high, medium,\n\
    low, and healthy) to train a deep neural network (DNN)\nmodel to detect disease\
    \ by severity [19]. The model has a\n98% likelihood of predicting low severity\
    \ and a 98% chance\nof predicting high seriousness. In a subsequent study, the\n\
    author takes advantage of blockchain’s potential beneﬁts,\ncombines it with SDN,\
    \ and provides justiﬁcation for worries\nabout energy consumption and security\
    \ [20]. In the most\nrecent survey, authors applied the same blockchain technology\n\
    integration technology to diﬀerent platforms. LDA was used\nto anticipate blockchain\
    \ research trends. The researchers have\npredicted 17 scientiﬁc trends that deserve\
    \ more attention.\nAccording to the literature, LDA approaches anticipate smart\n\
    agriculture research trends [21]. The researcher created a\nnovel routing protocol\
    \ for IoT networks with a cluster topol-\nogy using a blockchain-based architecture\
    \ for the SDN con-\ntroller. The research concepts of the existing state of the\
    \ art\nand its diﬀerentiation from the current state are represented\nin Table\
    \ 2.\n3. Topic Modeling\nData mining is an emerging ﬁeld to extract data from\n\
    unstructured formats. Topic modeling is a powerful tech-\nnique in text mining\
    \ in natural language processing to\nexplore the relationship between the data\
    \ and collected doc-\numents [22]. This technique is used by various researchers\
    \ in\ntheir native ﬁelds, like medical, semantic analysis [23], and\nengineering\
    \ [24], to conclude the relationship between the\ndocuments and topics. Techniques\
    \ like latent Dirichlet allo-\ncation (LDA), nonnegative matrix factorization\
    \ (NMF),\nlatent semantic analysis (LSA), parallel latent Dirichlet allo-\ncation\
    \ (PLDA), and Pachinko allocation model (PAM) were\nused in the topic modeling;\
    \ among all, LDA is intensively\nused by researchers. The topic modeling technique\
    \ is similar\nto the dimensionality reduction technique used for numeri-\ncal\
    \ data. A bag of words (BOW) is created from the dictio-\nnary of words, and topic\
    \ modeling extracts the required\nfeatures from this BOW. The words contained\
    \ in the corpus\nare viewed as a signiﬁcant feature in NLP.\nNLP considers each\
    \ word as a feature to train the model.\nThis technique helps us ﬁnd the right\
    \ content instead of ana-\nlyzing the accurate data. LDA is used to attain a relationship\n\
    among the documents in the collected dataset, and results\nTable 1: Continued.\n\

    [25] is used to estimate the similarities from the corpus.\nUsually, the top few\

    \ LDA fol-\nlows the concept of probabilistic distribution, so each docu-\nment\

    \ phrases identiﬁed were “IoT agricul-\nture”. Scopus is considered the most extensive\
    \ database for\npublished articles globally. The string is run on the Scopus\n\
    platform, and 4803 articles were extracted from the Scopus\ndatabase. The speciﬁc\

    5\nJournal of Sensors\nFurther processing required inclusion and exclusion cri-\n\
    teria to ﬁnalize the corpus, so, for inclusion criteria, we con-\nsidered the\
    \ research papers published in English only. Then,\nthe studies concerning IoT\
    \ agriculture were only considered.\nUnder the exclusion procedure, we excluded\
    \ and removed\nthose studies published in diﬀerent native languages. In\naddition,\
    \ studies having missing information like author,\nabstract, title, and year were\
    \ excluded from the corpus. After\napplying the requirements, 4309 studies were\
    \ considered for\nthe current research. Figure 3 represents the year-wise\ngrowth\
    \ in article publication in IoT agriculture. It is clear\nfrom Figure 3 that after\
    \ 2015 there has been tremendous\ngrowth in publications. The leading publication\
    \ is in 2021,\n26.43% of the total corpus; in 2020, 21.95% of an article\nwas\
    \ published. In 2022 as per data, there is 0.07% publica-\ntion, which can be\
    \ increased by the end of the year.\nThis area of research is published in various\
    \ reputed\njournals. Some top-rated journals or dominating journals\nin IoT agriculture\
    \ are shown in Figure 4. Dominating jour-\nnal\nanalysis\nshows\nmaximum\nparticipation\n\
    from\nthe\nAdvances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, which has\n134 articles\
    \ having 0.031%, and this journal belongs to\nSpringer, having H-Index 48 and\
    \ 0.66 as its impact factor.\n4.2. Preprocessing. It is a preliminary step that\
    \ processes the\ndataset or the information collected. The objective of pre-\n\
    processing is to discard the extraneous information inside\nthe information. Preprocessing\
    \ removes unwanted words\nand characters from the accumulated or collected corpus\n\
    and improves the dataset’s quality. As a result, the proﬁle\nof further processing\
    \ becomes more accurate and acceptable.\nIn the collected corpus, the author used\
    \ four types of data for\nLDA modeling: title of the paper, year of publication,\
    \ journal\nof published article, abstract, and keywords of the docu-\nments. Further,\
    \ abstract and keywords are combined under\nthe same column. A sample of the loading\
    \ corpus is shown\nin Table 3.\nThe ﬁrst step to performing on the uploaded corpus\
    \ is to\ntoken the words so that all the abstracts per title are toke-\nnized\
    \ into tokens. The generated tokens are then trans-\nformed into lowercase letters\
    \ for each document. In\ntokenization, the focus is on removing the punctuation\n\
    marks, single characters, and other special characters like\n“;”, “,”, “.”, “/”,\
    \ “\\”, “brackets”, “!”. Further, any equation or\nformula used in the abstract\
    \ was removed. Also, the numer-\nical values were eradicated to get a full-ﬂedge\
    \ textual token\n[28]. Finally, after tokenization, the words which have no\n\
    meaning are removed. The stop words are the commonly\nused words such as “the”,\
    \ “if”, “but”, “a”, or “an”. These\nwords take up space in our corpus and consume\
    \ valuable\nprocessing time. Thus, it becomes crucial to remove these\nstop removals,\
    \ and here in our experimentation, we have\nused Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).\
    \ This toolkit has\nstop words stored in more than sixteen languages. Here,\n\
    the English-language stop words in the NLTK library and\nother phrases used to\
    \ build the corpus were removed from\nthe corpus [29].\nFurther, stemming is reducing\
    \ a word to its word stem.\nStemming is essential in natural language understanding\n\
    and natural language processing, endeavoring to extract\nthe root or core word\
    \ that is usually appended with the\nEnglish suﬃxes and preﬁxes. It erases all\
    \ the extraneous\nparts in the word and sources out the accurate, meaningful\n\
    word. For example, use is the core word that can be\nextracted by stemming the\
    \ word useless, useful, and uses.\nTo prepare an adequate corpus, words stem from\
    \ their orig-\ninal form using the Snowball stemmer algorithm [30], and\nthe resulting\
    \ base keywords are stored in the cleansed cor-\npus. Finally, the words which\
    \ were previously stemmed need\nto be lemmatized. Lemmatization is when the context\
    \ is con-\nsidered, and stemmed words are converted into more mean-\ningful base\
    \ words or lemmas. This phase targets removing\ninﬂected words and outputs the\
    \ dictionary form of a\nword [31].\n5. Latent Dirichlet Allocation\nLatent Dirichlet\
    \ allocation (LDA) is the most popular tech-\nnique in NLP, so data is fed to\
    \ the LDA model after prepro-\ncessing. Before sending data, bigrams and trigrams\
    \ are\nremoved from the corpus. Two words that occur together\nare named bigrams,\
    \ like human resources, and the three\nwords frequently occurring together in\
    \ the document are\ntermed trigrams, like human resource management. The\nLDA\
    \ model is implemented in python language, where the\ngenism library has been\
    \ used to remove such phrases. Gen-\nism’s phrases model can build and identify\
    \ these bigrams,\ntrigrams, quadgrams, or even n-grams [32]; thus, we can\nremove\
    \ and improve the data cleansing process. It is also\npart of preprocessing, so\
    \ after completing this stage, data is\nsent to the LDA model for further analysis\
    \ [49, 67]. LDA\ntopic modeling is based on three input parameters, one of\nwhich\
    \ is a list of topics, and the other is hyperparameters.\nBefore the distribution\
    \ of a document’s topic content is the\nmagnitude of the Dirichlet. This parameter\
    \ is regarded as\nseveral “pseudowords” equally distributed across the docu-\n\
    ment’s topics, regardless of how the document’s other words\nare assigned to topics.\
    \ β is per-word-weight of Dirichlet\nprior over topic-word distributions. The\
    \ α value for this\nexperiment is taken as 1/T, where T is the desired number\n\
    of topics [33], and the β has been ﬁxed as 0.01 for all topic\nsolutions. For\
    \ identifying two, ﬁve, and ten topic solutions,\nas suggested by [26], the number\
    \ of iterations considered is\n1000. Thus, initializing these parameters becomes\
    \ a concern\nas the values can deﬁne the distribution of high-quality topic\n\
    results. The bag of words (BOW) extracted is initially proc-\nessed in LDA topic\
    \ modeling, where the most frequently and\nleast frequently occurring are removed\
    \ so the corpus can\nbecome absolute. This study removes a word frequency of\n\
    more than 5000 from BOW. The top 20 frequently occurring\nwords from the corpus\
    \ with their frequency are shown in\nFigure 5, as it is clear from the graph that\
    \ the most occurring\nkeyword is the system, use, sensors, internet, agriculture,\
    \ and\nmany more.\nHyperparameters are optimized using Python’s mallet\nlibrary,\
    \ a JAVA-based NLP package. Then, the mallet pack-\nage extracts the desired topics\
    \ by training the model using\nBOW. Unfortunately, no oﬃcial or proven measure\
    \ exists\n6\nJournal of Sensors\nto ﬁnd the optimal number of solutions [27].\
    \ Still, some\nobservational parameters are given by Cao and Arun, which\nhelps\
    \ the researcher decide the optimal number of keys [55,\n68]. Furthermore, the\
    \ choice of the topic solution has been\ninﬂuenced by the heuristics and ﬁndings\
    \ of the studies [55,\n61, 68, 69]. Finally, K-mean clustering algorithms are\
    \ used\nto ﬁnd the optimal number of topics from the BOW.\n6. Topic Labeling\n\
    Once the topics have been extracted with the help of the\nLDA model, each topic\
    \ is labeled manually based on the\nkey terms of each topic. As a result, there\
    \ are 4309 articles\nin the corpus, and out of all documents, the top ﬁve high-\n\
    loading papers and their contribution to the topic are men-\ntioned in Table 1.\n\
    7. Result Analysis\n7.1. Parameters of Topic Solutions. The loadings for two,\
    \ ﬁve,\nand ten topic solutions have been acquired by deploying the\nLDA model\
    \ and are presented in Table 1. The selection of\ntwo, ﬁve, and ten topic solutions\
    \ is based on a coherence\nscore and is inﬂuenced by the previous studies. The\n\

    \ ITS (intelligent transport systems).\n7\nJournal of Sensors\ncoherence score\
    \ plays an essential role in ﬁnding the seman-\ntic similarity between the key\
    \ terms in the topic, and ideally,\na 0.3 to 0.6 coherence value is considered\
    \ a good score [81].\nIn this study, coherence values achieved are good; for two\n\
    topic solutions, 0.62; for ﬁve topics, 0.58; and for ten topic\nsolutions, 0.52\
    \ coherence value is reached. Therefore, ﬁve\ntopic solutions are considered optimal\
    \ based on coherence\nvalue. The dominance of each topic solution is also sup-\n\
    ported by the corresponding count of articles it covers.\nTable 4 summarizes the\
    \ count of year-wise publications cor-\nresponding to each topic solution.\nThe\
    \ initial choice of two topics will broadly depict the\ncore research areas that\
    \ have been widely covered by the\nresearchers in the compiled research literature.\
    \ Further, in\nﬁve topic solutions, the researchers have explored the\nresearch\
    \ areas. Therefore, we have depicted in detail the\nresearch areas studied in\
    \ ﬁve topic solutions. Further in the\nhierarchy, the ﬁve topic solutions have\
    \ widened into ten\ntopic solutions, with new areas emerging as the research\n\
    trends in GHRM.\n7.2. Topic Labeling. The core research zones explored and\ndiscovered\
    \ based on the two topic solutions are depicted in\ntopics T-2.1 and T-2.2. Let\
    \ us discuss how this labeling has\nbeen performed. While implementing LDA on\
    \ two topic\nsolutions, the keywords and their loading has been extracted.\nThe\
    \ extraction results of LDA depict the high-loading arti-\ncles per topic and\
    \ the high-loading terms or keywords per\ntopic. The labeling process is based\
    \ on the high-loading key-\nwords that have been collected. Thus, in the table,\
    \ the label-\ning per topic solution corresponds to the terms extracted\nunder\
    \ the heads T-2.1, T-2.2, and so on; it goes for ﬁve\nand ten topic solutions.\n\
    7.2.1. Core Research Area. The two topic solutions present an\nabstract view of\
    \ the literature dataset and divides it into\n“Security and Privacy in Smart Agriculture”\
    \ (T-2.1) and\n“Monitoring and Control System in Agriculture” (T-2.2).\nThese\
    \ two signiﬁcant labels depict the research areas the\nresearchers have extensively\
    \ explored.\n(1) T-2.1: Security and Privacy in Smart Agriculture. Agricul-\n\
    ture has shaped human civilizations since ancient times.\nRapid information and\
    \ communication growth aﬀects agri-\nculture’s structure and operation (ICT) [82].\
    \ Despite\nadvances, hazards may be signiﬁcant, so smart farming must\ngrasp security\
    \ and privacy challenges before contemplating\ncyber attacks. Smart farming uses\
    \ devices, protocols, and\ncomputer ideas to modernize agriculture. Digital farming\n\
    changes everything and creates eﬀective, eﬃcient, sustain-\nable, and open systems\
    \ [83]. Mobile devices, precision\nagronomy, remote sensing, big data, cloud analytics,\
    \ cyber\nsecurity,\nand\nintelligent\nsystems\nsimplify\nagricultural\ntechnology\n\
    integration.\nIncompatibility,\nheterogeneity,\nequipment constraints, processing,\
    \ and data security may\nthreaten smart farming, but recent years have increased\n\
    usage of ICTs in agriculture [84]. Physical risks and con-\ncerns may impede agriculture’s\
    \ deployment, but agriculture\n4.0 will be the new agriculture standard [85].\
    \ Simultaneous\nresearch is also going on in the area to secure smart agricul-\n\
    ture. Technology has added to environmental problems—list\nagriculture’s\nphysical\n\
    threats\nby\ncategory.\nPopulation\nincrease, urbanization, aging, and technical\
    \ developments\nin food production all aﬀect agriculture and farmers. Agri-\n\
    culture’s most signiﬁcant physical hazard is weather [86].\nExternal factors continually\
    \ threaten agriculture. In recent\ndecades, technology has reduced its inﬂuence.\
    \ Agriculture\napps need stable connections, IoT networks, and cloud\ncomputing\n\
    [87].\nExternal\nfactors\ncontinually\nthreaten\nagriculture. In recent decades,\
    \ technology has reduced its\ninﬂuence. Agriculture apps need stable connections,\
    \ IoT net-\nworks, and cloud computing. The sensors can malfunction,\ncausing\
    \ erroneous readings and instructions that could cause\na manufacturing failure.\
    \ Temperature, humidity, obstruc-\ntions, and human presence can impact Lora WAN,\
    \ Zigbee,\nand other agri-wireless networks, causing data loss. Sensors\nand networking\
    \ equipment are usually exposed [88].\n(2) T-2.2 Monitoring and Control System\
    \ in Agriculture. New\ntechniques, technology, and approaches have also helped\
    \ in\nagriculture. 35% of the world’s workforce works in this pro-\nfession. Agriculture\
    \ helps many economies to grow [89]. It\nboosts industrialized nations’ economies.\
    \ India is the second\nlargest country that deals in this profession. Every country\n\
    has practiced agriculture since ancient times. Businesses\nand other areas must\
    \ support agriculture’s tech transforma-\ntion. The future population rise is\
    \ frightening. Mid-20th cen-\ntury population may have surpassed nine billion\
    \ counts, so\nagriculture needs to be strengthened to meet the ﬂooding\nneeds.\

    \ farming data. IoT-based agricultural\nmonitoring system wirelessly communicates\
    \ and dissemi-\nnates the sensor data. Global agriculture uses 70% of avail-\n\
    able fresh water each year to irrigate 17% of the land [91].\nGrowing food requirements\
    \ and global warming reduce irri-\ngated land, a challenge in plague agriculture.\
    \ FAO predicts\nglobal food production must rise by 70% to meet population\nand\
    \ urbanization needs. Modern agriculture uses robotics,\nautomation, and computer\
    \ systems to replace challenging\nhuman jobs, so expanding agriculture needs new\
    \ technolo-\ngies to be included [92]. Future agricultural technology\nincludes\
    \ robotics and machine vision. In addition, popula-\ntion growth will increase\
    \ the demand for resources and\nproducts. “Sustainability” is blended into social,\
    \ economic,\nand technological problems to address environmental con-\nservation\
    \ and economic development, and information and\ncontrol systems will be crucial\
    \ [93].\n7.2.2. Five Topic Solutions: Research Areas\n(1) T-5.1: Intelligent Disease\
    \ Detection Models. India’s econ-\nomy is mainly based on agriculture. Agriculture\
    \ accounts for\n16% of India’s GDP and exports. More than 75% of India’s\npopulation\
    \ depends on agriculture. Healthy, high-quality\nagriculture is essential for\
    \ economic prosperity [94]. Detec-\ntion of plant disease is critical at an early\
    \ stage. Plants can\nbecome ill while growing. Early illness diagnosis is a chal-\n\
    lenge\nin\nagriculture.\nResearchers\nﬁrst\ndemonstrated\ncutting-edge machine\
    \ learning methods for identifying plant\nillnesses [95]. Training parameters\
    \ are used in modern sys-\ntems but require powerful computers or lengthy training\n\
    and prediction durations to work. Convolutional auto\nencoder (CAE) network prediction\
    \ features have been\nreduced while preserving accuracy in this research. Thanks\n\
    to technological advancements, the world’s population of 7\nbillion people can\
    \ be fed [96].\nChanging climates, declining pollinators, and plant dis-\neases\
    \ threaten the ability to produce enough food. Plant dis-\neases endanger the\
    \ livelihoods of smallholder farmers who\ndepend on healthy crops [97]. Despite\
    \ declining yields,\nsmallholder farmers in developing economies provide more\n\
    than 80% agricultural output. Methods for preventing dis-\nease already exist\
    \ [98]. Pesticides have been replaced with\nintegrated pest management (IPM).\
    \ Early diagnosis is essen-\ntial for successful therapy. Agricultural extension\
    \ organiza-\ntions and local plant clinics have long supported disease\ndetection\
    \ thanks to their computer power, high-resolution\ndisplays, and broad accessory\
    \ sets, such as HD cameras.\nSmartphone diagnostics are a ﬁrst-of-its-kind technology.\n\
    5-6 billion mobile phones will be in use by 2020. More than\ntwo-thirds of the\
    \ world’s people now have access to mobile\nbroadband, a 12-fold increase since\
    \ 2007 [99].\n(2) T-5.2: Data Security Challenges in Smart Agriculture.\nTechnology,\
    \ equipment, protocols, and computer paradigms\nare all used to enhance agricultural\
    \ operations in smart agri-\nculture. Big data, artiﬁcial intelligence, the cloud,\
    \ and edge\ncomputing all store and analyze the data in various forms\nof storage\
    \ and archiving. As a relatively new ﬁeld, smart\nagriculture lacks adequate data\
    \ security measures [84].\nFarming’s future relies heavily on the availability\
    \ and quality\nof data, which necessitates the need for security. To maintain\n\

    89\n31\n257\n9\nJournal of Sensors\nAgricultural systems may not be well suited\
    \ to traditional\nIoT security solutions, resulting in unique demands and pos-\n\
    sibilities. New agricultural projects have been developed to\nkeep up with population\
    \ increase and food production.\nThe success of agriculture depends on productivity,\
    \ era-\nspeciﬁc restrictions, and the advancement of science and\ntechnology.\
    \ A lot may go wrong regarding smart agriculture,\nwhich is still in its infancy.\
    \ In the future, farmers will rely\nheavily on the availability and quality of\
    \ data to help them;\nthus, developing secure and stable systems is critical [101].\n\
    The growth of the agriculture generation is depicted in\nFigure 6, in which agriculture\
    \ 1.0 started in 1784. In the\n20th century, agriculture 2.0 came into existence.\
    \ In 1992\nagriculture 3.0 was started, and in 2018 agriculture 4.0\nif followed.\n\
    Smart agriculture uses IT to increase information per-\nception, quantitative\
    \ decision-making, intelligent control,\nsuitable investment, and personal service\
    \ [102]. In addition,\ncurrent technology boosts agricultural yield and improves\n\
    security and privacy [103]. There are both advantages and\ndisadvantages to using\
    \ automation in smart agriculture.\nComputer-aided farming uses contemporary technology\n\
    and procedures, so in the future, “digital agriculture” will\nbe more productive,\
    \ eﬃcient, sustainable, inclusive, trans-\nparent, and resilient agriculture.\
    \ Many diﬀerent types of\nagricultural technology may be used in conjunction with\n\
    one another to increase eﬃciency and productivity [104].\n(3) T-5.3: Smart Monitoring\
    \ System in Agriculture. Rainfall\nand\ntemperature\nﬂuctuations\nare\nvery\n\
    unpredictable.\nClimate-smart farming is becoming increasingly popular\namong\
    \ Indian farmers. IoT enables smart agriculture. It\nsaves water, fertilizer,\
    \ and agricultural yields. IoT-enabled\nautomated systems and wireless networks\
    \ are expanding\nindustries. Thus, research into integrated sensor technology\n\
    and the usage of IoT networks in agriculture is reaching\nthe level [105].\n(4)\
    \ T-5.4: Production and Supply Chain Management in\nAgriculture. The growth of\
    \ the supply chain and the move-\nment of information are driven by the gathering\
    \ of materials,\nthe transformation of products, and the delivery to end-\nusers.\
    \ Information-driven, “connected supply chains” enable\norganizations to reduce\
    \ inventory and expenditures; increase\nproduct value; extend resources; expedite\
    \ time to market;\nand retain consumers, among other beneﬁts [106]. Supply\nchain\
    \ performance determines how healthy activities are\nlinked to maximizing customer\
    \ value and proﬁtability at\neach process stage—the end-user beneﬁts from an eﬃcient\n\
    supply chain. Several agricultural supply chains in India\nare problematic owing\
    \ to issues in the agriculture industry\n[107]. Many factors aﬀect the agri-food\
    \ supply chain, includ-\ning small and marginal farmers, disjointed supply chains,\
    \ a\nlack of economies of scale, subpar processing, value addition,\nand fewer\
    \ marketing options. Supply chain management is\nexpanding into logistics by creating\
    \ new divisions integrat-\ning manufacturing, procurement, transportation, and\
    \ distri-\nbution [108]. Information ﬂow visibility has increased\nbecause of\
    \ advancements in telecommunications, electronic\ndata interfaces, and other technologies.\
    \ Animals and plants\nare used in agriculture to produce products that beneﬁt\n\
    human health. For example, agribusiness produces textiles\nand paper. Throughout\
    \ the supply chain, the needs of cus-\ntomers are met. Organizations in the agricultural\
    \ supply\nchain, such as cooperatives, distribute produce, fruits, grains,\npulses,\
    \ and products derived from animals [109]—a network\nof businesses that make goods\
    \ and services for the end-user.\nThere are several beneﬁts to establishing a\
    \ supply chain net-\nwork, such as shifting risk and proﬁt from one company to\n\
    another. Quality is ensured by openness and accountability\nin the process. Quality\
    \ is dependent on transparent pro-\ncesses and responsibilities at each stage\
    \ of the process. The\nprice and performance of transfer payments are crucial\
    \ to\nthe success of process chains.\n(5) T-5.5: Cost-Eﬀective Communication System\
    \ in Smart\nAgriculture. Low-cost solutions like crop rotation, green\nmanuring,\
    \ and mulching have cut cultivation expenses while\nsaving soil and water. Legumes,\
    \ weed control, and increased\nagricultural diversity are nonmonetary inputs [101].\
    \ Climate\nchange, global warming, saltwater intrusion, desertiﬁcation,\nand a\
    \ lack of arable land have increased worldwide worries\nabout food safety and\
    \ security. Connectivity-of-Things\napplications require steady internet [110].\
    \ In the Mekong\nDelta and HCMC, climate change threatens food security.\nDrought\
    \ and saltwater intrusion in the South and Central\nHighlands in early 2016 demonstrate\
    \ the vulnerability and\nsusceptibility of unsustainable agriculture. Agriculture\
    \ may\nbe more eﬃcient and safer thanks to a new Farming system.\nVietnam may\
    \ become a smart and sustainable farm by mod-\nernizing, boosting productivity,\
    \ and ensuring quality. Busi-\nnesses in Vietnam have shared their know-how with\n\
    companies in other countries. Another important factor to\nconsider is the safety\
    \ of the food being prepared. When\ndeciding which meals are good for you and\
    \ the environment,\nmost people have no idea where to begin. Concerns about\n\
    food safety have given rise to new ideas like “city farms”\nand “growing your\
    \ veggies at home” [111]. However, the\neconomic sustainability of these models\
    \ must be thoroughly\nexplored. Researchers are currently focusing on developing\n\
    an IoT-enabled agriculture system. Increased productivity,\nquality, and safety\
    \ may be achieved via this method [82].\n7.2.3. Ten Topic Solutions: Research\
    \ Trends\n(1) T-10.1: Greenhouse Monitoring System. Most Indians\nwork in agriculture,\
    \ contributing to the country’s econo-\nmy—agriculture beneﬁts from technological\
    \ advancements.\nHowever, pesticides are used to grow most fruits and vegeta-\n\
    bles since contemporary farming methods cannot keep up\nwith demand. As a result,\
    \ conventional farming practices\ncontend with weather and disease. Although crop\
    \ yields\nmay be increased by altering agricultural practices [112]\nbecause of\
    \ urbanization and land scarcity, farming must be\ndone in greenhouses. Temperature,\
    \ humidity, light, water\ncontent, pH, and wetness are all shown via LEDs in the\n\
    greenhouse. The goal is to create an intelligent greenhouse.\n10\nJournal of Sensors\n\
    Greenhouse temperature and humidity may be adjusted\nautomatically using programmable\
    \ modules and low-cost\nand high-eﬃciency options [113].\nSoil water content,\
    \ light intensity, temperature, and\nhumidity may be adjusted. In greenhouse crop\
    \ production,\nthe appropriate growth conditions must be changed to\nachieve high\
    \ yields, low costs, improved quality, and the\nlowest environmental impact. To\
    \ attain these goals, proper\nheating and ventilation must be maintained. Using\
    \ a green-\nhouse is more dependable, but it is also more diﬃcult [114].\nTemperature\
    \ and timing controls had previously improved\ncrop quality. Many control devices\
    \ and systems lack auto-\nmation and eﬃciency in today’s dynamic and competitive\n\
    environment. A variety of complicated models depict the\ngreenhouse eﬀect. Costs\
    \ increased, plans became more com-\nplex, and more control was required. The\
    \ usage of com-\nputers in greenhouses has increased during the last decade.\n\
    These components are necessary for a control system.\nSophisticated microelectronic\
    \ hybrid circuits boost sensor\nmanufacturing. Advances in product quality and\
    \ depend-\nability enable commercial competitiveness. Each sensor’s\nperformance\
    \ is determined by its calibration and sensing\nprocesses. It will be impossible\
    \ to automate some jobs even\nin the far future. Several American businesses have\
    \ yet to\nautomate fully, maybe due to cost concerns [115].\n(2) T-10.2: Service-Based\
    \ Industry for Smart Agriculture.\nTechnical advancement has been driven by the\
    \ widespread\nuse of IT and its adaptability in satisfying various require-\n\
    ments. Service-based agriculture (SBA) is widely utilized in\nmultiple industries.\
    \ Farming systems that make it easier for\nfarmers to do their work. A large-scale\
    \ service smart agricul-\nture systems link buses to a hotel, hospital, logistics\
    \ center,\nrestaurant, grocery store, or traditional market. With SBA,\nmaterial\
    \ sales partners may easily share information about\ntheir products with one other\
    \ fast. As a result of SBA,\nIndonesia will see an increase in its economy, as\
    \ quoted in\none study. Over time, the importance of information tech-\nnology\
    \ has grown. The production of farms has increased\nthanks to the adoption of\
    \ contemporary technology [116].\nMany\npeople\nare\nfamiliar\nwith\nthe\npredicament\n\
    of\nIndonesian farmers. The signiﬁcance of variables cannot be\noverstated. Farmers\
    \ have a fear of technology. Farmers in\nIndonesia may be able to increase their\
    \ abilities and produce\nfood for the country’s population by utilizing new technologies.\n\
    Brokers are often used to resell the produce of Indone-\nsian farmers. Small-scale\
    \ farmers in Indonesia were hurt by\nbrokers who gambled on the price of agricultural\
    \ goods\n[117]. Prices for components are rising. Broker fraud\ninﬂated market\
    \ values. Brokers save agricultural products,\ngiving the impression that the\
    \ market is oversupplied and\ndriving up the price of food. When chili prices\
    \ climb and\nthere is a shortage, many brokers refuse to buy from\ngrowers. The\
    \ growing cost of food in Indonesia might harm\nthe country’s economy. Farmers\
    \ must be able to sell their\nproducts directly to consumers. The direct distribution\n\
    oﬀers farmers an easy way to market their products. Whole-\nsalers buy agricultural\
    \ goods from farmers at inexpensive\nrates [118]. To get their goods to market,\
    \ farmers must rent\na vehicle. Commodities no longer impact farmers’ earnings\n\
    with a long processing time. Indonesians rely heavily on\ntheir smartphones to\
    \ get information. Technology can help\nfarmers become food wholesalers. Local\
    \ markets and restau-\nrants might be fed using this method by farmers. The\n\
    Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing support agri-\nculture’s food supply\
    \ and distribution systems [119]. Nowa-\ndays, nanotechnology is also used in\
    \ agriculture to improve\nyields and reduce waste.\n(3) T-10.3: Cloud-Based Smart\
    \ Applications in Agriculture.\nSmart farming uses technology to increase production\
    \ and\nimprove product quality. For example, the Internet of\nThings-based smart\
    \ agriculture automates crop inspections\nand watering. Database traﬃc and data\
    \ cannot be handled\nAgriculrure 1.0\nAgriculrure 2.0\nAgriculrure 3.0\nAgriculrure\
    \ 4.0\nHuman and animal resources dominated\nagriculture during the traditional\n\
    agricultural period, and inefficiency was a\nfundamental issue.\nDuring the industrialized\
    \ agricultural period\nof the 20th century, resource insfficiency\nwas a severe\
    \ concern.\nA lack of intelligence was a significant worry\nthroughout agriculture,s\
    \ rapid, automated\ngrowth.\nThe era of smart agriculture is defined by\napplying\
    \ current information technologies to\nservice and intelligently grow agriculture.\n\
    20th Century\n1784-1875\n1992-2017\n2018-Present\nFigure 6: Agriculture generation.\n\
    11\nJournal of Sensors\nby a cloud-based IoT-based system. As a result, there\
    \ is less\nlag, the battery lasts longer, and the money and information\nare better\
    \ managed [120].\nIn many cases, the edge for IoT may provide signiﬁcant\nadvantages,\
    \ such as removing the need for interval and geo-\nmetric communications eﬃciency.\
    \ High interface automa-\ntion in IoT activities may achieve reduced latency and\n\
    faster processing. This simulator replicates the sting, edge,\nand fog of IoT.\
    \ IoT-based edge computing is more immedi-\nate, cost-eﬀective, and eﬃcient than\
    \ traditional computer\nsystems [121]. In cities, these strategies are ineﬀective.\
    \ Rural\nlocations are where they are most commonly used. Robots\nshould be used\
    \ in agriculture. The ﬁeld is navigated using\nthe GPS on the tractor. Agribusiness\
    \ in the 21st century is\nanything but digital or computerized. Monitoring crops\n\
    and animals with sensors, GPS-enabled tractors, image pro-\ncessing, and machine\
    \ learning is possible. Edge computing\nreduces the amount of noise in the raw\
    \ data it analyses\nwhich can be cleaned using data mining techniques [122].\n\
    On the other hand, Broadband networks are more cum-\nbersome and diﬃcult to standardize.\
    \ After sensors are\ninstalled, data is automatically collected. We can identify\
    \ if\nanimals or birds are active, inactive, unwell, healthy, submis-\nsive, or\
    \ dominant. We may alter their treatment, living cir-\ncumstances, medicine, and\
    \ food to suit their needs [123].\n(4) T-10.4: Energy-Eﬃcient Smart Transmission\
    \ System. An\nintelligent electrical infrastructure that satisﬁes society’s sus-\n\
    tainability and energy eﬃciency demands is called “smart\ninfrastructure” Customers\
    \ and utility providers will beneﬁt\nfrom the smart grid’s ability to monitor\
    \ their energy use bet-\nter and link the power grid with micro-networks. As a\
    \ result,\nthere is a danger to data security and privacy. Economic\ngrowth depends\
    \ on the availability of electricity, which\nboosts productivity and sustains\
    \ quality of life. Global eco-\nnomic development and electricity usage are depleting\
    \ the\nworld’s energy resources [124]. The smart grid’s core\nassumption is to\
    \ minimize resource depletion and promote\neconomic growth through energy eﬃciency\
    \ and manage-\nment technologies. Demand management lowers transmis-\nsion and\
    \ distribution system stress and high-demand\noverhead lines. Several countries\
    \ have used industrial and\ncommercial demand response strategies to boost their\
    \ econ-\nomies. Direct load limiting often reduces peak demand\n[125]. Direct\
    \ load management may result in a decrease in\ncustomer satisfaction—direct load\
    \ management. Consumers\nand utility companies beneﬁt from reduced peak demand\n\
    when loads are shifted. However, the electrical system’s sta-\nbility and dependability\
    \ are compromised during periods of\nhigh energy demand. The smart grid and load\
    \ modeling\nneed to limit peak energy use.\nTrouble ensues when demand exceeds\
    \ supply. From\n2019 to 2030, India’s population and development demands\nare\
    \ expected to grow by 50 percent [126]. A transmission\nsystem that can endure\
    \ interruptions and blackouts must\nmeet these criteria. Grid operators must regularly\
    \ monitor\nsupply and demand to avoid power outages. To ﬁx this prob-\nlem, load\
    \ shedding disconnects speciﬁc customers’ electric-\nity. Generators must be turned\
    \ down to prevent blackouts\nif supply and demand are out of sync. Smart grids\
    \ can iden-\ntify problems early on and immediately resolve them. Sen-\nsors monitor\
    \ the grid and manage the ﬂow of current.\nThese are computerized to increase\
    \ productivity [127].\n(5) T-10.5: Smart Solutions for Modern Farming. Sustainable\n\
    food production is in high demand as the world’s population\nexpands and weather\
    \ patterns shift. Agriculture and devel-\nopment go forward as time goes by. Agricultural\
    \ technology\nis advancing rapidly. These new technologies are pretty\neﬀective,\
    \ but they must be constantly improved. Using infor-\nmation and communications\
    \ technology, planting, watering,\nand harvesting are all enhanced. Many ﬁelds,\
    \ including agri-\nculture, beneﬁt from technological advancements. The Inter-\n\
    net of Things (IoT) in agriculture is referred to as “smart\nfarming” [128]. Produce\
    \ and livestock will be healthier\nthanks to IoT-enabled smart farming. Real-time\
    \ information\nis provided through wearables and sensors in the ﬁeld.\nShelter,\
    \ clothing, and food have been top priorities for\nhumanity since the dawn of\
    \ civilization. There is a lot of\nmodernity in the house and clothing. According\
    \ to the UN\nFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO), humanity’s food\nrequirements\
    \ will rise by 70% by 2050, according to the UN\nFood and Agriculture Organization\
    \ (FAO) [129]. IoT can be\nused to solve problems in business and technology.\
    \ Tractors\nare used to plant seeds and gather crops. You can use it for\nbusiness\
    \ or yourself. Farming is done with the help of trac-\ntors. Farmers can do other\
    \ things when they use tractors that\ndrive themselves. A Polish company called\
    \ Agribot makes\ntractors that can work independently. When they pull weeds,\n\
    their tractors have sensors that reduce the number of chemi-\ncals and pesticides\
    \ exposed. Agro-IoT devices can meet the\nneeds of farming in the future. Traditional\
    \ agriculture must\nbecome more productive and less risky for the global econ-\n\
    omy to grow. IoT helps growth. Farmers can keep an eye\non their land with the\
    \ help of the Internet of Things. IoT\napplications include keeping an eye on\
    \ climate change, man-\naging water, keeping an eye on land, improving productivity,\n\
    keeping an eye on farming, and keeping track of pesticides\nand herbicides [130].\n\
    (6) T-10.6: Smart Irrigation System for Agriculture. The most\ndiﬃcult chore in\
    \ agriculture is watering ﬁelds. Water sys-\ntems consist of drips, nozzles, tubes,\
    \ and sprinklers, among\nother things. As a whole, agriculture has a positive\
    \ impact\non economic activity. Watering by hand is required. Gar-\ndening and\
    \ soil deterioration are both covered in rainfall.\nAgriculture’s key objectives\
    \ are the production of food and\nlivestock. IoT is a network of interconnected\
    \ devices that\ncan exchange data [131]. When water supplies are limited,\nautomatic\
    \ irrigation may be necessary.\nAccording on the weather, irrigation might be\
    \ done con-\ntinuously or intermittently. As a result, there is less spillage.\n\
    Almost all of the water comes from drip irrigation or sprin-\nklers. With a wireless\
    \ gadget, soil moisture and humidity\n12\nJournal of Sensors\nmay be monitored.\
    \ In agriculture, controllers manage every-\nthing from power to intruder detection\
    \ to pump switching\n[69]. A pump is used to deliver water to the ground. Water\
    \ is\nconserved when drippers are used. Drip irrigation and ﬂood\nirrigation are\
    \ both standard irrigation methods. Both all of\nthe sensors, pumps, and controls\
    \ work as expected. Manual\nwatering may hurt or deplete crops and the environment.\n\
    Automated irrigation systems can be used to address the diﬃ-\nculties. Farming\
    \ may beneﬁt from drip irrigation, which saves\non water. Automatic irrigation\
    \ systems for crop management\nhave become widespread during rainstorms, landscaping,\
    \ and\nsoil erosion. Wi-ﬁ sensors are used to gauge the humidity and\nmoisture\
    \ content of the soil. In agriculture, controllers keep\nan eye on the electricity,\
    \ keep an eye out for intruders, and\nmanage the pumps. Saturating the soil is\
    \ accomplished with\nthe use of pumps. Using drippers saves water, therefore reduc-\n\
    ing the amount of water used. Floatation irrigation commonly\nutilizes electricity,\
    \ sensors, pumps, and controls [132].\n(7) T-10.7: Blockchain-Based Security System\
    \ for Agriculture.\nThere are nodes in a blockchain, and each node has its own\n\
    distributed ledger, allowing several nodes to read and amend\na single ledger\
    \ while preserving shared control. Each block-\nchain node contains a distributed\
    \ ledger that is safe and acces-\nsible to all participants. There are no middlemen\
    \ to\nauthenticate, track, store or synchronize transactions using\nblockchain\
    \ technology. According to several research studies,\nblockchain has altered technology\
    \ from centralized to decen-\ntralized and distributed networks, a shift that\
    \ has been well\ndocumented. The blockchain helps business networks [133].\nBusiness\
    \ networks are composed of companies or individuals\nthat trade assets. Products,\
    \ materials, and equipment are\nexamples of physical assets. A distributed ledger\
    \ may be used\nto move assets across the network by anybody who is a mem-\nber.\
    \ The most recent ledger is available to all members.\nConsensus-based distributed\
    \ ledgers and smart contracts fos-\nter network conﬁdence. Assets and transactions\
    \ are recorded\nin the distributed ledger. Transactions are possible with a dis-\n\
    tributed ledger. You cannot remove a transaction after it has\nbeen added. An\
    \ encrypted ledger prevents tampering with\ntransactions. With blockchain, the\
    \ distributed ledger is trans-\nformed into a reliable data source for the network\
    \ [134]. A dis-\ntributed ledger of digital commerce is known as a blockchain.\n\
    Each node of the network modiﬁes distributed ledgers\nthrough cryptography. Components\
    \ of a blockchain include\nits block header, timestamp, nonce, and Merkle root\
    \ hash.\nSmart apps are being developed for rural agriculture. Agri-\ncultural\
    \ modernization relies on ICT to automate processes\nand protect personal data.\
    \ Data from many IoT devices\nmay be sent to a central hub to analyze and manage\
    \ auton-\nomous farm activities. However, centralized intermediates\nare inherent\
    \ in a single point of failure, data loss risk, and\nman-in-the-middle attacks.\
    \ Thanks to smart contracts on\nthe blockchain, decentralized and safe agricultural\
    \ automa-\ntions are now possible [135].\n(8) T-10.8: Production-Based Smart System\
    \ for Agriculture. It\nis possible to increase productivity and quality by using\
    \ IoT-\nbased agricultural convergence technologies. Predicting\ndemand, managing\
    \ supply, and ensuring quality are beneﬁts\nof precision agriculture. The expansion\
    \ of the economy is\nmainly fueled by agriculture. The government is responsible\n\
    for protecting the land [136]. Nothing has changed despite\nadvances in science\
    \ and technology. There is no shortage\nof green technologies. Farmers need to\
    \ reduce the time they\nspend working and increase the precision they use their\n\
    resources. Complex statistical methodologies are used by\nagriculturalists when\
    \ analyzing historical data and making\neconomic predictions. Farm yields are\
    \ improved via GPS,\nsensors, and big data. Real-time data from ICT-based deci-\n\
    sion support systems can take the role of farmers’ knowledge\nand intuition [137].\
    \ Improved decision-making reduces the\namount of waste and increases eﬃciency.\
    \ Images, GPS,\nscience-based solutions, climate forecasts, technology, and\n\
    environmental controls play a role in agriculture. As with\nthe terms “smart meters”\
    \ and “smart cities,” “smart farming”\nrefers to any M2M application. Technology\
    \ advances to aid\nin harvest forecasting. However, predictions based on statis-\n\
    tics are not always accurate. Harvest data and the agricul-\ntural environment\
    \ should be correlated. IoT will provide\nagricultural data. Complex statistical\
    \ methodologies are used\nby agriculturalists when analyzing historical data and\
    \ mak-\ning economic predictions. Predicting crop yields is aided\nby the use\
    \ of smart systems. In the end, statistical forecasts\nare not perfect; they are\
    \ only a starting point. Make a con-\nnection between the agricultural environment\
    \ and harvest\ndata. Crop pattern data will be provided through IoT-\nbased decision\
    \ support. On IoT, agribusiness utilizes data\nmining, statistical forecasting,\

    must undergo a paradigm shift in light of evolving environ-\nmental conditions,\
    \ dietary preferences, and a scarcity of crit-\nical inputs. It is all about the\
    \ latest advancements in\nagriculture. As a result of the adoption of Industry\
    \ 4.0, busi-\nnesses may expect to see advances in output, eﬃciency, and\ncreativity.\
    \ First, agriculture provides food for the world’s\npopulation. Second, agriculture\
    \ 4.0 decreases labor and envi-\nronmental eﬀects to increase agricultural proﬁtability\
    \ by\nreducing greenhouse gas emissions and water use. Third,\nagriculture is\
    \ the primary source of income for half of India’s\npopulation, India’s veins\
    \ and arteries [139]. The fourth stage\nof industrial development is large-scale\
    \ agriculture. Among\nthe essential ICTs is the IoT. Flexibility is improved in\n\
    “smart factories.” People, equipment, and software work\ntogether to satisfy production\
    \ demands, which are met\nthrough cutting-edge technology such as CPS/IoT/iOS\
    \ and\nreal-time interaction. The industry beneﬁts from consolida-\ntion. However,\
    \ future manufacturing and commerce will be\nharmed. This shift is made possible\
    \ due to the Internet and\ninformation technology [140]. Quality control encompasses\n\
    all aspects of engineering, management, manufacturing,\noperations, and logistics.\
    \ Costs, availability, use of resources,\nand market demand may all be automated.\
    \ ‘The implemen-\ntation of Industry 4.0 will profoundly impact the agriculture\n\
    and industrial sectors. All technologies like Big Data, AI, and\nIoT are part\
    \ of Industry 4.0. IoT allows agricultural systems\n13\nJournal of Sensors\nand\
    \ equipment to connect with one another, making Indus-\ntry 4.0 a game changer\
    \ in agriculture [141]. The fourth\nindustrial revolution created networked tractors,\
    \ farms,\nand manufacturing equipment [142]. “Industry Revolutions\n4.0” refers\
    \ to three factors:\n(1) Digitalization and its integration into simple eco-\n\
    nomical and technical networks\n(2) Digitalization of services and products\n\
    (3) Market models that have been updated\nAs economic, economic and business models\
    \ develop,\nhumans become more distant from the center of production\nand surveillance\
    \ of crops. Industry 4.0 is being used by both\ndeveloped and developing countries.\
    \ India has a lot of\nuntapped potential for agricultural growth. Robotics, IoT,\n\
    and e-business are the three pillars of this revolution, aiming\nto deliver technology\
    \ to every corner of the globe.\n(10) T-10.10: Image-Based Classiﬁcation Techniques\
    \ in Intel-\nligent Agriculture. Agriculture originated thirteen thousand\nyears\
    \ ago between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers north of\nIraq. Gathered vegetation\
    \ included wild wheat and others.\nFew people needed food. UN estimates that the\
    \ world’s pop-\nulation will reach 10 billion by 2050, impacting farmers.\nDesertiﬁcation\
    \ and urbanization wreak havoc on farmland.\nCOVID-19 is a threat to food security\
    \ and the nation’s econ-\nomy. To solve this problem, we need to use fewer people\
    \ to\ngenerate more food [143]. In certain parts of India, rainfall is\nthe only\
    \ irrigation water supply. However, crop destruction\ncan occur in some places\
    \ due to unpredictability in rainfall,\nwhich is a problem. Management of watersheds\
    \ is critical.\nMany-variable hydrological modeling is required to predict\nrainfall\
    \ and runoﬀ in diﬀerent basins accurately. Estimates\nof imperviousness necessitate\
    \ a terrain categorization, which\nultimately categorizes land use and cover [144].\
    \ The image\nclassiﬁcation curve number is used in modeling. Satellite pic-\n\
    tures are diﬃcult to classify because of their high resolution\nand wide range\
    \ of applications.\nNevertheless, images are a common practice in agricul-\nture\
    \ and water management. There are a plethora of tools\nand methods for classifying\
    \ images. ANN and SVM are used\nfor image classiﬁcation [145]. Techniques used\
    \ to organize\npictures traditionally are time-consuming and prone to\nhuman error.\
    \ With pattern recognition, alternate ways can\nreduce time and enhance accuracy.\
    \ Unlike Bayes’ discrimi-\nnant criteria, SVM multiclassiﬁcation outperforms.\n\
    8. Threats to Validity\nThis analysis is based on LDA topic modeling and has\n\
    bounded to the limitations of this topic modeling technique.\nA suﬃcient article\
    \ count has been achieved, yet the risk of\nmissing out is a concern. The bibliographic\
    \ material has also\nbeen inferred. The search string insuﬃciency has been erad-\n\
    icated appropriately due to the limitations of selected search\nterms, synonyms,\
    \ string formulation, and search engines’\nvariedness resulting in imperfect retrieval\
    \ of literature cor-\npus. Labeling topics is a signiﬁcant concern due to subjectiv-\n\
    ity and bias. According to the author, a deep discussion has\nbeen conducted to\
    \ determine the label best to overcome this\nlimitation. Then, based on critical\
    \ terms, labels have been\nformulated to draw the best topic labels for researchers\n\
    and practitioners.\n9. Conclusion\nUsing IoT technology, farmers and producers\
    \ may better\nmanage their resources, such as fertilizer consumption and\nthe\
    \ number of trips made by farm vehicles, while minimiz-\ning waste and maximizing\
    \ productivity, including water,\nelectricity, and other inputs. In IoT smart\
    \ farming systems,\nsensors monitor the agricultural ﬁeld and automate the irri-\n\
    gation system. Farmers can monitor their ﬁelds from any-\nwhere. This paper concluded\
    \ the research direction in\nsmart agriculture and farming. Technology has shaped\
    \ agri-\nculture’s history. Historians have identiﬁed several agricul-\ntural\n\
    revolutions\nthat\nchanged\npractice\nand\noutput.\nTechnological advances have\
    \ fueled these revolutions. The\nIndustrial Revolution mechanized agriculture,\
    \ improving\nfarm labor productivity.\nModern mechanized agriculture has replaced\
    \ numerous\nfarm activities by hand or by oxen, horses, and mules.\nWeather forecasting\
    \ and barbed wire were 19thcentury\nadvances. Portable engines and threshing machines\
    \ became\npopular after improvements. In the 20thcentury, synthetic\nfertilizers\
    \ and insecticides, mass-produced tractors, and agri-\ncultural aircraft for aerial\
    \ pesticide application were devel-\noped. Precision farming, disease monitoring,\
    \ agricultural\ndrones, satellite imagery, and sensors are just ways technol-\n\
    ogy makes farming easier for farmers. Intelligent software\nanalysis for pest\
    \ and disease prediction and soil management\nare only a few of the many analytical\
    \ activities that IoT-\nbased sensor networks may do. New issues in smart farming\n\
    include the security of the farming data, technical failures,\nand technical incompetence.\n\
    10. Future Work\nThe LDA model works like a recommender system. The cur-\nrent\
    \ research is based on extracting keywords from the doc-\numents and recommends\
    \ current and trending research\nareas based on the correlation of the keywords\
    \ in the speci-\nﬁed ﬁeld. So, in the real-time scenario, any corpus of any size\n\
    can be passed to the model to get the relevant keywords, and\nbased on these keywords,\
    \ suggestions for topics can be\ndepicted. The authors have used this model on\
    \ smart agri-\nculture in the current research. In contrast, this model can\n\
    also be implemented in other research ﬁelds like smart cities,\nblockchain, and\
    \ Wireless Sensor Networks. In this study, the\nauthors analyzed data retrieved\
    \ from the Scopus database\ninstead of Web of Science, Education Resources Information\n\
    Center, ScienceDirect, or the Directory of Open Access Jour-\nnals. However, the\
    \ authors chose the Scopus database over\nthese other databases because Scopus\
    \ has more excellent\n14\nJournal of Sensors\ncoverage of publications, demonstrating\
    \ that it is a compre-\nhensive and dependable data source and so justifying its\
    \ eli-\ngibility for this review.\nData Availability\nData are available upon\
    \ request from the corresponding\nauthor.\nConflicts of Interest\nThe authors\

  data_sources: Historical data and real-time data
  explanation: The goal of this research is to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency
    of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems. An automated data preparation
    and processing system handles data quality for real-time, on-site processing.
    Data sources from heterogeneous origins are cleaned, formatted, and filtered to
    remove any unnecessary noise or measurement errors. This ensures that the data
    used to make irrigation decisions is accurate and reliable. The system quantifies
    data quality metrics to assess the readiness of the data for analysis. Machine
    learning models for real-time data processing and inference are implemented on-site,
    using this quality-assured data. These models are trained on historical data and
    continuously updated as new data becomes available. This allows the system to
    learn and adapt to changing environmental conditions and crop requirements.

    Get rights and content Highlights • An infrastructure to manage huge datasets
    produced by plant phenomics platforms. • Modular and highly expressive scientific
    workflows are designed to analyze datasets. • Scientific workflows are distributed
    over the Grid using an extensible middleware. • Provenance is managed to allow
    users understand results and ensure reproducibility. Abstract Plant phenotyping
    consists in the observation of physical and biochemical traits of plant genotypes
    in response to environmental conditions. Challenges, in particular in context
    of climate change and food security, are numerous. High-throughput platforms have
    been introduced to observe the dynamic growth of a large number of plants in different
    environmental conditions. Instead of considering a few genotypes at a time (as
    it is the case when phenomic traits are measured manually), such platforms make
    it possible to use completely new kinds of approaches. However, the datasets produced
    by such widely instrumented platforms are huge, constantly augmenting and produced
    by increasingly complex experiments, reaching a point where distributed computation
    is mandatory to extract knowledge from data. In this paper, we introduce InfraPhenoGrid,
    the infrastructure we designed and deploy to efficiently manage datasets produced
    by the PhenoArch plant phenomics platform in the context of the French Phenome
    Project. Our solution consists in deploying scientific workflows on a Grid using
    a middleware to pilot workflow executions. Our approach is user-friendly in the
    sense that despite the intrinsic complexity of the infrastructure, running scientific
    workflows and understanding results obtained (using provenance information) is
    kept as simple as possible for end-users. Previous article in issue Next article

    Biological research derives its findings from the proper analysis of experiments.
    However, over the last three decades, both throughput of experiments (from single
    observations to terabytes of sequences of images produced during a single day)
    and the breadth of questions studied (from single molecules to entire genomes)
    have increased tremendously. One of the main challenges remains to efficiently
    analyze, simulate and model such big datasets while keeping scientist users in
    the loop. In this paper we introduce InfraPhenoGrid, the infrastructure we designed
    and deployed to efficiently manage and analyze datasets produced by the PhenoArch
    plant phenomics platform. In this context, one difficulty remains to enable users
    to analyze, simulate and model increasingly huge datasets on a more frequent base.
    More precisely, the design of InfraPhenoGrid is driven by three needs, described
    here-after. First, management of large-scale experiments involving possibly large
    numbers of interlinked tools has to be supported. Users should be able to analyze
    and simulate complex structural-functional relationships of plant architectures,
    integrating multi-disciplinary models developed by different teams. Experiments
    should be easy to design by users and it is important that over time they can
    be changed, adapted to new needs (new analysis algorithms are constantly available),
    and then shared. As a result, the first brick of our infrastructure is a Scientific
    Workflow System. Second, each experiment can be replayed several times, varying
    datasets and/or parameter settings. Keeping track of the exact datasets and parameter
    settings used to produce a given result (provenance) is of paramount importance
    for scientists to ensure the results’ reproducibility and allow to properly interpret
    and understand them. The possibility of comparing results, obtained on several
    experiments when varying datasets and/or parameter settings are used, is another
    need directly associated with provenance. Consequently, the second brick of our
    infrastructure is a Provenance Layer. Last but not least, our infrastructure has
    to efficiently deal with the analysis of huge datasets, possibly acquired on multiple
    sites. Analysis may involve combining data produced by platforms with completely
    different kinds of data, including data obtained from public data sources. Data
    acquisition is fast compared to the time needed to analyze them. The size of datasets
    has reached a turning point at which local infrastructures are no longer sufficient
    to provide adequate computational power and storage facilities. Hence, distributed
    computation has become a major requirement. However, deploying jobs on a parallel
    environment might be complex for end users. Therefore the third brick of our infrastructure
    introduces a Middleware able to pilot the execution of jobs on parallel (Grid)
    environments. This paper is organized as follows: Section  2 introduces the precise
    context of this work, that is, the Phenome Project, PhenoArch platform and one
    use case of interest. Section  3 describes in detail the architecture of InfraPhenoGrid.
    Section  4 demonstrates the benefit of using our solution for managing plant phenomic
    datasets. Section  5 provides related work while Section  6 concludes the paper
    and draws perspectives. 2. Use case 2.1. The Phenome project and the PhenoArch
    platform Selecting genotypes that maintain and increase crop performance is a
    particularly challenging and important topic in the context of societal challenges
    such as climate change adaptation, food security and preserving natural resources.
    A large variety of tasks have to be performed to collect information on plant
    traits (called phenotyping), including measuring the size of the leaves, counting
    the number of tails…. Performing such tasks manually makes it impossible to consider
    more than a few plants at a time and it thus cruelly confines the kind of analyses
    that can be conducted. In the meantime, massive plant phenotyping in the field,
    that is, the evaluation of crop performance (yield) of millions of plants in a
    large range of environmental and climatic scenarios, has been very efficient for
    driving plant breeding. However plant breeding is now facing a stagnation of genetic
    progress in several species. New strategies, such as genomic selection, are now
    evolving to directly link the allelic composition of a genome, available at much
    higher throughput and lower cost than field phenotyping, to crop performance.
    The existence of large marker–environment interactions, i.e. the fact that a given
    combination of markers has very different genetic values depending on the climatic
    scenario, lead concomitantly to a revolution in phenotyping strategies. Such strategies
    aim to capture under controlled conditions, the genetic variability of plant responses
    to environmental factors for thousands of plants (reference panels), hence identifying
    more heritable traits for genomic selection. This first implies the necessity
    to automate quantification of a large number of traits, to characterize plant
    growth, plant development and plant functioning. Second, it requires a tight control
    or at least accurate measurement of environmental conditions as sensed by plants.
    It finally requires fluent and versatile interactions between data and continuously
    evolving plant response models. Such interactions are essential to be considered
    in the analysis of a given marker–environment interaction and in the integration
    of processes to predict genetic values of allelic combinations in different environment
    scenarios. High-throughput phenotyping platforms have thus been designed to allow
    growing and observing traits of a large number of plants. These platforms provide
    many measurements and imaging functionalities for different plant species grown
    in various environmental conditions. They potentially allow to assess the genetic
    variability of plant responses to environmental conditions using novel genetic
    approaches requiring a large number of genotypes. Nine of such platforms, distributed
    over various regions of France, are gathered in the Phenome project (Fig. 1).
    More precisely, Phenome consists of two controlled condition platforms (greenhouses
    with automated irrigation, control and temperature control) for 1900 plants, two
    field platforms (800 plots) equipped with environment control ( enrichment, automated
    rain shelters) and three larger field platforms (2000 plots) that use natural
    gradients of water availability or soil contents. All these platforms are equipped
    with environmental sensors and permit automated imaging of plants in one or multiple
    wavelengths (thus allowing functional analysis) using robots to convey plants
    (for green houses) or to carry instruments to automatically acquire data in the
    field (Phenomobile, drones). Finally two supporting omic platforms enable us to
    centralize and optimize high throughput metabolomic and structural measurements
    associated with the experiments. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Location
    of Phenome platforms, superimposed on a map of mean temperature in France. Phenome
    platforms are representative of the variability of temperature. They also represent
    different risks of water deficit. The work depicted in this paper is related to
    the PhenoArch platform,1 in the south of France (Montpellier). As depicted in
    Fig. 2, PhenoArch is composed of a conveyor belt storage structure of 28 lanes
    carrying 60 carts each (i.e. total of 1680 pots), and a conveyor belt system that
    feeds either the imaging or the watering units. The imaging unit consists of a
    3-D image acquisition cabin with top and side channel. Five water units consist
    of five weighing terminals and five high-precision watering pump-stations, as
    shown in Fig. 2. PhenoArch measures traits associated to the plants’ adaptation
    to climate change with a throughput of 1650 plants per day. Typical measured variables
    include the timing of the plant cycle (leaf appearance, duration of phenological
    phases), plant growth rate in terms of area and volume, plant organ expansion
    and plant morphology (angles, shape of leaves). The automated irrigation system
    allows to control various water supply scenarios and estimates the responses of
    these traits to water availability. Plants are imaged every day from 12 lateral
    and one apical view (20 000 images per day are produced), which allow reconstructing
    a digital ‘avatar’ of each plant of the platform. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Phenoarch phenotyping platform. Three main categories of workflows
    have to be executed: The first series of workflows is related to data acquisition
    in order to collect, describe, and organize datasets while being acquired. The
    second category consists in gathering, standardizing, and making available produced
    datasets. The third category aims at finding answers to research questions: analyzing
    results obtained and combining such data with other datasets to extract knowledge.
    Workflows then need to combine highly heterogeneous data, from very different
    sources such as manual samplings, readings, and human observations at different
    scales (populations, plants, organs, tissues, cells, etc.) and at different times
    and stages. Such data can be either comparative (mutant versus wild type), absolute
    (days to flowering of a cultivar) or relative (relative growth per day). Extensive
    connections to large sets of data types are also mandatory (seed stocks, genes,
    experimental methods, publications, etc.) leading to major data integration research
    questions  [1] and calling for a new generation of analysis tools. 2.2. Image
    analysis workflow As an example, we describe one of the elementary workflows,
    that mostly consists of an image analysis step targeting the estimation of plant
    leaf area. Most of the raw data (images) are indeed not used directly, but processed
    with an image analysis pipeline to get a trait, and then further analyzed with
    a response model. Analyzing images is part of the important steps of the experiments
    to be performed. It is shared between many workflows and used to produce the traits
    measurements. A very large variety of algorithms may be used to extract relevant
    information from image analysis. Dedicated plant phenotype commercial packages
    use basic functions to estimate total biovolume and leaf area for example. However
    current research provides a new landscape of algorithms. They make the link with
    ecophysiological models and allow to perform a more precise analysis of plant
    traits. In this context, it is particularly important to allow users to test and
    compare algorithms on their datasets. Despite its simplicity, this use case already
    illustrates one important characteristics of phenotyping analysis, that is the
    intrinsic dependency between data and models. Consecutively such workflows can
    then be completed by other workflows that couple data analysis with a model for
    analyzing the response of plant expansion rate to temperature and water availability
    or with an integrative model, in a simulation context. Furthermore, such a kind
    of in-silico experiment can be considered in much wider contexts. For instance,
    after an initial segmentation of organs in the image, the global architecture
    of the plant can be reconstructed. This 3D reconstruction can be interfaced with
    canopy-level models of light interception to gain access to physiological parameters
    like intercepted light and radiation use efficiency for example. Hence both geometrical
    parameters attached to a plant (e.g., leaf surface area) and physiological parameters
    (e.g., photosynthesis) can be tracked throughout time and correlated with genotypes.
    All these steps are particularly challenging and involve multi-disciplinary teams
    (biology, statistics, geometry, bioinformatics, computer science…). 2.3. User
    requirements In the introduction we have presented the three main high-level requirements
    we followed to design InfraPhenoGrid: (i) the ability for users to design and
    exchange experiments where a very large number of tools are interlinked (handled
    by a workflow management system), (ii) the ability for users to reproduce experiments
    and understand the result obtained by such experiments (handled by a provenance
    layer), and (iii) the ability to deal with large-scale experiments involving masses
    of data (handled by parallel computing environments). In this subsection we provide
    precision on the PhenoArch users’ requirements. A   Transparent, Familiar   and   Flexible   Working
    Environment: The classical users of the PhenoArch platform are bioinformaticians,
    mainly Python programmers (strongly involved in the design of Jupyter/IPython
    notebooks  [2], [3]), statisticians, image analysts and more generally modelers,
    all closely connected to the Plant community. They are already very familiar with
    the OpenAlea workflow system and in particular they are frequent users of some
    analysis tools and libraries provided by OpenAlea. InfraPhenoGrid should thus
    be designed to be as transparent as possible for users, that is, to allow them
    continuing working in the same environment. However, we want our infrastructure
    to be flexible to use other workflow systems and/or libraries both for our current
    users to discover them and to welcome next generation users. An   Adaptable Operational   Infrastructure:
    Faced with the amount of data to be analyzed, the computing infrastructure of
    InfraPhenoGrid has to be designed in an operational distributed infrastructure,
    already used in similar projects. While a National (European) and Open infrastructure
    has to be favored in a first time, InfraPhenoGrid should be adaptable to both
    Grid and Cloud solutions. A Reproducibility-Friendly Infrastructure: InfraPhenoGrid
    is a workflow infrastructure for plant scientists to analyze their datasets and
    understand them. Tracking data used and produced (Provenance) as well as the exact
    description and environments where the tools have been executed is a crucial need
    and should be done following international standards of the domain. InfraPhenoGrid
    should thus be Reproducibility-Friendly, welcoming to any plugins to export, visualize
    and analyze Provenance information and more generally any tool to enhance reproducibility
    of experiments. 3. InfraPhenoGrid architecture The InfraPhenoGrid we designed
    to manage and analyze plant phenotyping datasets is an infrastructure based on
    a number of layers of abstractions. First, computational methods for analysis
    and simulation are expressed by means of scientific workflows (in the OpenAlea
    workflow system). Second, a middleware (SciFloware) maps, manages and optimizes
    the execution of scientific workflows on distributed environments. Third, a provenance
    layer captures the workflow execution and reports it to users to further understand
    and explore results of the computation. Last, a large scale infrastructure, the
    Grid (France-Grilles) allows to have access to a shared, extensible and very large
    computational power and storage. France-Grilles makes use of two other important
    components, namely, DIRAC and iRODS. DIRAC (Distributed Infrastructure with Remote
    Agent Control)  [4] is a framework for distributed computing particularly well-suited
    to deal with large communities of users. iRODS (integrated Rule-Oriented Data
    System)  [5] is a scalable open-source data management software used by research
    organizations and government agencies worldwide. The focus of iRODS is data. It
    provides data discovery using a metadata catalog that describes every file, directory,
    and storage resource in the data grid. iRODS is also in charge of implementing
    data virtualization. (iRODS will be described in more details in Section  3.3)
    More precisely, the architecture of InfraPhenoGrid is depicted in Fig. 3. Circled
    numbers are related to steps described here-after. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. InfraPhenoGrid architecture. The user interacts with InfraPhenoGrid
    in a visual programming environment (step 1) by designing a workflow specification
    from scratch or by selecting an existing workflow in the library of available
    workflows. To run the workflow, the user has to select the datasets to be taken
    as input by the workflow at execution time. The distributed infrastructure is
    thus transparent for the end-user. Selecting a dataset in InfraPhenoGrid actually
    corresponds to sending a request to iRODS to concretely get the data (step 2).
    Resources have then to be allocated; this is performed by DIRAC (step 3). On each
    allocated worker or job, OpenAlea workflows are deployed by copying an image from
    iRODS so that an OpenAlea server is launched (step 4). OpenAlea servers then register
    to SciFloware (step 5) which is in charge to distribute computations of possible
    subparts of the workflow to the different OpenAlea servers (step 6). The workflow
    is then concretely executed on the Grid (step 7). At this stage, provenance information
    and all information on jobs are stored and available on iRODS. The next subsections
    present with more details and discuss the choices we made on the major components
    of InfraPhenoGrid, namely, the OpenAlea workflow system, the SciFloware middleware
    and the data management and provenance layer. 3.1. Scientific workflow management
    system: OpenAlea OpenAlea—A system targeted to the plant community. The OpenAlea
    scientific workflow system is a component-based architecture implemented as a
    set of pure Python packages  [6]. The visual programming environment and graphical
    user interface (GUI) is implemented using the PyQt toolkit, a Python binding to
    the Qt application framework. OpenAlea is portable and available on Linux, Windows,
    and MacOS/X. OpenAlea has been in constant use since 2004 by users of the French
    Plant science community but not only since the system has been downloaded 618
    000 times and the web site counts international 10 000 unique visitors a month
    according to the OpenAlea web repository (https://gforge.inria.fr). OpenAlea is
    distributed under a free software license (L-GPL) and maintained and developed
    by a group of 20 active developers from different research institutes and universities.
    Development is performed under a collaborative scheme with shared methodologies
    (best practices). Coding sprints are regularly organized by various sub-groups
    of developers (pair programming and test driven development) and scientists (biologists
    and mathematicians). OpenAlea tools (e.g., models, workflows, components) are
    published and shared on the web both through the main OpenAlea web repository
    and through web sites of groups which use and contribute to OpenAlea without being
    concretely partners of the OpenAlea project.2 As a consequence, more than 60 researchers
    have contributed to OpenAlea packages, in France and internationally, published
    through large meta-packages (e.g., Alinea to simulate ecophysiological and agronomical
    processes and VPlants to analyze, model and simulate plant architecture and its
    development) to ease the installation for end-users. The strong and long-term
    experience of PhenoArch users and their international collaborators with both
    using and developing workflows in OpenAlea made us choose OpenAlea as the workflow
    system for InfraPhenoGrid. The main technical features of OpenAlea are described
    here after. Using OpenAlea (Designing workflows). From an end-user point-of-view,
    the first feature of OpenAlea exploited is its visual programming environment
    (part A of Fig. 4) where users are provided with a set of predefined workflows
    and libraries of tools (part B of Fig. 4) to be combined to form new workflows.
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Main graphical user interface of OpenAlea.
    Users can design and interact with workflows in A. The package manager is in part
    B and provides users with the structured list of tools available and the list
    of existing workflows. On part C is the Python interpreter, where OpenAlea actors
    can be designed. Dotted lines denotes widgets. Users can create new wrapped tools
    by implementing them in Python (in part C of Fig. 4). Each tool and workflow is
    associated with some documentation and saved. Ports of actors are typed and widgets
    can be associated with data types to allow users interaction with the data. Workflow
    specification. From a more formal point-of-view, in OpenAlea, a workflow is classically
    represented as a directed multi-graph. Each node is called an actor and represents
    a task to be executed (a.k.a. component or activity). Each node has a name, a
    function object (a functor, a program, a Web Service or a composite actor), and
    an explicitly defined set of input and output ports. Directed edges are data links
    which connect output to input ports. While OpenAlea can be classically used to
    perform data analysis as in other workflow systems such as Galaxy  [7], Taverna  [8]
    or Kepler  [9], its originality lies in its ability to handle loops expressing
    retro-action  [10]. In other words, OpenAlea is able to deal with simulation and
    modeling. Iteration is handled by introducing a specific kind of actor, called
    dataflow variable . It allows to specify that, at a given port, an actor receives
    an unbound variable rather than a value. Connecting an X to an actor transforms
    a workflow into a lambda function. It allows to express higher-order programming
    providing control flow behavior using a set of algebraic operators. An algebraic
    operator is an actor that iterates over first-order function calls, and thus takes
    one or more functions as inputs. Ports that require a function have an associated
    semantic type Function. More precisely, the map operator is a higher-order function
    . Its arguments are a function (first port) and a set of elements of type (second
    input port). The map operator applies to each element of the set and returns the
    set of resulting elements of type . In Part A of Fig. 5, two implementations of
    the map operator are provided. The left workflow illustrates the map operator
    running on one single processor while the one on the right hand side illustrates
    the parallel map operator with the same workflow running on 4 processors. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Algebraic operators map (A left), parallel
    map (A right), and reduce (B). Similarly, the reduce operator takes a function
    of two variables and a sequence of elements and returns one element. while is
    an iteration operator that takes three inputs: an initial element , a Boolean
    function and function . It initializes a variable with and iteratively applies
    the function on while is true. Workflow execution. The execution of a given workflow
    in OpenAlea is launched in response to requests for data of one of its actors.
    Such an actor can satisfy the request when the upstream sub-workflow has been
    executed, that is, when all the relevant actors connected to its input ports have
    been executed. When such an actor has received its data on its input ports, it
    executes and places data on its output ports. OpenAlea has introduced -dataflow
    evaluation  [10] which differs from the classical evaluation if the workflow contains
    at least one dataflow variable . The execution is then decomposed into two stages.
    First, for each port of type Function, a sub-workflow is computed if the upstream
    sub-workflow contains at least one dataflow variable. This sub-workflow is defined
    by all the actors needed to produce the data on this port, i.e. the upstream sub-workflow
    and the connected output port. This sub-workflow is dynamically transformed into
    a function (i.e. an actor) of one or several variables corresponding to its dataflow
    variables. Second, the evaluation of this function by algebraic operators consists
    in replacing the variables by real data and evaluating the sub-workflow. Additionally,
    OpenAlea provides several optimizations in the orchestration of the workflow execution
    by allowing actors to be blocked and lazy. If an actor is blocked, the execution
    is not propagated to the upstream sub-workflow and if the actor is lazy, the execution
    is performed only if the actor’s inputs have not changed compared to its previous
    execution. This type of orchestration performs only the operations needed to produce
    the required result, executing the subset of the graph relevant to the output  [11].
    3.2. A middleware for parallel environments: SciFloware The choice of SciFloware.
    As stated in the user requirements, InfraPhenoGrid should be equipped with a system
    able to (i) hide the complexity of the computation and offer transparent access
    to data and tools for end-users, (ii) provide a flexible working environment by
    allowing several workflow systems to be used, (iii) be adaptable to pilot tasks
    both on Grid and Cloud infrastructures. Using and tuning such kind of systems
    remains a very difficult task. Our research groups have recently developed SciFloware,
    a generic lightweight middleware able to coordinate and pilot the tasks to be
    executed in a transparent way for the user. SciFloware is based on the Shared-data
    Overlay Network  [12] (SON) which follows a Software as a Service (SaaS) model,
    eliminating the need to install and maintain the software and allows users to
    run HPC programs through graphical interfaces (e.g., graphical interfaces of scientific
    workflow management systems). SciFloware has been chosen to be the InfraPhenoGrid
    middleware, because it was a system we are familiar with and it matched our demands
    on requirements. The technical features of SciFloware are described here after.
    Internal representation of workflows in SciFloware. SciFloware has been designed
    to allow interoperability of different workflow systems. In absence of standards
    to represent scientific workflows,3 SciFloware defines its own XML workflow specification
    to describe a master workflow. A master workflow is a meta-level workflow used
    to orchestrate and compose concrete workflows. Each workflow is run independently
    by different scientific workflow systems. As an example, in Fig. 6, the SciFloware
    master workflow consists of four steps, including steps and (sub-workflows of
    the master workflow) which are respectively executed by the X workflow system
    (for the a sub-workflow) and the OpenAlea workflow system (for the b sub-workflow).
    More precisely, SciFloware is responsible for (i) sending to workflow systems
    the execution of such two master sub-workflows with the right input data produced
    by the previous executed master workflow step, (ii) collecting output data generated
    at the end of each execution of the sub-workflows, and (iii) launching the execution
    of the last step of the master workflow with such collected data. Download : Download

    been the first workflow system orchestrated by SciFloware (based on our user requirements),
    Galaxy  [7] and Taverna  [8] are currently under consideration (to play the role
    as “X workflow system” in Fig. 6). Algebraic expressions in SciFloware. SciFloware
    uses a relational data model and an algebraic language to represent data-intensive
    scientific workflows  [13]. Data flows are represented as relations and workflow
    nodes and activities as algebraic expressions. A relation is a set of tuples composed
    of basic attributes (e.g., int, float, string, file references). An algebraic
    expression consists of algebraic activities, additional operands, operators, input
    relations and output relations. It is comprised of a workflow, a program or an
    SQL expression, with input and output relation schemes. More precisely, SciFloware
    provides six algebraic operators: Map, SplitMap, Reduce, Filter, SRQuery and MRQuery.
    The semantics of these operators has been defined in  [13]. Software as a Service,
    communication with workflow systems. As previously stated, SciFloware is particularly
    modular, following the SAAS (“Software as a Service”) principle. SciFloware is
    a service-and-component-based distributed architecture and built from software
    components. Each component provides services to other components of the workflow.
    A service is a self-contained unit of functionality which exposes components through
    well-defined interfaces. SciFloware provides services that can be combined to
    build large distributed applications. In InfraPhenoGrid, SciFloware runs on a
    dedicated server and provides a registration service, where distributed workers
    can register themselves. Using a communication protocol, SciFloware distributes
    the computation among workers, with each worker running behind a dedicated server.
    The tech stack (e.g., authentification) is implemented using services and can
    easily be evolved further. More precisely, three main kinds of services are considered
    in SciFloware: algebraic operators, scientific workflow systems and the communication
    protocol between algebraic operators and workflow systems. SciFloware schedules
    the computation using algebraic operators. Services associated with these are
    managed by the SciFloware server. Each component has its own decentralized execution
    strategy, which allows to simply distribute the execution on several sites. A
    component type is associated with each algebraic operator. For example, the Map
    operator has an associated map type of component, with an input and output service
    for relations and a service to schedule activity among workers. As for workflow
    systems, each worker runs a service, running a workflow within a given workflow
    system. It receives a workflow description and input data IDs and returns the
    produced output data. On a Grid infrastructure, workers will run on different
    nodes, each one executing its own server to communicate with SciFloware. Eventually,
    a set of services have been defined to manage communication between SciFloware
    and different workflow systems. Using these, SciFloware can request the execution
    of a workflow on any workflow system server, or be notified at the end of the
    execution of an OpenAlea workflow. Other services manage database relationships
    and communication protocols. Fig. 7 illustrates a case where a component manages
    local task executions depending on a given algebraic operator. More precisely,
    in Fig. 7, the Map component distributes the computation among workers (OA servers,
    that is, OpenAlea servers) depending on its own scheduling policy. Download :

    on the Grid with SciFloware. SciFloware allows new components to be added and
    instantiated dynamically to extend the middleware. SciFloware Architecture. The
    SciFloware architecture is composed of the following components (see Fig. 8):
    • Algebraic Operators. For each algebraic operator, a specific component type
    is associated, which can be instantiated several times during the execution of
    a given workflow. • Execution Manager. The Execution Manager takes in a workflow
    specification and instantiates the needed components (i.e. workflows or part-of
    workflows), such as the algebraic components. A message is sent to trigger execution
    of the first workflow component. The Execution Manager also manages and runs the
    available OpenAlea servers. At each registration of an instance of an OpenAlea
    server, a worker component is added to the list of available workers. • Data Manager.
    The Data Manager provides workers with access to the storage database. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 8. SciFloware architecture. Implementation of
    SciFloware. The implementation of SciFloware is based on the Shared-data Overlay
    Network (SON)  [12], written in JAVA, fully integrated into the Eclipse environment
    and implemented on top of OSGi.4 The communication protocol between SciFloware
    and scientific workflow systems being run on different workers use a REST (Representational
    State Transfer) interface. The RESTfull communication protocol is used to register
    new workers, exchange the workflow specification and the data identifiers stored
    on iRODS and start and stop the execution. Each service in SciFloware is described
    using description files similar to the Web Service Definition Language (WSDL).
    Each SciFloware component has an associated description file defining the required
    and provided services. SON is used for the internal composition of SciFloware
    components. SON allows to build an application following the SAAS model (Software
    as a Service) using a set of components that can be executed in a distributed
    way (e.g., Peer-to-Peer) on a Grid or on a Cloud infrastructure. The SON middleware
    allows to define new component types by specifying the services offered by each
    type. During execution it allows to dynamically combine different component instances
    and to manage the life cycle of these components (create, init, stop,…). Concerning
    the authorization framework, SciFloware uses OAuth2  [14] to enable safe registration
    of the OpenAlea servers to SciFloware. The OAuth2 flow used is the Resource Owner
    Password Credentials Grant flow.5 During the deployment of the OpenAlea server,
    the user provides its SciFloware’s username and password. At startup, each OpenAlea
    server requests an access token from SciFloware using login authentication. After
    registration, all the communication between SciFloware and OpenAlea is mediated
    through iRODS, whose access requires authentication based on certificates delivered
    by the French Grid Certification Authority. As for the Data Manager component,
    it has been extended to support iRODS. The connection with iRODS is established
    using the REST interface. iRODS is the focus of the next subsection. Packaging
    OpenAlea into a virtual environment. OpenAlea and all its dependencies have been
    built and packaged into a virtual environment  [15] on a virtual machine. The
    operating system (i.e., a scientific Linux version 6) of the virtual machine is
    the same as the one deployed on each worker of the Grid. The virtual environment
    is packed and stored on iRODS. When a worker is reserved by DIRAC, the bundle
    is uploaded locally and uncompressed. A shell script updates the environment variables
    and an OpenAlea server is launched. This method has been preferred to virtualization
    (e.g., vagrant or docker  [16]) for performance reasons and because all the workers
    have the same operating system. The size of the compressed bundle containing all
    the packages and their dependencies is 210 MB. The latency (or delay) due to the
    copy of the bundle from iRODS and its installation is less than 1 min, while each
    worker is deployed once for a maximum of 24 h. 3.3. Data management and provenance
    Data management with iRODS. As previously stated, iRODS (v3.3) is an open-source
    data system chosen by France-Grilles for its ability to provide a technology enabling
    data and policy virtualization for multiple and geographically separated users  [17].
    iRODS federates distributed and heterogeneous data resources into a single logical
    file system and provides a modular interface to integrate new client-side applications.
    iRODS does not only allow the worker nodes of the grid infrastructure to access
    datasets but it provides end-users with access to data, through GUI, while enabling
    user to annotate such datasets with rich metadata. Both input data and the results
    of a scientific workflow computation associated with their provenance are stored
    on iRODS. This drastically reduces the volume of data to be transferred through
    SciFloware to launch a computation and retrieve its result (only the address of
    data in the central catalog has to be exchanged). We also implemented a communication
    protocol by file to bypass the limitations enforced by the Grid on network communications.
    Provenance Layer. One of the major aims of our infrastructure is to be reproducibility-friendly   [18].
    The starting point to make a scientific result reproducible is to keep track of
    the exact datasets and exact tools (including parameter settings) used to obtain
    a given data item. To answer such needs a Provenance Layer has been designed and
    implemented in our infrastructure. A layer currently has two main components:
    a provenance model, based on the W3C standard PROV  [19] and a notebook generator,
    able to automatically generate notebooks from some workflow executions. The Provenance
    layer is flexible in the sense that new modules taking in PROV data and making
    it possible to visualize and analyze provenance information can be integrated.
    While iRODS is in charge of concretely managing data, the provenance module reconstructs
    (by querying iRODS) the history of each data item. In other words, the provenance
    module is able to provide for each produced data item the exact series of workflow
    node executions, including the datasets used as input of such nodes. Such provenance
    information is represented according to the W3C PROV standard  [19]. Both prospective
    (the workflow specification) and retrospective (execution and datasets) provenance
    are stored. Notebooks generator. The second component of the provenance layer
    aims at helping the PhenoArch users understand the results they obtained by allowing
    them to visualize and interact with the main steps of the process used to produce
    such results. In other words, we want PhenoArch users to be able to interact and
    visualize (part of) the execution of some workflows to follow how some final results
    have been obtained. The current solution used by an increasing number of scientists
    to answer such kinds of need is to (manually) design notebooks using the Jupyter/IPython
    Notebook web application  [2]. From a developer point-of-view, a notebook is a
    JSON document (convertible into a number of open standard output formats including
    HTML, LaTeX, PDF … and which can be designed using a web-base user interface)
    containing an ordered list of input/output cells with iPython code able to generate
    text, mathematics, plots and rich media (images, video…). From an end-user point-of-view,
    a notebook is a rich web page, where code, text, mathematics, plots and multimedia
    (images, video…) can be displayed and interacted with. In particular any user
    can modify the input of a notebook cell to observe the impact of this change on
    the objects displayed (e.g., plots). In InfraPhenoGrid, we implement a notebook
    generator where a set of OpenAlea workflow executions are automatically converted
    into Jupyter/ IPython notebooks. More precisely, the generator (i) converts each
    OpenAlea workflow actor (natively coded in Python) into an IPython cell and (ii)
    queries iRODS to extract automatically information on input and output datasets
    respectively used and produced by the execution of each OpenAlea actor. Users
    can then visualize and interact with data used and produced during an execution.
    A concrete example of generated notebooks is provided in the next section (Results).
    4. Results In this section, we present the benefits of using InfraPhenoGrid in
    Plant Phenotyping by showing how the various components of our infrastructure
    make it possible to perform complex experiments on huge datasets. Designing workflow.
    Fig. 9 provides an example of a workflow designed and executed by our end-users
    to estimate the growth of a plant. Such a workflow starts with querying iRODS
    to get input data (“import image” node). In this concrete example, the 1407th
    individual plant of genotype A310 has been considered. As a consequence, “1407”
    and “A310” appears in the name of the actors of the workflow. The import image
    node returns a time series of images. Each acquisition, taken every two days,
    records pictures of the plant at various angles by rotating the plant. The node
    keys returns the order sets of the dates, while values returns a list of images
    corresponding to the different side views of the growing plant, along time. The
    map node applies the sub-workflow illustrated on Part B of Fig. 9 on each set
    of images of the time series. The result is a list of estimated areas of the individual
    plant over time. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Workflow. Part A
    represents the main workflow while Part B is a sub-workflow corresponding to the
    node “area estimation” of workflow A. Part C depicts one of the set of real images
    of a plant of a given genotype obtained from the imaging system of the phenoarch
    platform. D represents the binary image. E plots the growth of the plant. The
    node represents a dataflow variable and abstracts the sub-workflow (part B) as
    a function. The sub-workflow B implements a mean-shift algorithm. It receives
    the multiple views of the plant at a given time. All these views are combined
    (node cv_mean) using an OpenCV algorithm to separate the plant from the cabin
    background in the image. The macro_side_binarization node subtracts the cabin
    background of each image and the “green” pixels are counted (countNonZero). Again,
    the map algebraic operator is used to run the same treatment on a set of images.
    Note that the mean shift algorithm is only computed once due to lazy evaluation.
    The binary image (Part D) is produced by one execution of the macro_side_binarization
    for each lateral perspective image using an optimized HSV segmentation algorithm.
    Finally, the plant area node receives as input a number of “green pixels” for
    each plant and estimates, using a linear model, the plant area along its growth
    and development. The PyLabScatter node plots the graph of the growth of the plant
    (Part E) using the MatplotLib library  [20] wrapped within OpenAlea. Exploring
    alternative methods. OpenAlea is modular and allows users to easily test various
    alternative methods. In particular, several variations of sub-workflow B can be
    designed, resulting in the use of several Binarization algorithms (as mentioned
    in Table 1). The results obtained by such variations can then be compared (mainly
    qualitatively) by the user. Table 1. Execution time of the workflow illustrated
    in Fig. 9 with variations of sub-workflow B on one plant measured during one seasonal
    growth (5 weeks). This experiment gathered 124 images. Binarization algorithms
    Time (s) Adaptive threshold  [21] 62.1 HSV  [22] 85.7 Mean shift  [23] 73.9 Exploiting
    the Grid. Execution times of Binarization algorithms reported in Table 1 are related
    to one single plant of one single genotype for which 13 images have been collected
    during one month. The challenge then lies in considering 300 genotypes, with 1900
    plants in each genotype. Per day, a PhenoArch platform produces 20 000 images
    of 50 M, equivalent to 1To/day, 5To/week and 250 To/year. Without any distributed
    infrastructure, processing these huge amounts of data would take between 409 days
    and 565 days (depending on the strategy followed for the sub-workflow B). For
    this project, France-Grilles provides us with 32 000 logical process units. With
    only a subset of this resource (2%), the whole computation, scheduled by SciFloware,
    can be performed in less than 12 h (night time). Exploiting Provenance. During
    any execution, provenance data, that is, all the data items processed and produced
    (including intermediate and final images) are stored on iRODS. Based on this provenance
    information, IPython notebooks are automatically generated for each individual
    plant either at a given time, or for the entire growth period, or for a given
    genotype. Each cell of the notebook contains the script of the workflow node executed.
    The input/output data are direct references to the data produced and stored in
    iRODS. Very interestingly, users can upload a given notebook (see Fig. 10) with
    the corresponding data, and modify the execution parameters directly on their
    computer to visualize the impact of such modifications and better understand their
    results. Thus, biologists can explore the obtained results a posteriori to discover
    for instance why some outliers on the “growth curve” (see Fig. 9(E)) have appeared.
    Reasons for this situation may actually be numerous, including problems occurring
    during acquisition (e.g., the plant may have fallen…), limitation of the method
    used (bugs in the implementation…) or wrong set of parameters. Download : Download

    with a value captured by the provenance module and stored into iRODS. The two
    images displayed correspond to the plant before and after its binarization. The
    total number of pixels of the plant is 87 489, which is the last cell value. 5.
    Discussion In the last ten years, several approaches have been designed to distribute
    scientific workflows on parallel environments. Survey papers and books include  [24],
    [25], [26], [27]. While cloud computing is increasingly used to manage Life Science
    data, our project involves large numbers of production sites and collaborating
    users, and such numbers are growing over time, making Grid technologies particularly
    well-suited  [28]. More precisely, we wrap-up and discuss the four key aspects
    of our approach. First of all, the infrastructure we introduce in this paper works
    on a production environment with real and huge data sets produced on a daily basis.
    In Plant phenotyping, which is a field of growing importance in the context of
    climate change and food security  [29], [30], [31], complex datasets produced
    by high-throughput image based phenotyping platforms need to be combined with
    highly heterogeneous data. In particular, compared to classical bioinformatics
    (largely driven by molecular biology), the need in plant phenomics is on modeling,
    simulation, designing statistical approaches, and performing complex image analysis.
    This poses new challenges in data integration and calls for new kinds of analytical
    tools  [32], [33]. Second, the workflow system we use is well-established in the
    Plant community. It is well-known by our first generation users, and has very
    specific features, making it possible to perform both data analysis and simulation
    (retro-action loops, modeling) while allowing visualization of complex data. As
    shown previously in  [10], [6], OpenAlea belongs to the family of functional workflow
    systems (such as  [9], [34], [35], [36]). It provides a unique solution, which
    is able to extend the dataflow model of computation by introducing higher-order
    language constructs in a visual programming environment, thus allowing to design
    highly expressive workflows in a fully uniform way. Third, while the context of
    this work is data intensive and involves very complex experiments on huge datasets,
    we use a middleware approach to make the distribution and coordination of jobs
    transparent to the user. SciFloware is data-driven  [37] in the sense that its
    internal workflow language clearly separates the definition of data to be processed
    from the graph of activities to be applied to the data. This separation is particularly
    suited to scientific workflows where the same experiment has to be reused for
    analyzing different datasets without any change. Optimization in SciFloware focuses
    on two main aspects: it uses asynchronous messages to execute workflows on a distributed
    infrastructure such as Grid or Cloud  [37], [38]. Furthermore, while it uses generally
    coarse grain parallelism, it is able to exploit the fact that some workflow actors
    may be algebraic operators (i.e., some actors are not black-boxes) to optimize
    the workflow execution. Additionally, basing the SciFloware implementation on
    the middleware SON  [12] which follows the SAAS concept (Software as a Service)
    makes it very modular and flexible. Last but not least, we have developed a large
    series of reproducibility-friendly features. Our approach allows users to share
    their experiments in the spirit of  [39], understand and compare their results  [40]
    and possibly refine their analysis process to augment quality of their data sets.
    To do so, we have followed the recommendations and current standards on provenance  [41],
    [19] and introduced a generator of IPython/Jupyter notebooks  [2]. 6. Conclusion
    High-throughput phenotyping platforms provide a unique and particularly novel
    kind of solution to study the behavior of plants in context of climate change
    and food security. At the same time, size and complexity of datasets produced
    by such platforms are huge, constantly augmenting and the experiments to be performed
    are becoming increasingly complex, posing particularly novel challenges. This
    paper introduces the InfraPhenoGrid infrastructure we designed and deployed to
    efficiently manage the datasets produced by the PhenoArch plant phenomics platform
    in the context of the Phenome Project. Our solution consists in deploying scientific
    workflows on a Grid (France-Grilles) using a middleware to pilot workflow executions.
    InfraPhenoGrid is user-friendly in the sense that despite the intrinsic complexity
    of the infrastructure, running scientific workflows and understanding results
    obtained (using provenance information) is kept as simple as possible for end-users.
    Future work includes considering automatic transformation of scripts designed
    by scientists into OpenAlea scientific workflows to augment the size of the workflow
    library. We are also working on techniques to augment the reuse of workflows (and
    scripts) by guiding the design of such experiments  [42], [43]. Another very important
    point we are actively working on is the reproducibility of scientific results.
    From the data point-of-view, one of the main challenges lies in finding the right
    level of granularity at which visualizing and, to some extent, recording the data  [44].
    Currently, the complete datasets are kept while we investigate several techniques
    (inspired from  [42]) to reduce the amount of data stored while ensuring a good
    level of reproducibility. From the environment point-of-view, we are currently
    able to consider virtual machine techniques to reproduce a given experiment in
    the exact same conditions (same OS, software versions…). Ongoing work includes
    considering techniques to re-execute experiments in new environments, where upgraded
    versions of software are considered  [45]. Acknowledgments The authors acknowledge

    Abstract: In this contribution, an end to end system to enable user interaction
    with a distributed botanical university campus garden is designed, implemented
    and tested. The proposed system employs different wireless links to collect data
    related to different bio physiological parameters of both the vegetation mass
    and the surrounding environment. Detailed analysis of these multilevel communication
    links is performed by using deterministic volumetric wireless channel estimation
    and considering underground, near ground and over ground radio propagation conditions.
    An in-house developed technique enables accurate wireless channel characterization
    for complete campus scenario considering the multiple link types and all its composing
    elements. Node definition and network topology is thus obtained by wireless channel
    analysis of over ground, near ground and underground communication for both 868
    MHz and 2.4 GHz Wireless Sensor Networks in an inhomogeneous vegetation environment.
    Connectivity to enable user interaction as well as for telemetry and tele-control
    purposes within the campus is achieved by combining ZigBee and LoRaWAN transceivers
    with the corresponding sensor/actuator platforms. Coverage studies have been performed
    in order to assess communication capabilities in the set of multiple underground/near
    ground/over ground links, by means of deterministic channel analysis for the complete
    university campus location. Measurement results in lab environment as well as
    full system deployment are presented, showing good agreement with deterministic
    simulations. Moreover, system level tests have been performed over a physical
    campus cloud, providing adequate quality of experience metrics. The proposed solution
    is a scalable system that provides real time trees status monitoring by a cloud-based
    platform, enabling user interaction within a distributed botanical garden environment
    in the university campus. Location of Smart Campus solution, within the UPNA university
    campus. Multiple LoRa/LoRaWAN nodes have been deployed in under ground, near ground

    I. Introduction Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are being actively adopted as enablers
    for context monitoring within multiple applications and scenarios, such as environmental
    pollution [1], power grids [2], public safety [3] and agriculture [4]. However,
    the deployment of WSNs in applications focused in vegetation monitoring is challenging,
    considering inherent restrictions in terms of energy source availability, form
    factor and limited computational capacity [5]. In this sense, one of the main
    difficulties is to insure a reliable connection between nodes, especially in dense
    vegetation environments. The presence of foliage in the communication path has
    a direct impact in wireless communication system Quality of Service (QoS) values.
    This generally leads to node densification to increase coverage levels, especially
    in large areas, resulting in additional costs. Discrete scatters such as randomly
    distributed leaves, twigs, branches and tree trunks can cause attenuation, scattering,
    diffraction and absorption of the radiated waves. This severely constrains the
    design of wireless communication systems in inhomogeneous vegetation environments,
    given by the effect of foliage or multipath dispersion, among others [5]–[9].
    In order to provide communication capabilities within large coverage areas, wireless
    sensor networks provide moderate cost, flexible topology and constrained energy
    consumption. Among WSNs, LoRaWAN (Long-Range Wide-Area Network) is a long range,
    low power wireless platform that has become one of the main technologies for Internet
    of Things (IoT) networks worldwide [10], [11]. The works in [12]–[14] present
    the use of LoRaWAN technology in precision agriculture, especially in automate
    irrigation systems, climate and soil parameters monitoring. Moreover, in [15],
    [16] present LoRaWAN based smart sensing systems for environmental monitoring.
    In parallel, universities have been more aware with global warming and climate
    change issues, making more efforts to promote sustainability. The first step universities
    take toward sustainability is campus greening. Thus, campus landscape management
    is important for a green and sustainable campus [17], [18]. Campus Sustainability
    Assessments as Green Metric provide the result of online survey regarding the
    current condition and policies related to Green Campus and Sustainability in Universities
    all over the world [19]. Greenery has been even identified for stress reduction
    and emotional state balance in students [20]. In this context, the use of WSNs
    can provide more information about the state the green zones of the campus, not
    only for monitoring, but also for on-campus botanic tours in a more amenable fashion
    [21]. Considering the characteristics of a university campus in terms of size
    and the existence of multiple distributed sites/buildings, long range, low power
    platforms such as LoRaWAN enable telemetry, tele-control and interactive communication
    systems. The performance of systems that rely on WSNs depends on radio channel
    characterization and on whether vegetation is present or specific requirements
    in terms of underground or near to ground communications are required. In the
    literature, a ray-based model for scattering by tree branches has been developed
    in a pre-existent ray-tracing tool, validated with measurements results in campus
    scenario [22]. LoRa LPWAN measurements have been performed in IIUM campus to study
    the contribution to the path loss of five tree types for propagation channel modelling
    [23], and an IoT based system for water quality monitoring using WSN and RFID
    is deployed in the campus area of the University Sains Malaysia [24]. However,
    no references have been found which explore the complete set of underground, near
    ground and over ground communication links. Since trees monitoring requires measurements
    of various eco-physiological/biological parameters (e.g., stem water content,
    quality/quantity of foliage, soil parameters), sensors should be placed in specific
    locations as a function of vegetation type in order to obtain accurate readings.
    Different approaches have been described, such as a system for measuring the vegetation
    Leaf Area Index with ZigBee based WSN technology [25], a tree health condition
    monitoring system via LoRaWAN [26] or a NB-IoT based tree health monitoring system
    [27]. System deployment within this complex scenario requires accurate propagation
    modeling capabilities for underground, near ground and over-ground links, for
    both Line of Sight (LoS) and Non-Line of Sight (NLoS) cases. Therefore, it is
    compulsory to perform radio propagation analysis when deploying a WSN. The works
    in [28]–[30] analyse the effect of soil and present link quality characterization
    for underground to underground and underground to above ground communication.
    The possibility of using magnetic induction communication for wireless underground
    sensor network designed for irrigation control is addressed in [31]. The works
    in [32]–[34] present near-ground radio channel propagation in the presence of
    vegetation. Furthermore, path loss models for wireless sensor nodes deployed in
    short and tall grass environments are presented in [35], [36]. The works in [37]–[41]
    present wireless propagation measurements and path loss models for WSN in forest
    environments. Table 1 summarizes the research works related to the use of wireless
    communications in vegetation environments. TABLE 1 Related Work In this work,
    a distributed system implemented to enable user interaction with the distributed
    botanical garden at the university campus of the Public University of Navarre
    (UPNA) is presented. Node design and network deployment are optimized by means
    of detailed wireless propagation analysis considering complex operation conditions
    in underground, near ground and over ground communications. To this aim, specific
    characterization and simulation models have been implemented in the framework
    of an in-house implemented deterministic volumetric ray launching simulation tool,
    previously tested in different scenarios, including vegetation [42], [43]. In
    this way, coverage relations are obtained for each communication link type. To
    our knowledge, it is the first time to propose and test the characterization of
    all the communication link types (underground, near ground and over ground) by
    means of deterministic techniques. Experimental and system level validations with
    the implemented testbed have been carried out at the UPNA campus, located in the
    city of Pamplona, Spain. As a final stage, a monitoring distributed wireless system
    has been implemented for the UPNA campus botanical park in addition to the multilevel
    underground, near-ground and over-ground wireless link assessment. Thus the system
    is divided into multiple/seven ZigBee-based zonal collection networks which gather
    the information provided by the sensors deployed on trees, and a LoRaWAN campus-wide
    communication network which sends the information of each ZigBee network to a
    central gateway. The system is completed with the implementation of a real-time
    tree monitoring application, a cloud-based architecture, and a physical cloud
    infrastructure, all of the set allows performing in depth tests and analysis on
    campus premises. In Fig. 1, it is shown a schematic overview of the different
    tasks developed, as well as the results obtained in this work Fig. 1. FIGURE 1.
    Schematic overview of the tasks developed in relation with the design, implementation
    and analysis of the proposed UPNA Smart Campus system. Show All The paper is organized
    as follows. Section II describes wireless channel characterization for near ground,
    over ground and underground links. Section III presents the link analysis applied
    to provide wireless system planning, for LoRaWAN and ZigBee network nodes. System
    validation and end to end data transmission are discussed in Section IV. Concluding
    remarks are offered in Section V. SECTION II. Underground, Near-Ground and Over-Ground
    Wireless Channel Assessment in Campus Environment With the aim of optimizing both
    the design and deployment of the proposed distributed system, wireless channel
    analysis for the complete UPNA campus must be performed to determine coverage
    distributions thus providing the initial wireless system planning. In this section,
    once presented the campus scenario, the multiple level wireless link types are
    studied: underground, near-ground and over-ground links. Link types are defined
    based on the wireless node transmitter antenna height. A. Campus Environment Under
    Analysis The UPNA campus covers approximately a surface of 170000 m2 and a volume
    of over 5.1 million m3. It has one central building, one library building, seven
    department buildings and elements such as sitting benches and hundreds of trees.
    In fact, it contains 99 different species, a variety of different trees and a
    dozen relevant shrub species [44]. This vegetation mass harmonically surrounds
    the campus buildings and is distributed in various landscaped areas, with the
    aim of conforming a distributed botanical garden. As shown in Fig. 2, the campus
    is divided into five main parks: the Park of Navarre, the English Park, the Asian
    and European Park, the American, African and Oceanic Park and finally the Rectorate
    Park. FIGURE 2. Location of the five parks that conform the distributed botanical
    garden at the Public University of Navarre. Show All In this work, the seven main
    types of trees distributed in five of the total parks within the campus are considered:
    Yew trees, pine trees, olive trees, holly trees, arbutus trees, magnolias trees
    and holm oak trees. The tree types can be easily recognized because each one grows
    next to a university department building that bears its name. This setting constitutes
    a distributed botanical garden aimed to promote dissemination of agroforestry
    knowledge [44]. B. 3D Ray Launching Simulation Tool With the aim of providing
    in depth understanding of the behavior of the multilevel wireless links present
    in this complex environment, a 3D-RL algorithm has been employed. The 3D-RL algorithm
    has been implemented in-house, based on Geometrical Optics (GO) and Geometrical
    Theory of Diffraction (GTD), optimized with hybrid simulation techniques in order
    to reduce computational cost. As an example, the garden surrounding the Los Tejos
    building has been analyzed and the simulation scenario implemented. The scenario
    has 110 m in length, 31 m width and 15m height. Fig. 3a shows a real picture of
    the scenario, and Fig. 3b shows the 3D-RL simulation scenario. FIGURE 3. Garden
    scenario for simulation in the 3D Ray Launching Simulator (a) real view and (b)
    schematic view. Show All All the existing elements at the garden such as trunk
    trees, foliage, streetlights and grass have been taken into account in order to
    obtain accurate radio propagation estimations. To this extent, the frequency dispersive
    characteristics of the dielectric constant and conductivity of the materials for
    the specific operation frequency have been taken in consideration. Table 2 presents
    the material properties (dielectric constant and conductivity) of all the elements
    considered. TABLE 2 Material Properties for the 3D Ray Launching Simulation The
    dielectric constant ε r and conductivity σ of tree foliage varies with humidity
    h as per (1) and (2): ε rfoliage = σ foliage = 137 h 3 −69.688 h 2 +23.385h+1.4984
    1.1541 h 3 −0.5489 h 2 +0.1669h−0.0004 (1) (2) View Source For this study, 20%
    humidity level has been considered. Simulation results have been obtained for
    the complete scenario volume. As an example, RF power distribution planes for
    different receiver heights are presented in Fig. 4, for both 2.4 GHz (ZigBee)
    and 868 MHz (LoRaWAN) bands. In order to simulate near ground and over ground
    conditions, two different transmitter antenna heights were conf: 0.1m and 1.1m.
    Simulation parameters have been chosen to agree with the measurement equipment
    setup, which will be analyzed in the following subsection. FIGURE 4. Estimated
    RF power level distributions for 868 MHz for (a) Tx = 0.1m; (b) Tx = 1.1m; and
    for 2.4 GHz for (c) Tx = 0.1m; (d) Tx = 1.1m. Show All C. Near-Ground and Over-Ground
    Wireless Link Assessment As a first step to perform the analysis of the multiple
    communication link types, over-ground and near-ground propagation conditions were
    considered, since accurate measurements of tree’s eco-physiological/biological
    parameters requires sensors placed at different height on the tree. Therefore,
    the multiple positions of the nodes leading to the different link types have been
    included in the wireless channel analysis. Received power and Received Signal
    Strength Indicator (RSSI) values have been measured while transmitter nodes were
    placed at different heights T x of 0.1m and 1.1m from the ground, corresponding
    to usual operating conditions of devices in near to ground and over the ground
    locations, respectively. Both transmitters were communicating with both receiver
    nodes placed at the same heights resulting in a near-ground to near-ground communication,
    near-ground to over-ground communication, over-ground to near-ground communication
    and over-ground to over-ground communication schemes. Measurements have been performed
    along both LoS and NLoS link paths, as it is schematically shown in Fig. 5a. Thus,
    these experiments will determine communication QoS parameters between nodes attached
    to trees in Los Tejos garden (see Fig. 5b). The distance between two trees in
    the same row is approximately 6.5m, and the distance between two rows is 9.5m.
    Los Tejos was chosen owing to the complexity of the scenario in terms of vegetation
    density and location. Nodes were placed over, near and under the ground. FIGURE
    5. (a) Details of the measurement setup for the near ground and over the ground
    communication links. (b) 3D-RL view of over-ground, near-ground and underground
    communication links considered in the scenario under analysis. Show All Wireless
    channel measurements have been performed using Libelium 868 MHz nodes, 2.4 GHz
    ZigBee nodes and a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) tuned at 2.4 GHz. Transmitted
    power of the ZigBee nodes was 25 dBm at 868 MHz and 17 dBm at 2.4 GHz. Received
    power measurements have been performed with an Agilent N9912 Field Fox portable
    spectrum analyzer. For the received power measurements at 2.4 GHz, an omnidirectional
    antenna has been connected to the VCO with a transmit power of 8.38 dBm. The RSSI
    has been measured using Libelium ZigBee nodes operating at 868 MHz and 2.4 GHz.
    Receiver sensitivity of the ZigBee nodes was −112 dBm at 868 MHz and −102 dBm
    at 2.4 GHz. Fig. 6 shows the received power and RSSI results for both transmitter
    and receiver placed at 0.1m and 1.1m from the ground, for LoS and NLoS path cases.
    It can be seen that over ground to over ground links exhibit the highest received
    power level, given by lower obstruction in such links. Measurements have been
    performed at a maximum distance of 65m in the case of 2.4GHz (Fig. 6c), to avoid
    unwanted effects of detected interferences in the 2.4GHz ISM band. FIGURE 6. (a)
    Received power and (b) RSSI (dBm) at different Tx and Rx heights for 868 MHz;
    (c) and (d) the same for 2.4 GHz. Show All Once the measurements were carried
    out, simulations were performed, in order to validate the presented 3D-RL tool.
    For that purpose, simulation and measurements results at 868 MHz are compared
    in Fig. 7. Both heights of T x =0.1 m and T x =1.1 are included. FIGURE 7. Comparison
    between the measured and the simulated results for 868 MHz radio frequency; (a)
    for Tx = 0.1m, and (b) Tx = 1.1m. Show All Table 3 summarizes the measurements
    vs. simulations results, with the obtained mean error and standard deviation.
    TABLE 3 Measurements vs. Simulations Comparison for Near-Ground and Overground
    Communication at 868 MHz Mean error values for received power estimations are
    given by using equation (3): x= ∑ n i=1 | P mi [dBm]− P si [dBm]| n (3) View Source
    with P m the measured received power, P s the simulated received power and n the
    number of the measurement points. As it can be observed in Table 3, higher errors
    occur when the transmitter (Tx) is placed on the ground (i.e. 0.1m) while lower
    errors appear when the transmitter is placed over-ground (i.e. at 1.1m height).
    These errors are further reduced in the case of over-ground to over-ground communication
    links (Tx and Rx at height of 1.1m. Large deviations in the estimation of received
    power levels mainly at closer distances to the transmitter as well as in the case
    of transmitter locations in near-ground configuration. This is given by the fact
    that near ground communications are influenced by phenomena such as surface wave
    coupling, which are not intrinsically considered following deterministic physical
    optics approach. Moreover, the implemented ground model considers a macroscopic
    homogeneous soil layer with dispersive material properties considered for a specific
    humidity level. Finally, a thin homogeneous grass layer has been implemented.
    Effects such as non-homogeneous soil/humidity distributions and small-scale diffraction
    and scattering effects from individual grass filaments increase average error
    values and will be considered in future models. D. Underground Wireless Link Assessment
    The use of underground nodes is required for soil parameters measurement (e.g.,
    moisture levels, scatterer density such as roots, rocks, etc.), which have a direct
    influence on tree health assessment. Radio propagation measurements have been
    performed to characterize communication links between a node placed underground
    and a node placed on the ground surface. In order to obtain accurate results,
    a container of 50/50/50 cm full of soil has been used, as depicted in Fig. 8.
    FIGURE 8. Schematic view of the measurement setup implemented for the underground
    link. Show All Received power, Delta RSSI (the difference between the received
    power and the RSSI), path loss and received packets in terms of the difference
    between the RSSI for propagation in both soil and air have been measured. Measurements
    were obtained for increments of 10 cm under the soil up to 50 cm of distance between
    the underground transmitter node and the receiver which is placed on the soil,
    as shown in Fig. 8. Measurement results are depicted in Fig. 9 plots. FIGURE 9.
    (a) Received power and Delta RSSI at 868 MHz and 2.4 GHz, (b) path loss at the
    same frequencies, (c) difference between the received packets RSSI for propagation
    in both soil and air at 868 MHz and (d) 2.4 GHz. Show All The results show that
    high losses are present at short distances, mainly given by the power extinction
    rate and the impedance mismatch between the node antenna and the surrounding soil
    medium. Impedance mismatching depends on the frequency dispersive dielectric constant
    values but also on the location conditions of the antenna/soil interfaces, which,
    in turn, also impact on both matching conditions (similar to the case of radome
    location with respect to an antenna radiating surface, owing to the existence
    of a stationary wave condition) and on the inter symbol interference [45], [46].
    Path losses are within the range of 55 dB to 72 dB at 868 MHz and in the range
    of 68 dB to 76 dB at 2.4GHz (see Table 4). Differences in losses can also be due
    to other factors, such as the surface wave coupling, which in the case of near
    ground communication are more relevant as operational frequency decreases, usually
    below the UHF/microwave range, out of the scope of the transceivers employed in
    this work. Another critical factor of influence is the transmitted waveform which
    should be specifically designed to counteract the effects of frequency dispersion
    to provide larger links [46]. Finally, although the measured losses for the underground
    links are high, it is important to note that the received RF power levels at 50cm
    distance/depth are greater than the sensitivity thresholds of the nodes, and therefore,
    adequate to enable a communication link between the underground and near-ground
    nodes, where all the transmitted packets are received. TABLE 4 Path Loss Range
    for Underground Communication SECTION III. Implementation of the Distributed Wireless
    System for the Monitoring of The Botanical Park Once the different wireless link
    types involved in the presented environment have been assessed, this section describes
    the radio planning tasks that validate the deployment of the LoRaWAN devices for
    the monitoring system of the botanical park of the UPNA campus. Due to the large
    size of the scenario to be covered, and the high number of wireless nodes that
    are necessary to monitor all the trees and shrub species, two differentiated wireless
    networks are proposed. On the one hand, since the area covered by the flora is
    extensive, instead of a unique network, several sub-networks have been proposed,
    based on ZigBee technology (see Fig. 10). ZigBee technology provides the possibility
    of having a large number of nodes within the same network (up to 65,000), therefore,
    the high number of present flora elements can be monitored in each sub-network,
    while at the same time allows scalability. ZigBee also allows mesh topology, which
    makes the network more robust against wireless link falls. Therefore, this study
    has focused on the LoRaWAN network, since its star topology needs point-to-point
    evaluation (beside the presence of obstacles such as buildings), while ZigBee’s
    mesh topology and the distances between ZigBee devices within a single sub-network
    are short and do not require extra radio planning tasks. FIGURE 10. Schematic
    view of the simulation scenario implemented to analyze the campus botanical monitoring
    system, in which each one of the LoRaWAN/ZigBee sub-networks is presented. Show
    All While ZigBee can be considered as a medium range wireless technology (which
    if low power consumption is wanted, the range becomes much shorter), a long range
    wireless technology has been proposed in order to send/transport the collected
    information of all the ZigBee sub-networks to a centralized gateway. For that
    purpose, three different technologies were assessed: NB-IoT, SigFox and LoRaWAN.
    All of them provided good coverage on campus, but even if LoRaWAN is the only
    one that needs the deployment of gateways (see Fig. 10), we opted for LoRaWAN
    because it does not require extra costs for the provided service after the deployment
    of the network, while SigFox and NB-IoT solutions require fee payments. The proposed
    LoRaWAN wireless network has been evaluated as follows. The 3D-RL simulation tool
    has been employed to obtain an optimized deployment for the LoRaWAN gateway. Once
    a placement for the LoRaWAN gateway is obtained based on simulations, LoRaWAN
    communication measurements between each garden with a specific tree type (where
    the ZigBee sub-networks are deployed) and the LoRaWAN gateway within the campus
    (the central node in Fig. 10) have been performed. As in the ZigBee case, different
    node heights have been considered. Received packets, RSSI and SNR were measured.
    A. 3D Ray Launching for LoRaWAN In order to provide full campus connectivity,
    the local sub-networks operate in conjunction with campus wide networks. Therefore,
    an additional deterministic radio planning study has been performed to obtain
    information about the feasibility of the proposed WSN for the whole campus. A
    view of the complete schematic campus model developed for the simulations is illustrated
    in Fig. 11. The campus of the Public University of Navarre scenario dimensions
    are 590 m long, 290 m width and 30 m height. FIGURE 11. Campus scenario for simulation
    in the 3D Ray Launching Simulator (a) real view and (b) schematic view and (c)
    a zoomed part of the scenario. Show All All the existing elements at the campus,
    such as trunk tree, foliage, streetlights, grass, benches, vehicles, and metallic
    elements, have been considered, making a simulation volume of 5.1 million m3.
    Table 5 presents the frequency dispersive material properties of the elements
    within the campus scenario. TABLE 5 3D RL Material Properties for the Campus Scenario
    Fig. 12 illustrates the coverage maps for receivers placed at different heights
    H 1 =2 m, H 2 =4 m and H 3 =6 m from the ground, and transmitters placed at Los
    Tejos building in Fig. 12 (a) and Las Encinas in Fig. 12 (b), at a height of 1.1
    m from the ground. It is worth noting that results have been obtained for the
    complete simulation volume, although they are represented in bi-dimensional constant
    height cut-plane for the sake of clarity. Los Tejos and Las Encinas buildings
    simulations results were chosen because of their locations within the campus context.
    FIGURE 12. Estimated RF power distribution planes obtained by 3D RL at different
    heights for a transmitter placed at (a) Los Tejos building, and (b) Las Encinas
    building. Show All Results show that coverage distributions at the height of 4m
    are better than the two other heights for both transmitters. Thus, placing the
    gateway at 4m from the ground provides higher received power levels and hence,
    communication link quality metrics with the nodes. Fig. 13 shows the coverage
    intersection of both transmitters. The results from transmitters placed at other
    buildings are compatible with this conclusion. FIGURE 13. Coverage intersection
    for transmitters placed at Los tejos and Las Encinas buildings. Show All B. LoRaWan
    Measurements In order to analyze and validate LoRaWan system deployment, The Thing
    Network (TTN) nodes have been attached to trees from all the seven types within
    the campus. Measurements have been conducted with the TTN nodes placed on the
    ground and at a height of 1.1m from the ground. The transmitted power and the
    sensitivity of the TTN nodes are 14 dBm and −148 dBm respectively. Following the
    simulations results and Fig. 13, the TTN gateway has been placed at the library,
    which is located at the center of the campus for an optimal communication link
    with all the deployed nodes. Fig. 2 illustrates the locations of the TTN nodes
    and gateway and Fig. 14 shows the deployed devices for the measurement campaigns.
    FIGURE 14. LoRaWAN system campaign: location of the different nodes within the
    campus, as well as the TTN gateway. Show All Received packets, RSSI and Signal-to-Noise
    Ratio (SNR) results have been obtained from direct communication between the TTN
    nodes in order to perform physical layer as well as preliminary system level validation.
    Fig. 15 depicts the results achieved for different node locations, placed at both
    0.1m and 1.1m from the ground, and the gateway placed at 4m from the ground. FIGURE
    15. Near ground and over ground TTN nodes to gateway results: (a) RSSI, (b) SNR,
    (c) received packets/RSSI and (d) received packets/SNR. Show All The results show
    that received power level are in general higher in over ground conditions, with
    an RSSI average difference in the order of 5-8dB between near ground and over
    ground links, consistent with losses given to ground/signal interaction. These
    results lead to improved performance in quality of experience metrics, such as
    those given by SNR and percentage of successful received packets. Hence, transceiver
    location within near ground leads to increased losses, which must be considered
    in the deployment phase to perform adequate coverage analysis and hence, optimal
    node location. SECTION IV. System Validation and Application Development Once
    a complete model for the different communication links within the distributed
    campus garden has been developed, a real scenario in terms of end users for trees
    monitoring within the campus has been tested for system validation. System validation
    is given by wireless communication between the sensor nodes and the Cayenne platform.
    The sensor nodes are communicating with the coordinator via ZigBee. Then, the
    coordinator sends data to the TTN gateway via LoRaWAN technology. The collected
    data is sent to the Cayenne platform for storage and display. A schema of all
    the communication steps for system validation is illustrated in Fig. 16. FIGURE
    16. (a) Functional diagram of the measurements system; (b) Developed application
    blocks and features. Show All Users can check the real time data of the tree parameters
    or revise the history of the last hour, day, week, month or year using cayenne’s
    webpage or application, which is available on both Apple and Android. Fig. 17
    illustrates some of the platform features. FIGURE 17. (a) End user platform for
    trees monitoring; (b) Temperature history plot for the mobile application. Show
    All After successful communication tests, a purpose specific application has been
    implemented. The developed application is divided into two main services, monitor
    and guide, as shown in Fig. 18. The monitor part is dedicated in the first place
    to gardeners and campus staff for data analysis and decision making. To contribute
    directly to sustainability in green campuses and water saving. By selecting the
    desired tree type, user can select the exact tree number for sensors information
    display. For each tree, user can read the following sensor data: Air temperature
    and humidity, sun light, leaf wetness, soil temperature and moisture. FIGURE 18.
    The developed UPNA Botanical Garden application, compatible with desktop, Tablet
    and mobile platforms. Bottom right, a picture of real time tree data monitoring
    within the UPNA campus. Show All Moreover, the application guides new students
    and visitors through the gardens of the campus through the guide section. By selecting
    the desired park, visitors can see a schema of the park, containing the names
    of all the existing trees and species with its location at the park. Also, a walking
    path for assuring a valuable experience for visitors. For an easy use, the application
    is compatible with mobile, Tablet and desktop, as it is shown in Fig. 18. In addition
    to the Cayenne environment, a specific platform called InGaM (Interactive Garden
    Monitor) has been developed for monitoring the campus garden of the Public University
    of Navarre. This platform, whose architecture is depicted in Fig. 19, is based
    on Apache and Elasticsearch’s components. Data collected by the WSN network can
    be injected directly into the platform, or it can be imported as often as desired
    from the Cayenne platform. In addition, the platform allows importing meteorological
    information from the national and regional meteorological networks [48], [49],
    in addition to municipal [50] and regional geographical open-data [51]. FIGURE
    19. Platform architecture and network hardware employed for the UPNA Botanical
    Garden application integration. Show All Data harvesting may be heterogeneous
    in terms of data model, so Apache Nifi allows data transformation and provides
    ETL functionalities (extract, transform and load) to ensure the arrival of quality,
    consistent and standardized data in the NGSI-LD data format to the platform. According
    to the data source, the data is distributed into message queues managed by the
    Apache Kafka component, which allows the use of the publish/subscribe paradigm.
    Data recovery, previously structured by Nifi and arranged by Kafka, is stored
    by means of the Elasticsearch component. Finally, visualization is provided by
    the Kibana component. All the components (Nifi, Kafka, Kibana and elasticsearch)
    are well-known and widely used software components. As a parallel learning mechanism,
    there is a data analysis module based on Python, Keras and TensorFlow, which enables
    fast experimentation with deep neural networks. Currently, InGaM has just accomplished
    its implementation and validation phase, and as enough data is harvested, data
    analysis will begin. SECTION V. Conclusion In this work, an interactive and distributed
    botanical university campus garden end to end system is proposed. Deterministic
    wireless channel analysis has been performed, considering a full set of communication
    links that includes underground, near ground and over ground communications. Precise
    coverage estimations for the complete volume of a very large and complex scenario,
    such as UPNA campus have been obtained, for communication links at 868MHz and
    2.4GHz frequency bands. The results have allowed the deployment of the sensor
    nodes, employing ZigBee protocol and data communication links, based in LoRaWAN.
    Simulation along with measurement results indicate the differences and limitations
    within the different communication links under analysis, establishing the maximum
    link distance for each one of underground, near ground and over ground link types.
    System level validation has been performed, initially on a Cayenne platform and
    afterwards a purpose specific dual application and in-house implemented cloud-based
    architecture. Measurement results show the viability of the system in terms of
    communication link availability as well on the successful reception of both telemonitoring
    data (for asset management) as well as those related with visitor interaction.
    Future work is foreseen in higher levels of sensor integration, as well as in
    interoperability of the data management system at operational level with the Pamplona
    Smart City platform. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More

    and their citizens have led the largest changes that have been taking place continuously,
    especially since the transition from an agricultural economy to an industrial
    one. This phenomenon is especially significant from the mid-eighteenth century
    and it will become more intense if the predictions that establish that, around
    the year 2050, approximately 70% of the world population will concentrate in some
    type of city finally come true. With these boundary conditions, it is evident
    that the achievement of more efficient and sustainable cities is an unavoidable
    objective for which politicians, managers and technicians must work in order to
    guarantee the quality of life of their citizens. Although this paradigm of sustainability
    and efficiency has always been present in the managers of cities, it has not been
    until very recently that technology has made available to the responsible parties
    a plethora of possibilities that, when properly employed, translate into significant
    savings. At the same time, the day-to-day improvement of the citizens is consolidating
    a new urban concept in which the different processes and systems that occur in
    it are continuously monitored in both time and space. This paper reviews the evolution
    of one of the pioneering examples of such cities, Santander, where an Internet
    of the Things infrastructure was deployed a decade ago. In this time, multiple
    technologies and services have been developed and deployed in smart city pilots.
    The paper discusses the key lessons learnt from the digitalization of the city
    and the new challenges that have arisen as we were paving the way for a smarter
    and more liveable city. Similar content being viewed by others RETRACTED ARTICLE:

    access 13 June 2023 1 Introduction The smart city market is still largely fragmented,
    with vertical solutions dominating and horizontal solutions more mirroring experimental
    petri dishes rather than solutions to real problems. This results in below-critical
    mass efforts in standardisation and commodity solutions. Vendor lock-in thus dictates
    the landscape, resulting in lowering cities’ confidence that smart city strategies
    can achieve a major change. Conversely, the fragmentation of emerging IoT-enabled
    city platforms makes it difficult for entrepreneurs and SMEs to achieve economies
    of scale by replicating innovative solutions from one city to another. In this
    sense, planning to effectively meet the conditions and realities of a post-carbon,
    climate responsible world will require a shift in our current understanding of
    what constitutes good urban design and planning. Many of the practices that we
    now take for granted, such as planning cities around automobile transportation
    and zoning for single uses, will no longer be economically, environmentally, or
    culturally viable. Smart cities hold the potential to be a key driver and catalyst
    in creating a large-scale global IoT market of services and hardware [1]. However,
    the emerging smart city market faces specific challenges that act as barriers
    to growth, impeding rapid innovation and inhibiting widespread market adoption.
    In this paper we are reviewing the key lessons learnt gathered from the experience
    of a decade of developing and deploying smart city services in the city of Santander,
    Spain. Based on this, we are proposing some of the key challenges that should
    be addressed in order to bring the smart city paradigm a step forward. In this
    sense, we are foreseeing four key objectives that should be pursued: (1) Scaling
    city platforms without vendor and/or city lock-in; (2) Developing services that
    really meet citizens’ needs; (3) Guaranteeing resilient wireless connectivity
    in massive 5G scenarios; (4) Encouraging new high-value data sources beyond open
    data. The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes
    the history of the SmartSantander ecosystem consolidation by briefly sketching
    the projects that have been carried out and presenting how they have contributed
    to the evolution of the city. In the path that these projects have opened some
    fundamental lessons have been learnt, which are also summarized. In Sect. 3, the
    way forward is outlined by identifying the crucial challenges that have to be
    addressed in order to fulfil the aforementioned key objectives. The high-level
    framework for addressing these challenges is also presented. Finally, existing
    related work and initiatives already developing innovative solutions for these
    challenges are also reviewed in Sect. 3. Last but not least, some concluding remarks
    are highlighted in Sect. 4. 2 SmartSantander Lessons Learnt This section presents
    the three key pillars of the SmartSantander evolution and the three key lessons
    learnt that we have concluded. These lessons learnt are based on our developments
    around the SmartSantander concept evolution as a successful case of the implementation
    of the smart city paradigm. 2.1 SmartSantander Evolution The objectives of SmartSantander’s
    developments are two-fold as well as concurrent. As a testbed, it enables experimental
    assessment of cutting-edge scientific research. However, this testbed goes beyond
    the experimental validation of novel IoT technologies. It also aims at supporting
    the assessment of the socio-economical acceptance of new IoT solutions and the
    quantification of service usability and performance with end users in the loop.
    For instance, it simultaneously supports the trial and subsequent provisioning
    of smart city services. In the following subsections, a brief summary of three
    key factors that have structured the evolution of the SmartSantander approach
    is presented. 2.1.1 Massive Deployment of IoT Devices The deployment, influenced
    by Santander Municipality’s strategic smart-city service requirements, intentionally
    provided a concentration of IoT devices in the city centre (a 1 km2 area) in order
    to achieve the maximum possible impact on the citizens. Nonetheless, other city
    areas are also covered. Figure 1 shows an excerpt view of the deployment. The
    different markers represent the deployed nodes (e.g. illuminance, sound pressure
    level, ambient temperature, mobile nodes or car presence detection sensors). Fig.
    1 Santander IoT infrastructure deployment excerpt view Full size image The SmartSantander
    testbed is composed of around 3000 IEEE 802.15.4 devices, 200 GPRS modules and
    2000 joint NFC tag/QR code labels deployed both at static locations (streetlights,
    facades, bus stops) as well as on-board mobile vehicles (buses, taxis). Moreover,
    smartphones belonging to citizens who have downloaded the Pulso de la Ciudad App
    [2] are also part of the testbed infrastructure. To attract the widest interest
    and demonstrate its usefulness, the deployment of the IoT experimentation infrastructure
    has been undertaken to create interesting use-cases that will generate an impact.
    In this respect, application areas have been selected based on their high potential
    impact on the citizens. Diversity, dynamics and scale of the IoT environment are
    also taken into consideration in the selection of application use cases: Environmental
    Monitoring: Around 2000 IoT devices installed (mainly in the city centre), on
    lampposts and facades provide measurements of different environmental parameters,
    such as temperature, CO, noise or light). Mobile Environmental Monitoring: In
    order to extend the aforementioned environmental monitoring use case, apart from
    measuring at static points, devices located in vehicles retrieve environmental
    parameters (related to air pollution). Sensors are installed in 150 public vehicles,
    including buses, taxis and police cars. Outdoor Parking: Almost 400 parking sensors
    (based on ferromagnetic technology), buried under the asphalt, have been installed
    in the main parking areas of the city centre in order to detect parking site availability
    in these zones (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Smart City services examples at Santander Full
    size image Traffic Intensity Monitoring: Around 60 devices have been deployed
    at the main entrances to the city of Santander to measure the main traffic condition
    parameters, such as traffic volumes, road occupancy, and vehicle speed or queue
    length. Parks and gardens irrigation: In order to make irrigation as efficient
    as possible, around 50 devices have been deployed in two green zones of the city
    to monitor irrigation-related parameters such as moisture temperature and humidity,
    rain precipitation or wind conditions. NFC/QR tags: More than 2000 tags have been
    deployed and distributed throughout different strategic locations. These tags
    are mainly at transportation points (bus stops, taxi ranks, etc…), points of interest
    (monuments, etc…) and shops. All the information provided is online and can be
    updated at any time. Every time one of these tags is read, an observation is generated
    including information relating to the reader. Participatory sensing: In this scenario,
    mobile phones are used as sensing devices automatically feeding information from
    the device’s built-in sensors such as GPS, compass, noise or temperature into
    the SmartSantander platform. Users can also participate by manually reporting
    events or incidences occurring in the city, which will subsequently be propagated
    to other users who are subscribed to the respective type of events (Fig. 1). The
    deployment of IoT devices to compose the SmartSantander infrastructure has been
    motivated both by requirements for ‘in-situ’ experimentation and by the aforementioned
    smart city services. The details of the SmartSantander’s IoT devices regarding
    hardware specifications, deployment locations and network organization have been
    thoroughly described in [3, 4]. 2.1.2 Service Provision One of the instruments
    of the strategy of Santander for sustainable development has been starting and
    performing a progressive enhancement of its Smart City dimension. The SmartSantander
    project [5] has been a clear milestone that has opened a wide variety of research
    lines converting the city in a kind of urban laboratory. Within the objectives
    of this initiative, the improvement of the quality of municipality services is
    paramount but also the contribution to the reactivation of the regional economic
    fabric is a heavyweight aim. The facility was conceived not only to act as a testbed
    for research with IoT technologies, but also for the development and evaluation
    of IoT enabled Smart City services and applications. To build such facility, the
    project analysed, designed and developed several services that were ranked as
    a priority by the local authorities, regional government and end users, which
    are described next. Environmental Monitoring: Due to global warming, governments
    around the world are devoting significant effort and resources to the management
    of the environment. The city of Santander, likewise, is involved in this activity
    and it is trying to carry out an effective policy for environmental management.
    Parking Management: With the aim of reducing CO emissions and other pollutants,
    as well as petrol consumption, ICT are becoming a transversal enabler. Drivers
    looking for available parking places within the city may use both smartphone applications
    as well as panels installed in the city. Traffic intensity: The assessment and
    classification of vehicles in road traffic is mainly accomplished by inductive
    loops placed under the pavement. These inductive loops allow monitoring vehicle
    passing and provide us information on several parameters of the traffic (vehicle
    speed, traffic congestion and traffic accidents, among others). The information
    is sent to the SmartSantander platform. Parks and gardens irrigation: The service
    is aimed at complementing the automated irrigation systems currently deployed
    at parks and gardens within the city of Santander. It offers a wide data set acquired
    in a distributed way, gathering the information of interest from multiple locations
    within each area. Agricultural IoT devices and weather stations have been deployed
    in three major parks of Santander. All the information captured by the sensors
    is sent to the SmartSantander platform and merged on an application that provides
    parks management technicians with accurate information on the green areas status.
    Tourist and Cultural information: In the majority of cities, there is a huge amount
    of information that may be of interest for tourists and citizens, but it is not
    readily accessible because it is so disperse. To avoid that, a service has been
    implemented to unify the way to access all data sources and presenting them in
    a context-sensitive, location-aware manner to the end users using Augmented Reality
    (AR) technology (Fig. 2). The service includes information about more than 2700
    places in the city of Santander, classified in different categories: beaches,
    parks and gardens, monuments, buildings, tourist offices, shops, art galleries,
    libraries, bus stops, taxi ranks, bicycle hire points, parking lots and sports
    centres. Furthermore, it allows real-time access to traffic and beach cameras,
    weather reports and forecasts, public bus information and bike hire service, generating
    a unique ecosystem for end users when moving around the city. Participatory Sensing:
    The service aims at exploiting the use of citizens’ smartphones to make people
    to take an active role in the generation of data for the SmartSantander Platform.
    Citizens, Santander City Council and the local newspaper are connected through
    the SmartSantander platform so that they can report, share and be notified of
    events happening in the city. Users also utilise their mobile phones to send physical
    sensing information, e.g. GPS coordinates, compass, environmental data such as
    noise, temperature, etc., feeding this information into the same platform. Municipal
    services were reorganized to adopt this application as the main way to report
    incidences. This has permitted to improve the response time to the citizen claims
    reducing the time to find out a solution for an incidence from 40.76 to 13.2 days.
    2.1.3 Co-creation Co-creation as a strategy where diverse stakeholders collaborate
    and produce a mutually beneficial product/service together was a crucial element
    of SmartSantander development. The SmartSantander facility provides the possibility
    that different stakeholders within the smart cities can co-create new services
    and innovative applications that can be tested and validated under real conditions
    in the urban landscape. SmartSantander has accomplished the concept of co-creation
    by opening its infrastructure and platform to third-party developers, entrepreneurs
    and companies for them to try their novel ideas over a real-world environment
    where not only a real infrastructure is available but also a complete living lab
    has been created (i.e. real users, real policies, real impairments, etc.). The
    SmartSantander experimentation tier consists of various components (deployed services
    and applications, template applications or libraries) that facilitate the building
    of applications and services for experimentation with them. At this level, any
    experimenter might develop and deploy its own services (e.g., a website, a web
    service, a desktop application or a smartphone application) that interact with
    the platform through the Experimentation as a Service (EaaS) Application Programming
    Interfaces (API). All applications at this tier have to be authorized and users
    utilizing them (either experimenters or services’ users) can be authenticated
    and authorized to interact with the various services/assets exposed by the platform.
    On this level, SmartSantander’s facility provides a set of user interfaces that
    aims to facilitate the experimentation and co-creation activities: (1) a User
    Interface (UI) for discovering assets and the corresponding metadata associated
    to them like ranking and comments; (2) a portal for defining, managing and monitoring
    experiments during their life cycle; (3) Web and Smartphone Applications or Services
    for gathering annotations or any other data provided by the users; and (4) another
    UI for interacting with the different communities participating in each experiment.
    2.2 Lessons Learnt From the experience that have been gathered throughout the
    years of evolution of the SmartSantander ecosystem, we discuss in the following
    sub-sections three aspects that are crucial for the development of smart cities.
    2.2.1 Necessary Infrastructure Deployment The baseline fabric of a smart city
    is surely the infrastructure that it has deployed. In this respect, what is meant
    with a smart city is the creation of a system of systems that is conscious about
    itself and that can adapt to the situation dynamically. Basically, we want the
    city to behave as a smart living entity. For this to happen, it is necessary to
    have sensors that makes the system aware of what is going on in the city. Also
    actuators that receives the commands and modify its behaviour to optimize their
    performance. It is likewise necessary to have the networks that bring the information
    back and forward in a secure and reliable way and respecting the quality and grade
    of service required. Without this sensing, actuating and communicating infrastructure
    deployed, developing a smart city is simply not possible. However, as we have
    learnt from the experience gathered in Santander, two important aspects have to
    be observed during the necessary infrastructure deployment. Firstly, there is
    already a lot of infrastructure deployed in the city. It is possible that some
    of it could already be useful as the aforementioned smart city fabric. Other,
    might only need some adaptations to be part of it. In other words, most of the
    times it is not a clean-slate start when a city embarks itself into its smart
    transformation, thus, it is sensible to create a portfolio of “sensors”, “actuators”
    and “networks” that the city has. Secondly, it is not necessary that all the systems
    that encompass the city are equally smart (or even smart at all). Making all the
    city services smart at the same time is plainly non-sense. Gradual and cyclical
    infrastructure deployment is much more sensible. The infrastructure should be
    deployed according to the city priorities. Indeed, the procurement and physical
    deployment processes have a learning curve that is not negligible. 2.2.2 Multi-stakeholder
    Ecosystem Creation Cities are complex ecosystems participated by many actors with
    heterogeneous backgrounds, interests and/or expertise. Thus, while the main responsible
    and policy regulator is the city administration, the deployment of a smart city
    has to observe this multi-stakeholder nature of the city. Moreover, in general,
    cities’ challenges are analogous globally. Thus, the ecosystem created for one
    city should be reproducible in another widening even more the scope and multilateralism
    of potential stakeholders. In the creation of this multi-stakeholder ecosystem,
    the adoption of a Smart City Platform (cf. Fig. 3) is fundamental. It should leverage
    interoperability technologies to aggregate the underlying heterogeneous infrastructure
    and enable service and application development independently of the information
    providers and the technologies that they use. Fig. 3 Smart City multi-stakeholder
    platform deployed at Santander Full size image The existing utilities and municipality
    infrastructures provide a first abstraction level in terms of resource management
    and data handling. Making use of IoT technologies [6], advantage is taken from
    the pervasive presence around the city of information sources and actuators belonging
    to the utilities. These elements interact with each other and cooperate with their
    neighbours to reach common goals. In this sense, by generating virtual instances
    of real physical objects, it is possible to deploy services and applications,
    characterized by a high degree of autonomous data capture, event transfer, network
    connectivity and interoperability [7]. However, they are mainly vertical systems
    that are exclusively tailored to the city service they are supporting. Hence,
    it is necessary to provide adequate mechanisms for added-value services creation
    and execution. In the city utilities application domain, this should enable new
    business opportunities for 3rd parties that can reuse available city assets and
    existing services to create new ones with added value and thus generate new forms
    of revenue. The later requires changing data sharing policies and making data
    generated seamlessly available to 3rd parties. To facilitate such development
    and deployment, an open API [8] framework is included in the envisioned ecosystem
    as one of its integral parts of our architecture. On top of this abstraction level,
    a service information model (described through a service catalogue) is provided
    to allow extending the traditional utility use cases towards new business scenarios.
    Different services can be combined through the service federation concept either
    by service re-use (by sticking to modular service development practices) or through
    creation of service mash-up resulting in relevant savings in terms of the Capital
    Expenditure (CAPEX) and Operation Expenditure (OPEX). Further on, the service
    framework can be supported over cloud-enabled technologies thus allowing assignment
    of resources in an elastic way, driven by demand, meeting Service Level Agreements
    (SLAs) and providing flexibility in the business requirements (e.g. the end user
    only pays for actual use or ICT resources). 2.2.3 Open Ecosystem Openness have
    been addressed on two main axes that are critical for the success of the deployment
    of smart city solutions with a global scope in mind. Firstly, standardization
    is crucial in the sense of breaking vendor lock-in as well as city lock-in. The
    first lock-in situation avoidance refers to the need for usable standards and
    an interoperable vendor ecosystem for IoT-enabled smart city solutions so that
    cities do not have to commit to a specific solution so there are no dependencies
    on a single vendor. The latter one refers to the necessity of APIs for accessing
    streamed data from IoT infrastructures that homogenize the availability of data
    sources and underlying data formats. This way developers and providers of IoT-based
    smart city services can deploy and operate a service, which has been initially
    developed for one city, to another, thus getting benefit from the opportunities
    that come from economies of scale. Secondly, open APIs are equally important to
    guarantee that no lock-in situation is produced. FIWARE [9] is a large ecosystem
    providing standardized APIs used in open-source implementations of generic enablers
    based on open specifications. FIWARE is now at the centre of the Open and Agile
    Smart Cities (OASC) initiative [10]. oneM2M [11], on the other hand, provides
    a global standard for IoT common service functionalities that are used by the
    emerging IoT services and products. oneM2M and FIWARE are two powerful existing
    ecosystems that are worth the effort to make them interoperable [12]. Indeed,
    in Santander this interoperability has been granted and it is possible, nowadays,
    to develop applications [13] that can transparently consume data from platforms
    that use any of this technologies as baseline. 3 Future Challenges Despite the
    advances in the implementation and deployment of novel technologies towards the
    realization of the smart city paradigm, globally, and in the city of Santander
    in particular, this is not a completed endeavour. Surely, the current scenario
    has addressed some of the original objectives, but it has become evident that
    there are large possibilities of enhancement for creating smarter cities. Figure
    4 summarizes the high-level framework to address the foreseen challenges and the
    establishment of novel business models based on the valuable data-streams that
    emanate from a full-blown smart city. The framework identifies the main tiers
    in which IoT-based smart city platforms are typically structured, namely IoT Infrastructure,
    IoT and Data Management and Data Marketplace. For each of these levels, key challenges
    and enabling technologies have been highlighted. Fig. 4 Smart City challenges
    high-level framework Full size image At the bottom layer, the IoT Infrastructure
    will be characterized by the heterogeneous communication technologies that will
    be available for best fitting the plethora of application domains. Additionally,
    muti-tenancy must be supported as the IoT deployments will come from both public
    and private domains and they should be handled under a common framework. Finally,
    distribution of infrastructure and intelligence is the only option to manage the
    complexity at this bottom layer. The second tier deals with the infrastructure
    management and more importantly with the data organization. On the one hand, it
    is of utmost importance that the underlying infrastructure is kept in good working
    order and guaranteeing this is not trivial considering its dimension and composition.
    On the other, the data produced has to be homogenized and its quality also guaranteed
    in order to make it easy and valuable to consume. Finally, the top layer handles
    the interaction with the services and applications that are based on the context
    information retrieved. The creation and maintenance of a data marketplace where
    data is organized in straightforwardly accessible offerings whose provenance and
    quality are systematically registered and guaranteed. Additionally, it has to
    provide the mechanisms to enable value exchanges among data providers and data
    consumers. These mechanisms have to be flexible enough to facilitate the adoption
    of different business models. Some of the challenges and development paths to
    implement this framework are depicted in the following sub-sections. 3.1 Adoption
    of Common APIs and Common Data Models Worldwide cities are involved in a digital
    revolution that will transform the way in which existing and new city systems
    are operated. However, optimizing the behaviour of any specific urban service
    has to be carried out taking into consideration the service itself as well as
    its interaction with adjacent services. This means that any solution aiming at
    achieving the autonomous city management paradigm is tightly coupled with the
    adoption of common frameworks, among in-city systems, which are able to guarantee
    systems interoperability. Furthermore, cities themselves are not isolated systems.
    They will interact one to the each other depending on different attributes. This
    implies that, eventually, optimizing some processes in one city without having
    in mind the adjacency to the others might result in inefficiencies [14]. Hence,
    interoperability among inter-city systems will become necessary. Not just in terms
    of pure optimization but also in terms of replicability. Moreover, it is necessary
    to highlight the multitude of actors that participate in the smart city services
    provision. This leads to heterogeneous service models and underlying infrastructure.
    In order to maximize the efficiency, exportability and horizontality of the cities
    digitalization, it is of utmost importance that the access to the data supporting
    the city services is homogenized, not only from a procedural viewpoint, but also
    from a syntactic and even semantic perspective. Standardization initiatives [15]
    as well as front-runner actors in the smart city ecosystem [9] are working on
    setting common APIs and data models that shall enable the necessary grounds for
    seamless data exchanges among data producers and data consumers. 3.2 Data, Network
    and Communications Reliability The next generation of communication networks and
    services, so-called 5G, will not only be an evolution of mobile broadband networks
    but it will also bring new unique network and service capabilities. Specifically,
    5G will be a key enabler for the Internet of Things by providing a platform to
    connect a massive number of sensors, rendering devices and actuators with stringent
    energy and transmission constraints. However, it is still open how to model these
    scenarios (mainly at the access network level), and which technologies (or combination
    of them) will be part of the future communication systems. 3.3 Data Marketplace
    In order to exploit data, the platform is required to provide data providers with
    means to decide and enforce how and with whom data is shared. In this sense, the
    data market place has to let data providers to define access policies based on
    both the particular data assets and the data consumer. In addition, considering
    the growing importance of data, such marketplace needs also to provide charging
    mechanisms, so that the data assets can be monetized. In this respect, pricing
    models are needed to assign cost to data assets. An appealing starting point can
    be the Black-Sholes model [16] used for options pricing modelling. Along with
    the different possibilities of sharing data, it is also necessary to provide different
    licensing levels and means for the data provider to ensure that a particular data
    asset is exploited under the negotiated conditions. Finally, it would be also
    desirable that the platform brings mechanisms to provide feedback concerning data
    quality, in order to implement reputation raking that can be afterwards exploited
    to better define the data sharing policies. 3.4 Opportunities Creation The vision
    of smart cities has been shaped, for long, by sales pitches of larger technology
    vendor and system integrators. Early “smart city 1.0” examples such as Masdar
    or Songdo have been technology- or marketing- driven rather than addressing typical
    operational and citizen needs. Other services often take the perspective of the
    city authorities, which is in many cases different from the one of the citizen.
    While there are significant cultural differences globally, from a European perspective,
    there is a lack of citizen voice in the current debate about IoT instrumentation.
    If smart city services are to make a real difference to citizens, and be accepted
    by the public, then citizens must play a strong role in their creation and design.
    Moreover, the smart city has to be promoted as a scenario where new business models
    are created around the exchange of data and the services that arise from this
    sharing. For example, cities are becoming the playground for the sharing economy
    [17]. The concentration of economic activity and ubiquity of technology in cities
    facilitate the rapid, location-based exchange of services and products among citizens
    (P2P), among businesses (B2B), and businesses to the crowd. Novel business concepts
    like the Commons Collaborative Economy [18] characterized by using data as the
    new key good for trading in the newly created digital marketplaces shall be able
    to: 1. Favour peer-to-peer relations -in contrast to the traditionally hierarchical
    command and contractual relationships. 2. Settle new value distribution and governance
    among the community of peers where profitability is not its main/unique driving
    force. 3. Leverage privacy-aware public infrastructure that results in the (generally)
    open access provision of commons resources that favour access, reproducibility
    and derivativeness. 3.5 Blockchain Technologies and its Impact on the Smart City
    Paradigm The first wave of smart city services have been predominantly developed
    around open data. Such data is in most cases shared if not considered sensitive,
    and the success of services developed on top is often only modest. Proprietary
    data sets such as IoT-generated data, closed organisational data or personal data
    have the potential to offer higher value for richer smart city services, but are
    not released for exploitation or not readily available. There is a lack of incentives,
    market confidence and trust for organisations and individuals to share new data
    sets as licensing models are not yet properly understood and developed, and key
    ecosystem foundation for such a market place are still missing. It is necessary
    to develop a security-by-design approach increasing the transparency of all the
    IoT asset governance flow shifting from the current paradigm of discrete centralized
    trusted authorities to a paradigm of liquid and decentralized trust of the network
    as a whole. In this shift, the creation of Blockchain platforms that can be employed
    following the “as a Service” paradigm will enable fully decentralised solutions
    delivering certified mechanisms to support the management of IoT devices, during
    their whole lifecycle. Blockchain-based distributed ledger concept offers provenance
    and quality of data guarantee, as well as reputation mechanisms for qualification
    of assets shared in a participatory fashion. The shifting from the current paradigm
    of discrete centralized trusted authorities to a paradigm of decentralized trust
    of the web as a whole responds to the consumers’ needs and to the providers’ demands.
    The first because they require reassurance of the data’s quality. The latter because
    they are reluctant to share some datasets due to uncertainty of how and for what
    purposes the data is used. 4 Conclusions Worldwide cities are involved in a digital
    transformation focused on sustainability and improving citizen’s quality of life.
    This digital transformation will make a reality the paradigm of an autonomous
    city meaning that relying on the massive amount of data as well as the appropriate
    machinery the city management platform will be able to run it near to the optimal
    operating point predicting any unexpected event making daily citizen''s life easier.
    While this paradigm of sustainability and efficiency has been always present for
    city administrators, digital transformation is opening new opportunities besides
    the optimization of the urban services that have been traditionally offer to its
    citizens (mobility, lighting, water distribution, waste management, etc.). Among
    these new opportunities, there is one, co-creation, with a large transformative
    potential from the economic and social viewpoint. Co-creation paradigm stands
    for the participatory creation of solutions and services among multiple stakeholders.
    In order to enable this scenario, cities have to set up a platform equipped with
    a set of highly intuitive tools and enablers that allow the design and implementation
    of novel services and, why not, so-called killer applications. For the platform
    to be valuable, it has to be fed by as many city assets, and the information that
    they generate, as possible. Moreover, it is of utmost importance to scale up the
    concept and federate such platform with other cities so that the creative process
    can be enriched and its impact enlarged. Another crucial aspect that has been
    highlighted is the need to include enablers associated to the incentives and rewards
    of participating, not only during the trial phases but also considering the long-term
    sustainability of the whole platform and smart city ecosystem. In this paper,
    we have reviewed the status of the SmartSantander ecosystem and the key features
    and lessons learnt through its evolution from a testbed for IoT experimentation
    to an open platform for co-creative innovation that is federated with other front-runner
    cities towards unleashing the potential of smart cities as social innovation hubs.
    Additionally, the challenges that have to be addressed in the short and medium
    term have been sketched. The path defined by these challenges is meant to establish
    a new economic model around the cities, bound to innovative exploitation of data
    exposed in a digital single market. References Balaji, S., Nathani, K., & Santhakumar,

    \ - Egypt \n \nAbstract: \n        Access to Information: Technology provides\
    \ small farmers with access to valuable \ninformation and knowledge. Through the\
    \ internet, mobile applications, and online \nplatforms, farmers can access weather\
    \ forecasts, market prices, agricultural practices, and \ncrop management techniques.\
    \ This information enables them to make informed decisions, \nadopt best practices,\
    \ and optimize their farming operations. Precision Farming: Precision \nfarming\
    \ technologies, such as Global Positioning System (GPS), Geographic Information\
    \ \nSystem (GIS), and remote sensing, help small farmers optimize resource use\
    \ and improve \ncrop yields. These technologies enable precise field mapping,\
    \ soil analysis, and \nmonitoring of crop health, allowing farmers to apply fertilizers,\
    \ water, and other inputs \nonly where and when needed. This reduces resource\
    \ wastage, enhances efficiency, and \nminimizes environmental impact. \n     \
    \     Farm Management Software: Farm management software and mobile applications\
    \ \nassist small farmers in managing their operations more effectively. These\
    \ tools help with \nrecord keeping, financial management, inventory tracking,\
    \ and farm planning. By \nautomating administrative tasks and providing real-time\
    \ data, farmers can streamline their \nprocesses, monitor performance, and make\
    \ data-driven decisions. Mobile Technology: \nMobile phones and applications have\
    \ transformed agricultural practices for small farmers. \nThey enable farmers\
    \ to access agricultural information, receive alerts on weather \nconditions,\
    \ market prices, and pest outbreaks. Mobile technology also facilitates \ncommunication\
    \ and networking among farmers, allowing them to share knowledge, learn \nfrom\
    \ each other, and access extension services remotely. \n           Agricultural\
    \ Machinery and Equipment: Technology has improved the availability \nand effectiveness\
    \ of agricultural machinery and equipment, even for small-scale farmers. \nSmall\
    \ agricultural projects can benefit from compact and affordable machinery, such\
    \ as \nmini-tractors, tillers, planters, and harvesters, which help increase productivity,\

    \ and accessible for small farmers. \nDrip irrigation, sprinkler systems, and\
    \ sensor-based irrigation technologies enable precise \nwater application, reducing\
    \ water wastage and increasing water-use efficiency. This is \nespecially beneficial\
    \ in areas with water scarcity or unreliable rainfall patterns. \nPost-Harvest\
    \ Technologies: Post-harvest losses are a significant challenge for small \nfarmers.\
    \ Technology offers solutions to mitigate these losses by improving storage, \n\
    processing, and value addition. Technologies such as solar dryers, cold storage\
    \ facilities, \nand packaging innovations help extend the shelf life of produce,\
    \ reduce spoilage, and \nincrease the market value of agricultural products. \n\
    E-commerce and Market Access: Technology has opened up new avenues for small \n\
    farmers to access markets and sell their produce. E-commerce platforms, online\
    \ \nmarketplaces, and mobile applications connect farmers directly with buyers,\
    \ eliminating \nintermediaries and enabling fairer prices. This improves market\
    \ access, reduces \ntransaction costs, and creates opportunities for small farmers\

    \  \n            Access to information about the role of technology in small agricultural\
    \ projects is \ncrucial for farmers to understand and utilize the available technological\
    \ solutions \neffectively. Agricultural Extension Services: Agricultural extension\
    \ services, provided by \ngovernment agencies or agricultural universities, offer\
    \ information and training to \nfarmers. These services often include guidance\
    \ on the use of technology in agriculture and \nprovide resources such as pamphlets,\
    \ workshops, and demonstrations. Online Resources \nand Websites: Numerous websites\
    \ and online platforms focus on agriculture and \ntechnology. These platforms\
    \ provide information, articles, guides, and case studies related \nto the role\
    \ of technology in small agricultural projects. Some reliable sources include\
    \ \nagricultural research institutes, government websites, and agricultural extension\
    \ websites. \n        Mobile Applications: There are mobile applications specifically\
    \ designed to provide \ninformation and guidance to farmers. These apps offer\
    \ features such as crop-specific \nrecommendations, pest management techniques,\
    \ weather forecasts, market prices, and \ntechnology-related insights. Some popular\
    \ agricultural apps include FarmLogs, AgriApp, \nand Plantix. Technology Suppliers\
    \ and Manufacturers: Companies that develop and \nsupply agricultural technologies\
    \ often have resources available on their websites. They \nmay provide information\
    \ on the benefits, features, and usage of their products. These \nresources can\
    \ help farmers understand how specific technologies can be integrated into \n\
    their agricultural projects. Online Forums and Communities: Participating in online\
    \ \nforums and communities related to agriculture can be valuable for accessing\
    \ information. \nFarmers can connect with other farmers, agricultural experts,\
    \ and technology enthusiasts \nwho can share their experiences, recommendations,\
    \ and knowledge about the role of \ntechnology in small agricultural projects.\
    \ \n       Agricultural Trade Shows and Exhibitions: Attending agricultural trade\
    \ shows and \nexhibitions provides farmers with opportunities to interact directly\

    20 May 2016 Accepted 01 Sept 2016 Published 20 Oct 2016 Abstract This work presents
    an architecture to help designing and deploying smart mobility applications. The
    proposed solution builds on the experience already matured by the authors in different
    fields: crowdsourcing and sensing done by users to gather data related to urban
    barriers and facilities, computation of personalized paths for users with special
    needs, and integration of open data provided by bus companies to identify the
    actual accessibility features and estimate the real arrival time of vehicles at
    stops. In terms of functionality, the first “monolithic” prototype fulfilled the
    goal of composing the aforementioned pieces of information to support citizens
    with reduced mobility (users with disabilities and/or elderly people) in their
    urban movements. In this paper, we describe a service-oriented architecture that
    exploits the microservices orchestration paradigm to enable the creation of new
    services and to make the management of the various data sources easier and more
    effective. The proposed platform exposes standardized interfaces to access data,
    implements common services to manage metadata associated with them, such as trustworthiness
    and provenance, and provides an orchestration language to create complex services,
    naturally mapping their internal workflow to code. The manuscript demonstrates
    the effectiveness of the approach by means of some case studies. 1. Introduction
    As world populations concentrate in cities, mobility in urban environments is
    becoming one of the most prominent and interesting research fields in the smart
    city context. A well-known definition of smart city is provided in [ 1] and says
    that a smart city is “a city well performing in a forward-looking way in economy,
    people, governance, mobility, environment, and living, built on the smart combination
    of endowments and activities of self-decisive, independent and aware citizens.”
    The World Health Organization has recently released a report about Urban health
    [ 2], which claims that about 3.7 billion people live in cities today and that
    a further 1 billion people will be added by 2030, with 90% of the growth being
    in low- and middle-income countries. According to this study, the ways that cities
    are planned and built can profoundly affect the ability of their citizens to live
    long, healthy, and productive lives. Urban mobility plays a key-role in this context,
    because it is strategic in making cities age-friendly and accessible for communities,
    with particular regard to those persons with disabilities [ 2]. Hence, providing
    and adequately orchestrating services devoted to improving urban mobility is fundamental
    in achieving smart mobility [ 3]. In this context, the crowdsensing and the mobility
    as service paradigms are emerging. In particular, crowdsensing is rising thanks
    to the widespread diffusion of mobile devices: it involves people who are moving
    and collecting data from different places and routes, by carrying sensors integrated
    in their mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets [ 4]. Here, we can identify
    the three interrelated components (space, people, and technology) of the urban
    computing systems, as presented in [ 5]. The concept of Mobility as a Service
    (MaaS) was born in Finland and it is rapidly spreading worldwide [ 6] as an effective
    approach to achieve business efficiency, traveler satisfaction, and government
    agenda fulfillment through smart mobility. Given this background, we envision
    the creation of ICT infrastructures based on microservices. This modern and renowned
    development model [ 7] fosters the creation of an ecosystem of reusable components.
    In the context of MaaS, microservices shall efficiently and flexibly combine heterogeneous
    data sources, such as available transport options, real-time data regarding vehicles
    and infrastructures, and pricing, to provide customized travel planning, information,
    and ticketing to final users, as well as monitoring and strategic planning tools
    to policy-makers. In this context, crowdsensing plays a fundamental role, letting
    the users and their devices be a significant actor in the whole picture, becoming
    one of the data sources. As emerging by the results found in [ 8], crowdsensing
    from citizens’ devices is an important advantage and opens a range of potential
    applications and tools. This would improve data and applications made available
    by operators, policy-makers, and transport providers, enriching the entire smart
    mobility context. This paper presents the design of an infrastructure as a marketplace
    for mobility services, called Smart Mobility for All (SMAll). A prototype of such
    infrastructure has been developed and its architecture is described in the remainder
    of this paper, as well as some of the provided services. In our vision, SMAll
    is the enabling technology to solve the challenges of the MaaS market, from developing
    user-contributed, crowdsourced applications and crowdsensing services to launching
    a MaaS operator and to planning effective and sustainable transport policies for
    smart cities. Particular attention has been given to specific services offered
    with the aim of supporting mobility of citizens with disabilities and special
    needs within urban environments. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 presents the background and some of the main related work which have
    inspired and driven our research. Section 3 describes the overall system architecture
    we have designed and developed, which is based on services orchestration. Two
    broad categories of services, namely, data quality management and data sources,
    are illustrated in detail in Sections 4 and 5, respectively, before their orchestration
    is described in Section 6. Two case studies are introduced in Section 7, and,
    finally, Section 8 concludes the paper and presents some future works. 2. Background
    and Related Work An emerging trend introduced with cloud computing [ 9] defines
    a new category of models which can be identified under the umbrella term Everything
    as a Service (XaaS) [ 10]. The basic idea behind cloud computing is to concentrate
    resources, such as hardware and software, into few physical locations and offer
    those resources as services to a large number of users who are located in many
    different geographical locations around the world in an effective way. In this
    context, three major service models have been traditionally exploited: infrastructure-as-a-service,
    platform-as-a-service, and software-as-a-service. The main common element among
    them is that they all provide resources as a service. These models arose a wide
    popularity and starting from them, several similar yet context-specific models
    have been proposed [ 11]. One of these ones is the Sensing as a Service (SaaS)
    model, which can be considered a solution based on IoT infrastructure and it has
    the capability to address some of the most challenging issues in smart cities
    [ 12]. Many everyday objects are equipped with sensors and the European Commission
    has predicted that, by 2020, there will be 50 to 100 billion devices connected
    to the Internet [ 13]. This represents a strong motivation behind the diffusion
    and the opportunity of efficiently exploiting the SaaS model. In a typical SaaS
    cloud, multiple sensing servers can be deployed to handle sensing requests from
    different locations [ 14]. Usually, a SaaS cloud works as follows. When a cloud
    user initiates sensing requests through a Web front-end from either mobile phone
    or a computer, the request will be forwarded to a sensing server which will then
    push the request to a subset of mobile phones that happen to be in the area of
    interest [ 15]. Such mobile devices will fulfill the corresponding sensing task.
    The sensed data will then be collected by a sensing server, stored in a database
    and returned to the cloud user who requests the service. An interesting feature
    is that in such a system a mobile user can be at the same time a provider and
    a consumer of the sensing services [ 15, 16]. And this is the case of the sensing
    service prototype we are going to present in Section 4.2 of this paper. Taking
    into account mobile phone sensing, we can identify two primary paradigms [ 17]:
    (1) Participatory sensing: mobile users actively engage in sensing activities
    by manually determining how, when, what, and where to sense. (2) Opportunistic
    sensing: sensing activities are fully automated without the involvement of mobile
    users. It is worth mentioning that, despite the fact that in traditional sensor
    network the owner is typically a single organization, in mobile phone and sensors
    the control is spread between different individual users. This means that mobile
    sensing activities and resulting data are not controllable and not easy to predict
    [ 14]. In some contexts, in particular in the participatory sensing ones, SaaS
    is considered as a crowdsourcing system that depends on mobile users to provide
    data [ 15], and it can also be referred to as crowdsensing [ 18], which has been
    also defined as a subtype of crowdsourcing, where the outsourced job is a sensing
    task [ 4]. Crowdsensing is recognized as an important technological enabler for
    smart cities that has attracted several research efforts, with the aim of improving
    sensing quality on mobile devices, promoting user participation, and validating
    collected data [ 19, 20]. Compared to infrastructure-based sensing, crowdsensing
    has several advantages, even if it can bring some additional issues. A system
    based on crowdsensing can potentially be cheaper than infrastructure-based sensing
    solutions, because it does not require the deployment of expensive fixed infrastructure.
    Moreover, it is easier to deploy and can be used in areas where deploying a fixed
    infrastructure can be difficult or maybe impossible, but it can introduce additional
    complexity and challenges. In general, mobile devices used for crowdsensing and
    infrastructure-based sensing are complementary technology that can cooperate to
    enable sensing in smart cities [ 18]. In the smart city context, crowdsensing
    can be exploited by involving sensors which are moving (since they are carried
    by users) and human intelligence into the sensing process [ 4]. Some of these
    use cases address tasks related to urban transportation systems, such as tracking
    of public vehicles (e.g., buses, trams, and subways) or others like mapping bumps
    on the road to inform authorities. Crowdsensing can provide great support in optimizing
    urban transportation. Traffic can be unpredictable; moreover, most influenced
    public transportation lines can bear shorter or longer delays. Weather conditions
    can influence the traveling speed of vehicles in the city. In [ 21], an effective
    way of describing the entities of a crowdsourced public transit networks (including
    locations and vehicles) was presented and discussed. A system devoted to monitoring
    public transport vehicles with an application running on traveling users’ mobile
    phones and detecting the stopping places of vehicles is described in [ 22]. An
    interesting example of participatory sensing is represented by the platform called
    Waze [ 23], which supports car drivers to get information on road conditions.
    Thanks to its versatility, it was the wider community-assisted navigation app
    in 2015. To improve routing, users can report changes in local maps to keep them
    up to date [ 4]. It is important to note that systems based on crowdsensing need
    to reach a critical mass of gathered data in effectively and efficiently providing
    services. For this reason, contributors have to feel motivated and involved in
    collecting data. Different research works have proved that resorting in intrinsic
    motivation (the activity is perceived as intrinsically rewarding) and/or extrinsic
    motivation (the action is driven by an external outcome, as rewards or an increase
    of reputation) makes it possible to engage contributors in participating, with
    an increment of the quantity and quality of collected data [ 24, 25]. An interesting
    concept that some of the authors are investigating is the one about the use of
    gamification so as to motivate the participation of the crowd in gathering data
    about the urban environment (see, e.g., [ 26– 28]). Some among the several crowdsourcing
    and crowdsensing systems and applications developed in the smart cities paradigm
    are devoted to let citizens collaborate in improving the quality of life in their
    urban environment [ 29, 30]. A part of them aims to collect data about urban accessibility
    [ 31], improving the quality of life and the level of independence of persons
    with disabilities [ 32, 33]. Many sensing apps have been developed to monitor
    human activities and a part of them could be effectively used to detect accessibility/pedestrian
    barriers (such as stairs) and facilities (such as zebra crossing). These researches
    present sensing architectures and algorithms studied to be used in different contexts,
    so they need to be adapted in order to be exploited in detecting barriers and
    facilities (see, e.g., [ 34, 35]). In [ 36], the authors (by using data obtained
    by a smartphone accelerometer) aim to recognize the position where a pedestrian
    stops and crosses a street ruled by a traffic light. Some barriers and facilities
    could be recognized more easily by using cooperative sensing, working on detecting
    movement of groups of people [ 37]. In [ 38, 39], the authors propose methodologies
    for developing large scale accessibility map with personal sensing by using smart
    phones. In particular, the idea is to exploit devices held by wheelchair citizens
    and then to apply machine learning technologies (i.e., supervised learning techniques)
    with the aim of estimating types of ground surfaces. Using moving sensors in crowdsourcing
    is called mobile crowdsensing (MCS) [ 4]. MCS differs from the deployed sensor
    networks in involving people who are moving and collecting data from different
    places and paths. People can carry sensors integrated to their mobile devices
    and they can provide information about the surroundings manually [ 19]. The MCS
    as a Service (MCSaaS) paradigm has been proposed in [ 40]. The authors discussed
    about the MCSaaS vision and presented a platform prototype and its evaluation.
    In particular, regarding the MCSaaS vision, the authors proposed to implement
    such an approach by splitting the MCS application deployment into two domains:
    the infrastructure and the application ones. Another important and interesting
    concept that is at the basis of our work is Mobility as a Service (MaaS) [ 6].
    One of the main advantages of a MaaS provider is that it shall offer a unique
    and seamless interface to users, aggregating heterogeneous transport options offered
    by different mobility providers (e.g., different agencies providing transportation
    by taxi, bus, train, airplane, and car-sharing, including the public transportation
    providers) and handling the whole experience of traveling, from providing information
    to travel planning and payments [ 41]. All these concepts and studies have inspired
    our work and the resulting system we present in this paper. In particular, our
    prototype is exploiting sensing, mobile crowdsourcing, and mobility as a service
    with the specific purpose of supporting citizens in wandering the city (i.e.,
    in the context of smart mobility). A specific attention has been paid to meet
    the needs of those people who would get more benefits than the others from the
    availability of information about urban accessibility in terms of barriers and
    facilities. 3. Smart Mobility for All (SMAll) From a software engineering point
    of view, it is useful to frame the various functions needed to build any smart-city
    vertical application within a common reference model based on microservices [
    7]. By modeling and implementing every component of a mobility application as
    a service, several remarkable advantages emerge. Data can be transparently collected
    from different sources that, wrapped inside a microservice, become available through
    a standard interface. Preprocessing and labeling of data, for example, to assign
    trustworthiness values, can be implemented by means of different algorithms available
    as services; these, in turn, can take advantage of shared knowledge bases, for
    example, managing user ratings. Sharing databases through services instead of
    giving direct access means having a finer control on access policies, both in
    terms of simple access rights and in terms of precomputations that allow providing
    properly aggregated or otherwise sanitized data to applications. It is worth noting
    that security issues can emerge from this kind of open structure, yet the platform
    itself can play a crucial role in mitigating them [ 41, 42]. Generally speaking,
    a platform to “glue” mobility services together could enable the establishment
    of Mobility as a Service operators. One way to develop a MaaS-enabling infrastructure
    is to structure it as a marketplace (Figure 1) for mobility services, where the
    definition of open standards for service invocation guarantees interoperability,
    the availability of infrastructural components (i.e., authentication, access control,
    QoS negotiation, and business intelligence) lowers the effort needed for the development
    of applications, and an orchestration framework streamlines the composition of
    available services into more complex applications. We are developing a prototype
    of this system called SMAll.    Figure 1  Architecture of a marketplace for mobility
    services. Indeed, we already classified some macrocategories of services that
    we can expect to find in such a marketplace. Figure 2 outlines some of the most
    important ones, arranged in layers of increasing complexity—in this context, “complex”
    means the creation of functionalities on top of other “simple” services. Starting
    from the bottom, we find services that are either wrappers for legacy software,
    for example, travel planners that do not include real-time functionalities, or
    services that process basic data. The aim of this class of services is to standardize
    the data and the interfaces of legacy software to make them available to other
    services. Other more complex services, found in the upper layers, orchestrate
    these basic ones to implement their behaviors, up to the very refined policies
    of MaaS operators and similar applications.    Figure 2  Service categories in
    SMAll. As mentioned at the beginning of the section, we envisage the adoption
    of microservices to provide seamless implementation of these categories of components:
    (i) Wrappers converting legacy data source into standard services (ii) Helper
    services (e.g., authentication, authorization, scheduling, routing, and orchestration)
    (iii) The service registry storing the definition of all the services deployed
    on the platform (iv) The actual business logic deployed by operators or intermediaries,
    collecting, storing, and processing data to offer some data-related insight on
    the usage of services. According to this model, there is no single actor responsible
    for data quality and service correctness, so we are introducing a layer of services
    to manage the quality issues of data resulting from crowdsourcing. This layer
    will offer metadata management services, such as the evaluation of data provenance,
    data reliability, and data trustworthiness, and the propagation of these indicators
    across services which compose data, ready to be exploited in coordination with
    any service that exposes data. The microservices architecture is suitable for
    this kind of scenario, because it allows creating independent services for specific
    tasks (and for different implementation of the same task) of the data quality
    management process. On the SMAll platform, it will be possible to exploit these
    services through orchestration. The concept is illustrated in Figure 3.    Figure
    3  Organization of crowdsensing orchestration layers. On the bottom level, we
    have the services that expose data. These services are heterogeneous in terms
    of amount, sensitivity, expressiveness, representativeness, and so forth. Above
    the data level, there are the microservices in charge of the implementation of
    the mechanisms dealing with each of the data management problems described (provenance,
    trustworthiness, etc.). While the two levels are kept separated to highlight their
    different function, there is no hierarchical relation between them. From an architectural
    point of view, every box is a service, and their invocation is defined by a workflow,
    representing the desired data quality policies, and implemented through the orchestration
    mechanism. 4. Data Sources Various kinds of data sources feed the system. We can
    classify them in broad categories, according to their provenance (e.g., official
    data about the transport infrastructure versus crowdsourced POIs) and their timescale
    (e.g., real-time information versus planned timetables and static features). Indeed,
    each stored data includes specific information and has peculiar characteristics
    depending on its own source. For instance, traffic data feeds are automatically
    posted and updated in the system; instead, the quantity and quality of crowdsourced/crowdsensed
    data are strongly influenced by the voluntary nature of the action and engagement
    of the participant [ 43]. In any case, all the data sources, independently of
    their category, will be accessed in a homogeneous fashion, through appropriate
    microservices. 4.1. Profiling System To provide personalized services, we have
    to build a category of services that exploits a user (JSON-based) profile, structured
    in three interconnected parts: (A) the Generic Profile (GProfile) which includes
    some general data about the user, such as personal info, language, unit of measurement,
    device(s) in use, average walking speed, data about his/her credibility, and data
    about his/her favorite public means of transport routes; (B) the Urban Profile
    (UProfile), which describes users preferences related to the urban environment,
    expressed according to his/her needs, and preferences about the urban Point of
    Interests (POI); a specific section of such a part of the profile is devoted to
    describing the user’s preferences about the urban barriers (such as stairs) and
    facilities (such as curb cuts); and (C) the eAccessibility Profile (eAProfile),
    which describes users preferences related to the e-accessibility and to the interface
    of the application. 4.1.1. Generic Profile The Generic Profile describes the general
    information about the user. It includes personal data and data about the device
    in use, as well as the language and the unit of measurement. These latter data
    can be automatically set by the service, deriving them from users location, or
    manually set up by the user. In such part of the profile, the user can also declare
    his/her average speed when he/she moves in an urban environment. Alternatively,
    such data can be automatically derived from device sensor, which can track the
    users movement and then compute his/her average speed. This information is essential
    for our system, because the routing algorithms compute the best personalized paths
    taking them into account. For example, when combined to real time availability
    of buses (when the paths include the use of public means of transports), the user’s
    ability to reach a stop in time to catch the bus prunes the set of feasible different
    paths. Finally, the user could store here information about his/her traveling
    habits, providing data about his/her favorite bus routes. The user can provide
    a location in the city by exploiting his/her current position or an address (i.e.,
    street and number). Then, our system provides all the bus stops that the user
    can reach (in a configured time) with a list of the bus routes available at those
    stops; finally, the user can choose bus stops and routes of interest. 4.1.2. Urban
    Profile The Urban Profile stores information about users preferences related to
    the urban environment. In particular, the urban elements are called Point of Interests
    (POIs) and users can set their preferences, classifying them as NEUTRAL, LIKE,
    UNLIKE, and AVOID on the basic of their degree of interest, preference, and/or
    need. Some examples of POIs mapped in our system are bus stops; subway stations;
    bicycle-sharing stations; parking; and so on. An interesting subset of POIs is
    related to identify urban barriers and facilities in the city. Such specific POIs
    are defined as aPOIs (accessibility Points of Interests). We have classified the
    aPOIs in categories that derive from the mobility context, in particular for those
    people with disabilities that we treat in the use cases of this work (see Section
    7). These categories include items such as gaps, crosses, obstructions, and surface
    descriptions. Users have the possibility of defining their preferences about the
    above-listed aPOIs (stored in the Urban Accessibility Profile (UAProfile)) as
    follows: (i) NEUTRAL: the user has neither difficulties nor preferences related
    to the aPOI type. The presence of this type of barrier/facility on a path is irrelevant
    to the user. (ii) LIKE: the user prefers aPOIs of this type, when they are available.
    The presence of this type of barrier/facility on a path is positive to the user.
    (iii) DISLIKE: the user can face this aPOI type, but with some efforts. In this
    case, an alternative path is preferred (when available), but it is not necessary.
    The presence of this type of barrier facility on a path is negative to the user.
    (iv) AVOID: the user cannot face this aPOI type and an alternative path is necessary.
    The presence of this type of barrier/facility on a path prevents the user from
    following this path. A more detailed description of such urban accessibility preferences
    can be found in [ 33, 44]. On the basis of them, our system computes an accessible
    route that comes across the LIKEd aPOIs when feasible, gets round the DISLIKE
    aPOIs if it is possible, and avoids the AVOIDed aPOIs every time. It is worth
    noting that positive preferences can be associated with barriers and negative
    preferences can be associated with facilities. As an example, a blind user can
    set as LIKE some specific barriers, such as stairs and steps, because they can
    represent a reference point. Analogously, wheelchair users can set tactile paving
    as DISLIKE, because such surfaces can be uncomfortable for them. 4.1.3. eAccessibility
    Profile The e-Accessibility Profile is devoted to storing preferences and needs
    in terms of maps rendering. The main selection is the one related to textual/graphical
    representation of the map. On the basis of it, users can choose specific styles
    to represent POIs. For instance, the graphical representation can be personalized
    in terms of colors and size of the POIs icons in the map, addition of textual
    labels, and visualization (show or hide) of POI categories or of POI types. In
    particular, different style rules can be associated with the whole application,
    to a specific preference (LIKE, DISLIKE, etc.) or to a single type of POI. 4.2.
    Data Sensing We designed and developed a specific sensing service prototype that
    would be exploited on users smartphones, with the aim of sensing stairs, automatically
    storing information about such a kind of urban barrier. Stairs are commonly placed
    in pedestrian areas of the urban environment, in particular in European cities,
    due to their old origins. As an example, we report in Figure 4 a picture taken
    in Bologna. Bologna is famous for its porticos, which are devoted to pedestrian
    paths all over the city (over 45 kilometers of arcades) and where stairs often
    affect the urban accessibility.    Figure 4  Stairs in Bologna porticos. The design
    issues of such an ad hoc service were based on the need of low energy consumption
    and of high precision, minimizing false positive and false negative results. Analyzing
    the sensors available on a smart phone, we focused on gyroscopes, accelerometers,
    and magnetometers. The idea was to create a service, which would be used in background,
    without affecting other uses activities, applying an opportunistic sensing. Several
    methodologies have been evaluated, such as sensors fusion (combining data coming
    from the gyroscope, the accelerometers, and the magnetometer, with the aim of
    identifying the device inclination), Fourier analysis, Kalman filtering, convolution
    (cross-correlation and signal analysis of the forces applied on the device, with
    the aim of reconstructing and interpreting the device movements). We have exploited
    this latter method, by using only the accelerometer. In particular, our prototype
    compares the signal recorded by the smartphone accelerometer with a set of presampled
    ones, so as to assess the actual presence of a stair. Such presampled signals
    correspond to signals obtained climbing stairs up and down, by a group of different
    users equipped with their smartphones in different modalities (by walking, by
    running, and by keeping the smartphone in the pocket, in hand, in a bag, or in
    a backpack). The use of this method (and in particular of the sole accelerometer)
    lets us avoid the use of the gyroscope, then limiting the energy consumption and
    false positives and negatives. The sensing prototype we have developed is based
    on Android operating systems; it exploits the spatial components thanks to the
    accelerometer, which senses the force applied to all spatial components. Once
    our sensing service prototype recognizes the presence of a stair, data about its
    position are sensed and stored. Hence, our prototype records the sensed data,
    analyses them, and stores the corresponding signal. A screenshot of a corresponding
    plot is shown in Figure 5.    Figure 5  A screenshot of the signal sensed by means
    of the accelerometer. 4.3. Transit Infrastructure Information regarding the operation
    of buses, trains, and other means of transport is possibly the most complete example
    of variety that benefits from the standardization offered by wrapper services.
    (i) Operators are usually the authoritative source for static information about
    the transport infrastructure (stops, routes, etc.) and planned services (timetables,
    vehicles features, etc.). Operators can make this data available through different
    open data formats. GTFS [ 45] is rapidly growing to the status of de facto standard,
    yet many company-specific formats are still in use. A set of wrapper services
    is useful not only to convert these formats into a standard one but also to offer
    more sensible ways to access data, for example, allowing for discovering nearby
    stops given an address or set of coordinates, to know the set of bus lines serving
    a given stop, and so forth. (ii) Real-time information about the transport services
    is, again, usually provided by operators. Depending on the end-user needs, it
    could be useful to know either the position of a vehicle or its delay with respect
    to planned operation or the estimated time of arrival at a given stop. Of course,
    these data are all mutually related, and it turns out that different operators
    may decide to provide different views of the same basic information (in our region,
    e.g., the biggest bus operator provides the arrival time of the next two buses
    at a given stop to the public, but at the same time, it feeds the “raw” GPS position
    of each vehicle to the regional transport authority, which is considering to make
    these data available for crowdsourced applications). By wrapping the composition
    between the available kind(s) of data and other information (e.g., position of
    vehicles crowdsensed by passengers, travel times measured on street segments),
    it is possible to obtain all the needed views and even to improve the precision
    of estimates. (iii) Real-time information about the transport infrastructure comes
    from many different sources, such as public administrations announcing planned
    or extraordinary works, emergency teams intervening on accidents, operators giving
    notice of strikes of vehicle failures, weather reports, and of course people in
    the streets. 5. Data Quality Management Services Various kinds of data sources
    feed the system. We can classify them in broad categories, according to their
    provenance (e.g., official data about the transport infrastructures versus crowdsourced
    POIs) and their timescale (e.g., real-time information versus planned timetables
    and static features). Indeed, each stored data includes specific information and
    has peculiar characteristics depending on its own source. For instance, traffic
    data feeds are automatically posted and updated in the system; instead, the quantity
    and quality of crowdsourced/crowdsensed data are strongly influenced by the voluntary
    nature of the action and engagement of the participant [ 43]. In any case, all
    the data sources, independently of their category, will be accessed in a homogeneous
    fashion, through appropriate microservices. 5.1. Data Provenance Data Provenance
    for single hosts sources is a known problem in literature. According to works
    like [ 46], this problem could be solved only with a creation of private and public
    key system for data stream certification. A good reference is the system developed
    in [ 47], describing a cryptographic provenance verification approach for ensuring
    data properties and integrity for single hosts. Specifically, the authors designed
    and implemented an efficient cryptographic protocol that enforces keystroke integrity.
    This kind of protocol can be integrated as a microservice in our architecture.
    However, public-key schemes are known for their significant computational load,
    thus existing techniques may not be suitable for high-rate, high-volume data sources.
    Moreover, there could be the need for an algorithm for the propagation of provenance
    data. In some cases, data originated from the composition of raw (or otherwise
    “lower ranked”) sources should be accompanied by suitable metadata that allows
    verifying the provenance of the input values, in a cryptographically strong way.
    Merkle hash trees could be a good candidate to build proofs for composed data
    pieces [ 48]. 5.2. Data Trustworthiness Trustworthiness often referred to measuring
    and quantifying the quality of information coming from online resources and systems
    [ 49]. Several studies have been conducted with the aim of supporting users in
    quickly judging the trustworthiness of information they get, providing automatically
    computed values, which can be continuously updated [ 49, 50]. The authors of [
    51] based the trustworthiness model on users mobility and on the usefulness of
    their past contributions to the system. This work focuses on data integrity (for
    data coming from automatic readings from devices), data correctness, and quality.
    Users contributions are compared with those ones provided by local authoritative
    data sources, certified by the data provenance microservice. The trustworthiness
    microservice considers information provided by authoritative data sources (i.e.,
    local administrations, municipalities) as a gold set. Thus, our idea is to compare
    information provided by users with trustworthy and correct data. Hence, it is
    possible to base our trustworthiness service on the computation and assignment
    of more effective credibility values to users, similar to what has been done in
    other works, for example, [ 52]. 5.3. Data Reliability and Reporting Service Once
    we are able to verify the provenance and trustworthiness of the data intended
    as verification of the correct elaboration process, we have to verify that the
    results or the data displayed are actually correct. The process of correctness
    verification of the results of a crowdsourced data can be done in two ways: through
    an automated system with artificial intelligence embedded or through a reporting
    system with a trusted source approach. Considering that this work is mainly aimed
    at helping disabled people, who are known to be more collaborative in using reporting
    systems, has obviously led us to implement the second solution. The description
    of the reporting system for our architecture is inspired from the mPASS model
    [ 32], which is based on the mapping of POI. Each POI and its related data can
    be added to our system by means of one or more reports. Reports are classified
    in three different source classes, according to how they are collected. The three
    source classes have a growing validity: (i) U-report (report obtained by users):
    users can add POI to the DB system. This can be done in two ways: (i) spontaneously,
    a user encountering a specific barrier or an accessibility facility can send a
    report to the reporting service (RS); (ii) on demand, the RS can ask users to
    improve validity of an existing POI (usually a POI reported by sensors). Hence,
    the system will exploit the user report instead of sensor ones and the user gets
    an award badge on his/her public profile. (ii) S-report (report obtained by sensors):
    the RS can automatically produce data by sensing from mobile devices sensors.
    These reports are supposed to have a low validity. (iii) E-report (report produced
    by experts): experts are people working for organizations involved in monitoring
    urban accessibility (such as local administrations and municipalities or disability
    right organizations). Being professionally able to correctly classify and measure
    every kind of POI and POIs, their reports are considered totally valid. Reports
    from administrators can be added in two ways: (i) spontaneously: administrators
    add reports according to their program of activities, sending to the RS reports
    on barriers or accessibility facilities; (ii) on demand: the RS can ask administrators
    to improve validity of an existing POI (usually a user-added one). Hence, the
    system will use the administrator report instead of user ones. Hence, the RS can
    have more reports of the same POI, classified with one or more different source
    classes. Both the map provided to users and the data set considered by the routing
    algorithm are based on the more valid reports available. For example, if a POI
    is added by both sensors and users, U-reports are used instead of S-reports, since
    they are considered more valid. Analogously, if a POI is added by both users and
    administrators, E-reports are used instead of U-reports, because they are considered
    more valid. To populate the RS database, we also added some POIs and reports obtained
    by converting, filtering, and mashing up existing data. 5.4. Feedback Scoring
    System The Feedback Scoring System service is linked with the reporting service,
    an algorithm that calculates the reliability of a report based on the assigned
    scores on the basis of certain characteristics. It can happen, however, that in
    some cases these reports are uncertain, or missing, or simply they are too few
    to yield a reliable result. In this case, we can ask for the user interaction
    in order to give a feedback of a specific case. When uncertainty occurs on a POI,
    we activate a simple mechanism of user request, asking to confirm the presence/absence
    of this POI or to confirm parameters about measures of this POI. This feedback
    cannot always be sharp; it can include a confidence score, showing how much the
    user trusts the POI features to be correct. This score will be used to recalculate
    the reliability of the crowdsourced data. 6. Orchestration The core of this architecture
    is the orchestration process. As previously described, as service orchestration
    we mean the composition of microservices, tools, and processes invoked and the
    connection and automation of workflows to deliver a defined service [ 53]. To
    this end, our platform can natively run orchestration tasks written in Jolie [
    54], a programming language offering several structural advantages: it provides
    workflow constructs such as sequence, parallelism, and nondeterministic choice
    for composing communication interactions, it deals with statefulness by activating
    different workflow instances for each business task to manage, and it implements
    interfaces to almost every communication protocol commonly used. Figure 6 represents
    one of the possible workflows managed by the orchestrator. The idea is that the
    evaluation of data quality is carried out by suitably combining one or more specific
    microservices.    Figure 6  Example of orchestration workflow. In our case, the
    workflow represents the composition of data management services that, according
    to the legacy service policy, will produce results and an evaluation of their
    quality at the same time. To do that, the orchestrator begins invoking a service
    of the data management layer, in this case the data provenance service that certifies
    the provider. The results can be used by the service caller to refine authentication
    data as well feed back the data provenance service. This result will improve the
    data quality evaluation in subsequent data source service invocations. 7. Use
    Cases In order to prove the effectiveness of our approach, we tested our system
    with many different user profiles (such as users with reduced mobility, elderly
    people, blind users, and users with low vision). In this section, we present two
    scenarios illustrating urban accessibility issues involving a wheelchair user
    and an elderly user. More generally, different scenarios can be pictured, involving
    all the different aspects of the smart mobility context. For instance, an interesting
    use case can be envisioned by considering a bicycle-sharing system together with
    subway/bus stops: real time subway/bus information are automatically provided
    by the transportation provider company, while data related to the bicycle-sharing
    stations with available bikes or open docks are crowdsourced by users and/or derived
    by crowdsensed data obtained in the activity of bike block/unblock, exploiting,
    for example, RFID/NFC technologies and GPS position. In this way, the SMAll system
    can compute personalized paths by taking into account the actual time of the interested
    subway or bus and the effective availability of bikes or of open docks suggesting
    the best bicycle-sharing station to reach, according to the defined destination
    of the route. Another interesting use case that we are currently developing involves
    particular rural areas, whose main features are a low population density and a
    difficult road conditions due to rugged environmental conditions. For these particular
    areas, in general, many public transport services such as buses and trains are
    not economically justified by the current demand. Conversely, however, more accessible
    urban public transport services become essential to reach other important social
    services such as healthcare which are often far apart. SMAll provides the following
    solution. The public transport network is acting as a targeted service on request
    for each applicant. A network of taxis satisfies every single request. The SMAll
    task is to coordinate the various taxi operators who have the assigned races,
    from call handling to profit redistribution. SMAll would deal to merge close calls
    in an efficient way (e.g., Uber Pool). The advantage is twofold, the administration
    spends less to provide a service and the quality of the service for citizen is
    improved. Moreover, this can be considered an example of fostering and supporting
    community awareness in rural area [ 55]. In the two user cases here detailed,
    the users request personalized paths, by using their own smartphones. In particular,
    let us consider a male user equipped with a manual wheelchair (first scenario)
    and an elderly woman (second scenario); both of them ask for a specific path (including
    bus routes) in the city of Bologna (Italy), with the same starting point A and
    the same destination B (shown in Figures 7 and 8). The path usually proposed by
    the most commonly used geospatial mapping platforms (e.g., Google Maps, Bing Maps)
    takes 17 minutes as a whole and is structured in three parts: (i) A pedestrian
    part to reach the bus stop: this part is supposed to take 8 minutes to the user.
    (ii) A part of a bus route (from the blue bus stop to the green bus stop): this
    part is supposed to take 8 minutes (with four in-between stops). (iii) Another
    pedestrian part from the arrival bus stop to the final destination: this part
    is supposed to take 1 minute.    Figure 7  Path proposed by our system, tailored
    on a wheelchair user profile.    Figure 8  Path proposed by our system, tailored
    on an elderly user profile. This path presents some issues our users have to face:
    (1) There is a stair in the first pedestrian part of the path and there is no
    information about its presence; this means that our wheelchair user cannot afford
    the suggested pathway, but he has to find another alternative and accessible route.
    (2) There is no information about accessibility of the public mean of transport
    and of the bus stops; in particular, not all the vehicles are provided with facilities
    to support our specific user, such as ramps, kneeler features, and lifts. (3)
    Estimated time to reach the departure bus stop from the starting point (8 minutes,
    for 600 meters) is computed taking into account abilities and speed of an average
    user, instead of considering the actual abilities average speed of our specific
    users. (4) Information about bus arrival time is derived from a time table, instead
    of referring to the real bus position and availability. The following subsections
    detail the scenarios about the sensing and the data consuming activities of two
    different users with different needs and preferences about the urban environment.
    The design of the interface is under investigation and some preliminary results
    can be found in [ 56]. 7.1. First Scenario As a first scenario, let us consider
    a wheelchair user who asks for an accessible path starting from A to the destination
    B. He has set up his UAProfile declaring that he stated as LIKE ramps and curb
    cuts (as gap facilities), parking slots reserved to people with disabilities (as
    parking facility), sidewalks with an adequate width (in the pathway category),
    and zebra crossing and traffic lights (as crossing facilities). He initialized
    uneven road surface and tactile paving (in the surface category) as DISLIKE and
    Gap category aPOIs and obstructions barriers as AVOID. Handrails and audible traffic
    lights are NEUTRAL for him, as well as street lighting. Algorithm 1 shows a fragment
    of his profile in JSON format. "UAProfile": "style": "neutral": "_style": "hidden"
    , "like": "_style": "ok" Algorithm 1  When this user asks for a path from the
    starting point A to the destination B, then our system computes a personalized
    route taking into account the users profile (i.e., avoiding such barriers which
    affect him and including as much as possible the LIKEd facilities). Our system
    computes a personalized path, by taking into account real data about bus availability
    and the users profile, in terms of barriers to avoid, LIKEd facilities to include
    as much as possible, and users personal average speed (set up as 0.98 m/s, according
    to [ 57]). This path is structured in three parts (shown in Figure 7), where only
    the first part is different from the path previously described. In particular,
    (1) our path suggests a different first pedestrian part of the path, taking into
    account the presence of that stair, and finds an alternative accessible path,
    including a ramp (highlighted in Figure 7 with a green icon); (2) information
    about the accessibility of the public means of transport is provided; in particular,
    the path is computed taking into account a bus equipped with a kneeler and wheelchair
    anchorage features; (3) estimated time to reach the departure bus stop from the
    starting point is computed taking into account our specific users abilities and
    average speed, as declared in his profile (16 minutes, for 900 meters); (4) information
    about bus arrival time is provided taking into account open data about the real
    bus position and eventual delays, provided by the local public means of transport
    operator. The time to complete the path is estimated to be 30 minutes and it is
    computed according to the users average speed and real bus availability (by considering
    real time data about eventual delays, traffic, and so on, coming from open data
    made available by the public transportation provider), as follows: 16 minutes
    for the first part, 12 minutes for the second part, and 2 minutes for the last
    one. Meanwhile, crowdsensing and crowdsourcing services are exploited on the user’s
    mobile device, with the aim of collecting data and reports about urban barriers
    and facilities. 7.2. Second Scenario As a second scenario, let us consider an
    elderly woman who asks for a path from A to B, tailored according to her preferences.
    She has set up her UAProfile declaring that she stated as LIKE streets lighting,
    crossing facilities, sidewalks, ramps, curb cuts, and handrails. She also stated
    as LIKE stairs, because her doctor suggested her to do some exercise, climbing
    stairs. She stated as DISLIKE garbage bins, while steps, gaps, uneven road surface,
    and tactile paving are NEUTRAL. Algorithm 2 shows a fragment of her profile in
    JSON format. "UAProfile": "style": "neutral": "_style": "hidden" , "like": "_style":
    "ok" Algorithm 2  Once such a user asks for a pedestrian path, our system computes
    a personalized route from the starting point (A) to the destination point (B)
    taking into account her profile (i.e., stairs) and real data about bus availability.
    Also in this case the personalized path is structured in three parts and it is
    similar to the one previously described, including the stairs in its first part.
    Since this user is equipped with a smart phone, she would actively provide data
    coming from her mobile device accelerometer, so as to enrich the available information
    that are exploited by SMAll, with the aim of equipping citizens with smart mobility
    applications and data. 8. Conclusion Smart mobility is a key point in supporting
    citizens in their daily activities and in offering them a feasible smart city.
    Information about urban transportation (including taxis, buses, trains, and car-sharing),
    urban barriers and facilities, and pedestrian and multimodal paths would be of
    great benefit in this context, as well as all the information about the whole
    experience of traveling and wandering the city, including travel planning and
    payments. Crowdsensing and Mobility as a Service can play a key role in this background.
    As discussed in Sections 3–6, in providing a complete and smart urban mobility
    service, different requirements need to be considered and orchestrated. In particular,
    an efficient service-oriented approach for smart mobility needs (i) real time
    data about public means of transport; (ii) updated urban data collected via crowdsensing
    and crowdsourcing; (iii) a model able to calculate the trustworthiness of collected
    data; (iv) a definition of a precise profile according to user’s preferences and
    needs. Keeping into account these design issues, we designed and prototyped an
    infrastructure as a marketplace for mobility services, called Smart Mobility for
    All (SMAll). A prototype of such infrastructure has been developed and its architecture
    has been described in the paper, as well as some of the provided services. In
    particular, two use cases have been presented, focusing on a wheelchair user and
    an elderly person. We are now doing further studies with the aim of profiling
    users by tracking their daily journeys, by exploiting machine learning techniques,
    integrating them in crowdsensing activities. Adaptation mechanisms will be applied
    to the profile, so as to dynamically and automatically modify it according to
    users actual abilities and habits. The adopted SOA approach will make all future
    additions easy to integrate, since each new algorithm or service will be developed
    as an independent microservice and plugged into the orchestration logic as needed.
    As future work, we are planning to conduct the evaluation of the system in terms
    of (i) efficiency, scalability, and robustness and (ii) effectiveness, user experience,
    and usability. Competing Interests The authors declare that there is no conflict
    of interests regarding the publication of this paper. References R. Giffinger

    Get rights and content Highlights • Increasing demand for food urges for the modernization
    of agricultural process. • Agricultural process involves crop production as well
    as food supply chain. • Optimizing crop production requires real time monitoring
    of agricultural fields and yields. • Reducing intermediaries in the food supply
    chain increases farmers profit. • User-centric Internet of Things is a key enabler
    for realizing Smart Agriculture. Abstract Recent advancement in the technology
    has paved the way for the optimization of traditional industrial practices. Agriculture
    sector continues to serve as the backbone of the global economy. Moreover, it
    is required to cater the ever increasing demand for the food products arising
    due to rapid growth of global population. This urges for the modernization of
    traditional agricultural methodologies. Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential
    to become the key enabler for realizing the vision of Smart Agriculture. This
    paper proposes a user-centric IoT architecture for addressing the various issues
    faced in the agricultural domain. The proposed system allows the farmers to monitor
    their agricultural fields in real time and receive recommendations for producing
    good quality crops. The proposed architecture also optimizes the food supply chain
    in a manner that allows the farmers to maximize their overall profit on the sold
    goods. The applicability of the proposed architecture is evaluated using multiple
    uses cases encompassing the different aspects of the agriculture process. The
    paper also proposes a novel framework for smartphones that would facilitate the
    software engineers to develop applications required for implementing various functionality
    of the proposed system. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    1. Introduction Agriculture is one of the most important sector round the globe.
    In developing nations like India, agriculture contributes to about 15% of the
    GDP and is a vital source of the Indian Economy [1]. Few other countries that
    depends highly on agriculture for their GDP are Sierra Leone (60%), Chad (49.1%),
    Central African Republic (39.6%), etc. [52]. The World Bank data clearly depicts
    that more than one-fourth of the total employment at the global level relies on
    the agriculture sector [53]. The significance of the agriculture sector in terms
    of employment is more in the developing countries like India where approximately
    two-third of the population rely on agriculture for their income source. It is
    responsible for creating more than 50% of employment either directly or indirectly
    [1]. As per the prediction of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United
    Nation (FAO), the population of the world is expected to reach 8 billion by 2025
    and 9.6 billion by 2050 [2]. This is a clear indicator of the increase in the
    requirement of food production by 2050 at the global level. It is also required
    that the food products should be of high quality. This urges for the industrialization
    of the agricultural sector and employment of advanced technology for modernizing
    the agricultural process. The agricultural process comprises of multiple sub processes
    ranging from the production of crops to the delivery of the end products to the
    consumers. Several works in the existing literature have addressed the issues
    prevalent in the current agricultural practices. For instance, one of the key
    requirements for producing healthy crops is that of apt and timely supply of nutritional
    and water content in the agricultural fields [109]. This has been made possible
    through the real-time monitoring ability of the solutions equipped with sensors
    and actuators. The sensors are deployed in the agricultural fields where they
    continuously sense the environmental and soil conditions and transmit this information
    to the intelligent softwares residing either on the cloud or at the local level.
    These softwares are responsible for taking suitable decisions and controlling
    actuators like sprinklers, etc. so that the field conditions can be maintained
    in an automated fashion. Table 1 highlights the technology adoption scenario in
    the agriculture sector by some of the countries. Table 1. Technology Adoption
    Scenario in Agriculture. Region Technology Adoption Scenario Reference Argentina
    • Increasing employment of yield monitors, global positioning system (GPS) and
    satellite data. • Ranks second country with respect to the usage of yield monitors
    and fifth in terms of yield monitor density. [54,55] Australia • Employs GPS guidance
    for spraying or sowing of broad acre crops. • Increasing use of yield monitors.
    • Wide scale application of automatic guidance technology by the grain growing
    farmers • Approximately 20% increase in the technology adoption rate post 2008.
    [54,[56], [57], [58]] Brazil • Large scale adoption of Precision Agriculture by
    domestic (58%) and foreign (38%) sugar and ethanol firms. • Preferred technologies
    are GPS guidance with auto and manual control, satellite imaging, yield maps,
    variable rate fertilizing and liming, and georeferenced soil sampling. [[59],
    [60], [61]] Canada • 98% of surveyed farmers used GPS guidance, 84% at least one
    PA technology, 84% had combine with yield monitoring capability, 73% used auto
    section control, 75% intend to use more PA in the future [62] China • Tractor
    auto guidance was the most accepted technology and about 25% of the farmland was
    managed using PA [63] Europe • Fertilizing and spraying machines are equipped
    with PA technologies and smart or ISO-Bus enabled equipment. • Ratio of farms
    using GPS increased from 14% to 22%, soil mapping from 14% to 20%, variable rate
    application from 13% to 16% and yield mapping from 7% to 11% in 2009 compared
    to 2012. • Between 6.6% and 11.0% of surveyed farmers used PA mainly for data
    collection techniques such as GPS-based area measurement and soil sampling • Nitrogen
    sensors are used in about 20% of wheat fields primarily for nitrogen fertilizer
    application • Around 60% of UK farmers already use some sort of precision agriculture
    on their farms, although for the most part this simply means using GPS tractor
    steering [[64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69]] Japan • In rice farming, ground
    vehicles spray about 22% (in 2014) and the proportion of large-scale UAV plant
    protection has reached 36%. [70] South Africa • The number of yield monitors increased
    to more than 600, variable rate lime applications to 244, manual guidance systems
    to 200, and auto guidance to 60. [54,71] Turkey • About 310 combine harvesters
    are equipped with yield monitors. About 110 automatic steering systems and 25
    steering assistance systems were sold to the farmers. Number of variable rate
    applicators is less than 20. • GNSS-based auto guidance systems in Adana province.
    [[72], [73], [74], [75]] United States • Three most popular technologies were
    GPS guidance with auto control / auto steer (83%), GPS-enabled sprayer section
    control (74%) and GPS guidance with manual control (63%); 82% of the dealers offered
    PA services. • About 25% of peanut farms adopted GPS soil mapping and over 40%
    used auto steering; variable rate fertilizing had a higher adoption rate in peanut
    production at over 20% of farms than for many other crops. • In the 2005 survey,
    23% of cotton producers used GPS guidance as in 2013 survey, about 31% adopted
    auto section control and 59% auto guidance systems. • Until 2000s, adoption of
    different PA technologies varied up to 22% across major field crops. Tractor guidance
    grew faster than variable-rate application for all major field crops over the
    last 10 years. [[76], [77], [78]] Another key process in the agricultural domain
    is the selling off the grown products in the market. This is widely known as the
    food supply chain and involves a number of entities that act as intermediaries
    between the farmer and the final consumer. These intermediaries are responsible
    for about 75% of the total net margin accruing to the entire supply chain [1].
    Fig. 1 depicts a general food supply chain scenario. The complete process can
    be subdivided into a number of transactions. Farmers receive seeds and fertilizers
    from the suppliers required for the production of crops. The agro products produced
    by the farmers need to be sold in the market. The farmers have the choice of selling
    the food products either directly in the market designated as distribution centres
    or they can dispose of their produce to a local trader. The local traders act
    as the aggregators of the fresh food products acquired from different farmers.
    They arrange for all the necessary transportation vehicles and sell the aggregated
    food products at the distribution centres. The retailers procure these food products
    from the distribution centres and sell them to the end consumers. A study performed
    by Sidhu et al. in [35] deduced that farmers sell more than 90% of the grown crops
    to the local traders or the distribution centres while a small portion is sold
    to the retailers and consumers directly. Download : Download high-res image (291KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Food Supply Chain Scenario. The food
    supply chain has a number of shortcomings from the farmers’ point of view. As
    most of the farmers do not have sufficient resources for the storage and transportation
    of the produced crops, they tend to sell them to the local traders at a very low
    margin. Moreover, the farmers usually do not sell their crops directly in the
    market at the distribution centres. This can also be attributed to the fact that
    the rates at the distribution centres are not standardized and these farmers can
    be cheated and may be forced to sell their products at low cost. However, if the
    products are sold as per the favorable marketing condition, the farmers are expected
    to get a high return for their products. The work done in this paper is an attempt
    to minimize the various difficulties faced by the farmers in the agricultural
    sectors. This work proposes a user-centric Internet of Things (IoT) based architecture
    for facilitating the farmers to make use of the advanced technology for improving
    their crop production and increasing their profits in selling the products. IoT
    refers to a network of interconnected heterogeneous smart devices for delivering
    value added services to the society. The term “Internet of Things” was initially
    coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in the context of supply chain management. IoT
    ecosystem encompasses a wide variety of uniquely identifiable devices communicating
    using standard protocols and delivering value added services to the users [3].
    The contemporary applications of these IoT networks include a variety of domains,
    ranging from personalized applications like smart home, smart meeting room, etc.
    at one end to services such as smart healthcare, intelligent transportation, precision
    agriculture, etc., at the other end [4,5]. This rapid growth and adoption of the
    IoT technology is clearly visible in the Gartner estimates, which states that
    there will be nearly 26 billion devices on the IoT by 2020 [6]. IoT has been proved
    to be a vital component for implementing dynamic workflow adaptions [7,8]. The
    dynamic nature of the agricultural sector makes IoT the most suitable enabling
    technology for addressing various challenges prevalent in the current agricultural
    practices [[110], [111], [112],114,116]. The use of sensors in conjunction with
    the intelligent algorithms can provide smart recommendations to the farmers regarding
    the maintenance of the field quality in order to have high quality crops [9,108,113].
    Moreover, apart from the data generated by the IoT devices, user generated data
    can be a key player in transforming the traditional food supply chain to be more
    farmer friendly [115,117]. This can be realized from the fact, that if market
    rates along with the demand are made available to the farmer in real-time, he
    can make apt decision regarding the selling of the food products. This will save
    the time and effort of the farmer which would otherwise be invested in visiting
    different markets in person. This will also benefit the farmers in terms of profit
    by recommending the most favorable market for his products. The work proposed
    in this paper provides a base architecture for facilitating the incorporation
    of social dimension to the IoT based solutions for agriculture. The proposed work
    further proposes a conceptual framework for smart devices that can be used for
    leveraging the social aspects of the humans. The focal point of most of the existing
    works in the literature is limited to only certain aspects of the agricultural
    process. They either focus upon the real-time monitoring of the fields and crops
    along with the provision of providing quality control methods or they attempt
    to optimize the food supply chain component of the agricultural process. The work
    proposed in this paper, however, considers the agricultural process as a conglomerate
    of field and crop monitoring, food supply chain, transportations and logistics
    as well as optimized service recommendations. This research also in line with
    the previous works that suggest for a comprehensive conceptualization of spanning
    sustainability, perceived value and knowledge creation [79] in contrast to conceptualization
    of the perceived value as an indicator of only overall products benefits and value
    for money [80,81]. The proposed work also provides a conceptual framework for
    smart devices that can be utilized by the application developers for building
    socially aware IoT based solutions. Multiple use-case descriptions have been provided
    for demonstrating the applicability and efficiency of the proposed work. The employment
    of intelligent methodologies for optimized service recommendations in the proposed
    architecture shall, further, guide to researchers to develop more smart algorithms
    relevant to the agricultural domain. The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
    Section 2 provides the highlights of the related works present in the existing
    literature; Section 3 discusses the proposed work in detail outlining the analogy
    between the proposed architecture and the IoT ecosystem and providing a detailed
    description of the proposed system; Section 4 presents few uses cases encompassing
    the different aspects of the agricultural process; and finally, Section 5; concludes
    the paper and provides research directions to further improve the work proposed
    in this paper. 2. Related works The employment of technologies in the agriculture
    practices has been attributed to the Green Revolution in Mexico in the 1940s that
    catalyzed the increased use of high-yielding crop cultivars and inputs such as
    fertilizer and irrigation for meeting the rising demands of food [82]. There exists
    multitude of works in the literature that attempt to identify the potential factors
    of affecting the technology adoption in agriculture [[83], [84], [85], [86], [87],
    [88], [89]]. The identified factors can be summarized as: farm size, land tenure
    arrangements, access to credit and extension services, land and labour availability,
    human capital (education, gender, demographics), and farmer attitude towards risks
    and uncertainty. Results of few empirical studies [90,91] underscore the potential
    of improved agricultural technologies in enhancing productivity, income, and overall
    economic growth. The advancement in the sensing technology coupled with the reduction
    in the size of the devices as well as their cost can be considered as the most
    significant enablers of precision and micro-precision agriculture [10]. Several
    researchers have proposed different types of IoT based solutions to address the
    issues in the existing agricultural practice [11]. The ability to sense and analyze
    the production environment is critical for making precise decisions in order to
    optimize the agricultural practices so as to enhance the cultivars’ quality [12,108].
    The application of WSN techniques in the farming domain is proposed in [92]. The
    authors present a comprehensive study regarding the applicability of WSN in agriculture
    along with the various associated challenges. The authors in [13] proposed a fault
    tolerant and energy efficient WSN architecture for real time monitoring of the
    agricultural field conditions and for enhancing the crop quality and yield. The
    authors in [93] propose the employment of Photosynthetically Active Radiation
    (PAR) sensors fo non-destructive in-situ Leaf Area Index (LAI) assessment. Multiple
    researchers have proposed intelligent systems for greenhouse environment monitoring
    to reduce farming cost and energy consumptions [[14], [15], [16]]. Their proposed
    architectures encompassed wireless based remote intelligence for greenhouse control
    as an alternative to the traditional wired infrastructure. The authors in [15,17]
    proposed WSN based automated irrigation systems. The crux of their works is to
    determine the apt frequency and time of watering the fields depending upon the
    soil moisture conditions. This ensures efficient use of water and high quality
    crops. In order to address the energy consumption issue in the deployed systems,
    the low power Zigbee protocol is employed for communication. The applicability
    of the IoT concepts for controlled environment agriculture has also been explored
    in several works such as [[18], [19], [20], [21], [22]]. The authors in [94] proposed
    a framework for remotely monitoring the crops using wireless and internet communication.
    The main aim of their work is to emphasize upon the advantages of cultivating
    plants in a greenhouse instead of open fields. Several IoT based commercial platforms
    have been developed with the vision of modernizing and enhancing the effectiveness
    of farming process. These platforms have been summarized in Table 2. Table 2.

    activities and crops health status The IoT based solutions rely upon the data
    obtained from the end nodes (sensors/actuators) which needs to be analyzed in
    real-time. Storing such data locally and then transmitting it to the remote servers
    for analysis involves appreciable amount of time and the analysis and actuations
    may be delayed. To overcome such issues the authors in [[23], [24], [25]] proposed
    the use of cloud based infrastructure for real-time analysis of the collected
    data in a reliable, faster and efficient manner. The use of cloud infrastructure
    also reduces the storage cost at the local level. The benefits of using cloud
    computing techniques in conjunction with IoT for agriculture process is presented
    in [95]. The authors in [96,97] highlights the significance of precision farming
    systems. The study of authors in [97] attempts to identify the adoption aspects
    of precision farming constrained to various factors and farmers demographics.
    The obtained results clearly indicate the potential of the identified factors
    in increasing the rate of precision agriculture adoption by the farmers. A system
    for online precise irrigation scheduling (OpIRIS) for greenhouses is proposed
    in [26]. The proposed system includes a web-based application that communicates
    with the sensors installed in the greenhouses. The web application embeds intelligence
    for predicting the water requirements of the crops and providing information to
    the farmers regarding the irrigation and further nutritional requirements. The
    author in [27] used RFID devices in conjunction with the IoT and cloud infrastructure
    for load balancing and distributing the resources dynamically. The obtained results
    demonstrates significant improvement in the efficient use of resources. Balducci
    et al. in [98] focused upon the management of heterogeneous data obtained from
    multiple sensory sources. Their study also presented the potential profitability
    aspects of logging and exploiting the continuously generated dataset for achieving
    subjective goals. The authors specify the use of Regression Models and Neural
    Networks for data handling and decision making. The use of smartphones for obtaining
    various types of agricultural information is proposed in [99]. The authors also
    proposed the demonstration of advanced agricultural techniques through videos
    in order to create awareness with respect to the adoption of Precision Agriculture.
    IoT technology has the potential to become a key player in realizing the food
    supply chain traceability systems. Various issues pertaining to the food supply
    chain and their resolution using IoT has been discussed extensively in existing
    literature [28,29]. The most commonly used IoT device in food supply chain is
    the RFID which are enhanced barcodes and can be used for tracing the tracking
    the agricultural logistics. The contemporary researches have employed multiple
    sensors to augment the product status information recorded through the RFID [30,31].
    Owing to the heterogeneity and distributed architecture of the IoT, naming has
    been considered as an important aspect for real-time tracking of the food supply
    logistics [32]. The authors in [100] presented a framework for highlighting the
    technological drivers of IoT. They further proposed a methodology that employs
    IoT for facilitating the farmers to deliver the crops directly to the nearby customers.
    Virtualizing the food supply chains using the IoT concepts eradicates the need
    of physical proximity [11]. The amalgamation of advanced hardware technology and
    intelligent software agents has contributed a lot in the development of automated
    food supply chain management systems [[33], [34], [35], [36], [37]]. 3. Proposed
    methodolgy This section presents a detailed description of the proposed solution.
    The complete solution has been discussed in two parts: (i) First, an analogy of
    the solution with respect to the IoT topology has been provided, and (ii) Second,
    a detailed description of the proposed framework for achieving the required functionality
    has been discussed. A summarized view of the involved entities and the communication
    between them is provided in the latter part of this section. 3.1. Analogy of the
    proposed solution with the IoT ecosystem The complete IoT ecosystem has been divided
    into three main components viz. (i) Perception Layer, (ii) Communication Layer,
    and (iii) Intelligence or Control Layer [38]. Fig. 2 shows an overview of the
    IoT ecosystem with respect to these layers. The components of the proposed solution
    comprising each of these layers have been discussed in detail in following sub-sections.

    Fig. 2. IoT Ecosystem – Layered Representation. 3.1.1. Perception layer The Perception
    Layer is mainly responsible for acquiring data from the environment with the help
    of sensors. However, information gathering in the IoT ecosystem cannot be restricted
    to only sensory data. Users are an indispensable entity of the IoT ecosystem and
    are a rich source of data generation. Such data may correspond to either textual
    or graphical posts on the social media or even sharing of information such as
    user’s location in an explicit or implicit manner. The concept of the perception
    layer, hence, can be further extended to the data acquisition from the users through
    their smart devices, such as smartphones, smartwatches, etc. This work classifies
    the data gathering mechanisms into two broad categories depending upon the data
    source: (i) sensory data; (ii) user data. This section discusses the various types
    of information that can be obtained through various entities of the IoT Ecosystem.
    3.1.1.1. Sensory data Data obtained using sensors is termed as sensory data. Sensors
    are tiny electro-mechanical devices and can be used for obtaining information
    regarding: • Field and Weather Conditions: The quality of the crops depends mainly
    upon the soil and the atmospheric conditions in which they are being cultivated.
    The knowledge about the soil nutrients, moisture content, density of weeds and
    other factors responsible for the production of crops can help in reducing the
    use of chemical products such as herbicides, pesticides and other pollutants thereby
    reducing the environmental impact and increasing the productivity. Such type of
    information can be obtained using appropriate sensors such as meteorological sensors,
    photometric sensors, water sensors, dendrometers, biological sensors, weed seekers,
    Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), optical cameras, photosynthesis sensors,
    soil respiration or moisture sensors, hygrometers, Leaf Area index (LAI) sensors,
    etc. [39]. Sensors are resource constrained and low power devices that collect
    data from the surroundings. Data collected by these sensors is transmitted to
    a local gateway or coordinator which in turn would forward the data to cloud or
    other data centers for analysis and other services that need to be provided. •
    Logistics tracing and tracking: Another important aspect that can be addressed
    using sensors is that of logistics tracing and tracking. Logistics refer to the
    commercial activity of transporting goods to the customer and is a vital component
    of the food supply chain. The traceability of logistics is classified into three
    main categories: viz. linear, centralized and distributed [40,41]. The linear
    approach involves the sharing of the traceability data among the partners involved
    in the logistics transportation process. Every user involved in the supply chain
    captures the traceability information of the immediate buyer and supplier for
    each product. European General Food Law identifies this process as the “one step
    forward and one step back” principle [42]. The centralized approach for logistics
    tracing involves the use of shared databases for storing the traceability data.
    The national bovine animal registration systems in Europe [42] follows this centralized
    approach. The distributed approach requires the involved users to exchange the
    traceability data throughout the network of interconnected individual traceability
    systems. Information regarding the transport of raw materials from suppliers to
    the farmers, crops and pre-processed food items from farming fields to distribution
    centres and to the customer can be made available using the technology offered
    by the IoT paradigm. The “Electronic Product Code Information Services” (EPCIS)
    standard is used extensively in the food supply chain for implementing the distributed
    traceability systems [40,41,[43], [44], [45]]. The tracking systems based on EPCIS
    record the events of supply chain network and store them in either single or multiple
    repositories. These events can be retrieved upon requirement based on appropriate
    security policy [41,46]. The contents of these events comprise of product identity,
    the reason and the location of occurrence along with the timestamp. Such events
    are usually generated using AutoID technologies, such as RFID, bar codes, Optical
    Character Recognition (OCR), smart cards, etc. [47]. The architecture of the proposed
    solution employs a distributed approach for tracing and tracking mechanism. Vehicles
    used for transportation or the transported goods themselves may carry RFID and
    other devices for providing real-time information regarding the logistics. Tracing
    the logistics through user shared information is another aspect of the proposed
    system. 3.1.1.2. User data Users are an important component of the IoT ecosystem.
    Apart from the sensors, users themselves are an important source of information
    that can be utilized to enhance the quality of service being provided by the IoT
    based solution. These users have their social circles (professional and personal)
    that can be leveraged for efficient delivery of services. The addition of this
    social dimension to the IoT ecosystem allows for collaborative sharing of user
    data. The proposed system comprises of five major entities namely: (i) Supplier,
    (ii) Farmer, (iii) Transporter, (iv) Distribution Centres, and (v) Consumers.
    Information shared by each of these entities can be utilized to provide them with
    value added services using the proposed solution. • Information sharing by suppliers:
    The food supply chain initiates with the suppliers providing the necessary materials
    (fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, etc.) required by the farmers for growing crops.
    The suppliers can, as such, share information regarding the type of the products
    they are selling along with their estimated costs. This would help the farmers
    in identifying the suitable supplier for their requirements in less time. Moreover,
    even if the suppliers do not wish share the quotes publicly for the materials
    being sold, they may share their contact details which would help the farmers
    to connect with them for their enquiries in minimum time. • Information sharing
    by farmers: The type and quantity of the produced crop can be shared by the farmers
    so that intelligent recommendations may be shown to the consumers as per their
    requirements (discussed in Section 3.1.3). The availability of data such as field
    size along with the other sensory data corresponding to the field quality can
    be utilized for providing predictions regarding the types of the crops that can
    be sown and other measures required for ensuring the quality of the crops being
    produced. • Information sharing by consumers/distribution centres: Distribution
    centres and consumers may share their demands in terms of required quantity of
    the products, location of delivery, delivery deadlines, etc. Real-time availability
    of such information would benefit the farmers in deciding the distribution centre
    and consumer to whom they may sell their products. The consumers can share their
    contact details so that in case the farmer is capable of supplying the required
    goods may contact directly to the consumer, thereby eliminating the need of the
    intermediaries and getting apt prices for their products. • Information sharing
    by transporters: Transporters are indispensable part of the food supply chain
    as they are responsible for carrying the required products to the destination.
    Transportation incurs significant cost and as a result, adds to the final cost
    of the product being sold. Further, the availability of the transporters offering
    logistic services is in abundance and the rates charged by them vary among different
    transporters. Hence, it is required that the farmers or the shipment consignee
    must survey multiple transporter before selecting any. Manual survey in such cases
    becomes infeasible as it requires a lot of time and effort. As an alternative,
    the transporters can share the information regarding the services they are offering
    along with the rates being charged through electronic means so as to facilitate
    the farmers in selecting the best choice. • Location information: The information
    shared by all the user entities must be augmented with the location information
    for uninterrupted services. For instance: data shared by the farmers should include
    the location of the site/field from where the goods need to be picked. Similarly,
    consumer should provide the location of the site where the goods need to be delivered.
    Moreover, the locations of different distribution centres can help the farmers
    to decide where to sell their goods considering the distance of the distribution
    centre, cost incurred in transportation, demand quantity of goods and the rates
    being provided. Such location information can be manually shared by the concerned
    entities or can be obtained using GPS of their smart phones. Table 3 summarizes
    the various types of information obtained by the perception layer along with their
    source. Table 3. Information obtained in Perception Layer. Information Type Source

    service 3.1.2. Communication layer This layer is mainly responsible for transmitting
    the data in the IoT network and mainly deals with the protocols that need to be
    employed for local as well as global communication. The proposed solution classifies
    the communication layer into (i) Physical Communication layer, and (ii) Virtual
    Communication sub-layer. The role and responsibilities of these sublayers are
    discussed further in this section. 3.1.2.1. Physical communication sub-layer This
    sub-layer is concerned with the underlying protocols required to transmit the
    data from various sources across the IoT network. As discussed in Section 3.1.1,
    data obtained in perception layer comprises of sensory data and user data. User
    data can be shared using smartphones that are rich in computational power and
    energy and hence legacy protocols for the wireless networks can be employed for
    transmitting such type of data. The application layer data can be shared using
    suitable protocols such as REST, HTTP, etc. Sensors, in contrast, are resource
    constrained and low power devices. Protocols such as Zigbee, Bluetooth Low Energy,
    etc. that have been designed for such devices operating in a Personal Area Network
    (PAN) can be used for sharing data generated by these devices. Table 4 presents
    a highlight of the protocols for IoT based communication. Table 4. Protocols for

    devices; (i) Reduced Functional Device (RFD), and (ii) Fully Functional Device
    (FFD) [48]. RFDs are the end devices comprising of sensors/actuators while FFDs
    can play the role of Coordinator that is responsible for starting and managing
    the personal area network. FFDs may also be used as routers to extend the range
    of the personal area networks. Data collected by the end devices are sent to the
    coordinator via a router. The coordinator further transmits the data to a gateway
    device that is responsible for computation, analysis and further transmission
    of the data to the cloud. Computation and data analysis can be performed at a
    local level (Coordinator/Gateway) or at remote site or cloud. Fig. 3 represents
    the communication topology of the proposed solution. Download : Download high-res

    for the Proposed Architecture. 3.1.2.2. Virtual communication sub-layer The virtual
    communication sub-layer acts as an overlay network superimposed over the physical
    network. This implies that even though the users may think that they are directly
    connected to a remote user (virtual connection), however, in practice the communication
    between these two users may involve multiple routers, switches and other network
    components. The virtual connection between the different entities involved in
    the proposed system is shown in Fig. 4. For simplicity, the figure omits the networking
    details and focusses mainly upon the communicating entities. Download : Download

    between the IoT entities. Data from the sensors can be processed locally at the
    gateway or remotely at the cloud or remote data centres. This data is required
    to provide intelligent services and notifications to the users. Information shared
    by the suppliers is stored on the cloud and is used for recommending the most
    suitable supplier to farmers depending upon their requirements. Similarly, depending
    upon the customer demands or distribution centres requirements and quotes, intelligent
    notifications and recommendation services can be provided to the farmers. The
    location information of the customers and distribution centres can be used to
    provide suggestions regarding the shortest route available to them. These services
    have been discussed in detail in Section 4. 3.1.3. Intelligence layer This is
    the most vital layer and is responsible for providing intelligent services to
    the users based upon the data acquired in the Perception Layer and transmitted
    in the Communication Layer. Intelligence capability can be embedded at local or
    global level. The proposed solution is capable of delivering a number of intelligent
    services to the users in the context of agriculture and food supply chain. The
    services provided by the proposed architecture has been discussed below: • Crop
    Prediction: Data regarding the quality of the farming fields such assoil nutrients,
    moisture content, density of weeds, etc. along with the weather conditions is
    used for predicting the type of the crops that can be sown. Prediction can be
    further enhanced by incorporating the details of the requirements of the market.
    For instance, if the demand for a particular type of food product is high and
    if the agricultural fields has the potential to grow good quality of the required
    product, the predictions can recommend that particular product to the farmer with
    high priority. Further, real-time data regarding the status of crops can be utilized
    to develop predictions regarding the time of harvesting as well. • Real-time monitoring
    of agricultural fields: Sensors fixed at predefined locations at the fields, unmanned
    arial vehicles UAVs such drones mounted with sensors or even sensor mounted vehicles
    are capable of providing the real time information about the field conditions.
    For instance, flame sensors can be placed to issue warning message to the farmers
    if fire is detected. An accompanying mounted camera can also click a picture of
    the situation when fire was detected. The warning messages should be sent to the
    smartphones of the farmers so that the necessary measures can be taken to avoid
    the impact of the adverse conditions. Farmers can also receive the real-time data
    about the conditions of their crops and agricultural fields so as to prevent unwanted
    pests hampering the quality of the crops. • Intelligent Recommendation Services:
    These services refer to the intelligent recommendations as per the requirements
    of the user. For instance, data shared by the suppliers can be used to recommend
    the most apt choice to the farmer as per their requirements. Similarly, manually
    visiting the distribution centres is not feasible for the farmers due to a number
    of reasons. One of the prominent being non-standardized rates of the goods offered
    by the distribution centres. Farmers are usually unware of the rates fixed for
    each type of the crops and as such there is a chance that the farmer gets cheated
    by the people at distribution centre. Moreover, different distribution centres
    provide different rates for the same product. Another important factor that prevents
    the farmers from visiting different distribution centres is their distance. Farmers,
    usually, reside in rural areas while the distribution centres are in the cities.
    Manually visiting each distribution centres would require considerable amount
    of time, effort and money. Hence, online availability of such information would
    facilitate the farmers to select the most appropriate distribution centre for
    selling their good. The use of intelligent algorithms that consider factors such
    as demand, cost, distance, etc., to suggest the most suitable choice to the users
    further helps in saving the decision-making efforts of the farmers. The end consumers
    can also be provided with appropriate recommendations for procuring the goods
    directly from the farmers. Depending upon the required quantity and type of the
    products by the consumer, algorithms can be employed to mine and filter suitable
    farmers that are willing to sell their goods. This is made possible due to the
    information shared by the farmers about their crops and locations. Upon selecting
    a suitable choice the consumer can directly contact the farmer using the contact
    details provided by them. • Shortest Route Prediction: Considering that the location
    of the destination is available different mechanisms can be employed to suggest
    the shortest route to users for delivering the goods. Such mechanism may include
    use of web APIs such as Google Maps [49], Distance Calculator [50], GeoDataSource
    [51] and others. • Logistics Tracing and Tracking: Tracing and tracking services
    for the transported goods is an essential mechanism. Vehicles and goods equipped
    with RFID sensors can provide real time location information. This information
    is made available to the dispatcher and other stakeholders on demand. The proposed
    solution also provides the mechanism for implicit sharing of location using smartphones
    or other GPS embedded devices mounted on the goods or vehicles. 3.2. Proposed
    system model This section discusses the proposed framework for smart devices to
    realize the intelligent services for the agriculture practice. Fig. 5 provides
    a detailed overview of the proposed framework. The proposed framework can be utilized
    by the application developers for designing applications pertaining to specific
    use cases. The proposed framework allows the developers to leverage the functionalities
    required for achieving the concept of smart architecture. The different components
    of the framework have been discussed below: • User Profile Manager: This module
    is responsible for maintaining the user profile information, such as name, contact
    details, user location, and so on. The information is stored in the User profile
    database and is retrieved during recommendation services. • Contact List Manager:
    Contact list management refers to the addition of new contacts and updation or
    deletion of the existing contacts. The module offers the functionality similar
    to the contact management in smart mobile phones. Data entered through this module
    is stored in Phonebook database. • Contact Group Manager: This module is responsible
    for grouping the contacts as per the user preference. For instance, all the contacts
    of different logistic operators may be clubbed into one group. This would facilitate
    the information dissemination to the required group as per the user’s requirement.
    For instance, if the farmer wishes to hire a transport vehicle for the delivery
    of food product, he can upload his requirements on the mobile application which
    would in turn send this data as notifications to all the logistic operators existing
    in the group. • User Data Requirements Module: This serves as an interface to
    add the user requirements which would eventually be either uploaded on cloud portal
    or sent to specific users or groups. Adding a requirement may include the group
    name to which the user wants to send the information. The user can also specify
    the requirements as public indicating that the requirements will be published
    on the cloud portal from where every user can view the published information.
    This data is also saved in the User Requirements database for a specified period
    of time. • Notifications Module: This is unified module for displaying the notifications
    received on the mobile application. Notifications can be classified into different
    categories, such as (i) Field Conditions: Data received from sensors deployed
    in the agricultural field; (ii) Requirement Notifications: Information regarding
    the market demand or the demand of the consumers; and (iii) Recommendations: Suggestions
    obtained from the intelligent recommendation module. • Intelligent Recommendation
    Module: This serves as the intelligence core for the proposed framework. The intelligent
    services discussed in Section 3.1.3 is realized through this module. The module
    is responsible for providing intelligent recommendation so as to facilitate the
    decision making process of the users, such as the best option for selling the
    produced crops, or suggestion regarding improving the field quality in terms of
    nutrients or moisture, etc. The module interacts with the notification module
    for retrieving real time requirements received on the mobile applications and
    provides suggestions to the users as per the requirements. • Network Interface:
    This serves as an interface to the network and is responsible for the transmission
    and reception of the messages to and fro the network. • Cloud Portal: The cloud
    portal refers to a web-based application portal for storing the various types
    of data submitted by the user. Any information published on the cloud portal can
    be either for public or specific users. Users can synchronize their mobile application
    to fetch the latest requirements posted by the distribution centres in the market
    regarding the cost of the products and their demand or the customers regarding
    their requirements. Real-time rates and the product demand in the market can be
    obtained from this portal and can be used to provide intelligent recommendations
    to the user. Download : Download high-res image (406KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. Proposed Framework. 4. Use-cases description The concept of social
    network of things can benefit the stakeholders in a number of ways. This section
    discusses the various scenarios where the proposed concept can facilitate the
    users in terms of effort and time. The scenarios discussed in this section covers
    the different aspects of agriculture ranging from procurement of raw products
    from the supplier to the selling of the agriculture product to the customers.
    4.1. Use Case 1: procuring raw materials from the farmers The initial stage of
    farming starts with the decision of the type of crops that can be grown and the
    materials required for good quality crops. Decision regarding the type of crops
    to be grown depends upon a number of factors including the climatic and field
    conditions, demand of the crop in the market, etc. The sensors installed in the
    fields acquire different types of information regarding the field conditions,
    the weather conditions can be obtained by either using sensors or the third party
    services. This information is aggregated by the coordinators and transmitted through
    the gateway to both the service running on the cloud as well as to the smartphones
    of the farmers. The Notification Module is responsible for displaying the received
    information as notifications on the smartphones. The demand of various crops in
    the market is availed from the information shared the distribution centres and
    stored in the repository residing on cloud. The Intelligent Recommendation Module
    uses relevant algorithms for data aggregation and service composition for recommending
    the type of the product most suited as per the conditions. This information is
    directly made available to the farmers through the Notification Module of the
    proposed framework. The recommendation algorithms can either be executed on the
    cloud or on the users’ smartphone. Once the type of crop has been decided, the
    next stage is to procure different materials required for growing the crop. This
    includes seeds, fertilizers, etc. A farmer can upload his requirements regarding
    the material type and the quantity required on his mobile application using the
    User Data Requirements Module. This information is shared among the different
    raw material suppliers and they are presented with an option to quote their rates.
    The quoted rates are displayed on the farmer’s smartphone application through
    the Notification Module. The farmer can then select the most suitable supplier
    as per his preference and contact him using the details shared by the raw material
    supplier. This would not only save the farmer’s time and effort for procuring
    the material but would also enable them to get the best rates for the procured
    goods. 4.2. Use case 2: farmer and customer Getting directly in touch with the
    end customer can be a boon for the farmers since the cost incurred by the intermediaries
    will be avoided leading to an overall increase in the farmer as well as customer
    benefits. Fig. 6 shows the information exchange between the farmers’ and the customer’s
    smart device. Initially, consider Farmer 1 made a transaction with a Customer
    XYZ. Upon successful transaction, the information of the Customer XYZ is added
    to the contact list maintained in Farmer 1′s smartphone using the Contact List
    Manager module. Similarly, upon interacting with different farmers, the information
    of the Customer XYZ is stored in all the corresponding farmer’s smartphone device.
    All the customers whose details are stored in the farmers’ mobile application
    is grouped under the Costumer Tag using the Contact Group Manager. Similarly,
    when a customer saves the information of different famers in his mobile application
    they will be grouped under the Farmer Tag by the Contact Group Manager. In future,
    if the Customer XYZ decides to purchase agricultural goods, he may upload the
    requirements along with other details in the application installed in his smartphone
    device using the User Data Requirements Module. This information regarding the
    requirements of the customer is used by the Intelligent Recommendation Module
    for providing the list of potential farmers capable of supplying the required
    product. The module shall fetch the details of farmers stored under the Farmer
    Tag from the Contact Group Manager. The application will then mine the relevant
    farmers capable of supplying the required goods and those farmers existing in
    the contact list of the customer shall receive a notification on their mobile
    application through the Notifications Module informing them about the requirements
    of the Customer XYZ. Fig. 6 shows an instance of the scenario where Farmer 1 and
    Farmer 2 receive the notification about the Customer XYZ requirements and are
    provided with an option to quote their rates. When the farmers quote their corresponding
    rates for the required goods using the Submit Requirement Notification Response
    module, Customer XYZ can view the rates quoted by the different famers on his
    mobile application. The customer can then manually select a farmer to view his
    details, and can contact him directly for further confirmations. If the farmer
    agrees to supply the required products, he needs to confirm the deal on his mobile
    application portal after which the customer will receive a success acknowledgement
    of the transaction, as shown in Fig. 6. This would allow the farmer to sell their
    products directly to customer without going through the distribution centres.
    This would also allow the customer to get goods at cheaper price than the retailer
    rates. Download : Download high-res image (406KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Farmer-Customer interaction using the proposed framework. 4.3. Use
    case 3: farmer and logistics operator Once the farmer has finalized the deal with
    the customer, he needs to transport the goods to the customer. The transport facility
    can be arranged by the customer as well as the farmer depending upon the terms
    agreed in the deal. Fig. 7 depicts the scenario where the transportation is arranged
    by the farmers themselves. As in case with the customers, the farmers can have
    a separate group for storing the contact details of various logistic operators
    using Contact List Manager and Contact Group Manager. A farmer uploads his requirements
    regarding the quantity of the goods that need to be transported along with the
    location details and the date by which the goods should reach the designated locations.
    Different logistic operators receive the notification about the requirements of
    the farmer through Notifications Module and they are required to quote their rates
    using Submit Requirement Notification Response module of the proposed framework.
    The Notifications Module on the farmer’s mobile application displays the rates
    quoted by different logistics operators. He may then select the most suitable
    operator and can contact him using the contact details uploaded by the logistics
    operator in the User Profile Manage component of the framework. Upon successful
    confirmation of the logistics operator, the operator sends the details of the
    vehicle to be used for transportation as well as that of the driver responsible
    for transporting the goods. The contact details of the farmer and the customer
    is sent to the driver as well. The application will automatically add the driver’s
    information in the friends list of the farmer and the farmer’s information in
    the friends list of the driver. When the driver starts from the source location,
    the real time location sharing of the vehicle will be automatically turned on
    and the farmer can receive the location information the transported goods. When
    the consignment is received by the customer the real time location sharing of
    the vehicle is automatically turned off for the stakeholders involved in this
    transaction. This application of the social network of thigs concept clearly eliminates
    the requirement of having extra RFIDs or other sensors installed on the vehicles
    for location tracking. The concept of location sharing is applicable between the
    customer and the vehicle driver as well. This implies that the customer will also
    receive the real time location of the transported goods. Download : Download high-res

    interaction using the proposed framework. 4.4. Use case 4: intelligent recommendations
    The agricultural product, once harvested, is sold in the market for the consumption
    by the customers. This process, in its current state, involves multiple entities.
    For instance, the farmer sells the goods to the local broker who will arrange
    for the transportation and will sell the goods to the distribution centre. These
    distribution centers quote rates for the products as per the demand in the market.
    The standard rates of the goods are not available with the farmers. This allows
    the local brokers to purchase the goods from the farmers at a meagre expense and
    they sell the same goods at higher price to the distribution centers. It is also
    not feasible for the farmer to manually visit the different distribution centres
    to sell their goods, since these distribution centres are located in urban areas
    far from the farmer’s field. The proposed system is capable of recommending various
    services to user as per the requirement. An important application of the proposed
    solution is to facilitate the farmers to sell their goods directly at these distribution
    centres. A farmer is required to upload the product information such as crop type,
    crop quantity, etc. which he wants to sell at the distribution centre using the
    User Data Requirements Module. The Intelligent Recommendation Module of the proposed
    framework will capture the location of different distribution centres, demand
    of the agricultural goods and their quoted rates. This data can be then used to
    recommend the most suitable distribution centre to the farmer where he can sell
    his goods. The location information adds one more level of intelligence to the
    recommendation service by suggesting the most apt distribution centre in terms
    of cost as well as the distance of the distribution centre from the farmer’s location.
    Once the farmer finalizes the distribution centre, live traffic conditions can
    be utilized to suggest the shortest route to the distribution centre. Fig. 8 shows
    an instance where Farmer 1 needs to sell crop type X at the distribution centre.
    The farmer uploads the crop type and the quantity to be sold. The Intelligent
    Recommendation Module searches and suggests the list of different distribution
    centre in the order of their suitability index. Once the farmer selects a particular
    distribution centre, the module recommends the shortest route to the distribution
    centre as per the live traffic conditions. Download : Download high-res image

    the farmer selects a particular distribution centre, the module recommends the
    shortest route to the distribution centre as per the live traffic conditions.
    5. Discussion There exists a plethora of research regarding the applicability
    of IoT based systems for improving the traditional agricultural practices. However,
    the work proposed in this paper is an improvement over the existing works since
    it does not only relies upon the sensory data for providing the services to the
    user but it also incorporates the user centric data in terms of requirements and
    preferences of the user. Moreover, the proposed work also attempts to incorporate
    a certain level of social relations of the users in order to provide the right
    information at right time and at right place. The social relation refers to the
    type of relations that a humans share with other humans in the professional or
    personal domain. The conceptual architecture and framework proposed in this paper
    for incorporating social dimension to the IoT ecosystem has wide scope of application
    in the agricultural domain. This can be inferred from the various use case descriptions
    provided in Section 4. This section further presents logical justifications for
    the proposed work. Consider a farmer who has to sell his produce in the market
    say 50 kg of food product and that the invested amount by the famer is Rs. 5000.
    In the current scenario, where multiple intermediaries are involved in the food
    supply chain, the farmer is tempted to sell this product to local broker at say
    Rs. 6000. The broker will arrange for the transport facility and will sell this
    product at the distribution centre at a higher price say Rs. 10,000. These distribution
    centres will further sell this product to the retailers at a price that will be
    higher than 10,000. For simplicity, let us consider the distributers sell the
    product at Rs 15,000. This makes the Rs 5000 food product worth of Rs 15,000,
    i.e. Rs 300 per kg which was initially produced in Rs 100 per kg. Moreover, the
    farmer gained only Rs 1000 by selling 50 kg of product, i.e. Rs 10 per kg even
    when the consumer is paying Rs 300 per kg of the same product. In this context,
    the proposed architecture shall help the farmer to maximize his profit while allowing
    the consumers to purchase the product at a reasonable cost. This can be attributed
    to the fact that the proposed architecture shall allow the consumers to purchase
    the products directly from the farmer. Obviously, the required amount of product
    that needs to be purchased cannot be too small, since it would be infeasible for
    the farmer to ship a small quantity of the product to the customer place at low
    price. However, if it is feasible for the consumer, he can directly visit the
    famer for collecting the product. The proposed architecture also enables the farmer
    to select the most appropriate distribution centre for selling their products
    without investing too much effort and time in the process. Consider a famer needs
    to sell 50 kg of product at the distribution centre which can be 50 kms from his
    place. The rate at which the farmer will sell its product will vary from one distribution
    centre to another. Let us consider that distribution centre A is 50 km from the
    famer’s place and is will to purchase the product at Rs 100 per kg while distribution
    centre B is 70 km from the farmer’s place but is expected to purchase the product
    at Rs 150 per kg. This problem further elevates when the number of distribution
    centres increase with each having different price and distance. The amount of
    effort and time that the farmer has to invest for visiting each of these distribution
    centre before he makes his decision regarding the choice of distribution centre
    where he can sell the product is very high. In this context, the proposed work
    in this paper shall facilitate the farmer to obtain this information without having
    the need to visit each centre individually. Moreover, the proposed work will also
    assist the farmer in selecting the best option since the intelligent algorithms
    shall provide the farmer with a list of distribution centres ranked according
    to the farmer preferences, i.e. whether he needs to maximize the cost or minimize
    the distance. Another important contribution of the proposed work is that it will
    provide the farmers with the real time assessment of the agricultural field conditions
    that will help him in maintain the quality of the field and eventually the quality
    of the grown crops. Moreover, this information can also be analyzed for recommending
    the farmers with the type of food products that he can grow as per the conditions
    of the field. The demand of the crops in the market shall allow the farmer to
    grow the right type and quantity of product in order to minimize the wastage and
    loss which would otherwise incur if the products are in excess than the demand.
    6. Conclusions and future works The exponential rise in the global population
    has created an increased demand for the quantity as well as quality of the food
    products. This demand can be catered by modernizing the agricultural sector. IoT
    has the potential to optimize the traditional agricultural practices. The conjunction
    of smart devices with the intelligent algorithms can be a boon to the farmers.
    This paper proposes an IoT architecture for adding the smartness component to
    the agricultural sector. The proposed architecture relies upon the data obtained
    from the end devices comprising of not only sensors/actuators but also the farmers
    and other personnel involved in the agricultural process. Information regarding
    the quality of the agricultural fields is helpful for growing good quality crops.
    The architecture proposed in this paper provides real time monitoring of the agricultural
    fields so as to facilitate the farmers to supply the required nutrients to the
    crops in a timely manner. User generated data comprising of product demand and
    cost helps the farmers as well as consumers to obtain good quality products at
    optimal rates. The proposed architecture also takes care of the real-time tracing
    and tracking of the food supply logistics. The data being shared by the different
    entities involved in the proposed system can be collaborated to provided critical
    and value added recommendations for enhancing the efficiency of the agricultural
    practices. The discussed use cases clearly depicts the applicability of the proposed
    architecture in the various agricultural process scenario. However there are certain
    limitations of the work presented in this paper that needs to be addressed for
    enhancing the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. The architecture proposed
    in this paper relies upon the user generated data and as such storage of these
    large volumes of data is a key concern. Moreover, intelligent algorithms for searching
    relevant information in the IoT needs to be designed in order to minimize the
    delivery time of the services. Other aspects of the proposed architecture that
    require critical attention is that that security, privacy and trust management.
    This can be attributed to the fact that smart devices such as smart phones owned
    by the users are the storehouses of multiple types of personal and important information.
    These devices are assumed to work autonomously in the proposed architecture and
    hence are vulnerable to various types of security attacks. Further, the trust
    credentials of the shared information is also a significant concern since false
    information can misguide the users and reduce the efficiency of the recommendation
    services. Moreover, the heterogeneity of the devices in the IoT ecosystem needs
    to be addressed in order to ensure interoperability between the devices. References

  explanation: In this research, the review team carried out a systematic literature
    review on automated, real-time irrigation management systems utilizing IoT. The
    primary goal was to conduct an in-depth evaluation of contemporary IoT-enabled
    irrigation management systems in relation to their capabilities and benefits,
    as well as to identify areas for future development and research. The review also
    aimed to contrast IoT-enabled solutions with non-IoT approaches, highlighting
    where IoT can augment or replace existing practices. This comprehensive review
    provided insights into the current state of IoT-enabled irrigation management
    systems, their advantages and disadvantages, and potential areas for further research
    and development.
  extract_1: In recent years, circular business models (CBM) have become an inevitable
    requirement to foster improvements in environmental performance. However, the
    current literature rarely discusses the link between Internet of Things (IoT)
    and CBM.
  extract_2: Therefore, progress of IoT-enabled CBM has attracted academic researches,
    which have recently assessed the impact of I4.0 technologies such as IoT on CBM
    with different conclusions (Rosa et al., 2019, 2020). They discussed CBM and IoT
    from economic, social and environmental perspectives (Govindan and Hasanagic,
    2018; Ding et al., 2023). Rejeb et al. (2022) reviewed how the IoT provides contributions
    and challenges in the CBM domain.

    dematerialized solutions, supporting ‘Redesign’ strategy. • IoT reduces the energy
    use of the Optimize and Loop business model with 20–30%. Abstract In recent years,
    circular business models (CBM) have become an inevitable requirement to foster
    improvements in environmental performance. However, the current literature rarely
    discusses the link between Internet of Things (IoT) and CBM. This paper first
    identifies four IoT capabilities including monitoring, tracking, optimization
    and design evolution for improving CBM performance based on the ReSOLVE framework.
    In a second step, a systematic literature review using the PRISMA approach analyzes
    how these capabilities contribute to 6 R and CBM through the CBM-6R and CBM-IoT
    cross-section heatmaps and relationship frameworks, followed by assessing the
    quantitative impacts of IoT on potential energy saving in CBM. Finally, challenges
    are analyzed for the realization of IoT-enabled CBM. The results show that the
    assessments of Loop and Optimize business models dominate current studies. IoT
    plays a significant role in these business models respectively through tracking,
    monitoring and optimization capabilities. While (quantitative) case studies for
    Virtualize, Exchange and Regenerate CBM are substantially needed. IoT holds the
    potential to reduce energy consumption by around 20–30% for referenced applications
    in the literature. However, the IoT hardware, software and protocol energy consumption,
    interoperability, security and financial investment might become main obstacles
    for the wider use of IoT in CBM. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    frameworkCircular business model 1. Introduction 1.1. Key concepts and a brief
    history of the IoT Since the birth of the internet in the early 1980s, attempts
    have been made to connect “Things” with the internet. In 1990, John Romkey created
    the first Internet ‘device’, a toaster that could be turned on and off via the
    Internet (Romkey, 2017). Paul Saffo gave the first brief description of sensors
    and how they could be used in connection with the internet in 1997 (Saffo, 1997).
    To describe this growing connection of sensors and similar devices providing real-time
    information via the internet, in 1999 the term “Internet of Things” was coined
    by Kevin Ashton, who was working in supply chain optimization and invented a new
    technology called Radio-frequency identification (RFID)-based item identification
    in the same year (Suresh et al., 2014). In 2003, Walmart deployed RFID in all
    its shops across the globe to measure product stocks and sales and support supply
    chain management (Harold, 2007). In 2005, International Telecommunication Union
    (ITU, 2005) regarded the IoT as a third wave of the world''s information industry
    transformation. In 2008, the Federal Communications Commission approved the usage
    of the “white space spectrum” (Suresh et al., 2014). Later, IT giants like Cisco,
    IBM and Ericsson took a lot of educational and commercial initiatives with IoT.
    Some countries, like China, listed the IoT as a strategic emerging technology
    in their long-term plans (MIIT, 2012). The IoT technology can be simply explained
    as a connection between humans - computers - things. It uses RFID, infrared sensors,
    global positioning systems, laser scanners and other information-sensing equipment
    to connect any item under internet protocol (IP) with a unique IP address for
    information exchange and communication, which can achieve intelligent positioning,
    tracking, monitoring and management of items. The systems architecture can, for
    instance, be based on the context of operations and processes in real-time scenarios.
    For instance, in a smart home, every electrical switch box could be connected
    with a smart phone so that it could be operated remotely. The HarmonyOS system
    recently created by Huawei uses full stack decoupling architecture that could
    even solve constraints issues on the boundary of software and hardware, thus making
    it possible for other collaborators to join the system (Chen and Matt, 2021).
    Altogether, the application boundary of the IoT has been expanded considerably.
    Such a scenario does not need a processor and a storage device installed in every
    switch box. It just needs a sensor to capture signals and process them (mostly
    switching ON/OFF). 1.2. Potentials by IoT technologies in CE in a finite world
    Avoiding overshooting of planetary boundaries for climate change (Rockström et
    al., 2009) and switching to more sustainable practices are among the greatest
    challenges of the 21st century. Any approach to reduce pressures requires simultaneous
    consideration of economic, social, and especially environmental aspects of industrial
    processes, as well as respective interactions along cradle-to-grave value chains
    of products and services (Ren et al., 2013). Important strategies to reduce critical
    raw material use are sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) and circular usage
    of products and materials (Manavalan and Jayakrishna, 2019). Seuring and Müller
    (2008) defined SSCM as “the management of material, information and capital flows
    as well as cooperation among companies along the supply chain, while taking goals
    from all three dimensions – environmental, economic and social into account which
    are derived from customer and stakeholder requirements.” Circularity adds a different
    perspective to SSCM as it tries to keep substances in closed loops. Unlike a linear
    economy that is based on a “take-make-dispose” model, CE promotes longevity, reparability,
    durability and recyclability of products with the aim of a full re-use of resources
    (Elisha, 2020). It therefore symbolizes a linear to loop transition for supply
    chains in sustainability (Schröder et al., 2019). In the industry 4.0 (I4.0) era,
    the IoT offers opportunities to foster CE in value chains through real-time monitoring
    of the resources inventory (Mohammadian, 2019). It can support the minimization
    of waste flows through product lifetime detection. As consequence material reuse
    and recycling processes can be optimized. In summary, IoT promotes a highly accurate,
    efficient and sound use of resources aimed at the shift from disposable to renewable
    resources paradigm, and facilitates the born and development of CBM (Ghisellini
    et al., 2016; Nižetić et al., 2020). Therefore, progress of IoT-enabled CBM has
    attracted academic researches, which have recently assessed the impact of I4.0
    technologies such as IoT on CBM with different conclusions (Rosa et al., 2019,
    2020). They discussed CBM and IoT from economic, social and environmental perspectives
    (Govindan and Hasanagic, 2018; Ding et al., 2023). Rejeb et al. (2022) reviewed
    how the IoT provides contributions and challenges in the CBM domain. They identified
    important drivers and provided a structured framework that exploring business
    and management-focused CE strategies based on IoT technologies. However, there
    is still a large gap between theory and practice (Gorissen et al., 2016). In particular,
    most small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are encountering unprecedented pressure
    to improve environmental performance. Since the adoption cost of the IoT could
    be tremendous, they might hesitate to seize IoT-enabled emission reduction opportunities
    based on their specific status (Ding et al., 2023; Awan et al., 2022a). This requires
    an in-depth understanding of the IoT capabilities and the characteristics of different
    CBMs to find their best intersection point. Besides, the circularity of IoT devices
    themselves should also be considered (Beier et al., 2018). Given these research
    gaps this paper addresses the following research questions. i) What are the (synergy)
    contributions of IoT capabilities under different CBM? ii) What are the carbon
    emission reduction potentials of the IoT in different CBM? iii) What are the obstacles
    for SMEs to adopt IoT in promoting circular strategies? The contributions of this
    paper are as follows: We used a pre-defined circular business framework (ReSOLVE)
    developed by Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF, 2015) to analyze the CBM-IoT context
    and linked it to 6 R principles to specifically map the IoT capabilities into
    each business practices. This visualizes how IoT contributes differently in each
    business model and provides information for us to describe the relationship between
    IoT capabilities, 6 R and CBM. Additionally, we quantitatively review the literature
    on how IoT can contribute to reducing environmental impacts under CBM and identify
    their obstacles. This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces the Prisma
    methodology we used as the method for the literature review, and the reasoning
    of paper selection. Section 3 reviews IoT''s role in CE, introduces the capabilities
    of IoT correlated with CBM and identifies its environmental opportunities. Section
    4 reflects on potential obstacles for IoT adjustment in CBM. Section 5 comprehensively
    summarizes our findings and concludes. Finally, section 6 outlines limitations
    and gives recommendations for future research. 2. Review approach: Prisma 2.1.
    Introduction of Prisma In June 2022, we conducted a literature search based on
    the checklist framework provided by the PRISMA-P guidelines (Moher et al., 2015).
    PRISMA was initially used in the medical field. Although other methods for conducting
    literature reviews and meta-analyses are available (Horvathova, 2012; Luederitz
    et al., 2016), PRISMA guidelines have become widely accepted as an approach to
    conduct transparent literature reviews. Recently they have been applied in the
    field of sustainability and CE research (Blanco et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2019;
    Zalk and Behrens, 2018; Aguilar-Hernandez et al., 2021). The latest PRISMA Abstract
    2020 (Page et al., 2021a, Page et al., 2021b) suggests discussing 5 main items
    in relation to 10 subcategories in a review. We refer to the checklist items listed
    in Table 1. Table 1. Major steps in Prisma Abstract 2020 (Page et al., 2021a,
    Page et al., 2021b). Section and Topic Item # Checklist item TITLE Title 1 Identify
    the report as a systematic review. BACKGROUND Objectives 2 Provide an explicit
    statement of the main objectives or questions. METHODS Eligibility criteria 3
    Specify the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the review. Information sources
    4 Specify the information sources (e.g., databases, search terms) used to identify
    studies. Risk of bias 5 Specify the methods used to assess risk of bias in the
    studies included. Synthesis of results 6 Specify the methods used to present and
    synthesize results. RESULTS Included studies 7 Give the total number of studies
    included and participants and summarize relevant characteristics of the studies.
    Synthesis of results 8 Present results for main outcomes, preferably indicating
    the number of studies included and participants for each. If a meta-analysis was
    carried out, report the summary estimate and confidence/credible interval. If
    comparing groups, indicate the direction of the effect (i.e., which group is favoured).
    DISCUSSION Limitations of evidence 9 Provide a brief summary of the limitations
    of the evidence included in the review (e.g., study risk of bias, inconsistency
    and imprecision). Interpretation 10 Provide a general interpretation of the results
    and important implications. These categories explain the search objectives and
    eligibility criteria, including the methods and reasons for including and excluding
    certain records (i.e. some papers do not contain the keywords checked for but
    have keywords with similar meanings, some papers contain the keywords but do not
    explain them in detail). Second, it describes the steps of the quantitative analysis,
    which includes collecting data from selected publications and harmonizing their
    values. Based on this framework, this literature review was conducted. 2.2. Classification
    of papers We use the 6 R concept (Joshi et al., 2006) to initially classify circularity
    strategies and related business models, as shown in Fig. 1. The 6 R concept discerns
    Reuse, Recycle, Reduce, Repair, Remanufacture and Redesign. Sihvonen and Ritola
    (2015) regarded the 6 R framework as the operational approaches and core principles
    of CE. Report of Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF, 2013) pointed out that discovering
    new paths to support CE under 6 R guidance – “an industrial system that is restorative
    or regenerative by intention and design” is becoming more and more vital against
    the background of Industrial 4.0 era. From a systems perspective, the combination
    of six operational approaches (6 R) enables new business models of CE at the macro
    level (Kirchherr et al., 2017). Download : Download high-res image (451KB) Download

    Based on these characteristics, the ReSOLVE framework further explains CE -- Preserve
    and enhance natural capital, optimize resource yields and foster system effectiveness,
    and classifies circular models based on the economic and resource impacts of major
    sectors (EMF, 2015). It offers a tool for generating circular strategies and growth
    initiatives. Jabbour et al. (2018) then connected Industry 4.0 technologies to
    six CBM proposed by the ReSOLVE framework, namely Regenerating, Share, Optimize,
    Loop, Virtualize and Exchange, to guide organizations through implementing the
    principles of the CE (EMF, 2015), as shown in Table 2. Most technologies own opportunities
    in specific areas, while the IoT can play a significant role to make such business
    models viable (Jabbour et al., 2018). Table 2. Explanation of six business models
    in ReSOLVE framework. Business models Explanation Regenerate This business model
    is based on a shift to renewable energy and materials. Biological cycles are used
    to enable the circulation of energy and materials, and to convert organic waste
    into sources of energy and raw material for other chains. Share Assets are shared
    between individuals (peer-to-peer sharing of privately owned products or public
    sharing of a pool of products). As a consequence, products should be designed
    to last longer by the producers, and maintenance should be available to allow
    the re-use and extension of product life. Optimize This business model requires
    organizations to use digital manufacturing technologies, such as IoT, automation,
    and big data to reduce waste in production systems across supply chains. As a
    result, organizations will benefit from increased performance. Loop This business
    model aims to promote the circularity of raw materials and energy. The design,
    production, and supply chain therefore have to be adjusted from the perspective
    of the entire life cycle. Virtualize This business model is service-focused which
    replaces physical with virtual and dematerialized products. Exchange It involves
    substituting old and non-renewable goods for advanced and renewable ones. While
    the exact terminology to describe IoT-related capabilities varies under different
    scenarios, we synthesized core capabilities of the technology as found in literature.
    Ingemarsdotter et al. (2019) suggests that IoT''s can support the development
    of circular business models via capabilities such as tracking, monitoring, control,
    optimization and design evolution, and stated that optimization often relies on
    the use of control capability. Therefore, we incorporated the control capability
    into optimization to reduce the list of relevant IoT capabilities to four, as
    shown in Table 3. Table 3. IoT capabilities that can support implementation of
    the ReSOLVE framework. IoT capabilities Definition of functions Tracking Available
    information for products'' identity, location, or unique composition. Monitoring
    Available information for products'' real-time condition, or environment. This
    includes alerts and notifications. Optimization Goal-based improvements of operations
    are controlled and optimized by using advanced algorithms. Design Evolution The
    design of a product can be upgraded based on data feedback from other lifecycle
    phases. This includes functional or routing upgrades. 2.2.1. Selection of papers
    On the basis of the discussion above, in order to systematically review the contribution
    of the IoT to circular economy business models, we used the following terms as
    a basis for the literature search in a Boolean operation -- Title, Abstract, Keyword
    = [“internet of things” AND (“circular economy” OR “circular business model” OR
    “sustainable supply chain”)]. In total, there were 432 papers available on Scopus
    and 142 papers available on Web of Science (WoS). We excluded duplicate records
    and papers that have no relation to any elements of the 6 R through browsing abstracts.
    Then, we further excluded papers with non-CBM descriptions discerned in the RESOLVE
    framework after browsing the full texts. In this way, 59 papers were retained
    to explore the contribution of the IoT to CBM, see Fig. 2. Download : Download
    high-res image (615KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Flowchart of
    selected publications in the review (status in June 2022). Then, a quantitative
    analysis of how the IoT reduces environmental impacts in CBM was conducted. For
    this, from the included papers we acquired 23 results that a) quantified impacts
    on energy-related indicators in circular economy (e.g., energy use or CO2 emissions)
    and b) compared these impacts before and after using IoT technology. 3. Review:
    impacts of the IoT on CBM 3.1. Descriptive results The retrieved 59 papers used
    for describing the contribution of the IoT to CBM can be categorized by journal,
    year of publication, and sector/application. Fig. 3 shows the number of articles
    published in different journals under the given search term and constraints. The
    number of papers published in the Journal of Cleaner Production, Sustainability
    and Computers in Industry appears to dominate. These journals make up 25.5% of
    the total share, which is much higher than that of other journals. The core fields
    covered by these journals include computer science, engineering and environmental
    science. The number of papers has increased significantly over time. Publications
    in the last 3 years occupy exceed 2/3 of the total share, which indicates a growing
    interest on this topic. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Numbers of IoT publications in different types of journals.
    Next, we use the framework developed by Maroli et al. (2021) to classify 59 papers
    into 4 major categories: reviews, theory studies, new designs and case studies.
    Reviews include pure review articles that classify and summarize previous studies.
    Theory studies generally analyze and discuss the proposed new framework for specific
    issues mainly based on surveying experts (Delphi) or questionnaires. New designs
    imply the development of a new mathematical model or a new protocol design for
    an IoT solution but without a real case to verify factual feasibility. Case studies
    further calculate or simulate the case and obtain reference results based on real
    or defined cases compared with the new design. A brief supplementary description
    of each article is also attached to this table to provide an overview of each
    research division. These classified papers are then categorized into six business
    models suggested by ReSOLVE framework (EMF, 2015). As shown in Fig. 4. Download

    Division of publications into the 6 ReSOLVE categories of CE business models.
    Over 60% of the papers describe the contribution of IoT to Loop and Optimize models.
    Both of these two models have higher potential impacts on manufacturing, transportation
    and storage, and IoT could thus promote significant business transformation within
    these sectors (EMF, 2015). As for Optimize, IoT helps to realize smart manufacturing
    and SSCM through improving decision-making plans to reduce the consumption of
    energy and resources. Most of the theoretical studies here explored and developed
    frameworks for low carbon footprints in different industries based on IoT capabilities
    of collecting, processing information more efficiently (Gružauskas et al., 2018;
    Chit et al., 2021; Ghoreishi and Happonen, 2022; Jagtap et al., 2021). The limited
    number of cases and new designs are usually process optimizations in enterprises,
    where IoT is used to develop intelligent production scheduling and logistics delivery
    models to promote green and sustainable development of intelligent manufacturing
    (Liao and Wang, 2019). In the Loop business model, most studies focused on waste
    management. Here, IoT is mainly used to realize waste collection optimization
    and more accuracy of decision support system for end-life products recycling (Bányai
    et al., 2019; Velvizhi et al., 2020; Al-Masri et al., 2018). Some theoretical
    studies designed CE–IoT-enabled ecosystems based on key enabling IoT technologies
    (Miaoudakis et al., 2020). Others combined it with LCA model to aid their processes
    of designing new products with low environmental impact (Zhang et al., 2020; de
    Oliveira and Soares, 2017). New designs and case studies validated IoT-enabled
    solutions based on products with different technical route characteristics, such
    as plastic waste and scrapped cars (Plakas et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2018), etc.
    Though the proportion of case studies is relatively low, only 11%. The remaining
    four business models account for only a small part of the articles. Among them,
    the sharing model generally relies on online platforms or apps supported by IoT,
    which brings the channel for products or information sharing between different
    stakeholders (Mastos et al., 2020). Virtualize and Exchange models usually demands
    extra technologies such as virtual world tools, digital twin (DT) and 3D printers
    to realize (Gustafson-Pearce and Grant, 2017; Despeisse et al., 2017; Rocca et
    al., 2020). 3.2. Connection of ReSOLVE framework with 6 R and IoT capabilities
    We further classified the papers in a number of matrices, considering the 6 R,
    IoT capabilities and Circular Business Model (CBM) categories discussed in section
    2. This results in a ‘heat map’ of the occurrences of CBM-IoT and CBM-6R cross-sections
    within the sample of 59 papers, see Fig. 5. Many papers describe multiple CBM-IoT
    and CBM-6R cross-sections. It should further be noted that while the categories
    are uniquely defined, they are not mutually exclusive. Below, we explored patterns
    for each of the CBM. 1. Loop business model Download : Download high-res image
    (399KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Heat map of the CBM-6R and
    CBM-IoT cross-section occurrences. The findings show that IoT-enabled ‘Recycle’
    dominates, followed by ‘Remanufacture’ and ‘Repair’. Papers displaying Loop usually
    rely on tracking or monitoring capabilities, while optimization and design evolution
    are relatively unexplored. In terms of recycling, remanufacturing, and repairing,
    the adoption of novel Internet-based transactions can exploit information for
    faster and more sustainable collection of post-consumption products, they can
    be tracked using sensors, RFID tags, and barcodes (Al-Masri et al., 2018). As
    a consequence, organizations are able to remanufacture, or recycle components
    of products and packaging (Vanderroost et al., 2017; Gligoric et al., 2019). In
    line with the Redesign prospect, product designers need to incorporate environmental
    criteria into their design decisions. They can obtain data from an IoT-based product
    life cycle management system to aid their processes of sustainable design and
    development (Zhang et al., 2020; Chit et al., 2021; de Oliveira and Soares, 2017).
    Typical cases are listed in Table 4. 2. Optimize business model Table 4. Illustration
    of the use of IoT capabilities in the Loop model. IoT capabilities Representative
    examples Tracking A research project called POIROT, which exploits IoT technologies,
    aiming to realize a platform for the traceability of organic waste and transform
    it into inert, odorless and sanitized material (De Fazio et al., 2019). Monitoring
    An IoT-enabled decision support system for a CE model that addresses the uncertainty
    of a product''s residual value based on the life cycle monitored from the IoT
    sensors (Mboli et al., 2020). Optimization A system that combines intelligent
    transportation systems (RFIDs, sensors, cameras, actuators and surveillance systems)
    and an advanced decision system (incorporating data sharing between truck drivers
    in real time to perform dynamic route optimization) for efficient waste collection
    (Velvizhi et al., 2020). Most of the papers exploring Optimize models are highly
    related to IoT-enabled ‘Reduce’, which is mainly realized by monitoring and optimization
    capabilities, as shown in Appendix figure A1. Through data monitoring from processes
    and agents such as machines, the IoT increases the possibility of identifying
    potential failures, and predictive maintenance can reduce the waste of non-performing
    products (Venkatesh et al., 2020; Laskurain-Iturbe et al., 2021). Additionally,
    based on the demands of the production and consumption of resources, managers
    could monitor and Optimize production rates and the use of sensors as well as
    algorithms would enable them to automatically intervene in processes to reduce
    intermediate inventory (Ghoreishi and Happonen, 2022; Roy and Roy 2019; Awan et
    al., 2022b). The IoT with the combination of cloud computing and machine learning
    provides potential for complex and integrated data-driven process manufacturing
    models in terms of robustness and accuracy (Fisher et al., 2020). Typical cases
    are listed in Table 5. 3. Share business model Table 5. Illustration of the use
    of IoT capabilities in the Optimize model. IoT capabilities Representative examples
    Tracking RFID technology to tag and track fresh milk could reduce the amount of
    product shrinkage (Bottani et al., 2014). Monitoring Based on IoT sensors, energy
    and cost savings will be achieved as long as the state of the ideal ball mill
    is specifically analyzed and extended to the other ball mills. (Ma et al., 2020).
    Optimization Each node (including suppliers, wholesalers and retailers) could
    be involved in managing and optimizing its own performance in terms of production,
    deliveries and environmental compliance by using RFID tags and wireless sensor
    networks (Hofmann and Rüsch, 2017; Hasanova and Romanovs, 2020). Monitoring and
    tracking are main capabilities of IoT that contribute to sharing business model,
    they help in the product ‘Resign’ and ‘Recycle’ in order to achieve product lifetime
    extension, as shown in Appendix figure A2. Information on consumers'' behavior
    is collected through websites and apps, organizations can therefore both improve
    product design and provide a digital service for better utilization or replacement
    of equipment, and increase customer satisfaction (Rymaszewska et al., 2017; Ingemarsdotter
    et al., 2020). Moreover, the use of sensors in products allows performance monitoring
    - for instance, monitoring maintenance requirements - thereby allowing organizations
    to proactively provide a high quality of service to customers. As a consequence
    of monitoring products during consumer use, organizations can invest in extending
    product life spans by applying the 3Rs strategy (repair, reuse, and recycle).
    Typical cases are listed in Table 6. 4. Virtualize business model Table 6. Illustration
    of the use of IoT capabilities in the Share model. IoT capabilities Representative
    examples Tracking Cranfield University launched a shoe recycling project: it includes
    the design of an intelligent component (IoT) that tracks the condition of the
    shoes and identifies the need for replacement/upgrading. The modular design of
    the shoes allows them to be easily disassembled for refurbishing or recycling
    (Nobre and Tavares, 2017). Monitoring A cross-company IoT communication protocol
    has the potential to offer an automated negotiation ecosystem between scrap metal
    producers and waste collecting companies based on cost, demand etc. (Mastos et
    al., 2020). Optimization IoT helps to achieve a mutual visible inventory under
    business-to-business e-commerce models in real time, where average food inventory,
    amount of food waste, frequency of lateral inventory share and ordering from the
    main depot; customer service level in the network is optimized (Ekren et al.,
    2021). Since service is a core focus of Virtualize, using real-time data to monitor
    supply activities is important to enhance the customer experience. It also triggers
    the potential of IoT-enabled “Redesign” of the product or service with the help
    of design evolution capability. Through virtually designing, simulating, and optimizing
    the system and converting it on the real world, it is possible to achieve system
    reconfigurability through a change of both specific hardware (i.e., change of
    robot tools for disassembly activities), and software resources (i.e., robot program
    coding) (Sassanelli et al., 2021). The IoT enables connections between organizations,
    suppliers, and customers in order to offer services rather than physical products
    (Jabbour et al., 2018). In addition, the IoT is able to collect information on
    consumers’ behavior and features of past designs, which designers can use to improve
    service quality. Typical cases are listed in Table 7. 5. Exchange business model
    Table 7. Illustration of the use of IoT capabilities in the Virtualize model.
    IoT capabilities Representative examples Monitoring Gustafson-Pearce and Grant
    (2017) tested 3D Virtual World tools with multiple sources of ‘streamed’ data
    generated by IoT, to discover whether knowledge sharing and learning within a
    horizontal supply chain was effective and reduced greenhouse gas emissions related
    to business travel. Design evolution A platform that combines hybrid IoT and blockchain
    to provide interactive innovation in prefabricated housing construction among
    shareholders, who were involved in life-cycle value co-design via online channels
    (e.g., mobile apps) (Li et al., 2021). A platform installing IoT devices in a
    smart building to measure energy consumption and provide energy optimization consulting
    services for end-users and building managers (Sharma et al., 2021). IoT could
    provide a scenario of experience shopping from a mirror image, aiming to solve
    the distortion of consumer''s experience in traditional online shopping (Gao and
    Han, 2021). IoT integrates the manufacturing execution system (MES) to the DT
    by using a communication protocol, which is able to give commands to the MES from
    external sources and digitalize the CE practices (Rocca et al., 2020). This model
    could acquire strength by adopting additive manufacturing and IoT systems with
    monitoring capability (Despeisse et al., 2017). 3D printers are able to process
    renewable and sustainable production. Based on interaction between organizations
    and customers, some companies are able to manufacture customized products by using
    databases incorporating 3D printers, where IoT helps to save time and material
    use in additive manufacturing. These kinds of functions make IoT easier to achieve
    CE principles. Typical cases are listed in Table 8. 6. Regenerate business model
    Table 8. Illustration of the use of IoT capabilities in the Exchange model. IoT
    capabilities Representative examples Monitoring The additive manufacturing leads
    to reduced use of material, IoT-enabled 3D printers enable the recycling of small
    quantities of waste (Despeisse et al., 2017). Optimization IoTs are used for the
    identification of engineered disassemblers as well as the real-time status of
    reproducible resources to build efficient multi-target production planning in
    real-time by the seed swarm optimization algorithm (Chau et al., 2021). The model
    could benefit from IoT in the form of sensors and networks. The design, production
    and supply decisions of CE could be adjusted based on data provided by IoT (EMF,
    2016). This would make it possible to reduce unnecessary resource consumption
    to improve the productivity of harvests, and to extend the life cycle of the land
    use. Typical cases are listed in Table 9. Table 9. Illustration of the use of
    IoT capabilities in the Regenerate model. IoT capabilities Representative examples
    Monitoring To monitor, and control factors related to land management between
    crop rotation, to automate irrigation systems based on weather conditions in real
    time, and to manage the use of pesticides according to the health of plantations
    (EMF Report of Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2016). Optimization IoT allows real-time
    measurement of ceramic tile production, providing the capability to modify the
    composition of the ceramic bodies and the transport mix to maximize the use of
    local raw materials, reducing the distances between mines and the factory and
    by favoring rail transport (Garcia-Muiña et al., 2019). In all, the concept of
    6 R is gradually supported by IoT technology. It promotes the combination of 6
    R in different circular business practices (Kirchherr et al., 2017; Spaltini et
    al., 2021), and each business model represents a major circularity opportunity
    enabled by the IoT technology that is quite different from growth in the linear
    economy. Therefore, we selected main contributors of 6 R and CBM from the ‘heat
    map’ results, and then constructed a relationship framework that containing the
    conceptualization of 4 IoT capabilities, 6 R and ReSOLVE framework, as shown in
    Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res image (341KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Relationship framework for IoT enabled 6 R and CBM. As for IoT capabilities,
    the monitoring plays a significant role, which promotes most circular business
    models by jointly facilitating all 6Rs, followed by the optimization capability.
    And for the intermediate nodes of 6 R actions, Recycle and Redesign are the core
    CE principles linking upstream IoT capabilities and downstream circular strategies.
    In different ways, these actions all increase the utilization of physical assets,
    prolong their life, and shift resource use from finite to renewable sources. They
    potentially reinforce and accelerate the performance of the other actions, creating
    a compounding effect. 3.3. Quantitative analysis of how the use of IoT in CBMs
    reduces energy-related environmental impacts Within the collected papers, 20 papers
    provide quantitative data on how the use of IoT in CBMs can reduce environmental
    impacts. These papers provide 23 cases. We included them in our quantitative analysis
    for they mainly use energy savings as the primary measurement. Fig. 7 depicts
    how much energy is saved by using IoT in the six ReSOLVE business model categories
    (Virtualize is missing due to lack of data). The X-axis shows the ReSOLVE business
    model categories and their number of samples in each. The Y-axis represents the
    relative energy savings compared to a baseline scenario without IoT enhancement
    (i.e., the energy use in the baseline is set on 100%). Supplementary Table 2 contains
    a list of cases and their references. 1. Optimize business model Download : Download

    saving under different IoT-enabled CBM (CI = 95%). Most results show quantitative
    data from the Optimize business model (11 results). Here, big data of related
    resource objects is collected using IoT sensors. The resource allocation framework
    is then optimized using heuristic algorithms for specific consumption habits to
    prevent any unwanted negative environmental impact in scheduling issues (Liao
    and Wang, 2019). 2. Loop business model 6 results consider the Loop business model.
    IoT solutions enable the transition to a cyber-physical1 waste management system,
    and provide real-time information on waste generation, treatment, transportation,
    and material handling capacity in big random systems. Carbon emissions from collected
    and transported waste have been significantly reduced due to enhanced recycling
    (Velvizhi et al., 2020). 3. Share business model 4 results discuss the Share business
    model, where IoT lowers energy and resource waste in corporate processes by sharing
    information, products or services (Ekren et al., 2021). For instance, IoT facilitates
    the recording of food expiration dates and facilitates communal food sharing (Phiri
    and Trevorrow, 2019). 4. Regenerate and Exchange business model The Regenerate
    and Exchange models each have a single case. In Regenerate model, IoT is utilized
    for the identification of engineered disassemblers and the real-time status of
    regenerable resources in order to construct effective multi-target production
    planning (Garcia-Muiña et al., 2019). While in Exchange model, IoT assists in
    modifying the composition of the ceramic bodies and the transport mix to maximize
    the utilization of local raw materials (Chau et al., 2021). The effects of relative
    energy savings in the Optimize and Loop business models are evident and comparable,
    with corresponding mean value of 30% and 25%. It may be attributed to the parallels
    of the two models in leveraging IoT capabilities. With the difference that Optimize
    model utilizes more on the optimization capabilities, which may provide it with
    higher energy saving potential. Some measures in the Optimize model could even
    achieve energy savings of up to 70%. But the effect of the Share business model
    is highly variable, ranging from less than 20%–80%, with the majority of results
    falling closer to the lower end. The results of the remaining three models are
    limited. Nevertheless, they present oppotunities for further investigation. 4.
    Environmental drawbacks and other obstacles to the use of IoT in CBMs While reviewing
    the literature, as described above we found many ways of how IoT could support
    the implementation of circular CBMs. However, some of these references also highlighted
    environmental risks of IoT, or other obstacles to implementing and using IoT.
    These findings including related references are discussed below, and Table 10
    summarizes them. Table 10. Environmental drawbacks and other obstacles to the
    implementation of IoT. Type Drawbacks and obstacles Environmental Use of harmful
    substances and non-degradable resources Hardware power consumption IoT node software
    energy consumption IoT protocol energy efficiency Other Lack of standardization
    and technological knowledge among partners Data availability High financial investment
    Security of virtual platform Inadequate internet connectivity 4.1. Environmental
    drawbacks One of the drawbacks of IoT-enabled business models includes the energy
    use of IoT and related carbon emissions, such as IoT hardware, node software and
    protocol energy consumption (Fraga-Lamas et al., 2021). Hardware is the basis
    for the IoT network, and both hardware and software needs to be optimized together
    to re duce environmental burdens. Such optimizations are particularly important
    for certain digital signal processing tasks, including compression, feature extraction,
    or machine learning training. The IoT is also dependent on protocols that enable
    communicating between the various nodes and routing devices involved in an IoT
    network. In terms of software implementation, these protocols must be energy-efficient
    and should minimize the use of communication interfaces. Next to this, IoT equipment
    may result in difficult to process electronic waste. An example consists of RFID
    tags that are hazardous to the environment and are difficult to recycle (Yu et
    al., 2022). Another concern is that IoT enables mass customization. Customization
    makes it more difficult for another user to reuse or recycle an item (Birkel et
    al., 2019). A key observation is that many studies do not take into account such
    environmental drawbacks of implementing IoT technology (i.e., the impact of producing
    or using IoT devices, etc.). Some preliminary analyses have been presented in
    the literature. For instance, Mataloto et al. (2019) discovered that IoT devices
    (LoRa) for energy management systems require an annual energy usage of 5.2 kWh
    if applied in small buildings (16–40 m2). Bottani et al. (2014) assessed the environmental
    performance and burdens of the use of RFID tags in a fresh milk supply chain based
    on life cycle assessment (LCA) and found that the environmental costs of 1 million
    RFID tags are 32,900 kg CO2-eq in climate change potential, 23.9 kg P-eq in freshwater
    eutrophication, and 156 molc H + -eq in acidification potential. Comparatively
    to the existing studies, there is a dearth of papers that examine the positive
    and negative contributions of IoT to CBM via case studies or simulations. This
    involves not only a full examination of its production, transportation, disposal,
    and reuse synergies, but also an evaluation of the LCA of IoT components. 4.2.
    Other obstacles Next to environmental drawbacks the literature we reviewed gave
    some more general implementation obstacles with regard to the use of IoT in CBMs.
    Firstly, there is often a lack of structured data management processes to ensure
    the acquisition of high-quality data for industrial analysis (Ingemarsdotter et
    al., 2020). Due to the limited availability and variety of industrial data, evaluating
    and validating representative models of real-world systems can be difficult, i.e.,
    determining when sufficient data has been acquired to ensure the representativeness
    of a simulation framework. (Fisher et al., 2020). Secondly, the absence of standardization
    and guidance in implementing IoT across various businesses poses a concern. There
    can be a lack of regulations addressing data ownership among stakeholders (Astill
    et al., 2019). The wide implementation of CE strategies is contingent upon solving
    such data ownership issues. Thirdly, ensuring privacy and data security poses
    a challenge (Roy and Roy, 2019). End-users as intermediate nodes in the manufacturing
    and remanufacturing cycle and vulnerable firewall nodes can be susceptible to
    botnet assaults (Tuptuk and Hailes, 2018). One typical case is the IoT botnet
    Mirai, a malware that could target consumer electronics and home routers, turning
    them into a zombie remotely controlled bots that can be used in large-scale network
    attacks (Antonakakis et al., 2017). Such challenges may be solved by IoT projects
    funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research program, it includes the
    European Cloud Initiative, the GAIA-X initiative, as well as public-private partnerships
    such as the Smart Networks and Services JU and the AI, Big Data and Robotics (Calisti,
    2020). These projects are expected to use distributed AI, address security, privacy
    and trust requirements by design and allow for new de-centralized topologies and
    governance. In addition, it is challenging to rapidly design IoT-enabled products
    for interoperability, adaptability, and upgradability (Ingemarsdotter et al.,
    2020). Currently, potential solutions tend to point at blockchain technology.
    However, integrating blockchain within the IoT framework will also pose technical,
    infrastructure, energy consumption, interoperability and social regulatory issues
    (Feng et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Venkatesh et al., 2020). The last impediment
    are the limited resources small-scale enterprises can invest systematically in
    IoT technologies throughout their entire supply chains (Tan et al., 2020). 5.
    Conclusion and outlook This review has assessed the state-of-the-art relation
    of IoT and CBM from several perspectives. Based on the Prisma approach, this article
    reviews the literature on the IoT and CBMs that has been expanding significantly
    in recent years. Through the classification of their methods and contents, this
    paper constructed a mapping framework connecting the ReSOLVE concept with four
    IoT capabilities and the 6 R framework. It depicts the current research status
    of IoT supported CBMs and explains their contribution for enterprises from the
    perspective of 6 R with representative cases. IoT by its support of joint interoperability
    for system optimization, timely monitoring and tracking, has contributed to the
    enhancement of industrial efficiency, recycling, and the reduction of unnecessary
    material and energy use. These characteristics of IoT support the implementation
    and success of CBMs, particularly the Loop and Optimize CBMs. These conclusions
    are similar to those of previously published studies. However, the dynamic feedback
    potential of the IoT also proves to be vital for the “Redesign” of product or
    service concepts, especially for Virtualize, Share and Exchange models which have
    not been fully explored before. Therefore, we revealed potential directions based
    on these preliminary studies: For instance, in the Share approach, IoT helps to
    provide a sharing platform that enables consumers to share products, essentially
    providing the same amount of final services with a smaller product pool. The IoT
    also provides virtual and dematerialized options as service solutions rather than
    physical products with similar functions to achieve design evolution capability,
    supporting the “Redesign” CE strategy through the combination of other I4.0 technologies
    such as DT. The review of quantitative assessments suggests that IoT has the potential
    to reduce the energy consumption of the Optimize and Loop business model by about
    20–30%. By redesigning and integrating IoT and IoT-based algorithms into business
    operations, the energy efficiency of the system can be greatly increased. In addition,
    IoT can help to minimize waste generation and enhance efficiency of resource use.
    However, the widespread usage of IoT and related data processing activities in
    itself can lead to higher energy use and generation of e-waste, which often is
    difficult to recycle. IoT also poses a number of obstacles for its cross-business
    applications, including the difficulties of establishing universal standards for
    data processing, cybersecurity liability issues, and relatively high investment
    costs. These assessments of strengths and challenges of IoT can provide more intuitive
    information for SMEs investors who are interested in innovative technologies and
    circular development. 6. Limitations and recommendations This research has limitations
    as well. Firstly, given the fact that the research on the interaction between
    the IoT and CE is still in its infancy, most of the references discuss conceptual
    frameworks, models and theoretical evaluations, and just a few case studies. Most
    case studies only explore one or a few technical applications of IoT, these limits
    the value of meta-analyses as attempted in this paper. Particularly for the Virtualize,
    Exchange and Regenerate CBMs the number of available cases was low. We hence recommend
    a more systematic, quantitative analysis of case studies on how IoT can contribute
    to CBMs and environmental improvements. Secondly, the literature gives just limited
    information on the environmental drawbacks of IoT. Some studies on e.g., RFID
    suggest that their production and use generate just limited environmental damage
    (Jia et al., 2012). However, to analyze the environmental benefits and drawbacks
    of IoT comprehensively, further research is needed that should consider specific
    IoT application scenarios, material choices and future improvement potentials
    that may be available due to scale and learning effects. These could become the
    focal points of the future phase of IoT research. Declaration of competing interest

    in agro-industry and environment during 2006–2016. • Clustering of IoT applications
    into four domains: monitoring, control, prediction, and logistics. • Visualization
    of key technologies used to develop the IoT applications. • Discussion of trends
    and open challenges. • Proposal of an IoT architecture for agro-industrial and
    environmental applications based on the research findings. Abstract This paper
    reviews agro-industrial and environmental applications that are using Internet
    of Things (IoT). It is motivated by the need to identify application areas, trends,
    architectures and open challenges in these two fields. The underlying survey was
    developed following a systematic literature review using academic documents written
    in English and published in peer-reviewed venues from 2006 to 2016. Selected references
    were clustered into four application domains corresponding to: monitoring, control,
    logistics, and prediction. Implementation-specific details from each selected
    reference were compiled to create usage distributions of sensors, actuators, power
    sources, edge computing modules, communication technologies, storage solutions,
    and visualization strategies. Finally, the results from the review were compiled
    into an IoT architecture that represents a wide range of current solutions in
    agro-industrial and environmental fields. Previous article in issue Next article

    literature review 1. Introduction The widespread of Internet in the last two decades
    brought countless benefits to citizens and organizations around the world. Arguably
    the most important benefit was the ability to consume and produce data and services
    in real time. Recently, the Internet of Things is promising to bring the same
    benefits to everyday objects, giving us a way to extend our perception and our
    ability to modify the environment around us. In this context, agro-industrial
    and environmental fields are ideal candidates for the deployment of IoT solutions
    because they occur in wide areas that need to be continuously monitored and controlled.
    At the same time, IoT opens new opportunities beyond ground floor automation when
    the collected data are used to feed machine learning algorithms to provide predictions
    (Saville et al., 2015), easing decision planning and decision making for owners,
    managers, and policy makers. IoT can be used at different levels in the agro-industrial
    production chain (Medela et al., 2013). It can help to evaluate field variables
    such as soil state, atmospheric conditions, and biomass of plants or animals.
    It can also be used to assess and control variables such as temperature, humidity,
    vibration, and shock during the product transport (Pang et al., 2015). It can
    be used to monitor and predict the product state and its demand on shelves or
    inside refrigerators. In addition, it can provide information to the final user/consumer
    about the origin and properties of the product. The IoT applied to the agro-industry
    can contribute to create an informed, connected, developed and adaptable rural
    community. Under the IoT paradigm, low-cost electronic devices can improve human
    interaction with the physical world, and the computing power and software available
    on the Internet can provide valuable analytics. In summary, IoT can be an important
    tool in the years to come for people interacting within an agro-industrial system:
    suppliers, farmers, technicians, distributors, business men, consumers, and government
    representatives. IoT can be incorporated into environmental applications to produce
    dense and real-time maps of air and water pollution, noise level (Torres-Ruiz
    et al., 2016, Hachem et al., 2015), temperature, and harmful radiation among others.
    It can be used to collect and store environmental records, check the compliance
    of environmental variables with local policies, trigger alerts, or send recommendation
    messages to citizens and authorities (Liu et al., 2013). Once the data reach the
    cloud, governments can feed predictive models to forecast environmental variables,
    and identify and track pollution sources over time and space, ultimately leading
    to faster and better decisions to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all
    citizens. Based on the potential of IoT applications in agro-industrial and environmental
    fields described in the previous paragraphs, this paper aims to identify the current
    state of solutions in these fields, as well as the trends, architectures, technologies
    and open challenges. This paper uses a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) based
    on a methodology proposed by Kitchenham and Charters (2007), in order to make
    it unbiased in terms of information selection, processing, and presentation of
    results. The paper is structured as follows. Sections 2 Planning, 3 Conduction,
    4 Results describe the stages of planning, conduction, and results of the SLR.
    Section 5 outlines some recent works that were published online after the SLR
    was concluded. Section 6 includes a discussion of the obtained results, and Section
    7 presents the conclusions from this study. 2. Planning During this stage of the
    SLR, the protocol was defined. This included: research questions, search strategies,
    selection criteria, data mining and synthesis methodologies. For this study, the
    two research questions considered were: 1. What are the main technological solutions
    of the Internet of Things in agro-industrial and environmental fields? 2. Which
    infrastructure and technology are using the main solutions of IoT in agro-industrial
    and environmental fields? To collect information, authors performed an Internet
    search using various academic digital libraries and search engines. Obtained results
    were manually compiled in order to select the best information sources to answer
    the two research questions. After analyzing the results, digital libraries and
    search engines described in Table 1 were chosen based on their scientific and
    technical content, as well as their close relationship to areas of knowledge associated
    with the objective of this paper. Table 1. Information sources used for the search

    Search Engine https://scholar.google.com/ The next step was to define search terms
    and a consistent procedure to seek scientific and technical documentation in the
    digital libraries and search engines. To define the search terms, a set of keywords
    was selected from the research questions to create two groups of words which are
    shown in Table 2. Each group contained consolidated expressions with synonyms
    or terms with related meaning. Group 1 included words associated with the Internet
    of Things, while Group 2 contained a set of terms related to the agro-industry
    and environment. Logical operators supported by the advanced search of digital
    libraries were used to construct search strings, based on the two research questions,
    combining terms from Groups 1 and 2 of Table 2. The general structure of the search
    queries that were applied to the information sources is presented in Table 3.

    order to ensure the quality of papers, only those that passed the following criteria
    were considered in the reviewing process. • Documents published in peer-reviewed
    conferences, peer-reviewed journals, papers from computer science or engineering
    organizations, patents, or technical reports. • Documents published in English.
    • Documents published between 2006 and 2016 (both years inclusive). If the main
    topic of a given paper was irrelevant or if it was outside the scope of this study,
    it was deleted. Then, a selection criterion was applied in order to reduce the
    number of papers found during the search and to get a small number of high-quality
    sources that could be used to answer the research questions. This involved using
    inclusion criteria (IC) and quality criteria (QC), which were defined in a three-phase
    process. • IC based on abstracts: in this phase, authors discarded papers found
    in the search stage based on the information provided in their abstracts. Papers
    that satisfied the first inclusion criterion were kept for further processing,
    i.e. papers that discussed IoT solutions applied to agro-industry and environment.
    Papers with little relevant information in their abstract were temporarily kept
    in the list and were processed in the next stage. It is important to highlight
    that quality criteria were not considered in this phase. • IC based on full reading:
    in this phase, papers that did not address the search terms shown in Table 2 were
    removed. This means that even though those papers contained the search terms in
    their abstract, they only represented minor aspects of them. • IC based on quality
    analysis: in this phase, a quality analysis was applied to remaining papers and
    those that did not comply any of the following four quality criteria (QC) were
    discarded: – QC1: Does the study present a comprehensive solution of IoT for agro-industry
    or environment? – QC2: Does the paper show details of the infrastructure and/or
    technologies used to implement the proposed solution? – QC3: Does the paper present
    a state of the art or related work? – QC4: Does the paper present an analysis
    of the results? The next stage of the SLR was data mining and synthesis. The goal
    here was to extract the information needed to answer the research questions in
    an objective manner. The information fields extracted for each study are presented
    in Table 4. Table 4. Form used to extract data for each study. Data retrieved

    in the previous section was used to search, select and evaluate preliminary papers.
    For the search process, the query defined in Table 3 was passed to information
    sources given in Table 1. The search was limited to title, abstract and keywords.
    Fig. 1 illustrates the conduction process discriminated by the academic database
    and search engine used, highlighting the key steps followed to select relevant
    studies for this review. Initially, 3578 studies were recovered from electronic
    databases. Firstly, duplicates were excluded, i.e. studies available in more than
    one database, eliminating 849 copies. Out of the 2729 remaining studies, 2652
    were initially screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria applied to the
    title, abstract, and keywords. These papers were marked to be downloaded, and
    references that could not be retrieved were discarded. Afterward, these studies
    were evaluated using quality criteria obtaining 720 studies. These studies were
    used to extract the data defined in Table 4. Finally, only 72 main studies were
    selected based on their quality for the final conduction phase and used to extract
    results presented in the next section. Download : Download high-res image (236KB)

    main studies. It is worth to note that more than 90% of included papers were retrieved
    from two sources: IEEExplore (76.4%) and Scopus (13.9%). In contrast, the least
    effective sources of information were Microsoft Academic Search and Microsoft
    Academic. They retrieved 668 papers during the first stage of the conduction phase
    (representing 25.2% of all retrieved papers, and only behind IEEExplore with 45%).
    However, only 3.1% of them were included for the next reviewing phase, a number
    well below the 39.8% of papers included from IEEExplore. These facts can be explained
    because IEEExplore and Scopus have complete and usable advanced search systems
    and they have been operating continuously unlike Microsoft’s counterpart (Sinha
    et al., 2015a). Fig. 2 enumerates the number of primary studies classified by
    publication year. It can be seen that most of the selected papers were published
    between 2012 and 2016. It should be highlighted that the small number of papers
    shown in 2016 can be explained because the initial search was made in April of
    that year. Download : Download high-res image (127KB) Download : Download full-size

    results of the SLR in order to answer the two research questions based on the
    information extracted from main studies selected. 4.1. Answer to the first research
    question To identify the main technological solutions of IoT in agro-industry
    and environmental fields, studies were grouped into four technological domains,
    corresponding to: (1) monitoring, (2) control, (3) prediction and (4) logistics.
    Results are summarized in Table 5 and illustrated in Fig. 4. From this figure,
    it can be seen that most of the selected studies were focused on monitoring (62%),
    followed by control (25%), logistics (7%), and prediction (6%). Table 5. Clustering

    image Fig. 4. Distribution of papers selected by application domain. Selected
    papers grouped in the monitoring domain dealt with remote sensing of physical
    and environmental parameters gathered in scenarios such as crops and farms using
    a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The main goal of this domain was the acquisition
    of information without an operator and its transmission to a server or data center
    for processing and visualization. Integrated monitoring tools made it possible
    to maintain a continuous communication with the deployed WSN, and access stored
    data through the Internet. Hence, smart agriculture based on IoT adds value to
    farmers by helping them to collect relevant data from crops and farms using sensor
    devices. Some IoT setups could display, process and analyze remote data applying
    cloud services in order to provide new insights and recommendations for better
    decision-making. IoT solutions categorized in monitoring domain can be divided
    into three architectural layers (Zou, 2014): (i) a perception layer supported
    by a WSN; (ii) a network layer where the sensor information travels a long distance
    using different protocols and Gateways, and (iii) an application layer that includes
    a web server and a database. Moreover, IoT solutions grouped in this domain are
    interested in monitoring several types of physical variables depending on the
    subdomain to which they belong. Specifically, the following subdomains were identified:
    air monitoring (34.5%), soil monitoring (27.3%), water monitoring (16.4%), plant
    monitoring (10.9%), and others (10.9%) which include areas such as aquaculture
    and animal monitoring. It is worth to highlight that most of the selected studies
    retrieved in this SLR can be categorized in more than one subdomain. For instance,
    the system proposed in Zou (2014) is used for online crop growth monitoring and
    it captures different types of variables such as: temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, CO2, luminosity, pH of water, and images. Some representative examples
    of IoT applications categorized in the monitoring domain are described below.
    • Air monitoring: this subdomain aimed to provide periodic or continuous measurements,
    evaluating and determining environmental parameters or pollution levels in order
    to prevent negative and damaging effects. It also included the forecasting of
    possible changes in the ecosystem or the biosphere as a whole. For instance, in
    Watthanawisuth et al. (2009) authors described an agricultural IoT solution which
    can be categorized in the air monitoring subdomain. In this solution, authors
    proposed a real-time monitoring system of micro climate based on a WSN. The solution
    included temperature and relative humidity sensors (SHT15) powered by solar panels
    and supported by ZigBee communication technology. Another air monitoring IoT solution
    is GEMS (Lu et al., 2010), which proposed an environmental monitoring system based
    on GPRS technology for monitoring apple orchards. This system was tested on five
    different regions of China over a 2-year period by monitoring variables such as
    relative humidity, temperature, and radiation. • Soil monitoring: papers classified
    in this subdomain such as (Chen et al., 2014, Mafuta et al., 2012) proposed systems
    for monitoring multi-layer soil temperature and moisture in a farmland fields
    using WSN. These systems are supported by communication technologies such as ZigBee,
    GPRS and Internet, where user interaction with the system is handled by a web
    application. • Water monitoring: primary studies categorized in this subdomain
    intend to monitor water pollution or water quality by sensing chemicals, pH, and
    temperature, which can alter the natural state of water. An example of this subdomain
    is presented in Postolache et al. (2013), where authors proposed an IoT solution
    for water quality assessment through the measurement of conductivity, temperature,
    and turbidity. The solution is based on a WSN architecture that combines low-cost
    sensing devices and monitoring of multiple parameters of water quality of shallow
    waters (lakes, estuaries, rivers) in urban areas. Similarly, (Xijun et al., 2009)
    proposed a WSN system for monitoring water level and rainfall in irrigation systems.
    • Plant monitoring: The LOFAR-agro Project (Langendoen et al., 2006) is an example
    of plant or crop monitoring. This project aimed to protect a potato crop against
    phytophthora (a genus of water mold) by monitoring the microclimate (humidity
    and temperature) using a large-scale WSN. The system intended to generate a policy
    to protect the crop against the fungal disease based on the collected data. In
    Fourati et al. (2014), authors propose a Web-based decision support system communicating
    with a WSN for irrigation scheduling in olive fields. For this purpose, authors
    use sensors to measure humidity, solar radiation, temperature, and rain. • Animal
    monitoring: This subdomain referred to animal tracking for both wildlife and animal
    husbandry activities. A research belonging to this subdomain was a delay-tolerant
    WSN for the monitoring and tracking of six horses presented in Ehsan et al. (2012).
    For this purpose, authors developed necklaces that acquired information about
    horses’ position and speed at a given time, and transmitted such logs to fixed
    nodes when they were close to its coverage area. Another example of animal monitoring
    was given by Jain et al. (2008), where an IoT solution was responsible for monitoring
    the behavior and migration patterns of Swamp Deers, obtaining information of the
    animal position and the climate at the same time. Papers selected and grouped
    under the domain of control use remote actuator devices deployed on-site. Unlike
    monitoring domain applications, which handle information in one-way, applications
    categorized in control use a two-way information channel. This means that a new
    level of communication was added, and commands could be sent back to the field.
    In this case, information from the server or data center traveled to a Wireless
    Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN) in order to control a set of actuator devices
    to modify the state of the process or environment. Commands were sent through
    a human–computer interface or as a result of a decision algorithm supported by
    analytic modules. Actuator devices included valves, pumps, humidifiers, and alarms
    among others. Many of these systems aimed to optimize the usage of water, fertilizers,
    and pesticides based on information provided by weather prediction systems and
    on-site WSN. Solutions in this domain could help farmers to reduce water consumption
    and waste by scheduling irrigation times and quantities according to the state
    of the crop and its growth cycle. Control systems were programmed to be adaptive,
    for instance, switching off sprinkler if rain was detected. Overall, solutions
    with control systems could save money to the farmer and provide at the same time
    valuable insights about the consumption of water, fertilizers, pesticides, and
    electricity. Actuator devices used by IoT solutions grouped in the control domain
    depended heavily on the subdomain to which they belonged. In this paper, the following
    subdomains were considered: irrigation (72.22%), fertilizers (5.56%), pesticides
    (5.56%), illumination (5.56%), and access control (5.56%). During the review,
    it was found that some studies used actuators in the domain of logistics (5.56%).
    Representative examples of IoT applications categorized in the control domain
    are described next. • Irrigation control: A precision irrigation solution based
    on wireless sensor network was proposed by Kanoun et al. (2014). The main challenge
    of that study was to create an automated irrigation system which could reduce
    water waste, saving energy, time, and money. This system was built using three
    nodes based on the TelosB mote: (i) a node to measure soil moisture and soil temperature;
    (ii) a node to measure environmental parameters such as air temperature, air humidity,
    wind speed and brightness; and (iii) a node that was connected to a valve for
    irrigation control. Data were transmitted to a base station for storage and were
    sent to the farmer’s PC to allow him to take action. Another precision irrigation
    IoT system was proposed by Jiao et al. (2014). This included an environmental
    monitoring system for agricultural management, as well as the implementation of
    precision dripping. The system considered an IoT ecosystem divided into three
    layers corresponding to sensing, transmission, and application. A WSN was used
    to perceive environmental information in real time within a tomato greenhouse,
    to later transmit the data to a remote server management system. In Shuwen and
    Changli (2015) researchers described a remote farmland irrigation monitoring solution
    based on ZigBee. The system included a solar-powered irrigation control system
    that also monitored air temperature, humidity and soil temperature. • Fertilizer
    and pesticide control: IoT solutions categorized in this subdomain applied conservation
    practices to improve nutrient usage, efficiency, crop quality, overall yield,
    and economic return while reducing off-site transport of nutrients. In Pahuja
    et al. (2013), authors developed an online micro-climate monitoring and control
    system for greenhouses. The system was supported by a WSN to gather and analyze
    plant-related sensor data to produce actions to control the climate, fertilization,
    irrigation, and pests. • Illumination control: authors in Yoo et al. (2007) described
    an automated agriculture system based on WSN for monitoring greenhouses used to
    grow melons and cabbages. The system monitored the growing process of crops and
    controlled the greenhouse’s environment. Some of the variables measured included
    ambient light, temperature, and humidity. For the greenhouse with melons, the
    system could control the illumination by changing the light state through a relay.
    • Access control: An agricultural intrusion detection system was presented in
    Roy et al. (2015). The proposed system generated alarms in the farmers house and
    sent a text message to the farmer’s mobile phone when an intruder entered the
    crop field. Selected papers categorized in the prediction domain were focused
    on providing knowledge and tools to farmers to support decision making. They had
    specific modules for these tasks in their architecture, and their predicted variables
    were grouped as follows: environmental conditions (42.86%), production estimation
    (42.86%), and crop growth (14.29%). • Environmental conditions: A representative
    example of environmental condition prediction is proposed in Khandani and Kalantari
    (2009), where authors described a design methodology to determine the spatial
    sampling of humidity sensors for the soil within a WSN. They used a historical
    database of dense soil-humidity measurements to determine the behavior of the
    2D correlation that exists between the measurements of nearby sensors. This was
    used later to find the largest spatial sampling that ensured a user-defined variance
    for the estimation on any given point of interest in the space. Authors found
    that the spatial correlation function decays exponentially with the distance between
    sensors. Another example of the prediction of environmental conditions was presented
    in Luan et al. (2015), which described a system that integrates drought monitoring
    and forecasting as well as irrigation prediction using IoT. • Production estimation:
    Authors in Lee et al. (2013) presented an IoT-based agricultural production system
    for stabilizing supply and demand of agricultural products. They achieved this
    goal by sensing environmental variables and by developing a prediction system
    for the growth and yield of crops. In a different application, (Saville et al.,
    2015) introduced a real-time estimation system for fixed-net fishery using ultrasonic
    sensors and supervised learning. • Crop growth: a dynamic analysis of farmlands
    using mobile sensors was presented in Lee et al. (2012). The developed system
    aimed to establish growth-control plans for grapes, and viticulture activities.
    The last domain used to categorize selected studies was logistics. Logistics in
    agriculture refers to the physical flow of entities and related information from
    producer to consumer to satisfy consumer demand. It includes: agricultural production,
    acquisition, transportation, storage, loading and unloading, handling, packaging,
    distribution, and related activities. Some objectives of logistics in agriculture
    include: adding value to agricultural products, saving money in distribution costs,
    improving shipping efficiency, reducing unnecessary losses, and to some extent,
    avoiding risks (Liping, 2012). Primary studies in logistics were further divided
    in: production (55.6%), commerce (22.2%) and transport(22.2%). The next paragraphs
    include representative studies of each subdomain. • Production: in Feng et al.
    (2012) researchers proposed an intelligent system for monitoring an apple orchard
    that implemented suggestions based on data. The system aimed to reduce management
    costs of apple orchards, improve apple quality, and provide detailed, comprehensive
    and accurate electronic information for planting works, pest warnings, and production-quality
    tracking of apples. The system included WSN using Zigbee, GPRS, and IoT providing
    detailed monitoring data of apple growth for agricultural cooperatives, to support
    for decision making in farming. • Commerce: (Li et al., 2013) presented an information
    system for agriculture based on IoT which used a distributed architecture. In
    that study, tracking and tracing of the whole agricultural production process
    were made with distributed IoT servers. Moreover, an information-discovery system
    was designed to implement, capture, standardize, manage, locate, and query business
    data from agricultural production. The system also allowed consumers to query
    information of agricultural products to verify their authenticity and quality.
    • Transport: A representative example of this subdomain is presented in Pang et
    al. (2015), where an IoT architecture was proposed for the food-production and
    commercialization chain. This paper dealt with logistics involved in the transportation
    of melons from Brazil to Sweden in a journey that takes 46 days. Sensor nodes
    measured conditions in the environment including oxygen, carbon dioxide, ethylene,
    temperature, humidity, and mechanical stress, such as vibrations, tilts, and shocks.

    selected by application subdomain. 4.2. Answer to the second research question
    Infrastructure and technology used by selected IoT solutions in agro-industrial
    and environmental fields were organized in seven groups, corresponding to: (i)
    sensing variables, (ii) actuator devices, (iii) power sources, (iv) communication
    technologies, (v) edge computing technologies (Shi et al., 2016), (vi) storage
    strategies, and (vii) visualization strategies. • Sensing variables: about 26%
    of analyzed studies sense temperature, followed by humidity, physicochemical properties,
    and radiation with 16%, 11%, and 10%, respectively. Particularly, temperature
    and physicochemical sensors are distributed in all subdomains as it can be seen
    in Fig. 6. Similarly, 55% of sensors are used for air monitoring. Thus, air temperature
    and humidity, soil moisture and solar radiation, can be considered universal variables
    in agricultural applications. Download : Download high-res image (324KB) Download

    studies is shown in Fig. 7. It can be stated that there are far fewer actuator
    devices than sensors currently being used in these studies and that most of them
    are concentrated in applications of control and logistics. In fact, more than
    60% of actuators reported were found in irrigation processes. Download : Download

    device used. • Power sources: currently, most monitoring applications prefer rechargeable
    batteries connected to solar panels, which offer a simple but sustainable energy
    supply. In contrast, control applications that typically have demanding energy
    requirements prefer the electrical grid. These trends can be appreciated in Fig.
    8. Recent power sources, such as electromagnetic or vibration harvesters were
    not found in selected studies showing that these approaches must mature and gain
    popularity for agricultural and environmental applications. Download : Download

    • Communication technologies: Fig. 9 shows that most studies (40%) used Wireless
    Personal Area Network (WPAN) protocols such as Bluetooth and ZigBee, followed
    by Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN) with 36% of the studies mainly supported
    by cellular technologies (GPRS/GSM/3G/4G). Meanwhile, the near-field communication,
    which is relatively new, has started to emerge in some field applications. Download

    technologies. • Edge computing technologies: microcontroller platforms were chosen
    in more than half of the applications reviewed. Interestingly, Single Board Computers
    (SBC) are not yet appropriate for edge computing in IoT agricultural applications.
    The complete distribution of edge computing technologies is shown in Fig. 10.

    it is clear that even though Cloud storage represents a key service for IoT systems,
    only 7.32% of selected studies used it. This shows that most researchers preferred
    their own data-storage implementation. Download : Download high-res image (78KB)

    strategies: Fig. 12 shows the distribution of three different visualization strategies:
    web, mobile and local, in four subdomains: monitoring, control, prediction, and
    logistics. It can be stated that web-based solutions were the preferred strategy
    to visualize reports in all subdomains of applications. Download : Download high-res

    Most of the selected works do not address security issues explicitly and leave
    them on a side. However, some efforts in this domain were found. For instance,
    (Jardak et al., 2009) described the design of a WSN that implemented a RANdom
    SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) filter to eliminate inconsistent sensor-node data due
    to the presence of faulty or malicious nodes in the network. Sun et al. (2012)
    presented a dam monitoring system where users needed to sign in through the main
    interface in order to validate their credentials. Tao et al. (2014) selected AppWeb
    as the embedded Web server for the IoT Gateway of an intelligent granary management
    system because it could add the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to enable
    encrypted data connection. This was valuable because the network information was
    vulnerable as it came from a wireless channel. Kuroda et al. (2015) proposed a
    WSN with easy-to-use secure communication that was implemented using Zero-admin
    encrypt/decrypt functions at the MAC level with the Advanced Encryption Standard
    (AES-128), which enabled automatic encryption/decryption of messages between each
    sensor node and the coordinator node. 5. Recent works The following paragraphs
    are devoted to introducing some recent and representative works that were available
    online between May 2016 and July 2017, beyond the initial scope of the SLR process
    described so far. They cover areas such as communications, energy management,
    monitoring and logistics for agro-industrial and environmental applications. 5.1.
    Communications Low-power WAN (LPWAN) technologies such as SigFox, LoRa, narrowband
    IoT and others are becoming popular within IoT applications due to its reduced
    energy requirements, wide coverage range, and low-cost when compared to other
    long-distance technologies according to Barrachina-Muñoz et al. (2017). For example,
    in a recent survey by Sinha et al. (2017), authors found that LoRa is the best
    option for smart agriculture applications. In Lukas et al. (2015), authors designed
    a long-range water level monitoring system for troughs using a WSN based on LoRa
    transceivers, allowing the cattleman to observe water availability for livestock
    even when the barn was 1 or 3 km away. In a different application, (Pham et al.,
    2016) proposed an IoT framework to contribute to rural development implementing
    agricultural applications supported by open-source hardware and long-range communication
    devices. The first deployment of this solution used LoRa transceivers since rural
    villages were located in remote areas and it was convenient to have a low-cost
    and non-proprietary infrastructure. 5.2. Energy management One of the main requirements
    for devices used in IoT projects is that they must be energy-efficient according
    to Borgia (2014). This is particularly important for pervasive solutions deployed
    outdoors that can not be powered from the electric grid nor regularly maintained
    because they are installed in difficult or remote environments. In WSN scenarios,
    the current challenge is to develop multi-source energy harvesters and ultra-efficient
    sensors to create battery-free solutions, (Shaikh and Zeadally, 2016). These considerations
    are very important for IoT solutions for agro-industrial and environmental problems
    as recharging batteries is not practical and ambient energy sources are usually
    available. In terms of smart energy control for IoT projects, (Wang et al., 2016)
    proposed a novel energy management strategy for solar powered devices that intend
    to power the load directly from the solar cell, avoiding power converters and
    energy storage elements that contribute to energy losses, greater weight/volume
    ratio, and higher price. Another trend that is likely to continue is the development
    of self-power devices, such as the soil water content sensor for an autonomous
    landslide surveillance system designed by Lu et al. (2016). In this case, the
    sensor used the soil moisture to power itself making it suitable for large scale
    deployments. Marjanović et al. (2016) described a cloud-based decision-making
    mechanism for managing sensor data acquisition that is applicable to collaborative
    sensing solutions using distributed sensors, like mobile devices, to efficiently
    monitor large geographical areas. The system selected which sensors had to upload
    the information to the cloud to prevent the acquisition of redundant information
    from other nearby sensors for a specific coverage area, maintaining a spatial
    sampling quality and reducing in this way the battery depletion of the devices.
    5.3. Monitoring Recent environmental monitoring solutions are now offering additional
    capabilities in terms of decision making and management. For example, (Giorgetti
    et al., 2016) proposed a custom-made landslide risk monitoring system based on
    a WSN that allows fast deployments in hostile environments without human intervention
    because the system is able to deal with node failure and poor-quality communication
    links reorganizing the network by itself. Wong and Kerkez (2016) presented a Web
    service and real-time data architecture that includes an adaptive controller that
    updates the parameters of each sensing node within a WSN based on a previously
    defined policy. Zheng et al. (2016) proposed an IoT management system to protect
    the ecological and environmental quality while building an artificial river where
    nature and city converge. The system monitored key elements like soil, water,
    atmosphere, and wind at a high spatial resolution over a large area. Edwards-Murphy
    et al. (2016) introduced a beehive monitoring system that collects internal and
    external data to describe the status of the bee colony from a set of possible
    states using a classification algorithm based on decision trees. This information
    was used to determine if a visit to the beehive was required or not. As an additional
    result, authors found a strong correlation between the beehive status and the
    short-term rain forecast. Overall, this study is relevant for agriculture because
    crop pollination depends on honey bees. Sarangi et al. (2016) presented a framework
    for an automated crop-disease advisory service that integrates the interoperability
    of an IoT web repository with an agricultural advisory call center. The implemented
    system processes images of the diseased plant sent by the farmer, and then it
    provides the plant diagnosis and the corresponding management recommendation for
    the disease. 5.4. Logistics Food safety and quality control in logistics are emerging
    as IoT agribusiness areas in response to the demand from businesses and end consumers
    to obtain real-time information about food supply chain and “farm-to-fork” traceability.
    For instance, (Ruan and Shi, 2016) presented an IoT framework to assess the fruit
    freshness on e-commerce deliveries, which is a non-traditional retail service
    that faces unique challenges in transportation due to the product perishability
    and expensive logistics. Similarly, (Liu et al., 2016) introduced a pilot project
    using IoT to monitor food safety throughout the product life cycle, helping authorities
    and consumers to trace the food and make better decisions before buying it. In
    a related work, (Wang and Yue, 2017) proposed an early-warning system for food
    safety that automatically warns about product quality risks and incidents by sharing
    and centralizing information among supply chains. Lastly, (Capello et al., 2016)
    developed a business-to-business monitoring service based on IoT that provides
    geo-located information (humidity and temperature) about food storage and transportation
    without a vendor lock-in infrastructure. 6. Discussion 6.1. Limitations and open
    challenges After analyzing the difficulties and limitations described in selected
    papers from the SLR, the following list summarizes a few insights that aim to
    contribute to the mass adoption of IoT solutions in agricultural and environmental
    fields. • Stronger standardization: it will help to improve compatibility among
    different vendors and to ensure stronger security measures across the entire IoT
    stack, starting from field devices all the way up to cloud providers and end-user
    interfaces (Pang et al., 2015). • Better power management: it will increase the
    endurance of IoT solutions because nowadays the main factor limiting the lifespan
    of IoT deployments is energy depletion (Jain et al., 2008, Chen et al., 2014,
    Islam et al., 2014, Diedrichs et al., 2014). The lifespan can be improved by lowering
    the power consumption of each electronic module, including energy harvesters,
    and using alternative power storage mechanisms as replacements of rechargeable
    batteries, which affect the expiration date of deployed devices. • Security: a
    major challenge in the realization of the IoT in agriculture is the security problem
    (Jiang and Zhang, 2013), and the few works that consider it only incorporate fragmented
    strategies to mitigate it. Therefore, it is evident that there is a need for agro-industrial
    and environmental IoT solutions that address end-to-end information security and
    physical integrity of field devices. • Design using modular hardware and software:
    it will enable a greater degree of reuse and customization for the end user (Pang
    et al., 2015). • Improve unit cost: even though the cost of embedded computing
    platforms have been decreasing sharply, the same is not true for high-quality
    sensors and actuators. In order to deploy IoT solutions with hundreds and possibly
    thousands of nodes, the overall hardware, Internet access and international data
    roaming costs have to be reduced even further (Pang et al., 2015). • Aim for a
    good compatibility with legacy infrastructure: similarly to what has happened
    in industrial automation, it is important to deliver IoT solutions that can be
    integrated with the customer’s existing infrastructure such as specialized equipment,
    field machines, and software. • Consider scalability early on: with an increasing
    number of devices in large deployments, data synchronization and data reliability
    become critical (Diedrichs et al., 2014). • Adopt good practices of software engineering:
    as the scale and endurance of deployed IoT solutions grow, the time and effort
    devoted to analyzing generated data, refining the code, and adding new features
    will explode unless the software is well designed and documented (Hussain et al.,
    2006, Jayaraman et al., 2015a). • Improve robustness for field deployments: commercial
    IoT solution should be able to handle strong changes in temperature, humidity,
    and illumination to deal with seasonal changes and worldwide climate variability.
    • User-centered design: the installation and management of corresponding IoT nodes
    should be straight forward for non-expert users. Additionally, the hardware must
    require very little or none human maintenance during its lifespan, and the underlying
    communication network should be intelligent enough to reconfigure or heal itself
    in the case of a node failure. • Contribute to the IoT the ecosystem: there is
    a noticeable void in the literature on how to improve and adapt IoT solutions
    for real-world applications beyond simple prototypes (Chen et al., 2015). • Sustainable
    practices: even if the most humble predictions about the worldwide adoption of
    IoT devices become a reality, recycling strategies will have to be taken into
    account for new solutions deployed on the field, as an integral part of the product
    life cycle to reduce the environmental impact. 6.2. Proposed architecture To summarize
    the findings of this study, authors proposed the IoT architecture for agro-industrial
    and environmental applications that is illustrated in Fig. 13. This encapsulates
    most of the studies analyzed in this paper. The architecture has four main layers:
    physical, communication, service, and application. The physical layer includes
    perception and control. In perception, the main objective is to produce valuable
    data sensing field variables using a WSN. Data produced are sent to the communication
    layer through field gateways. Devices in the perception layer can be powered by
    batteries for short-term deployments or by solar panels because of their low-power
    consumption. In contrast, the control layer acts as a data sink, receiving information
    from a communication layer or a perception layer in the simplest case. Information
    received in the control layer alters the state of field actuators frequently requiring
    power from the electrical grid. In the middle of the perception and control layers
    there is a mobile robot that can be used when fixed devices are not the best option.
    In the communication layer, the objective is to move the information from the
    physical layer to the Internet, collecting data from IoT gateways based either
    on Ethernet or mobile networks (e.g: GPRS/3G/4G/NB-IoT and eventually 5G). This
    layer includes field gateways acting as interfaces between IoT gateways and transceivers
    using ZigBee, Bluetooth, NFC, WiFi, LoRA, or Sigfox. The service layer handles
    data ingestion from the communication layer, as well as their storage, analytics,
    visualization, and security. Finally, the application layer consumes services
    from the previous layer in the architecture and allows the user to handle monitoring,
    control, prediction, and logistics. Download : Download high-res image (717KB)

    review of IoT applications for agro-industrial and environmental fields. It was
    guided by a systematic literature review, and therefore the methodology and intermediate
    results obtained during the stages of planning, conduction, and results were reported
    in great detail. From 3578 initial studies extracted from electronic sources,
    72 main studies were selected based on their relevance to answer two research
    questions. Selected studies came from five continents, and Asian countries contributed
    to more than half of them. During this study, it was discovered that most of the
    research still focuses on monitoring applications (62%); however there is a growing
    interest in closing the loop by doing control (25%), and there are some preliminary
    solutions in logistics and prediction (13%) for agro-industrial and environmental
    applications using IoT. The temperature and humidity of the air, as well as the
    soil moisture and solar radiation can be recognized as universal variables measured
    in agricultural applications based on selected studies. Similarly, actuators such
    as valves, pumps, motors, sprinklers, humidifiers, and lamps were widely used
    in irrigation, fertilization, pesticide management, and illumination control.
    It was also observed that new energy sources and Cloud storage have not been widely
    adopted, showing that there are opportunities for research and development in
    these areas. Studies included in this paper provide a compact view of solutions
    proposed for agro-industrial and environmental problems during the last decade.
    It was found that most of them relied heavily on heterogeneous components and
    wireless sensor networks. However, it seems reasonable to assume that future solutions
    will need to fully embrace Cloud services and new ways of connectivity in order
    to get the benefits of a truly connected and smart IoT ecosystem. Acknowledgements

    Abstract The term data quality refers to measuring the fitness of data regarding
    the intended usage. Poor data quality leads to inadequate, inconsistent, and erroneous
    decisions that could escalate the computational cost, cause a decline in profits,
    and cause customer churn. Thus, data quality is crucial for researchers and industry
    practitioners. Different factors drive the assessment of data quality. Data context
    is deemed one of the key factors due to the contextual diversity of real-world
    use cases of various entities such as people and organizations. Data used in a
    specific context (e.g., an organization policy) may need to be more efficacious
    for another context. Hence, implementing a data quality assessment solution in
    different contexts is challenging. Traditional technologies for data quality assessment
    reached the pinnacle of maturity. Existing solutions can solve most of the quality
    issues. The data context in these solutions is defined as validation rules applied
    within the ETL (extract, transform, load) process, i.e., the data warehousing
    process. In contrast to traditional data quality management, it is impossible
    to specify all the data semantics beforehand for big data. We need context-aware
    data quality rules to detect semantic errors in a massive amount of heterogeneous
    data generated at high speed. While many researchers tackle the quality issues
    of big data, they define the data context from a specific standpoint. Although
    data quality is a longstanding research issue in academia and industries, it remains
    an open issue, especially with the advent of big data, which has fostered the
    challenge of data quality assessment more than ever. This article provides a scoping
    review to study the existing context-aware data quality assessment solutions,
    starting with the existing big data quality solutions in general and then covering
    context-aware solutions. The strength and weaknesses of such solutions are outlined
    and discussed. The survey showed that none of the existing data quality assessment
    solutions could guarantee context awareness with the ability to handle big data.
    Notably, each solution dealt only with a partial view of the context. We compared
    the existing quality models and solutions to reach a comprehensive view covering
    the aspects of context awareness when assessing data quality. This led us to a
    set of recommendations framed in a methodological framework shaping the design
    and implementation of any context-aware data quality service for big data. Open
    challenges are then identified and discussed. Skip 1INTRODUCTION Section 1 INTRODUCTION
    Data quality is the measure of how much data can fit its intended use [124]. Assessing
    data quality levels is critically important to choose whether or not to use the
    data to make more accurate decisions. Since the decision-making process relies
    mainly on data, measuring data quality based on its intended use is a sine qua
    non. Strong et al. [124] have categorized data quality factors into four categories:
    (1) Intrinsic: The quality factors independent of the context of use, such as
    accuracy, believability, objectivity, and reputation. (2) Contextual: The elements,
    such as completeness and timeliness, that reflect how much data is helpful within
    a specific context. (3) Representational: The factors that show the presentation
    quality for the consumers, such as ease of understanding. (4) Accessibility: The
    factors that reflect if consumers can access the data when needed. Wang et al.
    [134] differentiated information from data and described the information as data
    that has been processed in some manner. Then, Pipino et al. [112] developed the
    concepts, principles, and procedures for defining, measuring, analyzing, and improving
    information products called Total Data Quality Management (TDQM). In addition
    to standard data quality, a more refined approach called context-aware data quality
    was introduced. The term “context” is subjective and can be related to the data
    life cycle phase (ingestion, processing, analysis), the data types, the domain
    of data, organizational policy, decision-making policy, the time range within
    which the analysis is done, the security level, or the available resources. In
    ISO/IEC 9126-1 [71] and ISO/IEC 25000 [73] standards, contextual data quality
    is defined from a generic standpoint, which is the following: the quality-in-use
    level. Quality-in-use considers the information as the subject and reflects the
    quality level when data is used in real conditions by including the execution
    environment, decision-making policies, permissions, and every quality characteristic
    related to the context in the assessment operation. Wang et al. [135] described
    the main quality factors reflecting this category: (1) Added value: determines
    the amount of data that gives a competitive edge and adds value to operations.
    (2) Relevancy: determines how much information is applicable, relevant, valuable,
    and usable. (3) Timeliness: determines the age of data. (4) Completeness: determines
    the breadth, depth, and scope of the information contained in the data. (5) The
    appropriate amount of data: determines the amount of data that is suitable for
    the task. Merino et al. [96] identified other contextual characteristics such
    as accuracy, consistency, credibility, compliance, confidentiality, and understandability.
    Additionally, Ge et al. [53] categorized the data quality problems between context-independent
    and context-dependent, and Woodall et al. [138] further extended this categorization.
    In this research, we heavily focus on how a data quality assessment method can
    be developed to adapt flexibly to different contexts. Typically, the properties
    of context are diverse; therefore, data quality assessment solutions must have
    the ability to be used within any context and to take into consideration all related
    conditions. Considering this critical factor, we define context awareness as follows:
    It is the ability of data quality solutions to evaluate the quality of data considering
    the generic properties of context, which enables the solutions to be used in any
    context. The data quality solutions must check whether the data properties are
    suitable with related policies and available resources in addition to the contextual
    factors. Data quality assessment is less challenging in traditional technologies
    such as data warehouses. The data model follows the relational schema principles,
    data size is reasonable, and the data is at rest. Leading companies such as Microsoft
    [30, 31], Oracle [32], Informatica [69], and Talend [130] offer many tools and
    frameworks that can be used to develop and administer ETL jobs and address the
    majority of data quality issues. However, these technologies limitations are three-fold:
    (i) the ability to adapt to different contexts, (ii) the generalization of data
    quality assessment methods remains an issue, and (iii) these technologies confront
    challenges when handling large datasets with high variety, and generated at high
    speed. More explicitly, traditional technologies still need to be appropriately
    used for non-relational massive data [94], such as processing wireless sensor
    feeds in real-time [6]. The operational limitation of traditional technologies
    can be tackled using highly advanced processing resources and distributed technologies
    such as distributed file systems (e.g., HDFS) developed over the past decade.
    However, these technologies do not address quality assessment standardization;
    instead, the quality issues are handled using different heuristics [118]. The
    quality assessment approaches need yet to reach a level of maturity that the industries
    would accept [104]. In short, quality assessment techniques within the big data
    domain remain an open research issue [11]. Furthermore, context-aware quality
    assessment is a critical concern, since any meaningless quality dimension measurement
    would consume time and resources and cannot yet be dealt with by state-of-the-art
    big data technologies. A context-aware quality assessment solution for assessing
    the quality attributes of big data is strongly required. The properties of the
    context should be generic for the solution to be used/adopted in any context.
    Such a data quality assessment solution would greatly help extract value-added
    intelligence from data that the industry is currently seeking. These requirements
    give rise to the following research questions: What are the challenges of building
    a context-aware big data quality assessment framework? What are the requirements
    for building such a framework? We conducted a deep and wide survey to answer these
    questions. This scoping review article presents our survey results on context-aware
    big data quality solutions. Only generally applicable solutions not related to
    a specific domain were selected in this survey. The strength and weaknesses of
    existing solutions are outlined comprehensively and discussed intensively. Moreover,
    we presented a sketch of a solution that could address the limitations of existing
    solutions. Finally, we identified the open challenges for building such a solution.
    The rest of this article is organized as follows: Section 2 describes our research
    methodology. Section 3 defines the main terms and concepts used in this work.
    Section 4 provides a literature review of the recent research about context-aware
    data quality and big data quality. Section 5 highlights the significant results
    and elements that should be considered in future research. Section 6 describes
    a methodological framework for a context-aware big data quality assessment solution
    based on the literature investigation. Section 7 lists the open challenges. Section
    8 concludes this work. Skip 2RESEARCH METHODOLOGY Section 2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
    Since our research aims to study the need for a context-aware big data quality
    assessment solution, as well as the challenges of building such a solution, two
    topics were covered by our research: (1) Assessing the data quality in the domain
    of big data. (2) Achieving context awareness while assessing data quality. We
    tried to answer five general research questions that are essential for building
    a context-aware big data quality assessment solution: What does a data quality
    assessment solution require to handle big data? How is data context defined in
    the existing data quality assessment solutions? How is context-aware data quality
    different in big data compared to traditional context-aware data quality? What
    key components/methods are used to achieve context awareness during data quality
    assessment? What are the main limitations and open challenges when building a
    context-aware data quality assessment solution that handles big data? To our knowledge,
    no surveys about context-aware big data quality assessment methods have been published.
    To bridge this research gap, in this article, we studied the existing data quality
    assessment solutions that consider the context or are designed for big data. Then,
    we tried to link both concepts to derive the main recommendations for building
    a context-aware big data quality assessment solution. Following Munn et al. [100]
    guidance when choosing between a systematic or scoping review approach, researchers
    should conduct a scoping review when they try to scope a body of literature, identify
    knowledge gaps, and clarify the key concepts. Thus, we found a scoping review
    more suitable than a systematic review, since—to our knowledge—no surveys about
    context-aware big data quality assessment methods have been published to date.
    We aimed in this survey to fill this research gap by studying the existing data
    quality assessment solutions that consider the context and/or are designed for
    big data. Then, we tried to link both concepts to derive the main recommendations
    for building a context-aware big data quality assessment solution. Our research
    started by searching for the following keywords: “context data quality”, “contextual
    data quality”, “context-aware quality”, “big data quality”, “data lake quality”,
    “context-aware big data quality”, “context-aware information quality”, “data quality
    in use” over the following scholarly literature indexes: Google Scholar,1 IEEE
    Xplore,2 and DBLP3 in addition to using the Mendeley search engine4 and the ResearchGate5
    social network. The first research phase resulted in more than a hundred articles.
    To select only the articles that are within our research scope, we defined two
    selection criteria: (1) The generally applicable big data quality assessment solutions
    that focus on handling the big data characteristics while assessing the data quality
    and excluding those related to a specific domain (for example, we excluded the
    healthcare quality assessment solutions). (2) The data quality assessment solutions
    where the data context is defined and considered. Since this was only a scoping
    review, no limits were placed on the publication date or research methodology.
    After filtering the search results based on the selection criteria, we identified
    three highly cited articles6 that are considered a primary reference for most
    contextual data quality research: “Data Quality in Context” (1,964 citations)
    [124], “Beyond Accuracy: What Data Quality Means to Data Consumers” (5,852 citations)
    [135], “A Product Perspective on Total Data Quality Management” (1,403 citations)
    [134]. Then, we searched over the citing articles. As a result, our scoping review
    covered 27 articles (Table 1) published between 2005 and 2021 (Figure 1); 18 were
    about context-aware data quality assessment, and 9 were about big data quality
    assessment where the data context was not considered. Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Articles

    in This Review Limitations and strengths A wide range of information was collected,
    analyzed, and fruitfully combined into a methodological framework offering an
    integrated context-aware big data quality solution. However, this scoping review
    started by searching for specific keywords, which may have resulted in unintentionally
    discarding some relevant research. Moreover, we intentionally excluded domain-specific
    big data quality assessment solutions, since our ultimate goal was to propose
    a framework that is general enough to be used in any domain. Skip 3BACKGROUND
    Section 3 BACKGROUND This section lays out the background of the concepts covered
    by our research. It provides a conceptual description of data quality assessment
    and big data quality. 3.1 Data Quality Ensuring data quality requires assessment
    and improvement techniques to be implemented during any phase of the data life
    cycle. Each stage may have different quality requirements. For example, data credibility
    may be optional while ingesting data from social media. In contrast, it is critical
    in the analysis phase. The data quality level is calculated based on several quality
    characteristics defining the data’s quality aspects, such as the accuracy and
    completeness level [72]. These characteristics are measured through specific measurement
    methods. The quality measurement methods are implemented using quality assessment
    techniques in the real data environment. Data quality techniques can generally
    be informative (assessment) or operational (improvement). Below, we explain these
    techniques. Data quality assessment techniques. Various techniques can be used
    to assess data quality. These techniques can be grouped into two categories: (1)
    objective techniques that measure the data quality based on the data characteristics
    and (2) subjective that ask the data consumer to rate the data quality [27]. An
    objective measurement is mainly done using the following techniques: Data quality
    models: Each data quality model is composed of several data quality dimensions
    measured using several quality metrics [53, 96, 124, 135, 138]. Data profiling:
    This technique collects statistics or informative summaries about data (e.g.,
    the percentage of null values within a dataset and the number of duplicates).
    It is used before and after storing data [7, 89, 97, 105, 129]. Data provenance:
    This technique describes the origin and history of the data [23, 111]. Data integration:
    It is the process of integrating a dataset with other knowledge bases or data
    from credible sources to assess the accuracy and consistency of the data [26,
    137]. As for the subjective measurement of data quality, it is done using one
    of the following techniques: Crowdsourcing: This technique engages a crowd to
    achieve a common goal. It is one of the techniques used to assess the quality
    of specific information. Mainly, this technique is used for unstructured data
    (text, videos, images...) [3, 50, 65, 87, 140]. Survey and questionnaires: Data
    consumers should rate the data quality after using it [113]. Data quality improvement
    techniques. Researchers have proposed a wide variety of techniques to improve
    data quality. Below is the list of the techniques we found in the literature.
    Data cleansing: Detecting and fixing inaccurate and erroneous values within records
    [85, 114]. Data enrichment: This technique adds additional information to the
    current data records from other external sources or uses advanced statistical
    techniques [8, 82]. Data fusion: It integrates related data from different sources
    to reject non-credible, inaccurate, and inconsistent data [40]. Data deduplication:
    It is the process of removing data records that store the same information [60,
    93]. Machine learning-guided cleaning: Classifying duplicate pairs in deduplication,
    estimating the most likely value for a missing value, predicting a transformation,
    or classifying values as normal or outliers [66]. 3.2 Big Data Quality Big data
    quality is critical to performing effective analysis and extracting meaningful
    insights [37]. As mentioned earlier, the traditional data quality assessment and
    improvement techniques must be improved to meet big data requirements. Until today,
    big data quality is still an open research issue. Batini et al. [11] showed the
    importance of data quality assessment when handling big data. They described the
    emerging challenges, such as handling a wide variety of data types, data generated
    at high speed, massive amounts of data analyzing maps, linked open data, and wireless
    sensors. Moreover, they described how the data sources and quality characteristics
    have evolved, leading to these new challenges. Saha et al. [118] provided an overview
    of the existing traditional data quality tools, then described the process of
    discovering and learning data quality semantics and repairing inconsistency at
    various stages in the big data domain. Clarke et al. [28] considered data accuracy,
    precision, timeliness (temporal applicability, Up-to-Dateness, Currency), and
    completeness as the main big data quality factors. They also described the primary
    quality assurance processes applicable in all data stages. Clarke et al. [28]
    also described the quality factors needed in the decision-making process as the
    data relevance, the data meaning, and the transparency of the decision-making
    process. While studying the quality assurance techniques for big data applications,
    Zhang et al. [141] considered data accuracy, scalability, correctness, consistency,
    and security as the main factors for big data quality assessment. Gao et al. [52]
    described the leading big data quality assurance parameters as data accuracy,
    currency, timeliness, correctness, consistency, usability, security, privacy,
    completeness, accessibility, accountability, and scalability. Then, they classified
    the data quality issues between (1) enterprise management issues (organization
    management issue, big data management issue, data quality assurance issue) and
    (2) big data processing and services issues (data collection issue, data conversion
    issue, data service scalability issue, data transformation issue). They demonstrated
    that poor data quality might lead to (1) higher costs for enterprises and businesses,
    (2) inefficient service operations, (3) as well as it may reduce business revenues
    and (4) affect the accuracy of the data analysis. They mentioned that data validation
    must be implemented within data collection, cleaning, transformation, loading,
    aggregation, and analysis operations to guarantee high quality. Finally, they
    described the main challenges facing organizations regarding data quality assurance
    in the context of big data as (1) the lack of awareness and a good understanding
    of big data quality assurance and validation, (2) the lack of well-defined enterprise-oriented
    big data assurance standards, (3) the lack of available research results on big
    data quality models and evaluation metrics, and (4) the lack of well-established
    big data certification program and standards. Big data quality and machine learning.
    Big data quality is crucial for many other computer science fields, such as data
    analytics and machine learning. The use of machine learning often requires big
    data. Machine learning algorithms face several challenges that arise from the
    big data Vs.: Volume, Velocity, Veracity...[133]. A wide variety of data sources
    and collection methods can result in noisy and uncertain data [139] that highly
    affect the learning process and result in inaccurate models. It is impossible
    for several machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning algorithms,
    to achieve their full potential without large, well-maintained training sets [143].
    L’Heureux et al. [92] stated that handling dirty and noisy data is one of the
    main challenges that face machine learning algorithms in a big data context. They
    also stated that it is difficult for a machine learning algorithm to learn from
    data that lacks objectivity or absolute truth, such as social media posts or crowdsourcing.
    Zhou et al. [143] recommended developing algorithms that can assess the trustworthiness
    or credibility of data or data sources to handle data veracity challenges when
    training machine learning models using big data so unreliable or contradictory
    data are filtered during pre-processing. Gudivada et al. [55, 56] considered big
    data and machine learning applications’ main challenge as developing an automated
    tool to resolve data quality issues such as streaming data, disparate data types,
    and integration difficulties. However, machine learning techniques are useful
    while handling big data quality. Four areas could be identified under the umbrella
    of data quality that machine learning helps to address [66, 68]: Handling missing
    values within the data. Assessing the data source relevance to a specific domain
    without user intervention. Anomaly detection: In a data pool, machine learning
    programs can detect patterns, associations, and rare occurrences. Data deduplication:
    Machine learning techniques can be more efficient in handling inconsistent data,
    stale data, or data with typos. Dai et al. [34] proposed a solution that detects
    erroneous data using deep learning and outlier detection techniques to improve
    big data quality. Skip 4SCOPING REVIEW RESULTS Section 4 SCOPING REVIEW RESULTS
    Big data quality and context-aware data quality assessment have been discussed
    in a large body of literature. This article investigated the quality models and
    techniques used to assess data quality and achieve context awareness in the big
    data context. Moreover, since context-aware big data quality assessment is not
    widely addressed, our study was extended to include valuable research on big data
    quality. We categorized our review as follows: (1) Big data quality assessment:
    covers the solutions designed to handle big data without considering the context.
    (2) Context-aware data quality assessment frameworks: covers the data quality
    assessment frameworks that consider the context. (3) Context modeling: covers
    the existing approaches for expressing and modeling the context during data quality
    assessment. We start with an overview of the reviewed literature and summarize
    the works we studied in Table 2. Existing solutions are compared based on three
    main aspects: (1) the data source types they can handle, (2) how they guarantee
    context awareness, and (3) how they handle big data. Moreover, we highlighted
    the solutions’ strengths and weaknesses to derive essential recommendations. Then,
    each solution is discussed separately, focusing on providing more technical details.

    More Table 2. Literature Summarization 4.1 Big Data Quality Assessment Cai et
    al. [24] proposed a two-layer big data quality standard for assessing data quality.
    The first layer contains the data quality dimensions, and the second layer contains
    each of the characteristics of each dimension. Then, they defined the primary
    indicators used to evaluate each quality characteristic. After defining the data
    quality dimensions, characteristics, and indicators, they proposed a data quality
    assessment process for big data, having four phases: (1) preparation, (2) pre-processing
    and assessment, (3) evaluation and troubleshooting, and (4) the analysis phase.
    Preparation phase: This phase requires a clear understanding of the work, since
    data consumers should determine the goals of data collection, the data source
    types, volume, and other parameters. Then, they should select data quality elements
    (characteristics). For each quality element, assessment indicators should be specified.
    Finally, a quality evaluation baseline should be formulated. This phase can well
    define the project scope. Pre-processing and assessment phase: This phase starts
    with the data collection operation. After collecting data, data quality is improved
    by detecting and removing typing errors and inconsistencies (pre-processing/cleaning).
    After data cleaning, the data quality assessment is performed. Evaluation and
    troubleshooting phase: After quality assessment, the data quality levels are compared
    with the previous evaluation baseline; if it meets baseline standards, then a
    quality report is generated. Otherwise, iterative improvement is achieved by returning
    to the data collection step. Analysis phase: If results do not reach the goal
    after many attempts, then the data quality assessment baseline may not be reasonable.
    In this case, data mining and analysis techniques may improve the evaluation baseline
    to obtain results aligned with the goals. This proposal provides a systematic
    approach to studying, evaluating, and monitoring data quality, which is very efficient.
    Using quality indicators is a great added value, since it simplifies quality measurement.
    Moreover, using data mining and analysis techniques to improve the evaluation
    baseline increases the quality assessment’s context awareness level. However,
    the proposed process cannot handle big data, since it does not address unstructured
    data quality assessment, nor the data volume challenges. In addition, the solution
    requires high user intervention, which is not valid with high-velocity data. Dmitriyev
    et al. [38] proposed SOA-Enabled ELTA, a new approach for extract, load, and transform
    (ELT) operations to prepare business intelligence solutions for big data. SOA-Enabled
    ELTA is built using a service-oriented architecture to perform data transformations
    and validate data through defined business rules. This provides high-level business
    concept representation, which can be published and discovered in a distributed
    network and reused to build new (business) functions and applications. Still,
    it is unclear how data quality can be assessed, since only the data cleaning process
    is described. Moreover, handling unstructured data is not covered, meaning this
    solution does not address the big data variety challenge. Ramaswamy et al. [115]
    considered the data accuracy, error rate, frequency, availability, timeliness,
    validity, and trustworthiness to evaluate data quality within a federated sensors
    network. They proposed a cloud-based solution to host the domain application and
    a central data quality repository. They used markup language to describe sensor
    feeds containing actual data quality metadata, while historical data quality metadata
    was stored in an aggregated form for optimizing storage. Using a cloud-based solution
    gives the ability to efficiently handle big data, since it enables high scalability
    and gives the ability to perform stream and batch processing. Moreover, storing
    only aggregates of historical data quality measurements can avoid a high-speed
    growing data volume and decreases the needed resources. However, this solution
    is proposed specifically for wireless sensor feeds and cannot handle different
    types of data sources. Moreover, it lacks essential quality dimensions such as
    completeness and uniqueness. To assess social media data quality, Immonen et al.
    [67] considered data accuracy, believability, completeness, consistency, corroboration,
    coverage (amount of data), validity, popularity, relevancy, timeliness, and verifiability
    as the relevant characteristics for the quality model. To describe each quality
    characteristic, they adopted Niemelä et al.’s [106] proposal by considering a
    group of quality metrics to evaluate a quality attribute (characteristic). Each
    metric is defined by the description, purpose, target, applicability, formula,
    value range, acceptable value, and rule. One of the main weaknesses of this solution
    is that the data quality rules and decision-making policies should be manually
    specified for each data source, knowing that automating the assessment operation
    is essential in a big data environment. Besides, the solution is designed to assess
    data ingested from social media and does not support other data sources. To assess
    data quality, they proposed a metadata management extension implemented within
    a big data reference architecture proposed by Paakkonen et al. [109]. The extension
    will be used during all data life cycle phases. In the data extraction phase,
    the organizational policy facilitates the process by defining an acceptable data
    source, quality attributes, applicability time of the quality attribute, as well
    as metrics and methods to evaluate the quality. After extraction, the imported
    data is stored in a data storage. The quality metadata is created for the dataset,
    and the evaluated values for quality attributes are automatically inserted into
    the metadata repository. The organizational policy helps select datasets for processing/analysis
    purposes and helps to attach applicable quality attributes for metadata of datasets.
    The decision-making policy facilitates the selection of relevant data for decision-making
    purposes. When evaluating the significance of a dataset for a specific purpose,
    the decision-making policy helps to weigh the relevant quality attributes for
    the practical situation. One of the main advantages of this extension is implementing
    organizational and decision-making policies to meet the context requirements.
    Besides, it guarantees data provenance by storing metadata from all data life
    cycle phases. However, it does not systematically select relevant data quality
    characteristics. It requires a high user interaction, which is not preferred in
    a big data context. To assess and monitor data quality from the heterogeneous
    data source, Ehrlinger et al. [45] proposed a high-level architecture for a data
    quality assessment solution that is composed of four components: (1) Data profiling
    component, (2) data quality repository, (3) time-series analytics, and (4) user
    interface. This solution’s core is the data quality repository, which contains
    an ontological description of the assessed information system schema and a database
    that stores only the measurement of the data quality metrics commonly used and
    the ones related to the time-series analysis. The time series analysis is performed
    to detect temporal data outliers affecting data quality. This proposal is a high-level
    architecture where many features are not described clearly, such as how data sources
    are integrated with the ontological description found within the quality repository.
    Using this kind of repository is very beneficial to address data variety by linking
    data with a unified description. Later, Ehrlinger et al. proposed QuaIIe [43,
    44], an unsupervised data quality monitoring tool that allows continuous data
    quality verification. It uses data source connectors to read from structured data
    such as Oracle database and semi-structured data such as XML and comma-separated
    values. One of the main advantages of QuaIIE is that it performs ad hoc quality
    analysis on integrated data sources. In contrast, its main weakness is that it
    does not handle schema-less data and only supports equijoins operation to integrate
    multiple data sources. Gu et al. [54] proposed SparkDQ, a data quality management
    framework for Apache Spark,7 to improve the data quality in a big data environment.
    They implemented several flexible quality issues detection and repair algorithms
    to customize data detection and repair logic for specific needs. The main weakness
    of this framework is that it can handle only structured data and does not handle
    the format variety aspect in the big data context. Schelter et al. [119] proposed
    a declarative language that automates measuring large-scale data accuracy, consistency,
    and completeness using incremental data quality scoring and machine learning techniques
    to predict values and anomalies based on historical data. Still, the proposed
    solution lacks essential data quality dimensions, such as timeliness. Also, the
    logical operators are defined based on the author’s definition of each quality
    dimension, while these definitions may vary based on the data consumer perspective,
    meaning that this solution may not be implemented in a different context. 4.2
    Context-aware Data Quality Assessment Frameworks Batini et al. extended their
    previously proposed data quality solution for structured data to address the data
    heterogeneity issue [10] with the ability to assess data quality for unstructured
    and semi-structured data [25]. They proposed an entity-relationship “Meta-Model”
    to associate the needed data quality dimensions and the included conceptual entities
    with each data source used by organizational units. After defining the data context
    (data sources, conceptual entities, organizational units), information is extracted
    from the data to perform a data quality assessment. The extraction process is
    done using two techniques (1) reverse engineering and (2) schema mapping (with
    the Meta-Model). While this solution addresses the data variety challenge, it
    can only handle a small data volume. Bronselaer et al. [21] proposed an operational
    approach for data quality measurement where quality is assessed in terms of the
    cost of task completion using the data. Unlike the value-driven quality assessment,
    the operational approach considers the time and resources needed to complete the
    required task. At the same time, it ignores the intrinsic characteristics of the
    data, which means that a descriptive quality assessment must precede this type
    of assessment. Moreover, the authors assumed that data is finite, making this
    proposal unable to fit the big data requirements. To assess data quality, Helfert
    et al. [62] used the quality characteristics defined in Reference [135]. Then,
    they classified these characteristics based on semiotics layers (pragmatics, semantics,
    syntactic) and the quality aspects (quality of design and conformance) and defined
    the measurement approach for each group. To evaluate the context, the proposed
    framework requires an analysis of the information system environment before measuring
    quality dimensions. Depending on the specific context, we can select and prioritize
    different information quality dimensions by applying a metric such as Leung’s
    metric for importance, urgency, and cost [90]. In their proposed framework, the
    authors defined the data context as a combination of (1) the end-user requirements,
    (2) the application task, and (3) the information system environment. This framework
    guarantees high data consumer satisfaction, since its requirements are essential.
    Moreover, using a systematic approach to select the needed quality dimensions
    increases the framework’s robustness. However, this framework requires a high
    user interaction, which is not recommendable when handling massive data volumes.
    Organizational policies and available resources are not considered a part of the
    data context. Taleb et al. [127] classified the data quality characteristics into
    two categories: intrinsic and contextual. They proposed a quality framework for
    the data pre-processing phase. The framework is composed of four main components:
    (1) data quality profile selection, (2) adaptation, (3) data quality control,
    and (4) monitoring. First, the user should select a data quality profile containing
    all related pre-processing activities (cleansing algorithms and targeted data
    quality) based on the data domain, user-defined business rules, and auto-discovery
    techniques. The quality profile is sent as XML to the data quality profile execution
    component. After receiving the profile, the cleansing algorithm is distributed
    across the big data cluster nodes and executed over a data sample. When the data
    processing finishes, the quality controller components check whether the cleansed
    data meets the quality requirements. If so, then the cleansing algorithm is executed
    over the whole dataset. Two main factors make this framework very efficient while
    handling big data: using a MapReduce paradigm and performing data quality profiling
    over a data sample to check if it is acceptable. Although it is adaptable to different
    contexts, it only assesses the data quality during the pre-processing phase and
    does not consider the representational and accessibility quality dimensions. Merino
    et al. [96] proposed a data quality model based on ISO/IEC 25010, 25012 [72, 122],
    and 25024 [74] standards. They classified the ISO/IEC 25012 quality characteristics
    based on 3A’s model, an improved form of the quality categories used by Strong
    et al. [124]. They regrouped the categories as (1) contextual adequacy (contextual
    data quality), (2) operational adequacy (accessibility, representation, and intrinsic
    qualities), and (3) temporal adequacy (the authors separated it from the contextual
    category due to the growing significance of time analysis). They proposed a data
    quality-in-use framework grounded on the quality measures from ISO/IEC 25024 to
    calculate the level of fulfillment of the data quality characteristics (ISO/IEC
    25012). Accordingly, to measure the data quality-in-use level, first, (1) the
    data quality requirements delimited by the scope need to be established. Then,
    (2) the appropriate adequacy type must be selected in addition to identifying
    the relevant quality characteristics. (3) The user-defined business rules and
    the quality measures defined within the context should be gathered. (4) The quality
    measures are evaluated, and finally, (5) a quality report is generated. This framework’s
    main advantages are using ISO standards and the context awareness guaranteed by
    the user-defined business rules and quality measures. However, it fails to consider
    the velocity and variety characteristics of big data, since it cannot handle streams
    and unstructured data. Ardagna et al. [7] used accuracy, consistency, completeness,
    and timeliness as data quality characteristics and added precision, distinctness,
    volume, and trustworthiness to meet the big data quality requirements. The proposed
    framework’s main components are (1) the Data quality profiling module that provides
    metrics to measure and monitor the overall data quality such as the number of
    values, number of null values, number of distinct values, maximum, minimum, mean,
    and standard deviation. Furthermore, (2) the Assessment modules are in charge
    of computing data quality dimensions. Data profiling starts automatically after
    the data source is registered; the source analyzer detects the source metadata
    and the appropriate quality dimensions (based on data type and format) to be measured.
    Then, the data quality profiling module executes an initial profiling operation
    and stores the data profile within the quality metadata repository. Unlike data
    profiling, the data assessment phase is executed on-demand; the data quality service
    interface allows users/applications to access the data quality service, browse
    the data quality metadata repository, or set up the quality assessment operation.
    All configurations are saved to the custom settings repository and a configuration
    file. The data quality adapter uses the external configuration file to tune the
    result’s precision. Since data quality evaluation can be expensive on massive
    data, the adapter can select a subset to provide a faster evaluation but with
    lower precision. The main parameters of the data quality adapter are (CCT model):
    Confidence: the size of the sample dataset/size of the whole dataset Budget (cost):
    the number of computational nodes (resources available) Time: the estimated execution
    time. The user must select one of the following three scenarios: Confidence maximization
    = maximum cost + maximum time Cost minimization = minimum confidence + maximum
    time Time minimization = minimum confidence + maximum cost. Once the confidence
    level is selected, the data quality assessment is executed. This framework is
    built using a service-oriented architecture (SOA) paradigm, which ensures high
    interoperability. The data profiling module solves the context-dependent quality
    assessment issues. At the same time, adopting the CCT model allows the execution
    of the assessment operation on commodity machines with low resources. The three
    predefined scenarios can be very efficient in minimizing user interaction. Using
    knowledge repositories (settings, quality metadata) helps prevent repetitive operations
    and allows the framework to handle streams (low user interaction is required).
    However, this framework shows many weaknesses: Unlike the data quality assessment,
    data quality profiling is performed on the whole dataset, which may be time-consuming
    and may require more resources than available. Moreover, the selected scenario
    (CCT model) may be incompatible with the real environment (i.e., the user may
    select the confidence maximization scenario while having insufficient resources).
    Finally, this solution cannot integrate with reference data sources that may be
    needed to evaluate data consistency. Taleb et al. [128] listed and classified
    unstructured data sources based on their domain and types to assess data quality
    for unstructured big data. They specified six steps: (1) Knowing the data (type,
    format, domain). (2) Specifying the data quality dimensions to use. (3) Specifying
    the data quality metrics to consider. (4) Identifying the attributes to evaluate.
    (5) Choosing a sampling strategy. (6) Choosing a quality assessment methodology.
    These six steps were implemented within a data quality assessment model. Knowledge
    extraction and mining techniques were used to gather information required for
    quality assessment. The classification of the data sources based on the domain
    and types gives the model the ability to adapt to different contexts. However,
    this classification needs to be updated and evaluated periodically. Mylavarapu
    et al. [101] proposed a context-aware big data accuracy assessment tool based
    on a collection of datasets already stored in the data lake. The quality assessment
    is done in three phases: training, record linkage, and accuracy assessment. The
    idea is to use word embeddings and record linkage techniques to identify the most
    accurate reference data, which will serve as a basis for the accuracy assessment
    process of the input dataset. For the same purpose, Talha et al. [131] distinguished
    between intrinsic and contextual data accuracy and proposed a method to select
    a reference dataset from a data lake to assess the contextual accuracy of input
    data. They defined several accuracy criteria to select the appropriate reference
    dataset. The proposed solution first collects several datasets from different
    providers and assigns a value for each dataset for each accuracy criterion; it
    uses schema-matching techniques to map between the input data and the selected
    datasets. Then, it uses record linkage and data sampling techniques to match records
    and filter the datasets that do not match the input dataset before assessing the
    data quality. Mylavarapu et al. [102] proposed another solution to assess information
    consistency based on its context. The proposed solution uses feature selection
    algorithms to extract the context information from a data record, then perform
    a record linkage to match it with existing datasets within a data lake to perform
    a consistency check. These assumptions can be correct if it is guaranteed that
    the data in the lake are correct and up to date, which is generally not the case.
    Moreover, the input data may even be of better quality. Besides, these solutions
    focus on only one quality dimension: data accuracy or consistency, while other
    essential dimensions should also be considered in a big data context. 4.3 Context
    Modeling 4.3.1 Expressing Context as Objects. To make data quality requirements
    executable, Bicevskis et al. [18] proposed a data quality model composed of three
    components: (1) data object, (2) quality requirements, and (3) quality evaluation
    process. Then, they divided data quality requirements into two categories: (1)
    syntactic (the quality of the data object itself) and (2) semantic (contextual).
    Two types of semantic quality control were considered: (1) contextual control
    on interrelated data to ensure the quality of the interconnected data objects
    and (2) contextual control on the entire dataset. The quality requirements are
    expressed in diagrams using a domain-specific language and then converted to executable
    tasks by IT and domain experts. They implemented their work using DIMOD, a derivative
    of the graphical tool-building platform GrTp [9]. This work was extended and demonstrated
    by Bicevska et al. [16, 17], where semantic quality control is divided into three
    categories: (1) contextual quality control of interrelated data, (2) contextual
    quality control over the data within a database, (3) contextual control over data
    stored within several databases/systems. This notion was extended in Reference
    [19], where the authors focused on how to design the informal model for the quality
    requirements (platform-independent model of the individual data object) and the
    executable task created by programmers from this informal model (platform-specific
    model for individual data object). Later, Nikiforova et al. [107, 108] extended
    this research by expressing the data context as separate data objects that are
    connected to the primary data object (the data for which we need to evaluate quality).
    The quality requirements of the primary data object are defined based on the secondary
    related objects. While this model-driven data quality assessment is efficient,
    since requirements are expressed in a formal language by the end-users, it cannot
    be implemented in the big data context, since it only applies to simple tabular
    data at rest. Also, it requires IT and domain experts to be involved in converting
    formal language into executable tasks. 4.3.2 Expressing Context Quantitatively.
    Even et al. [46, 47] proposed a contextual quantitative data quality assessment
    for tabular datasets from the perspective of data utility (value). The authors
    proposed a measurement method to assign an intrinsic numeric value for each record/dataset
    based on the customer’s point of view. Then, they used this intrinsic value to
    measure the data quality dimensions such as data completeness, currency, validity,
    and accuracy. They also defined four principles to ensure the consistency of the
    measurement methods, which are (1) interpretation consistency, (2) representation
    consistency, (3) aggregation consistency, and (4) impartial contextual consistency.
    The proposed approach is beneficial for data quality assessment research, since
    it can convert the context business rules into quantitative methods and use their
    values by statistical analysis or machine learning algorithms. Moreover, it treats
    data based on its value from the user’s perspective. However, it can only be used
    in tabular data and does not fit the big data quality requirements. Moreover,
    this approach does not consider all context characteristics, such as available
    system resources and time. Skip 5DISCUSSION Section 5 DISCUSSION After going through
    the literature, it was noticeable that each solution dealt only with a partial
    view of the context. In this section, we compare these quality models and solutions
    to reach a comprehensive view covering the whole aspects of context awareness
    when assessing data quality. This analysis has led us to some essential recommendations
    we compiled into a methodological framework we propose and describe at the end
    of this article. 5.1 Quality Models In Table 3, we summarize the classification
    approaches, as specified for each data quality model in the literature, to understand
    its purpose and scope of use. The table’s term “No classification” means that
    the author did not adopt any data quality characteristic classification. Table

    Used in Data Quality Models After looking through all data quality characteristics
    listed in (Table 4), we can see that the ISO/IEC 25012 standard data quality characteristics
    do not fit the big data requirements (data uniqueness, amount of data) and thus
    need to be extended. Context-related features such as data fitness also need to
    be added to measure to what degree the data fits the context needs. It is also
    worth noting that many context-specific quality characteristics related to ingesting
    data from wireless sensors are missing, i.e., error rate and frequency [115].
    This means that even when considering the adoption of ISO standards for big data
    quality assessment, there is a need to define additional context-specific quality
    characteristics. Table 4. Data Quality Characteristic Helfert el al. [62] Taleb

    Characteristics Used in the Literature From this summary, we drew the following
    conclusions and decided that the representational and accessibility categories
    defined in References [24, 124, 135] should be considered in the context of use.
    Second, we found no need to separate the temporal characteristics from the contextual
    category [96], since temporal factors are context-dependent. At another level,
    it was clear that the ISO/IEC 25012 classification standard could meet the needed
    context awareness requirements, since inherent characteristics can be considered
    intrinsic data quality characteristics and system-dependent ones as context-related
    characteristics. In addition, we can use the semiotics classification to define
    and classify the measurement methods of the quality characteristics [62] that
    are not listed in the ISO/IEC 25012 standard, since the ones listed have their
    quality measures and measurement function defined in the ISO/IEC 25024 and ISO/IEC
    25021 standards. In fact, all of the characteristics listed in Table 4, which
    are not found in the ISO/IEC 25012 standard, cannot be considered inherent and
    are system-dependent due to the following reasons: Representational quality characteristic
    depends on the current task, organizational policies, and user needs [135]. Uniqueness
    [7], Amount of Data, and Added Value are classified as contextual data quality
    characteristics [124, 135]. Validity, Frequency, Verfiablity, Popularity, Error
    rate characteristics are related to the wireless sensors [115] and social media
    contexts [67] and measured based on reference data or task-oriented business rules.
    Minimality, Pertinence are used within an integrated information systems [44]
    context and require a reference data to be measured. 5.2 Achieving Context Awareness
    in Big Data Quality Assessment Based on the literature, we can define data context
    as the information about the data itself (e.g., metadata, source reputation),
    organization policies, domain business rules, and the available system resources
    to handle the data. Achieving context awareness in big data is very important
    when performing data quality assessment; each measurement/operation should be
    carefully selected and executed, because each operation will cost a reasonable
    amount of time and resources. An essential part of the data quality measurement
    is context-related [124]. Moreover, extracting the context information in a big
    data context is much more challenging. It cannot be achieved using the traditional
    data quality assessment methods, as it requires more intelligent techniques that
    can handle a wide variety of data formats. In addition, handling a massive amount
    of data generated at a high velocity requires a well-designed and automated quality
    assessment solution that relies on a scalable infrastructure. Regarding the existing
    solutions, we can summarize their main weaknesses as follows: They cannot handle
    huge data volumes [16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 24, 107, 108]. They cannot handle unstructured
    data [16, 17, 18, 19, 24, 38, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 54, 96, 107, 108]. The end-user
    manually implements quality rules [7, 16, 17, 18, 19, 107, 108]. They only assess
    the data quality at rest [7, 24, 62, 96, 101, 102, 109, 131]. It is hard to implement
    within different contexts [67, 115, 128]. They lack essential data quality dimensions
    for the big data context [67, 101, 102, 115, 119, 131]. They require high user
    intervention during the quality assessment operation [24, 62, 109]. The following
    are the recommendations a data quality assessment solution must consider to achieve
    context awareness in a big data setting: Service-oriented architecture (SOA) and
    microservices. Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an enterprise-wide software
    design approach that allows loosely coupled services to communicate independently
    from operating systems, platforms, and languages [5, 35]. For example, Dmitriyev
    et al. [38] proposed a data-centric service to be consumed by different stakeholders
    using tools such as Weka8 and Pentaho BI9; thus, following the SOA approach allowed
    a wider range of tools to be used seamlessly for accessing the enterprise data.
    While Dmitriyev et al.’s [38] solution may be efficient as an enterprise solution,
    it may not be able to scale up once needed, since all components are tightly coupled.
    In contrast, Ardagna et al.’s [7] proposal guarantees higher scalability as the
    data quality service is separated from the data sources and the enterprise management
    system. Moreover, splitting the data quality solution into two separate modules
    (data profiling and data quality assessment service) allows each module to scale
    up separately once needed and increases the reusability and portability of the
    service components. This software development paradigm is known as Microservices,
    which is a must for building scalable [58] and distributed applications [41].
    Data sampling. Data sampling allows us to perform data profiling and quality assessment
    operations on a subset of the original dataset, which decreases resources and
    time consumption [7, 128]. Data sampling techniques can be based on probability;
    different statistical models are used to ensure no correlation between the points
    chosen for the sample. Alternatively, it could be extracted based on the analyst’s
    judgment [20]. Three solutions implemented data sampling techniques before the
    data quality assessment process: Taleb et al. [127, 128] used the Bag of Little
    Boostrap sampling algorithm to create a data sample that combines the results
    of bootstrapping multiple small subsets of a big dataset. In contrast, Ardagna
    et al. [7] implemented the Simple Random Sampling algorithm, where tuples are
    selected randomly, with an equal probability of being included in the sample.
    It is worth mentioning that choosing a big data sampling algorithm highly affects
    the data analysis and quality assessment process; the generated sample should
    be unbiased and representative of the original data, which is rarely guaranteed
    by Simple Random Sampling. In addition, the sampling algorithm must be easily
    parallelizable to be implemented in a parallel or distributed computing environment.
    Other optimized sampling methods for big data were proposed in the literature
    [29, 61, 86, 117]. Still, data sampling is a challenging topic in the domain of
    big data [103]. Using MapReduce-like paradigm. MapReduce is a parallel programming
    model presented by Google [36]. The MapReduce framework has attracted significant
    attention across a wide range of areas. It is considered a practical model for
    data-focused applications because of its basic programming interface, high elasticity,
    and resilience to defects. Additionally, it is well suited for preparing large
    data volumes in distributed computing environments. MapReduce has proven helpful
    in many different areas [42]. The accelerated growth in data size requires horizontal
    scaling, which is the ability to extend the data over additional servers [99].
    The support of a MapReduce-like paradigm allows the solution to handle streams
    and massive volumes of data by distributing tasks over multiple nodes [127], which
    meets the data scalability requirement. Currently, several distributed processing
    technologies with good stability are used. We can name, for example, Apache Spark10
    [54, 136] and Apache Storm11 [70, 123], among many others. Besides its stability,
    selecting the distributed processing technology depends on other factors, such
    as its ability to handle data at rest or data in motion. For example, the Hadoop
    MapReduce solution proposed by Taleb et al. [127] was used to assess the quality
    of data at rest, while the Apache Spark-based solution used by Gu et al. [54]
    and Ardagna et al. [7] was used to assess data quality for streaming data and
    data at rest. Cloud-based infrastructure. Big data is often collected by cloud-based
    applications [120]. A cloud-based infrastructure guarantees higher scalability
    of the solution. It enables adding storage and processing units when and as needed
    [115]. Due to its scalable nature, the cloud infrastructure is a good match for
    MapReduce processing paradigms; Ardagna et al. [7] created a data quality service
    that relies on Apache Spark cluster and deployed it on the Microsoft Azure cloud.
    Moreover, the Anything-as-a-Service (XaaS) model allowed providing a complete
    big data ecosystem as an on-demand service [126]. Still, managing and securing
    data on the cloud is an open challenge [80]. Metadata repository. As used in Reference
    [128], this repository is used to store all metadata extracted from schemaless
    datasets such as data structure [83, 142], recognized entities, context information
    [51, 125]. This metadata can be used in future operations to decrease redundancy
    while handling the same data sources. For example, in the case of handling data
    that is ingested continuously from wireless sensors, there is no need to extract
    the data structure for the data generated by the same sensors each time a quality
    assessment operation is needed; the structure will be retrieved directly from
    the metadata repository. Data quality repository. This repository is used to store
    the data quality score for each data source [43, 44, 45]; it is used to compute
    the data source reputation and prevent the execution of the quality evaluation
    process for data sources with a low reputation. A profile must be created for
    each data source where a history of data profiling and quality assessment results
    are stored. This will also allow performing incremental profiling and assessment
    operations [119] over continuously growing data sources (i.e., data ingested from
    sensors) rather than reading the whole data each time. This repository could be
    combined with the metadata repository proposed by Ardagna et al. [7], where data
    profiling and quality assessment results are stored to support any further data
    quality assessment task. Physical resources analysis. As we discussed the CCT
    model proposed in Reference [7], selecting predefined scenarios could be harmful,
    since the user selection may require an unavailable amount of system resources
    to perform the quality assessment operation. In contrast, a context-aware framework
    would scan the available system resources and estimate the needed time to assess
    the data quality for the input dataset. In addition, such a framework can also
    recommend an acceptable sampling ratio for optimal resource utilization and time-saving.
    We should note that although Helfert et al. [62] considered the information system
    environment as a part of the data context, they only considered the solution architecture
    and the data domain and ignored the available system resources. Data profiling.
    The data profiling service performs the exploratory data analysis to extract summaries
    that can be used in quality assessment operations, such as minimums, maximums,
    counts, averages, distinct values count, and null values percentages. The data
    profiling operations are essential to extract context information from the data,
    such as the data types, formats, and dates range. Metrics such as Null Values
    percentage are also essential to calculate quality dimensions such as Completeness.
    A critical concern about big data profiling is whether this operation should be
    executed before the data sampling task proposed by Ardagna et al. [7] or after
    data sampling as proposed by Taleb et al. [128]. After investigating the literature,
    we came up with a conclusion that two data profiling operations should be performed:
    A data profiling should retrieve the information needed to perform data sampling,
    such as the data size, lines/words count, and data format (media files, text files,
    tabular data). After the data sampling phase, data profiling should extract all
    information needed for the data quality assessment, since it is meaningless and
    resource-intensive to extract information from the initial data that is excluded
    from the quality assessment task. Several data profiling techniques were proposed
    in the domain of big data [2, 33, 91]. Still, data heterogeneity is an open challenge
    for data profiling techniques [1]. Automating data quality dimensions prioritization.
    As stated in Reference [62], using a systematic approach to prioritize data quality
    dimensions based on user needs and context is the key to building a context-aware
    solution. This is essential, since the data quality characteristics importance
    often changes based on the data context information and the user needs. The quality
    characteristics (dimensions) should be weighed automatically without user intervention.
    This step should be performed automatically after gathering all context information.
    This can be done using a knowledge database [98], machine learning techniques,
    or using a systematic approach [62]. ISO standards. Using ISO standards improves
    the compliance of our solution with universal standards and helps solve the plethora
    of data quality dimensions’ definitions found in the literature (Table 4). In
    fact, ISO standards are not just helpful regarding the data quality characteristics
    (dimensions) definitions [73]. Still, they also provide the metrics used to measure
    data quality as well as the measurement methods [75, 78] and functions [74]. While
    the ISO/IEC 25012 [72] standard does not support quality dimensions related to
    the big data domain, more guidance regarding the design, development, and management
    of big data applications are provided in ISO/IEC 20547 [76] standard. This standard
    is considered a big data reference architecture that illustrates the various big
    data components, processes, and systems in the context of an overall big data
    conceptual model. It also specifies the security and privacy aspects applicable
    to the big data reference architecture, including the big data roles, activities,
    and functional components. Also, it provides guidance on security and privacy
    operations for big data. Regarding data analytics and machine learning solution,
    ISO/IEC AWI 5259 [77], a new universal standard that describes the data quality
    measures, process, management requirements, and governance, is currently under
    development. Domain knowledge repositories. These repositories contain all business
    rules and organizational policies that are required in a specific domain [25].
    Rules and policies must be defined by domain experts and organization managers
    [98]. For example, data reputation is critical while handling social media feeds,
    while it is less important in other domains. Using these repositories will prevent
    users/developers from hard-coding business rules each time. A domain knowledge
    database can be created as an ontology [22, 98, 137], a database [10], or a knowledge
    graph [63]. Knowledge extraction techniques. As described in References [125,
    128], a set of techniques is used to extract metadata, hidden patterns, and context
    information from the data sources once needed, especially when handling unstructured
    data such as text or media files. As mentioned by Taleb et al. [128], the knowledge
    extraction techniques can be categorized into four categories based on the data
    source format (Table 5). Table 5. Data format Knowledge extraction technique Text
    Text mining, entity extraction Media files Features extraction: file metadata,
    extracting media characteristics Social media Sentiment analysis, opinion analysis,
    recommendation analysis Show More Table 5. Knowledge Extraction Techniques Based
    on the Data Format Context and quality rules abstraction. As defined in References
    [16, 17, 18, 19, 107, 108], using an object-oriented approach (data object class)
    to express data and context quality requirements will minimize the lines of code
    needed and allow the solution to be implemented easily within different contexts.
    Moreover, having a unified form to express data context and quality rules will
    help make the solution implementable in different contexts. Reference dataset
    election. Even though a reference dataset election may not be easily applicable,
    nor recommended when assessing the quality of critical data such as radiation
    pollution sensors feed [48, 49], it may still be recommended in certain cases.
    For example, References [101, 102, 131] stated that electing a reference dataset
    from the organization data lake could be helpful in case a reference dataset is
    required in the quality assessment process. A reference dataset and domain knowledge
    does not exist, and no other choices are available. This could be, for example,
    acceptable when analyzing a firm’s demographic and employment information as applied
    by Mylavarapu et al. [101]. Several string matching [64], schema matching [13,
    110, 121], and MapReduce-based data fusion solutions [39] were proposed in the
    literature and can be used when electing a reference dataset from a data lake.
    Still, this domain is considered an open challenge [81]. Skip 6DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT
    ARCHITECTURE – A PROPOSAL FOR A METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK Section 6 DATA QUALITY
    ASSESSMENT ARCHITECTURE – A PROPOSAL FOR A METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK In this section,
    we propose a high-level methodological framework for a context-aware big data
    quality assessment solution covering all these essential properties and supporting
    all the above-detailed recommendations (Figure 2). The proposed architecture follows
    a Microservice-oriented paradigm, where each component is composed of one or multiple
    independent modules. The data quality assessment is done in six phases: (1) initial
    configuration, (2) source analysis, (3) data profiling and sampling, (4) metadata
    extraction, (5) context information gathering, and (6) quality evaluation. Fig.
    2. Fig. 2. Methodological framework architecture. 6.1 Initial Configuration Before
    starting the quality assessment process, several configurations must be done by
    the user: Sampling ratio: Users must define the data sampling ratio to apply within
    the data sampling method. Choosing the sampling ratio is critical, since it will
    impact the quality assessment confidence level (for example, if a sampling ratio
    is set to 70%, then the quality assessment score has a confidence level of 70%,
    since it was performed over 70% of the data). The sampling ratio will also determine
    the amount of data to be processed, affecting the resources and time needed to
    process the data. Maximum amount of allowed resources: Users can define the maximum
    amount of resources (processing nodes, memory utilization) to be used while processing
    the data. Specifying a maximum amount of resources will prevent the system from
    failing or getting out of memory. It will also be used to check if the available
    resources can meet the quality measurement requirements; if not, then the user
    will be asked to change the data sampling ratio. All these configurations are
    saved within a configuration file to prevent users from repeating the configuration
    and to automate the data quality assessment operation. Configurations can be assigned
    to a specific dataset or even set as default, regardless of the data source. 6.2
    Source Analyzer The Source Analyzer is a service that aims to: (1) Recognize the
    data type (structured, semi-structured, unstructured). (2) Select the most feasible
    data sampling method among several predefined methods based on the data type,
    available resources, and sampling ratio. (3) Perform a primary data profiling
    operation over the dataset to retrieve the information needed to perform data
    sampling, such as the data size, lines/words count, and data format (media files,
    text files, tabular data). (4) Select the most feasible data profiling method
    among several predefined methods based on the data type, available resources,
    and data sample size. After performing all these operations, the results are sent
    to the Data Profiling and Sampling component. 6.3 Data Profiling and Sampling
    This component comprises two services: (1) The Data Sampling Service and (2) the
    Data Profiling Service. First, the Data Sampling Service receives the data sampling
    ratio and the selected data sampling method from the Source Analyzer service.
    Then, it performs the data sampling operation. Data Sampling is performed to decrease
    computational expenses and help investigate a subset instead of the whole set.
    After data sampling is complete, the Data Profiling Service receives the selected
    data profiling method from the Source Analyzer and the data sample generated from
    the Data Sampling Service. Then, data profiling is performed over the data sample.
    The data profiling service performs the exploratory data analysis to extract summaries
    that can be used in quality assessment operations, such as minimums, maximums,
    counts, averages, distinct values count, and null values percentages. 6.4 Metadata
    Extraction After the data profiling and sampling phase, if the data is schema-less
    (unstructured), then the Knowledge Extraction Service provides a set of techniques
    to extract metadata from the data sources. The needed techniques are selected
    based on the data format as defined in Table 5. This metadata is stored within
    a repository to avoid repeating knowledge extraction operations on the same dataset
    and to be used for further analysis. In addition to analyzing unstructured data,
    the Knowledge Extraction Service uses several techniques such as Named Entity
    Recognition (NER) [51, 125] to extract the included entities and the data domain.
    6.5 Gathering Context Information After performing the data sampling, profiling,
    and metadata extraction, information is sent to the Context Analyzer Service to
    gather all information related to the data context. To define the data context,
    the Context Analyzer Service needs the following information: Metadata: All metadata
    gathered by the Source Analyzer service, Data Profiling Service, and the Knowledge
    Extraction Service such as the data type, format, data domain, and entities (i.e.,
    persons, organizations, places). Organizational policies: A set of business rules
    defined by the organization regarding the data. As an example, an organization
    can reject data from a specific date range. Domain-specific rules: Based on the
    suggested domain by the Knowledge Extraction Service, the Context Analyzer will
    gather all related rules from a domain knowledge repository (described in Section
    5.2). Available system resources: The available physical resources (machines,
    cores, memory, storage) in the information system besides the related configuration
    defined in the initial configuration. Quality characteristics: The ISO data quality
    standards are aligned with the domain knowledge database and gathered business
    rules to determine quality dimensions and metrics. After gathering all needed
    context information, the Context Analyzer Service generates a list of data quality
    characteristics and their measurement functions using a markup language such as
    XML or YAML and sends them to the Quality Evaluation component after assessing
    the available resources. Available resources analysis. The Context Analyzer Service
    should verify if the available physical resources are sufficient to handle the
    sampled data size in an acceptable time. If there are insufficient resources,
    then the users should be notified to change the data sampling ratio and the maximum
    amount of resources to be more relevant before assessing the data quality. If
    there are insufficient resources, then the data quality service will still use
    the results of the data sampling, profiling, and knowledge extraction operations,
    if possible, to prevent repeating redundant operations. For example, suppose the
    user can increase the maximum number of allowed resources without changing the
    sampling ratio. In that case, the data quality service can reuse the previously
    stored results besides the existing data sample to prevent repeating the data
    preparation operations (profiling, sampling...) and decrease the processing time.
    6.6 Quality Evaluation After receiving the data context details, the data quality
    characteristics should be prioritized using a systematic approach [62] based on
    the context requirements; the quality characteristics prioritization information
    is stored within the domain knowledge database. The service should then check
    the possible data quality measurements that can be performed on the data; for
    example, uniqueness is not measurable while handling texts. If the data quality
    measures require reference data, then the quality evaluation service checks if
    it already exists for this data source. If not, then a reference data election
    is run using schema matching and machine learning techniques [13, 39, 110, 121]
    to select the most appropriate dataset from the organizational data lake as described
    in References [101, 102, 131]. After identifying the measurable quality characteristics,
    the data quality service should convert the measurement function sent by the Context
    Analyzer Service into an executable code by following the quality measurement
    methods described in ISO/IEC 15939 [75] and ISO/IEC 25000 [73] standards. The
    result is stored within a repository that can be used to calculate aggregates
    of the measured values in further analysis once needed. Finally, the data quality
    score is calculated based on the quality characteristics priority measured before,
    and a user-friendly quality report is generated. 6.7 Mapping the Methodological
    Framework to ISO/IEC 20547 Big Data Reference Architecture The ISO/IEC 20547 [76]
    series is intended to provide users with a standardized approach to developing
    and implementing big data architectures. This standard provides an architecture
    framework for describing the big data components, processes, and systems to establish
    a common language for the various stakeholders named big data reference architecture
    (BDRA). As illustrated in Figure 3, we show how the components of the proposed
    methodological framework can be seamlessly mapped to the big data reference architecture
    components provided by ISO/IEC 20547 standard: Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Methodological
    framework components mapped to the ISO/IEC 20547 big data reference architecture.
    The end-user is mapped to the big data consumer role. The components used to store
    the information are mapped to the big data platform layer. The components used
    to perform all operations needed to assess the data quality are mapped to the
    data preparation component in the big data application layer. The generated data
    quality report is mapped to the data visualization component in the big data application
    layer. Skip 7OPEN CHALLENGES Section 7 OPEN CHALLENGES This section will summarize
    the challenges we identified while reviewing the literature on building context-aware
    big data quality assessment solutions. Abstraction and standardization Implementing
    data quality operations within different contexts increases the need to have a
    unified definition of the data quality dimensions and the primitives that will
    be used in designing big data quality measuring applications. Several declarative
    solutions are found in the literature [85, 119], providing a good level of abstraction.
    Still, every solution relies on its own definition of the data quality characteristics
    and metrics, increasing the need to adopt universal standards such as ISO/IEC
    25000 [73], ISO/IEC 15939 [75], and ISO/IEC 20547 [76]. Big data management In
    big data management, challenges relate to those an organization faces regarding
    data privacy, security, integration, ingestion, and governance [104]. Furthermore,
    they might be caused by the lack of qualified professionals knowledgeable about
    the latest tools and techniques for dealing with each data phase [116]. Big data
    sampling The data sampling output affects the accuracy of all other operations,
    i.e., the data profiling task can be costly for large datasets. Obtaining effective
    results using sampling depends on the data sampling criteria used [57]. Data sampling
    is essential for big data profiling to reduce the computational pressure and speed
    up the process of data profiling [91]. Several optimized sampling methods for
    big data were proposed in the literature [29, 61, 86, 117]. Still, data sampling
    is a challenging topic in the domain of big data [103], especially when analyzing
    unstructured data [91] or when training a machine learning model. For example,
    several real-world applications that use machine learning face numerous challenges
    due to imbalances in datasets that occur when the sample size and distribution
    are inaccurate [88]. Big data profiling Data profiling operations are essential
    for data quality control, because they are needed to verify and review different
    data types. This domain has become increasingly important in the field of big
    data. As within huge data silos, if a dataset metadata is not present, then this
    data becomes invisible [4]. Several data profiling techniques were proposed in
    the domain of big data [2, 33, 91]. Still, data heterogeneity is an open challenge
    for data profiling techniques [1]. Cloud-based infrastructure challenges Even
    if the cloud-based infrastructure scalability is feasible for big data solutions,
    there are still several challenges that face cloud-based solutions [59, 80]. Data
    security and privacy can be considered the main challenges due to the increased
    risk of data theft [84, 95]. Managing the tradeoff between scalability and cost
    is yet another critical challenge to address [12]. Physical resources analysis
    Estimating the performance and required resources of a data processing task executed
    using distributed technologies in a cloud environment is increasingly important
    because of its influence on development time and resource management. However,
    estimating the performance concerning parallel processes is complex for iterative,
    multi-stage applications [14]. Several statistical models were proposed to calculate
    the estimated time based on variables such as the dataset, available resources,
    and processes [15, 79, 132]. Still, these models are not validated over distributed
    tasks performed by large-scale applications. Reference data Contextual data quality
    measurement often requires a reference dataset while measuring several dimensions,
    such as accuracy and consistency. Several solutions were provided to elect a reference
    dataset from the organizational data lake if not present [101, 102, 131]. Still,
    there is no guarantee that the data lake contains an accurate reference set. Skip
    8CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Section 8 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Data quality
    is critical, since poor quality can lead to bad decisions. While assessing data
    quality has reached a high level of maturity in traditional data technologies,
    it is still very challenging in big data. In this article, we explained what makes
    big data quality assessment different. And knowing that data quality is context-dependent,
    we also investigated the quality models and techniques used to achieve context
    awareness in the big data era. The results showed that none of the existing data
    quality assessment solutions could achieve context awareness while handling big
    data, thus, we provided several recommendations for building a context-aware big
    data quality assessment solution. Moreover, we compiled those recommendations
    into a methodological framework that could address the limitations of existing
    solutions. We also identified several open challenges to be addressed when building
    such a solution. A list of tasks is lined up to be done in the future. We must
    delve into the components of the methodological framework to select the most suitable
    methods and technologies at each layer (data profiling, knowledge extraction,
    quality evaluation) and address the open challenges we previously identified.
    We should start validating the design by implementing and testing it on various
    big data sets in different scenarios and contexts. In addition, we are looking
    to improve our methodological framework by considering the machine learning techniques
    that may be applied at certain levels in the quality assessment process. Footnotes

  explanation: The key focus of the paper is on data quality awareness in the context
    of association rule mining. The study emphasizes the need to consider data quality
    attributes when evaluating the quality of association rules to ensure that discovered
    knowledge is reliable and meaningful. The authors propose a cost-based probabilistic
    model for selecting genuinely interesting rules by considering data quality indicators
    such as data freshness, accuracy, and completeness. This approach aims to mitigate
    the negative impact of low-quality data on the discovery of association rules.

    evaluated by interestingness measures (commonly support and confidence) with the
    purpose of supplying indicators to the user in the understanding and use of the
    new discovered knowledge."'

    discovered association rules, and one might legitimately wonder if a so-called

    not up-to-date anymore, 20% of the RHS data are not accurate, and 15% of the LHS
    data come from a data source that is well-known for its bad credibility."'

    rules is commonly evaluated by interestingness measures (commonly support and
    confidence) with the purpose of supplying indicators to the user in the understanding
    and use of the new discovered knowledge. Low-quality datasets have a very bad
    impact over the quality of the discovered association rules, and one might legitimately
    wonder if a so-called “interesting” rule noted LHS→ RHS is meaningful when 30%
    of the LHS data are not up-to-date anymore, 20% of the RHS data are not accurate,
    and 15% of the LHS data come from a data source that is well-known for its bad
    credibility. This paper presents an overview of data quality characterization
    and management techniques that can be advantageously employed for improving the
    quality awareness of the knowledge discovery and data mining processes. We propose
    to integrate data quality indicators for quality aware association rule mining.
    We propose a cost-based probabilistic model for selecting legitimately interesting
    rules. Experiments on the challenging KDD-Cup-98 datasets show that variations
    on data quality have a great impact on the cost and quality of discovered association
    rules and confirm our approach for the integrated management of data quality indicators
    into the KDD process that ensure the quality of data mining results. Article PDF

    This study aims to investigate adaptive data preprocessing methods for handling
    varying data quality and formats from heterogeneous data sources in automated,
    real-time irrigation management systems. Specifically, it focuses on techniques
    like data normalization, feature scaling, and data fusion using Dempster-Shafer
    theory and Bayesian inference.


    **Relevance to Outline Point:**


    This study aligns with the outline point regarding the need for robust and efficient
    data preprocessing methods to handle diverse data sources and ensure data quality
    in automated irrigation systems. By exploring adaptive methods, the study contributes
    to improving the accuracy and reliability of irrigation decision-making based
    on heterogeneous data streams.'

    Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: The Algerian economy is
    currently experiencing a significant deterioration because of its dependence on
    oil revenues, which drops in prices recently. Therefore, it is necessary to revive
    the Algerian economy with other important sectors, mainly agricultural sector
    especially in the south of Algeria. The southern Algeria Contain all necessary
    conditions for agriculture, which are the large agricultural areas, water resources
    and good illumination (sunlight).The mismanagement of irrigation water affects
    negatively the agricultural production of Algeria because of the shortage of irrigation
    water. Thus, with the benefit of the Internet of Things and the smart technologies,

    IEEE Conference Location: Luton, UK SECTION I. Introduction Recently, the Algerian
    economy starts to decline due to the drop in oil prices. The decline in oil prices
    shows the dependence and vulnerability of a system built on the only resource
    of the hydrocarbon sector. In this case, it is urgent to develop other sectors
    of the economy to reduce the dependence on hydrocarbons. Agriculture is a strategic
    and important sector for economic development, especially in southern Algeria.
    This Saharan and semi-arid region has all conditions required for agriculture;
    there are wide agricultural surfaces, sun light and large water resources. Agricultural
    production, including livestock production, consumes more fresh water than any
    other activity in the world. Agricultural irrigation accounts for 85% of the consumed
    fresh water over the planet, and this percentage will continue to be dominant
    in water consumption due to population growth and the increasing of demand for
    food [1]. In general, poor irrigation management affects agricultural production,
    for this purpose it is necessary to develop strategies to optimize irrigation.
    An automated irrigation system is designed to monitor and control the various
    factors derived from an agricultural field such as humidity, water level, temperature,
    and human interaction. This system is generally composed of controllers and a
    wireless sensor network using ZigBee as the transmission technology for detecting
    values of an agricultural field. The sensors gather the various agricultural factors
    in real time and transmit them using Internet of Thing (IoT) applications [2].
    The control architecture of smart agriculture based on cloud computing and IOT
    is presented in [3]. The integration of modern technology in irrigation management
    system is one of the ways to improve the irrigation processes to optimize the
    use of water, electricity consumption and labor costs. In this regard, with the
    new technology and the development of the Internet and the Internet of Things,
    we will propose in this paper a strategy for smart irrigation in southern Algeria
    regions based on the use of the Internet of Things and new communication technologies.
    In this paper, this new scheme proposed for intelligent irrigation using IoT is
    an extension of our already attendant solution [4]. This new mechanism allows
    the farmer to monitor and manage agricultural area using smart phones via Internet.
    The rest of paper is organized as follow: in section 2 we will present generality
    about basic notions of Internet of Things, the section 3 presents current state
    of information and communication technology (ICT) in Algeria, our proposed approach
    will be presented in section 4 and finally, a conclusion and proposed perspectives
    of this work will be presented in section 5. SECTION II. Generality A. Internet
    of Things (IoT) The term “Internet of Things” was first used by the Massachusetts
    Institute of Technology in the year 1999[5]. There are several definitions of
    the Internet of Things. Definitions focus on technical aspects of IoT when the
    other based on the applications and functionalities. Some definition defined IoT
    as “an extension of the current Internet to all objects that can communicate directly
    or indirectly with electronic equipment and connected to the Internet”[6]. Other
    defied as “a novel paradigm that is rapidly gaining ground in the scenario of
    modern wireless telecommunications. The basic idea of this concept is the pervasive
    presence around us of a variety of things or objects - such as Radio-Frequency
    IDentification (RFID) tags, sensors, actuators, mobile phones, etc. - which, through
    unique addressing schemes, are able to interact with each other and cooperate
    with their neighbors to reach common goals”[7]. B. The Application Domains of
    IoT According to the definition of IoT, this technology can be applied in all
    domains possible but in reality IoT applied in specific domains. We categorize
    this application into four application domains: 1) Daily Life A Smartphone become
    a necessity in our life, several application for Apple iOS, Google Android and
    Windows Phone operating can be used for interfacing sensors measuring various
    parameters, which implies that facilitate the use of the concept of IoT in our
    daily life [8]. The use of IOT in daily live appear in several application such
    as control of home equipment such as air conditioners, refrigerators, washing
    machines, etc [8]. Sensors and actuators distributed in houses and offices can
    make our life more comfortable in several aspects, and domestic incidents can
    be avoided with appropriate monitoring and alarm systems, etc. [7]. Other application
    necessary of IoT like for losses, IoT can be helped to find objects that we don''t
    remember where have been left. Or in thefts an application similar to the previous
    one may leave the user to know if some objects are moved from a restricted area
    which would indicate that the object is being stolen [7]. 2) Transportation and
    Mobility Transport domain is one of most important domains, and one of the most
    complicated domains. Urban traffic is the main contributor to traffic noise pollution
    and a major contributor to urban air quality degradation and greenhouse gas emissions.
    Traffic congestion directly imposes significant costs on economic and social activities
    in most cities [8]. Advanced cars, trains, buses as well as bicycles along with
    roads and/or rails are becoming more instrumented with sensors, actuators, and
    processing power. Roads themselves are also equipped with tags and sensors that
    send important information to traffic control sites to better route the traffic,
    provide the tourist with appropriate transportation information. In this domain
    exist several applications such us assisted driving offer collision avoidance
    systems and monitoring of transportation of hazardous materials, or mobile ticketing
    and augmented maps [7]. 3) Work Environment In this domain they are several uses
    of IoT such us Industrial plants, enterprise, logistics, etc. Sensors have always
    been a part of the factory setup for security, automation, climate control, etc.
    Which ultimately will be replaced by a wireless system giving the opportunity
    to make changes to the configuration whenever necessary? It is nothing but a subnet
    IoT dedicated to the maintenance of the plant [8]. In industrial plants, IoT also
    contribute to improving the automation of industrial plants with a massive deployment
    of RFID tags associated with production parts. An event is generated by the reader
    with all the necessary data, such as RFID number, and stored on the network. The
    machine / robot is notified by the event and picks up part of the production [7].
    Logistics is a work domain but also attached to the transport domain including
    the management of transport offers good logistics management. With the application
    of IoT can improve these domains to offers the best customer services. 4) Others
    Utilities Other domains are necessary need the IoT as a Healthcare domain, military
    and smart environment, etc. In the military domain smart objects can protect the
    lives of people. In another side many benefits of IoT technologies in healthcare
    and resulting applications can be grouped essentially of: tracking objects and
    people, the identification and authentication of people, automatic data collection
    and sensing of sickness [7]. One of the major IoT application areas that are already
    drawing attention is Smart Environment IoT. There are several test beds being
    implemented and many more planned in the coming years. Other use of the IoT is
    Smart museum and gym and Monitoring environmental parameters. Smart museum and
    gym as to smart leisure environments, the museum and the gym are two representative
    examples where the IoT technologies can help in exploiting their facilities at
    the best. Monitoring environmental parameters perishable goods such as fruits,
    fresh-cut produce, meat, and dairy products are vital parts of our nutrition.
    From the production to the consumption sites thousands of kilometers or even more
    are covered and during the transportation the conservation status need to be monitored
    to avoid uncertainty in quality levels for distribution decisions. Pervasive computing
    and sensor technologies offer great potential for improving the efficiency of
    the food supply chain [3]. C. The Protocols Layer of the IoT Protocols layer of
    the IoT consists of 4 main layers: a) Physical and Data Link Layers The most common
    physical layer protocols used (10,100, 1G) WiFi (802.11b, g, n), GSM, 3G, LTE,
    4G, IEEE 802.15.4, PLC, etc. b) Network Layer The protocols of this layer are
    IPv6, RPL. • Routing Protocol for Low and Lossy Networks (RPL) The Internet Engineering
    Task Force (IETF) formed a new Working Group called ROLL (Routing Over Low-power
    and Lossy networks) in 2008[6] which was defined a new protocol RPL to solve de
    problem of Low power and Lossy Networks (LLN). Algorithmic and protocolary foundations
    of RPL described in RFC 6550[10]. RPL was developed from four sets of requirements
    that represent the four main foreseen uses of WSN: Home Automation, Building Automation,
    Industrial and Urban environments [15]. RPL is a Distance Vector IPv6 routing
    protocol for LLNs that specifies how to build a Destination Oriented Directed
    Acyclic Graph (DoDAG) using an objective function and a set of metrics/constraints
    [9]. The objective functions to adapt the generic behavior to a particular environment
    and specify more precisely the rules of construction of DoDAG [11]. RPL is based
    on the topological concept of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). The DAG defines
    a tree-like structure that specifies the default routes between nodes in the LLN.
    However, a DAG structure is more than a typical tree in the sense that a node
    might associate to multiple parent nodes in the DAG, in contrast to classical
    trees where only one parent is allowed. More specifically, RPL organizes nodes
    as Destination-Oriented DAGs (DODAGs), where most popular destination nodes (i.e.
    sinks) or those providing a default route to the Internet (i.e. gateways) act
    as the roots of the DAGs. A network may consist of one or several DODAGs, which
    form together an RPL instance identified by a unique ID, called RPLInstanceID.
    RPL defines three types of nodes: Low Power and Lossy Border Routers (LBRs): it
    refers to the root of a DODAG that represents a collection point in the network
    and has the ability to construct a DAG. The LBR also acts as a gateway (or edge
    router) between the Internet and the LLN. Router: it refers to a device that can
    forward and generate traffic. Such a router does not have the ability to create
    a new DAG, but associate to an existing one. Host: it refers to an end-device
    that is capable of generating data traffic, but is not able to forward traffic
    [14]. c) Transport Layer There are two protocols: TCP, UDP. d) Application Layer
    There are several protocols in this layer but the most important protocols are:
    HTTP (TCP), CoAP (UDP). Appear of IoT and the limits of IP architecture obliged
    to define new protocols and an adaptive layer. • Constrained Application Protocol
    CoAP The IETF Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is an application-layer
    protocol designed to provide a REST-like interface [16]. The CoAP protocol can
    remove HTTP limitations constrained environment while ensuring high compatibility
    with existing. It is relatively easy to turn HTTP requests in CoAP queries. A
    old device connected to an IPv4 network may well request access to a resource
    on a connected server to an IPv6 network and gateway translates between the two
    worlds [11]. Thus the side of a sensor network, we can use the protocol stack
    CoAP / UDP / 6LoWPAN for IPv6 auto configuration properties and the small size
    of the battery, and it will keep the Internet side HTTP stack / TCP / IPv4 which
    is present on all devices. If, for example, an iPhone wants to know the temperature
    measured by a sensor, it will send its HTTP request, it will be transformed into
    CoAP by a bridge, and the answer may be stored for a period specified by the sensor
    in the gateway. If another device on the Internet requires the same value during
    this time interval, it will not be necessary to propagate the query to the sensor
    [11]. • CoAP vs HTTP CoAP is network-oriented protocol, using similar features
    to HTTP but also allows for low overhead, multicast, etc. As HTTP protocol is
    a long-term successful standard, it can use small script to integrate various
    resources and services. Interoperation provided by HTTP is the key point of IoT,
    for this, http is employed in application level. However, HTTP is based on TCP
    protocol using point to point (p2p) communication model that not suitable for
    notification push services. Also, for constrained devices, HTTP is too complex.
    Unlike HTTP based protocols, CoAP operates over UDP instead of using complex congestion
    control as in TCP [12]. CoAP is based on REST architecture, which is a general
    design for accessing Internet resources. In order to overcome disadvantage in
    constrained resource, CoAP need to optimize the length of datagram and provide
    reliable communication. On one side, CoAP provides URI, REST method such as GET,
    POST, PUT, and DELETE. On the other side, based on lightweight UDP protocol, CoAP
    allows IP multicast, which satisfies group communication for IoT. To compensate
    for the unreliability of UDP protocol, CoAP defines a retransmission mechanism
    and provides resource discovery mechanism with resource description [13]. e) A
    Version of IPv6 Adapted to Constrained Networks 6LoWPAN In 2005, the IETF chartered
    the IPv6 over Low Power, Wireless Networks (6LoWPAN) working group to standardize
    adaptations oflPv6 over mesh networks composed of low-power, wireless links [9].
    The difference in size of the package IPv6 and datagram of IEEE 802.15.4 obliged
    6LoWPAN group to define encapsulation and header compression mechanisms that allow
    IPv6 packets to be sent to and received from over IEEE 802.15.4 based networks.
    SECTION III. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in Algeria Algeria
    wants to position itself as one of the strongholds of the wireless Internet in
    the Maghreb. The development of Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity), WiMax (Worldwide Interoperability
    for Microwave Access) is a wireless data transmission standard, with a theoretical
    speed of 70 megabits per second, the equivalent of hundreds of ADSL (Asymmetric
    Digital Subscriber Line) connections with range of 50 kilometers. This wireless
    radio technology that aims to connect any wireless equipment: access points Wi-Fi,
    IP phone, mobile phone. The commercialization of wireless telephony in fixed mode
    (4G LTE) has just started through all the capitals of the 48 provinces of the
    country with a gradual roll in each province. This new generation of wireless
    technology used in the majority of developed countries to provid users a remote
    and speed access to the Internet that not depend on fixed phone lines as ADSL
    and with a higher performance, as the incumbent Algeria Telecom has launched this
    technology. Choosing the 4G LTE was motivated to its flexibility, easy to deploy
    and competitiveness. SECTION IV. Our Approach A. The System Design The communications
    technologies in the Internet of Things is developing rapidly in recent years so
    it can meet the demands of the connections between the physical world “things”
    and “human”. Thus, the use of smartphones helps to handle remote objects via Internet.
    Our approach proposed in this paper is mainly based on our system for irrigation
    shown in [4]. The difference is that here we have used the technologies of the
    Internet of things for smart irrigation management in southern Algeria via the
    Internet, and using smart phones. As shown in figure 1, this system consists of:
    wireless sensor network system, the 6LoWPAN smart gateway that connects the Zigbee
    network with the internet via mobile communication network (4G LTE). The sensors
    placed in the agricultural field, measure continuously the soil moisture values,
    the water tank level and the water well level, then send these values through
    a ZigBee mesh network to a smart gateway (Generic IoT Border Router Wireless Br
    1000), those information are then sent via a mobile data communication 4G LTE
    network to a web service that uses intelligent software application to automatically
    analyze the data and act according to the obtained results, by selective activation
    of controllers as needed. The routing protocol used in this proposed design is
    the RPL protocol. The outputs results and irrigation recommendations are presented
    to the user on a smart phone web application using CoAP or HTTPs interfaces. Our
    system focuses on the following performance objectives to ensure its widespread
    adoption by farmers: The system is easy to deploy, to use, and facilitates planning
    of irrigation tasks. The system is modular and flexible, making it easy to maintain
    The system design is robust and reliable. Fig. 1. The system design. Show All
    The Smart gateway connects the two parts of our system (the first part: the wireless
    sensor networks and controllers, the second parts: is the internet and smartphones),
    it is the 6LoWPAN Border Router translates between the two standardized protocol
    stacks. In addition it is an application level gateway for other IoT protocols
    such as Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread, and ZigBee. WLAN or LTE may be used for
    the uplink to the Internet [17]. B. Communication in Our System The network of
    our system consists of several tiny devices (sensors, microcontrollers, smart
    gateway) that communicate with themselves via a Low and Lossy networks (LLNs),
    using the routing protocol dedicated to this type of network called RPL (Routing
    protocol for Low and Lossy networks). This LLN network is connected to the internet
    by a smart 6lowpan gateway that represents the root of the RPL, as it shown in
    figure 2. The construction of DODAG involves two phases. Phase 1. Creating the
    up paths (from the root to the nodes): The smart gateway sends a DIO message (DAG
    Information Object) to its neighbors which are (coordinators nodes, sensors detection
    of the water level and the controller of the electric pump) for the construction
    of DODAG. Each one of these neighbors in turn send a DIO message to its neighbors
    in each irrigation area for the creation of the DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graph).
    Phase 2. Creating the down paths (from the nodes to the root): Each node in the
    network when receiving the DIO Message send a DAO message (Destination Advertisement
    Object) to its root for creating paths to the root and filling tables routing.
    The soil moisture sensors measure soil moisture, these values must be sent to
    the root nodes of sub-DAGs (coordinators nodes). Each soil moisture sensor sends
    the measured values to his favorite parent until the reception of these values
    by the coordinator node, this latter calculates the average of the received values
    and send them to the smart gateway. Fig. 2. The system communication. Show All
    The sensors detection of the water level measure the water level in the well and
    in the tank, also send these measured values to the smart gateway. The smart gateway
    sends the received values (soil moisture values and water level values) via a
    mobile communication network (4G LTE) to the farmer. The farmer can check the
    soil moisture values, and also water level in the tank and in the well with smart
    phone application that connect directly to the smart gateway using http or CoAP
    protocols. Therefore, the farmer may decide either the irrigation of dry areas
    or filling the tank by sending a response to the gateway, which represent an intermediate
    that send this response to the coordinator node in order to control the opening
    and closing of the solenoid valves or to electric pump controller in order to
    activate or deactivate the electric pump in the well according to the specific
    needs. In the case where the values of soil moisture or the values of the water
    level in the tank are critical which means that areas are dry or the water level
    in the tank is minimum, our system will automatically pass to standalone mode
    (our proposed system in [4]), which makes our system tolerant to faults. SECTION
    V. Simulation and Discussion of Result In order to validate the Performance of
    our approach by simulation, we use Cooja simulator provided by Contiki, which
    unlike most simulators also allows real hardware platforms to be emulated [18].
    This simulation is about how the network converged and stabilized using the RPL
    protocol and OFO implementation of ContikiRPL. The simulation scripts consists
    of RPL sender nodes and LLN Border Router (LBR) programs which are emulated as
    Tmote sky nodes and derived from Cooja and uIPv6 module including UDP, ICMPv6,
    IPv6, SICSLoWPAN and Rime of the Contiki kernel [19] [20]. With the help of the
    CollectView tool [21] provided by Cooja, the following metrics could be observed:
    The time taken to find the first source-destination pair in the whole network;
    The time taken for the network to fully converge when all nodes join the network
    tree; The time taken for the network to fully stabilize after convergence, the
    time taken for the Estimated Transmission Count (ETX) value for each node. As
    shown in figure 3, our network consists of 15 RPL nodes; deployed in an irrigation
    land which composed of 3 areas, where each area consist of 4 RPL sender nodes,
    and the RPL sender nodes in the tank and in the well, all these nodes are connected
    to The RPL border router, and this router is used in order to interface a regular
    IP network with an RPL 6LoWPAN network. Fig. 3. The network simulation in cooja.
    Show All Figures 4 and 5, presents the network tree and the communication between
    DAGs roots (node 2.2, node 3.3, node 4.4, node 5.5, node 6.6) and DODAG root (RPL
    border router node 1.1). Fig. 4. Communication between nodes. Show All Fig. 5.
    The network tree. Show All All data collected by the wireless sensor network are
    used by the system to handle an intelligent, automated irrigation of vegetation
    (by saving water and energy use) and can be accessed in real time via a web application
    in smartphones, which can also send alerts and commands when the ground is too
    dry or a lack of water in the basin and offer suggestions to maximize plant health.
    These first results obtained by simulation using the Cooja simulator are satisfactory,
    especially in routing information by RPL and COAP protocols. This will encourage
    us to go further towards creating a web application in smartphones to complete
    all the proposed system and facilitate the tasks of the farmers for a good monitoring
    of their agriculture. Also, we hope that this approach will be very beneficial
    if we can experiment it in the fields of agriculture especially in Saharan and
    arid areas such as the south of Algeria. SECTION VI. Conclusion The intelligent
    technologies play a very important role for an effective management of irrigation,
    we have proposed in this article a smart irrigation system for a Saharan area
    like the south of Algeria. This proposed system is based on ICT and IoT technologies.
    Using these technologies, the control of irrigation will be ensured at low cost
    and high accuracy. Our proposed system facilitates the irrigation tasks and optimizes
    the costs in term of minimizing the water consummation and reducing the cost of
    the working force. The validation of the proposed approach by simulation showed
    us the value and the importance of the adoption of WSN and IoT technologies in
    precision farming. As a perspective we plan to complete the implementation of
    our system using the CoAP protocol and web application for monitoring the irrigation
    via the internet using IoT, and also to apply this system in real world. Authors

    the goal of providing a unified and scalable framework for IoT data management.
    The third is to examine automation across the entire pipeline, from data collection
    and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action.

    \ challenges from a data \nmanagement perspective. In addition, IoT platform designers\
    \ are faced with another set of questions. How can platforms \nbe extended to\
    \ smoothly integrate new data management functionalities? Currently, data processing\
    \ related tasks are typi-\ncally realized by manually developed code and functions\
    \ which creates difficulties in maintenance and growth. Hence we \nneed to explore\
    \ other approaches to integration for IoT platforms. In this paper we cover both\
    \ these aspects: (1) we explore \nseveral emerging data management challenges,\
    \ and (2) we propose an IoT platform integration model that can combine \ndisparate\
    \ functionalities under one roof. For the first, we focus on the following challenges:\
    \ sensor data quality, privacy in \ndata streams, machine learning model management,\
    \ and resource-aware data management. For the second, we propose an \ninformation-integration\
    \ model for IoT platforms. The model revolves around the concept of a Data-Sharing\
    \ Market where \ndata management functionalities can share and exchange information\
    \ about their data with other functionalities. In addition, \ndata-sharing markets\
    \ themselves can be combined into networks of markets where information flows\
    \ from one market to \nanother, which creates a web of information exchange about\
    \ data resources. To motivate this work we present a use-case \napplication in\
    \ smart cities.\nKeywords Internet of Things · Infrastructure Design · Information\

    \ the Internet of Things has evolved from \na high-level vision of always-connected\
    \ devices to a real \ncyber-physical system class that appears in many applica-\n\
    tion domains, from healthcare Pike et al. (2019) over smart \ncities Zanella et al.\
    \ (2014) to smart farming and precision \nagriculture Kamilaris et al. (2016).\
    \ IoT has introduced radi-\ncal changes in the way data are processed. The amount\
    \ of \nIoT data, the velocity of change, and variety of sources/for-\nmats implies\
    \ new challenges to process and inter-operate \nbetween heterogeneous data sources\
    \ and formats Elsaleh \net al. (2020).\nIn addition, we are faced with another\
    \ set of challenges \non platform design level. Assuming these emerging data \n\
    management challenges are solved, how can we extend IoT \nplatforms to smoothly\
    \ integrate new data management func-\ntionalities? This is an especially pressing\
    \ problem since vari-\nous available IoT platforms are not easily extendable beyond\
    \ \nthe original use-cases assumed by their designers. We have \n * Nasr Kasrin\

    \ \n1 3\nhad firsthand experience with several IoT platforms12 and \nhave faced\
    \ various issues related to extending platforms with \ndata management functionalities.\
    \ Currently, data processing \nrelated tasks are typically realized by manually\
    \ developed \ncode and functions which are deployed smart devices (AKA \nedge\
    \ nodes), in the cloud, or on in-between on so-called fog \nnodes. This creates\
    \ future difficulties in maintenance and \ngrowth of the platforms. Hence it is\
    \ needed to explore other \napproaches to designing IoT platforms that can be\
    \ extenda-\nble to integrate emerging functionalities. Overall these chal-\nlenge\
    \ relate to devising approaches, techniques, and system \nplatforms that ease\
    \ the development and maintenance for the \ndeveloper and operator of systems.\n\
    In this paper we cover both these aspects: (1) we explore \nseveral emerging data\
    \ management challenges, and (2) we \npropose an IoT platform integration model\
    \ that can combine \ndisparate functionalities under one roof.\nWe call the IoT\
    \ integration model we develop the \nInformation Basin (IB) model. The IB model\
    \ is informa-\ntion-driven in the sense that data is shared by exchanging \ninformation\
    \ that describes the data. We model each data \nmanagement functionality/component\
    \ as an agent that \ndescribes its data and shares its descriptions with other\
    \ \nagents. The IB model revolves around the concept of a data-\nsharing market\
    \ which is a shared information space where \nmultiple agents contribute by curating\
    \ and ‘advertising’ their \ndata resources and discovering those of others. So\
    \ for the \nIoT platform use case, various IoT functionalities integrate \nby\
    \ exchanging the data descriptions of their inputs and out-\nputs within data-sharing\
    \ markets. To allow more sophisti-\ncated organizations of data exchange and integration,\
    \ the IB \nmodel has a distributed network structure, where vertices \nare data-sharing\
    \ markets and directed edges are information \nflow between them where data descriptions\
    \ travel from one \nmarket to another. This enables more complex hierarchies of\
    \ \ndata-sharing markets to form. We will discuss the IB model \nin more details\
    \ in the approach section in this paper.\nRegarding the data management challenges\
    \ we explore, \nlet us first look at the landscape of IoT data management \nchallenges.\
    \ Abbasi et al. (2017) present a set of data manage-\nment challenges In the IoT,\
    \ their list includes: standardiza-\ntion, data storage management, confidentiality\
    \ and privacy, \nintegrity, energy constraints, device mobility and heteroge-\n\
    neity, device security and backup, availability, and internal \nadversaries. From\
    \ the big data side we have the four Vs of \nvolume, velocity, variety, and veracity.\
    \ The challenge we \ndiscuss in this paper intersect with several of those topics.\
    \ \nThe topics we do not cover include: security, data volume, \nintegrity, and\
    \ standardization. Next we introduce the set of \ndata management challenge covered\
    \ in this paper. \n1. CQuality. Many IoT applications are based on sensor \ndata\
    \ which is never perfect; we have to deal with data \nquality issues which might\
    \ even change depending on \nthe context of the sensor. Hence, the need for method-\n\
    ologies that model sensor data quality for processing and \ndecision making open\
    \ the door to the challenge we call \nthe CQuality challenge.\n2. CPrivacy. IoT\
    \ devices are ubiquitous, sensors are pre-\nsent in more devices that produce\
    \ continuous streams of \ndata about their environment. This leads to the situation\
    \ \nwhere people are not aware of the information they share \nwith others, which\
    \ paves the way for the challenge of \nprivacy preserving data stream processing,\
    \ which we \nrefer to as the CPrivacy challenge.\n3. CModel. Recently there has\
    \ been work in utilizing \nmachine learning to train models that then replace\
    \ \nmanually programmed or modeled functions, e.g., for \nactivity recognition.\
    \ We consider the life-cycle manage-\nment of these models as part of a (higher-level)\
    \ data \nmanagement. We refer to this challenge as the CModel \nchallenge.\n4.\
    \ CResource. Data management is distributed geographi-\ncally between the sensor/actuators,\
    \ gateways up to the \ncloud. This distribution leads to a high heterogeneity\
    \ \nbetween the processing nodes in terms of computing \nresources, system security\
    \ and connectivity; this cre-\nates the opportunity for building solutions that\
    \ tackle the \nmanagement problem from a resource-aware approach, \nwhich we call\
    \ the CResource challenge.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows: in\
    \ Sect. 2 we \npresent a motivating use-case for the paper, and in Sect. 3 \n\
    we discuss our approach to IoT platform design. Next we \npresent the challenges:\
    \ in Sect. 4 the CQuality challenge, in \nSect. 5 we highlight issues related\
    \ to the CPrivacy challenge, \nand in Sect. 6 we discuss the CModel challenge.\
    \ In Sect. 7 \nwe cover the CResource challenge, in Sect. 8 we discuss \nrelated\
    \ work, and wrap up in Sect. 9 with conclusions and \nfuture work.\n2  Use case\n\
    The establishment of smart cities can be supported by the \nInternet of Things\
    \ (IoT) platforms with sensors collecting \ndata and improve the life quality\
    \ and resource efficiency in \nfuture cities. Many smart city applications use\
    \ their gathered \ndata to measure city-wide processes like mobility, energy,\
    \ \nor environmental factors like air quality. Various challenges \narise in managing\
    \ this huge amount of data consistently.\n1 ThingsBoard, https ://thing sboar\

    \ \n-iot.html.\n78\n \nN. Kasrin et al.\n1 3\nTo define the challenges, explain\
    \ and provide appropri-\nate solutions first, we describe our use-case, a smart\
    \ city \nplatform, the so-called Living Lab Bamberg. This testbed \nprovides a\
    \ user-centric environment to test and use different \nsensing systems. The Living\
    \ Lab is open for industry part-\nners and citizens who help us receive new sensor\
    \ systems \nand find installations locations. Furthermore, the University \nof\
    \ Bamberg is not a campus university with the advantage \nthat we can place lots\
    \ of sensors in different buildings inside \nthe city.\nIn general, we use different\
    \ kinds of stationary and mobile \nsensors systems. An example of a stationary\
    \ sensor is a peo-\nple-counting camera, and an example for a mobile sensor \n\
    is a sensor box in a city bus to measure air quality. These \nsensing systems\
    \ produce data that we use in our different \napplication scenarios. We describe\
    \ some of these application \nscenarios below.\nOne application scenario is indoor\
    \ and outdoor locali-\nzation management. Every year many people visit a lot of\
    \ \nstreet festivals in the world’s cultural heritage, Bamberg. \nBamberg is a\
    \ medieval city with many narrow alleys and \nsmall lanes that make it difficult\
    \ to plan events with a lot of \nvisitors. The goal was to flow-track the movement\
    \ of visi-\ntors in the area of the festival, as well as learn movement \nmodels\
    \ of the civilians and groups of people. This can help \non a short term basis\
    \ to predict escape routes on the fly, or \nin retrospect to plan for future planning\
    \ of street festivals.\nFor the measurement, we used a combination of different\
    \ \nsensing technologies like manual counting, camera-based \ncounting, and Wi-Fi\
    \ tracking of mobile phones. In addition, \nthe people tracking camera system\
    \ helps us to collect trajec-\ntories from people inside buildings (an example\
    \ of indoor \nlocalization would be an iBeacon network). In this environ-\nment,\
    \ we can simulate tourist information panels inside the \nuniversity or guides\
    \ for city museums.\nAlready in such a scenario we have several data manage-\n\
    ment challenges arising. We also highlight the information-\ndrivne aspect of\
    \ each challenge since this is the key property \nwe use in the proposed information\
    \ integration model, the \nInformation Basin (IB) model. \n1. Festival Sensor\
    \ Data Quality. The above sensors, like \nmost other sensors, produce readings\
    \ that are never per-\nfect. However for it should be possible to build quality\
    \ \nmodels for data–using sensor models and environmental \ncontext–to enrich\
    \ them with quality information. This \ncan greatly help in correcting some kinds\
    \ of faultiness \nor at least in describing the nature of the faultiness of \n\
    the sensor data. Such quality information can be invalu-\nable for developing\
    \ machine learning models for exam-\nple (see below). The CQuality challenge we\
    \ present in \nthis paper forms an instance of studying this problem. \nIt must\
    \ be noted that in the above approach sensor qual-\nity models, as well as quality\
    \ information attached to \ndata sets (ex. metadata) are both structured information,\
    \ \nwhich can be represented, exchanged and processed by \nothers in the IB network.\n\
    2. Visitors’ Privacy. As data is collected about festival \nattendees, vulnerability\
    \ of the visitors’ privacy is the \nWi-Fi tracking of mobile phones arises. How\
    \ can we \ncollect data from the festival attendees while protect-\ning their\
    \ identities? The CPrivacy covers this aspect of \nthe problem. Although not as\
    \ information-driven as the \nsensor data quality challenge, information representing\
    \ \nwhich parts of the data are privacy sensitive, or what \nalgorithms and parameters\
    \ to run on them, are structured \ninformation that drives privacy data processing.\n\
    3. Festival Attendees Movement Models. Developing \nmovement models helps to predict,\
    \ mange emergen-\ncies and support the planning of future festivals. Sensor \n\
    data and its quality information can be used to develop \nthese models which in\
    \ part are also structured informa-\ntion that can be processed by different systems.\
    \ This \nforms the CModel investigation in this paper. Examples \nof strucutre\
    \ information driving this data management \nfunctionality include, training datasets\
    \ used, learning \nparameters, and the learned models themselves are all \nstructured\
    \ information that are key to driving machine \nlearning model management.\n4.\
    \ Resource-aware Computation of Festival Data. So far \nwe have assumed that computation\
    \ is managed locally or \nby some high-performance machine. But the IoT reality\
    \ \nhas given us many options to run computations. For pri-\nvacy, it can greatly\
    \ benefit if data is for example pseudo \nanatomized on the fog node, or the nearest\
    \ gateway, if it \nhas such computational capabilities. Also for developing \n\
    machine learning models, resource-aware computation \ncan provide various alternatives\
    \ to pre-process, clean-\nup, or run jobs across nodes. This challenges, as opposed\
    \ \nto the three above, is a service challenge that supports \nother data management\
    \ functionalities.\n5. Integration. Various data management functionalities \n\
    arise in this use-cases, and IoT platforms suffer from \na lack of fluidity when\
    \ new features or functions are \nadded to the platform. So with discussing all\
    \ the above \nchallenges, a natural question arises, how can we inte-\ngrate such\
    \ functionalities together? Towards this end \nwe present an information-driven\
    \ paradigm for IoT \nplatform design. We model the data management func-\ntionalities\
    \ referenced above as agents, which processes \ndata and consumes and produces\
    \ information about this \ndata. Then integrating the different functionalities\
    \ into \na common framework by sharing and exchanging all this \ninformation.\
    \ We present this model in the next section.\n79\nData-sharing markets for integrating\
    \ IoT data processing functionalities \n1 3\nMobility sensing is just one use\
    \ case for smart cities. With \nsuch a small use-case, we already see various\
    \ motivating \nrequirement for the challenges and approach presented in \nthis\
    \ paper. Similar challenges can be found in other applica-\ntions as well in such\
    \ as environmental sensing, using distrib-\nuted air quality measurements and\
    \ analysis.\n3  Platform integration: the information \nbasin model\nWe have introduced\
    \ several IoT platform functionalities so \nfar. From a platform design perspective\
    \ we model each func-\ntionality as a functional dimension of the IoT platform,\
    \ as \ndefined below.\nDefinition 1 (Functional Dimension) A functional dimen-\n\
    sion is a component of an IoT platform that: (1) adds inde-\npendent functionality\
    \ or value of its own (i.e. processing, \ninput to output dynamics), and (2) is\
    \ expected to integrate \nwith the platform (ex. by producing or consuming data/\n\
    information).\nSensor data quality management (CQuality) is an exam-\nple of functional\
    \ dimension of an IoT platform since it adds \nan independent functionality (processing\
    \ sensor data and \nsensor information and producing data quality models, etc.)\
    \ \nand it must integrate into a larger platform so that its results \ncan be\
    \ used by other systems. Machine learning model man-\nagement (CModel) shares\
    \ a similar structure to CQuality as \na functional dimension, and so on.\nDistributed\
    \ resource-aware computing (CResource) can \nalso be understood as a functional\
    \ dimension in the sense \nthat it adds functionality and produces results/data\
    \ back to \nthe platform. A similar argument can be made about CPri-\nvacy in\
    \ the sense of adding functionality and integrating into \nthe larger system.\n\
    Faced with expanding requirements, innovations, and \nfunctionalities of IoT platforms,\
    \ we must find ways to design \nplatforms so that they can handle multiple functional\
    \ dimen-\nsions as well as be extendable to integrate new ones. To \nachieve this\
    \ we use a model we are developing3 called the \nInformation Basin (IB) model,\
    \ which revolves around the \nconcept of a data-sharing market.\nDefinition 2\
    \ (Data-Sharing Market) A data-sharing market \nis a shared information space\
    \ where multiple organizations \ncan describe and ‘advertise’ their data resources\
    \ as well as \ndiscover those of others.\nOnline open-data repositories are one\
    \ example of a \ndata-sharing market, however their underlying model for \ninformation\
    \ representation (i.e. list + keywords) might be \nprimitive for more sophisticated\
    \ applications. The informa-\ntion representation model we currently use is more\
    \ akin to a \nlightweight semantic graph model driven by shared domain \nmodels.\n\
    Definition 3 (The Information Basin (IB) Model) The IB \nmodel is a platform design\
    \ model for enabling data-sharing \nand exchange networks across multiple groups,\
    \ users, or sys-\ntems. The basic building block of the IB model is (1) a set\
    \ \nof data-sharing markets and (2) information flow between \nthem. The IB model\
    \ is ‘information-driven’ in the sense \nthat data is shared by exchanging information\
    \ about data. \nAn IB network is ‘animated’ when (1) information about \nnew data\
    \ resources is added to a market, or (2) information \nflows from one market to\
    \ another, thereby creating a kind \nof living web-of-markets. Since we are dealing\
    \ with (struc-\ntured) information here, if we assume that markets can have \n\
    different domain models, information flow must include a \nmapping stage from\
    \ the source domain model to the destina-\ntion model.\nContinuing with the online\
    \ open-data repository exam-\nple, implementing an IB network using them will\
    \ require \nestablishing a mechanism whereas some selection of entries \nfrom\
    \ one repository can be propagated to other repositories, \nwhere each repository\
    \ might have a different set of users, \nvisibility etc.\nSo how can we apply\
    \ the IB model to establish an expand-\nable IoT platform with multiple functional\
    \ dimensions? \nWe can design a simple IB network where each functional \ndimension\
    \ has its own internal data-sharing market, and in \naddition declare an IoT platform-wide\
    \ market where infor-\nmation flows from the respective feature dimension markets\
    \ \nto the main one.\nA primitive IB network would be a single IoT platform-\n\
    wide market shared by all functional dimensions, and \nalthough this can work,\
    \ this assumes that all the dimensions \nmust adhere to the same domain model\
    \ of information, as \nwell as being forced to share all produced data to this\
    \ mar-\nket. Usually functional dimensions would have some local/\nprivate data\
    \ that is not meant to be shared, in addition to \nhaving domain models that are\
    \ specialized differently. So for \nthese reasons we will opt for a multi-market\
    \ IB network. Fig-\nure 1 depicts this IB network, where IoT-Mark is the name\
    \ \nof the IoT-wide shared market. Regarding the contributors \nin the different\
    \ markets, we can assume that each functional \ndimension market is accessible\
    \ only by users/systems of that \nfunctional dimension and the IoT-Mark market\
    \ is accessible \nand writable by all the users/systems of all the functional\
    \ \ndimension.\n3 Submitted, awaiting review.\n80\n \nN. Kasrin et al.\n1 3\n\
    Next we will looking at the example of how the above \nIB network can support\
    \ an IoT platform with the multiple \nfunctional dimensions covered in this paper.\
    \ First regarding \ndomain models across markets, we can give the IoT-Mark \n\
    market an abstract domain model that is specialized by each \nmarket differently.\
    \ By specialized we mean the abstract \nmodel is extended by adding new types\
    \ that must be a sub-\ntype of some element in the abstract model. Figure 2 depicts\
    \ \none such model, where the ‘p:’ prefix denotes that the type \ncomes from the\
    \ PROV W3C provenance recommendation4.\nThe CQuality market can further specialize\
    \ the above \nmodel by defining a rich sub-hierarchy of sensors and sen-\nsor\
    \ quality models, the CModel market on the other hand \ncan define a rich sub-hierarchy\
    \ of type DataSet above, and so \non. Let us look at a concrete example of how\
    \ the functional \ndimensions can integrated within the IoT platform.\nExample\
    \ 1 The CQuality solution processes a DataSet and \nits context and produces a\
    \ reliability model. Let’s assume \nthis reliability model is defined in the abstract\
    \ domain model \non the DataSet type, hence it is understood by the other \ngroups.\
    \ The CQuality market would have a forwarding rule \nto the IoT-Mark market for\
    \ all new reliability information, \nand hence this piece of information about\
    \ this particular \nDataSet instance will be propagated. In the IoT-Mark market\
    \ \nthe CModel group can query for all DataSets with reliability \ninformation\
    \ and use that information as parameters to their \nlearning algorithms and produce\
    \ a learning model where \nthey declare that the DataSet above has been used as\
    \ train-\ning data. Let’s say that hypothetically, a problem occurs with \nthe\
    \ learning model and someone would like to diagnose the \npossible reasons, with\
    \ the information about which DataSets \nwhere used in the training they can trace\
    \ this same DataSet \nback to the CQuality group and can explore more informa-\n\
    tion about how the reliability information was derived, and \nso on.\nIn essence,\
    \ a functional dimension = (structured) infor-\nmation + operations (that use\
    \ and produce more informa-\ntion). And an IB network = information models / mappings\
    \ \n+ markets + information flow.\nWe will not go into more details regarding\
    \ the approach \ndue to scope. The goal of this section was to show an IoT \n\
    platform model where a set of IoT functionalities can be \ncombined under a common\
    \ roof collaborate and exchange \ninformation and data to achieve the goals of\
    \ an IoT platform. \nThe remainder of this paper will dive into the various chal-\n\
    lenges introduced earlier.\nFig. 1  The IoT platform IB \nnetwork with clouds\

    \ \n1 3\n4  CQuality: data quality challenges in IoT \nenvironments\nThis challenge\
    \ revolves around the quality of data in the \ncontext of IoT. Most applications\
    \ deal with data coming \nfrom different sources. These sources can be human or\
    \ \nnon-human. Non-human data can come from other similar \ndevices or from sensors\
    \ that capture the phenomena happen-\ning around and quantifying them.\nTo show\
    \ the importance of data quality, we can relate \nto the use cases in Sect. 2,\
    \ where machine learning models \nare created on the basis of sensors. If these\
    \ datasets are not \nchecked for quality, the models created could give a skewed\
    \ \nview on the actual observation/behavior. Any predictions \nbased on the learned\
    \ models from raw data will result in \nwrong predictions. In this section, we\
    \ focus on the main \nchallenges of data quality in IoT environments with regards\
    \ \nto the stream processing applications. Since most of the \ndata in IoT context\
    \ is generated from sensors, we know \nhow faulty can the data be. Besides, we\
    \ note that decision-\nmaking is made on the fly. Those two aspects make the data\
    \ \nquality an important issue in the process of data evaluation \nand usage.\
    \ First, we start by enumerating the different chal-\nlenges that face the developers\
    \ of IoT applications and then \nwe describe them individually in this section.\n\
    When we talk about data quality, we have to precisely \ndefine what quality means.\
    \ This definitions can be defined \nby introducing the dimensions that make up\
    \ the data quality. \nThis challenge is concerned with the definition of data\
    \ qual-\nity. After having a clear idea of the quality dimensions and \ntheir\
    \ metrics, we have to determine the values of those met-\nrics. This poses the\
    \ second challenge of data quality compu-\ntation. We also want to make the use\
    \ of quality-aware data \nprocessing as easy as possible by having an easy integration\
    \ \nfor application developers.\nTo summarize, this challenge focuses on the following\
    \ \nresearch question: How can we integrate quality-aware data \nprocessing in\
    \ IoT applications through semi-automatic and \nautomatic methods?\n4.1  Related\
    \ work\nIn this part, we give a background on the relevant research \nthat addresses\
    \ the different aspects of data quality in IoT \nenvironments.\n4.1.1  Data quality\
    \ definition\nThe first challenge is to clearly define what data quality is. \n\
    According to Buchholz and Schiffers (2003), quality is “Any \ninformation that\
    \ describes the quality of information that is \nused as context information”.\
    \ Batini et al. define the data \nquality in terms of specific dimensions Batini\
    \ et al. (2006) \nlike accuracy, completeness, volatility and timeliness. Klein\
    \ \nand Lehner (2009) define data quality as the accuracy and \nresolution of\
    \ the data as it goes though the steps of a data \nprocessing chain. With these\
    \ definitions of data quality, we \nhave to distinguish between inherent quality\
    \ dimensions and \ndomain-specific dimensions.\nThe inherent quality dimensions\
    \ can be automatically \ncomputed like those given by Batini. However, the domain-\n\
    specific dimensions must be defined by the application \ndevelopers. This makes\
    \ the task of data quality definition \nusing a specific tool a little bit tricky.\n\
    In order to deal with data quality representation, we can \nuse semantic tools\
    \ like ontologies to define both types of \nquality dimensions. The inherent quality\
    \ dimensions can \nhave their own terms in an ontology like the SSN ontology \n\
    Compton et al. (2012). The domain-specific dimensions can \nbe expressed through\
    \ extensions of ontologies or by enabling \nthe inclusion of user-defined terms\
    \ to include these. How-\never, the definition of any data quality dimension or\
    \ process \nmust be simple and clear to encourage any users to adopt it.\n4.1.2\
    \  Data quality processing\nThe challenges in the area of data processing are\
    \ numer-\nous. Should the quality dimensions be computed online or \noffline?\
    \ Do we output data with quality annotations or meta-\ndata about the quality?\n\
    The online approaches are mostly present in applica-\ntions that process the data\
    \ on the fly as an incoming stream. \nGeisler et al. (2016) introduces a Data\
    \ Quality ontology-\nbased framework for data stream applications. The ontology\
    \ \ngives quality metrics for content, queries and applications. \nThe framework\
    \ is based on an ontology for the description \nof sensor and quality dimensions.\
    \ Kuka and Nicklas (2014) \ngive an approach for quality-aware sensor data processing\
    \ \nbased on the SSN ontology Compton et al. (2012). The \nontology is used to\
    \ describe context information about the \nsensors deployed. The Gaussian Mixture\
    \ Models are used \nto assess the probability of a data element being an outlier.\n\
    Schmidt et al. (2004) adopt a deterministic data stream \nprocessing approach\
    \ with a system called QStream. Klein \nand Lehner (2009) propose a flexible model\
    \ of data quality \nprocessing and propagation in a stream processing network\
    \ \nfor sensor data in a smart environment. We also applied \nonline data stream\
    \ processing for quality estimation of sen-\nsor data in Benabbas et al. (2018,\
    \ 2019, 2020); Aboubakr \net al. (2017a).\nThe mentioned approaches process the\
    \ data on the fly and \ncan be also applied offline. These approaches include\
    \ pro-\ncesses for the computation of the said quality dimensions. \nThe user-defined\
    \ quality dimensions come with user-defined \n82\n \nN. Kasrin et al.\n1 3\nprocedures\
    \ to determine the values of the quality dimen-\nsions. Besides, we need to consider\
    \ the trade-off between \nthe accuracy of the computed quality and the costs in\
    \ terms \nof computation overhead and delay. Some of the approaches \nneed a training-set\
    \ to develop a model for their quality-aware \nprocessing Wu et al. (2007), while\
    \ some do not need any \ntraining to start their process. These two variants give\
    \ the \nuser a choice between a delay-free quality-aware process-\ning and one\
    \ with an up-start time. The challenge is to find a \nhybrid approach that enables\
    \ the choice between the differ-\nent models and the activation/deactivation of\
    \ quality com-\nputation processes.\n4.1.3  Data quality integration\nThis challenge\
    \ builds on the first two challenges. Given that \nall the challenges above are\
    \ solved, how do we make the \nintegration of quality aware processing as easy\
    \ and as seam-\nless as possible? From the above discussion, we note that \nmost\
    \ systems deal with data quality as a parallel process or \na pre-processing step\
    \ before passing the data to the actual \napplication. This challenge implies\
    \ that for any quality-\naware solution to be adopted, it must be simple enough\
    \ and \nintuitive enough to be wide-spread over all the IoT applica-\ntions. This\
    \ gives rise to the following two challenges:\n• Simplify the use of semantic\
    \ models to describe the \nquality-aware processes.\n• Automatically generate\
    \ the processes from the semantic \ndescriptions.\n4.2  Our approach\nThe first\
    \ challenge must be addressed through the introduc-\ntion of processing patterns,\
    \ which can be deduced from the \nbasic structures of the participating data sources\
    \ in the IoT \napplications. The second challenge can be solved by having \nprocesses\
    \ in the background to perform the translation from \nthe semantic model to the\
    \ actual quality-aware processes. \nA first step towards these goals is done in\
    \ a previous con-\ntribution Benabbas et al. (2020), where we define the first\
    \ \nprocessing patterns and their use with an automatic genera-\ntion of the quality-aware\
    \ processes. The target is to be able \nto provide templates of sensor models\
    \ to be used by the IoT \napplication developers to deal with the quality issues\
    \ wher-\never applicable. Besides, we want to leverage large scale \nmodels that\
    \ contain multiple sensors to find the target groups \nfor data quality checks.\n\
    Figure 3 shows the cycle of data quality integration into \nIoT platforms. Developers\
    \ design their applications by hav-\ning models of the data sources and sensors\
    \ they have. To \nwrite the models, we can use the aforementioned SSN ontol-\n\
    ogy. The models are fed to the Data Quality Management \nTool that extracts the\
    \ data quality processing patterns from \nthe model. The patterns can be identified\
    \ through the seman-\ntic relationships between the sensors and other spatially\
    \ col-\nlocated sensors or with other data sources. The automatic \nrecognition\
    \ of such quality patterns and the generation of \nthe queries should solve the\
    \ second challenge. The process-\ning patterns indicate the method of checking\
    \ the data qual-\nity. Then, the process of quality-aware processing queries \n\
    generation.\nThe output of the process are quality-aware queries, \nwhich can\
    \ be deployed on data stream management sys-\ntems (DSMS) to perform the data\
    \ quality metrics compu-\ntation. The results of those queries are quality-annotated\
    \ \ndata, which are ready to be used by the IoT applications. \nAny changes in\
    \ the application model can be updated in the \nmodel and this triggers a chain\
    \ of updates on the queries to \nreflect the change in the model.\nThe third challenge\
    \ of Data Quality Integration is the \nlong term goal for IoT applications, where\
    \ the above steps \nof model creation and query generation should be standard-\n\
    ized and made as a part of any IoT development platform. \nThe developers should\
    \ have all the necessary tools to make \nquality-aware processing a permanent\
    \ part of the develop-\nment of applications.\n5  CPrivacy: privacy‑preserving\
    \ data stream \nprocessing\nIoT devices are ubiquitous. Sensors are present in\
    \ more and \nmore devices not just in smart phones or wearables. This \nleads\
    \ to the problem that the people are not aware what \ninformation about their\
    \ daily lives they share with others. \nAn example like a fitness tracking app\
    \ that gives away loca-\ntion of secret US army bases Hern (2020) seems funny,\
    \ but \nthere are too many privacy fails that this problem could be \nignored.\n\
    Fig. 3  Cycle of data quality integration in IoT applications\n83\nData-sharing\
    \ markets for integrating IoT data processing functionalities \n1 3\nRecently\
    \ laws are being published to ensure the security \nand privacy features of IoT\
    \ devices. For example, the federal \nstate of California has prohibited the use\
    \ of standard pass-\nwords (2020). This is a good first step to define standards\
    \ \nfor private IoT devices.\nThe problem is that nowadays you can be monitored\
    \ by \nsensors without knowing that. Especially if companies like \nsupermarkets\
    \ use systems to track customer to analyze their \nshops. In 2018 the European\
    \ GDPR was launched and pro-\nvided a good foundation for privacy. Since that\
    \ time super-\nmarkets were not allowed anymore to store private informa-\ntion\
    \ like the mac addresses of the customer’s mobile devices \nin plain text.\nWe\
    \ want to analyze stream of stakeholders of a street \nfestival to create new\
    \ security and safety concepts. How \ncan we set up long-running city-wide sensor\
    \ campaigns and \nshare the data without compromising the citizen’s privacy? \n\
    We integrate different state-of-the art privacy methods to \nreduce the risk of\
    \ leaks in data publication to a minimum. In \na next step we adopt our prototype\
    \ to data streams. We will \nrefer this challenge as the privacy-preserving data\
    \ stream \nprocessing challenge.\nTo summarize, this challenge focuses on the\
    \ following \nresearch question: How can we process privacy-preserving \ndata\
    \ streams without publishing sensitive information’s?\n5.1  Related work\nWe already\
    \ defined our privacy-preserving architecture for \nour smart city testbed in\
    \ Steuer et al. (2016). One of the \nmain challenges is the publication anonymous\
    \ data. Privacy-\nPreserving Data Publishing (PPDP) is a good fundamen-\ntal for\
    \ our research in this domain. Fung et al. treated also \nmoving object data in\
    \ their survey Fung et al. (2010) as \nprivacy in location-based services (LBS).\
    \ “Location privacy \nis defined as the ability to prevent untrusted third parties\
    \ to \nreveal current or past location[s] of an individual” Pelekis \nand Theodoridis\
    \ (2014). There are two general approaches \nto prevent re-identification in trajectories:\
    \ spatial cloaking \nand perturbation Pelekis and Theodoridis (2014).\nIn the\
    \ cloaking approach the generalization increases the \nquery region until the\
    \ region contains at least k users. The \nprobability of de-identification is\
    \ not higher then 1/k. Exam-\nples for cloaking are based on k-anonymity like\
    \ Always-\nWalk-with-Others. The cloaking approach is just possible \nif we have\
    \ a high number of trajectories, if we do not have \nthis then we need perturbation\
    \ like in the Never-Walk-Alone \napproach or decide not to publish data sets Pelekis\
    \ and Theo-\ndoridis (2014).\nIn data publication we focus on k-anonymity because\
    \ we \nhave just slightly sensitive data that can be anonymized eas-\nily without\
    \ much risk. Our goal is to use k-anonymity also \nfor data streams. There have\
    \ been several scientific articles \nover the years, which try to extend the concept\
    \ of k-anonym-\nity to streaming data. The Continuously Anonymizing Data \nStreams\
    \ algorithm (Castle), presented in Cao et al. (2011), \nhas the most similarities\
    \ to our approach.\nExisting privacy-preserving techniques such as k-ano-\nnymity\
    \ are designed for static data sets. The adaption to data \nstreams is challenging\
    \ because of the differences to classical \ndata bases. In data streams the data\
    \ input is continues and \ndoes not stop. Furthermore the data arrives in real\
    \ time in \nan ordered sequence of items Golab and Özsu (2003). In our \nuse case\
    \ in Sect. 2 entities can appear more than one time if \na visitor enters a new\
    \ region and then immediately returns.\n5.2  Our approach\nIn our approach, we\
    \ decided to use generalization with \nk-anonymity. In the first step, we analyze\
    \ our stored data set \nfrom the crowd monitoring use case in Sect. 2. The identi-\n\
    fiers in our data set are the mac address and a combination \nof time stamps and\
    \ location points, which makes it possible \nto encrypt stakeholders.\nMac address\
    \ is the sensitive attribute that we protect via \npseudonymisation with hashing.\
    \ Regarding the quasi iden-\ntifier time stamp and location, we conclude that\
    \ we need a \nlocation point (e.g. City Hall) and a time stamp categoriza-\ntion\
    \ (morning, afternoon, evening and overnight) as clusters. \nThe trajectories\
    \ just consist of these cluster set of elements. \nA typical trajectory looks\
    \ like:\nCity Hall[morning] - Lower Bridge[morning] - Upper \nBridge[morning]\n\
    Our goal is to see, how k-anonymity can be applied to \ndata streams with the\
    \ data set from our crowd monitoring \nuse case presented in Sect. 2. Towards\
    \ enable privacy-pre-\nserving data stream processing, we want to extend our data\
    \ \nstream management system (DSMS) Odysseus Appelrath \net al. (2012). Therefore,\
    \ we want to implement a standard \noperator, so that adding anonymization to\
    \ data streams \nbecomes easy for developers and can be enforced easily.\nHence,\
    \ very similar to the static data set, the identifying \ninformation of stakeholders\
    \ the mac address is removed. \nAfter that, we focus on the following questions:\
    \ (1) How \nmany tuples are stored temporarily before they get published \nas\
    \ clusters? (2) What should be a good window size, so that \nwe can guarantee\
    \ the privacy in the diversity of trajectories \nand that we do not lose too much\
    \ data sets? After answering \nthe questions (1) and (2), we can use a predicate\
    \ window \nwith a predefined size so that tuples have to fulfill the predi-\n\
    cate cluster_size ≥ k to get published.\nThe anonymization operator is optimized\
    \ for one data set \nin one specific use case. In order to make it useful for\
    \ devel-\nopers, more crowd sensing use cases have to be supported. \nFor this\
    \ end, we want to define a set of the most probably \nscenarios and define the\
    \ concrete parameters for them.\n84\n \nN. Kasrin et al.\n1 3\n6  CModel: ML model\
    \ management\nIoT platforms are made of a huge number of different sen-\nsory\
    \ devices that produce a huge volume of data. There are \ndifferent applications\
    \ of IoT in different environments, like \nthe smart city described in Sect. 2.\
    \ Many different services \ncan be defined in such environments as smart mobility\
    \ \nmonitoring, smart traffic management, and smart build-\nings. These different\
    \ services should provide appropriate \nknowledge and insight into the environment\
    \ and support \ndomain experts in making critical decisions.\nFor example, in\
    \ the smart city scenario, all the people \ncan use a traffic management service,\
    \ which suggests the \nshortest path to the destination based on different possible\
    \ \npaths’ traffic load.\nThe word machine learning refers to a computer pro-\n\
    gram that is said to optimize a learning criterion using \nexample data and post\
    \ experiences Alpaydin (2020). \nMachine learning (ML) and data analytics techniques\
    \ are \npowerful tools that provide us the ability to extract knowl-\nedge from\
    \ transmitted data. Based on the requirements, \ndifferent ML and data analytics\
    \ techniques should be \napplied to provide a service in an IoT platform Samie\
    \ et al. \n(2019); Cui et al. (2018). To design the best ML model \nframework\
    \ that manages all the ML models in our IoT \nplatforms, first, we have to define\
    \ the challenges related to \nML model management. This section reviews the related\
    \ \nworks for ML model development and management in an \nIoT platform, and then\
    \ we define and discuss the chal-\nlenges related to ML model management. In the\
    \ end, we \ndescribe our approach and explain how we can overcome \nthe challenges\
    \ and answer the research question.\nThe research question for ML model management\
    \ \nwould be: how we can integrate and manage a variety of \nML models with different\
    \ properties in an IoT platform in \na unified and scalable framework?\n6.1  Related\
    \ work\nA variety of ML and data analytics techniques have been \nintroduced to\
    \ deal with a massive amount of heterogene-\nous data gathered by the IoT infrastructure\
    \ Samie et al. \n(2019); Cui et al. (2018). Different ML models can extract \n\
    different patterns and knowledge needed by applications. \nBased on the application\
    \ demands, the appropriate ML \nmodel with the proper properties can be defined.\n\
    Data should go through stages of ML pipeline and \nsometimes combined with context\
    \ knowledge to gain \nthe appropriate knowledge. ML pipeline consists of dif-\n\
    ferent ML techniques for data cleaning, preprocessing, \ndata segmentation, feature\
    \ selection, processing, and \npostprocessing. So many related works focused on\
    \ devel-\noping different ML models and combining the ML models \nfrom different\
    \ stages of pipeline to extract the accurate \nresults Chin et al. (2017); Patil\
    \ and Thorat (2016); Mah-\ndavinejad et al. (2018). Some mature works like Vla-\n\
    cheas et al. (2013) introduced an ML model management \nframework with some level\
    \ of automation for selecting \nthe ML models. Besides, combining the context\
    \ knowl-\nedge like what has been done in Sasidharan and Somov \n(2014) improved\
    \ the accuracy of ML models. However, \nall the mentioned works are developed\
    \ for some limited \napplications.\nIn addition, each ML model has its evolution\
    \ life-cycle. \nThis means that every time an ML model is developed, it \nmust\
    \ be evaluated and deployed Schelter et al. (2018). The \nlife-cycle of an ML\
    \ model produces different versions of an \nML with other properties.\nThe rapid\
    \ speed of growing IoT platforms and matura-\ntion of ML techniques address the\
    \ need to have a unified \nframework for managing the ML models and correspond-\n\
    ing metadata and connections for each model to overcome \nthe aforementioned challenges.\
    \ The ML model manage-\nment should allow us to integrate new ML models to the\
    \ \nframework, elevate existing models, track and access differ-\nent ML models\
    \ with corresponding metadata, and decide \nwhich model should be used to extract\
    \ the desirable knowl-\nedge. Such an ML management framework should be able \n\
    to overcome the challenges of managing ML models that \ncan be divided into three\
    \ main categories. In the following, \nwe explain each challenge, describe the\
    \ related works, and \ndiscuss the shortcomings and new insights.\n6.1.1  ML models\
    \ for different applications\nIoT platforms can cover a vast area like a city\
    \ Steuer et al. \n(2016), a building Elmamooz et al. (2017), or a farm Kami-\n\
    laris et al. (2016). Different users and agents with different \ndemands can be\
    \ defined in an IoT covered environment. For \nexample, taxi drivers, tourists,\
    \ and citizens of a city can ben-\nefit from smart mobility monitoring service\
    \ with different \napplications Zanella et al. (2014). A taxi driver needs the\
    \ \nfastest path to the destination, a tourist needs a recommen-\ndation for the\
    \ next interesting place in the city, and a user \ncan use a traffic load app\
    \ to decide on the hours for shop-\nping. So many different ML techniques have\
    \ been introduced \nto extract relevant knowledge for an application. The ML \n\
    techniques can be categorized into three main categories of \nsupervised learning,\
    \ unsupervised learning, and reinforce-\nment learning Kavakiotis et al. (2017).\
    \ Different techniques \nare introduced to extract hidden knowledge from data.\
    \ This \nknowledge can be in the form of classified data, frequent \npatterns,\
    \ sequential patterns, and so forth. This knowledge \nshould be presented in an\
    \ understandable way for the end \n85\nData-sharing markets for integrating IoT\
    \ data processing functionalities \n1 3\nuser. Moreover, based on the application\
    \ demands, different \nML models should be executed offline or online over differ-\n\
    ent data segments Zorbas et al. (2015). In some cases, it is \nneeded to execute\
    \ an ML model over various window sizes \nto extract the hidden patterns and anomalies\
    \ in different time \nand space granularities.\nMost of the recent works focus\
    \ on developing the algo-\nrithms that fit best to the specific demand like Mahdavine-\n\
    jad et al. (2018); Kavakiotis et al. (2017); Sasidharan and \nSomov (2014). However,\
    \ managing ML models should not \njust focus on developing the most efficient\
    \ models but also \non model management efficiently. This means that an ML \n\
    model management framework should be developed in a \nscalable way to make the\
    \ integration of new models easier. \nIn addition, different components of a framework\
    \ can be (re)\nused for other domains and applications.\n6.1.2  Pipeline of ML\
    \ models\nThe data transmitted from sensory devices in big IoT plat-\nforms are\
    \ completely heterogeneous and full of noise and \nmissing values, as mentioned\
    \ in Sect. 4. Moreover, each \nbunch of raw data gathered from a specific kind\
    \ of sensor \nhas its own characteristics like the type of data and num-\nber\
    \ of fields. Gathered data from heterogeneous sensors \nin different places and\
    \ time should be processed to return \nthe desired result. The process of converting\
    \ raw data into \nknowledge consists of different steps called ML pipeline \n\
    Schelter et al. (2018). These stages are data cleaning, data \npreprocessing,\
    \ data segmentation, feature selection, process-\ning, and postprocessing.\nEach\
    \ step in the pipeline includes one or more ML model \nthat receives an input\
    \ dataset and converts it to the output \ndataset. In the cleaning and preprocessing\
    \ step, some ML \nmodels should be used to leverage the quality of data for \n\
    further usage like noise reduction, data segmentation, and \nresampling. In data\
    \ segmentation and feature extraction, the \ndata is divided into batches based\
    \ on time and space, and \ndifferent features of a batch can be selected based\
    \ on their \neffects on the evaluation of the model. In the processing step, \n\
    based on the application, different supervised, unsupervised, \nor reinforcement\
    \ ML models can be chosen to extract the \nknowledge out of data. As the last\
    \ step, in some cases, the \nresult of the second step of the pipeline should\
    \ be further \nprocessed to produce understandable knowledge.\nIt should be mentioned\
    \ that combinations of different ML \nmodels can change the evaluation results.\
    \ For example, some \npreprocessing techniques like discretization can enhance\
    \ the \naccuracy of some ML models that cannot work with con-\ntinuous values\
    \ Zhu and Collette (2015). Therefore, the ML \nmodel management framework should\
    \ be able to keep and \nretrieve different ML models in different stages of the\
    \ pipe-\nline based on the connections between the models. Such a \nframework\
    \ should help choose a suitable (combination of) \nML model(s) to get the desirable\
    \ results.\n6.1.3  The life‑cycle of ML model evolution\nDeveloping an ML model\
    \ is a continuous task. This means \nthat every time an ML model is developed,\
    \ the model should \nbe validated with the data and be improved based on the \n\
    validation results. Figure 4 illustrates the life-cycle of ML \nmodels.\nThe life-cycle\
    \ of an ML model consists of three stages, \nincluding model development, model\
    \ evaluation, and model \ndeployment Schelter et al. (2018). After defining the\
    \ train-\ning data, selecting the features, and training the model with \nthe\
    \ training dataset, the model should be evaluated with test \ndatasets. In most\
    \ cases, an ML model is a combination of \nfeature transformation and a learning\
    \ algorithm with tuned \nparameters. An ML model is implemented and integrated\
    \ to \naccept domain specific input data and return reliable results. \nTherefore,\
    \ the selection of features and tuning the param-\neters can be made based on\
    \ the distribution of data. The \nperformance and accuracy of an ML model can\
    \ change over \ntime and space with changes in the data distribution. To keep\
    \ \nthe results of ML models reliable, ML models should be \nvalidated and improved\
    \ over time.\nThe continuous life-cycle of ML models raises the \ndemand to keep\
    \ the trace and information about different \nML over time and space. Introduced\
    \ ML model management \nframeworks mostly keep the current version of ML models\
    \ \nMahdavinejad et al. (2018). Keeping the current version of \nML models without\
    \ the history of evolution is not enough \nfor most of the recent IoT platforms.\
    \ Keeping the trace of \nthe ML model evolution helps us to use and compare differ-\n\
    ent versions on different datasets and produce new versions \nwithout losing the\
    \ previous versions.\n6.2  Our approach\nBased on the discussed challenges, various\
    \ ML models \nwith different properties can be developed for an IoT plat-\nform.\
    \ These properties can include information about the \ninput, output, parameters,\
    \ evaluation results, and con-\nnections to other models. Besides, ML models might\
    \ be \nFig. 4  Life-cycle of ML models\n86\n \nN. Kasrin et al.\n1 3\ndeveloped\
    \ in different development environments. To be \nable to integrate all ML models\
    \ that are implemented in \ndifferent environments, we need to define an efficient\
    \ ML \nmodel management framework that can fulfill the follow-\ning goals:\n–\
    \ The framework should be scalable\n– The framework should manage several executions\
    \ of \nML models on different input\n– The framework should keep the metadata\
    \ for different \nML models\nOne of the main capabilities of the ML model management\
    \ \nframework is scalability. This means the development and \nintegration of\
    \ new ML models in the framework should be \npossible. Such a framework should\
    \ be easily extended to \nconsider new data sources and new ML models that can\
    \ \ndeal with the data from new sources. As an example, we \ncan mention continuous\
    \ ML models in the form of queries \nfor streams of data and incremental ML models\
    \ for batches \nof input data.\nThe second goal is to have a framework that can\
    \ manage \nthe execution of one or more ML models on the data with \ndifferent\
    \ spatio-temporal granularity. The combination of \nthe results of several executions\
    \ brings new knowledge \nand insight into the data. To make it understandable,\
    \ a \nsimple ML model like detection of the top points of inter-\nest from the\
    \ trajectory of tourists in smart city use-case \ncan be considered. The top ten\
    \ points of interest (POIs) \nduring the week-days might differ from the top ten\
    \ POIs \nat the weekend. Weather conditions, festivals, and school \ntime can\
    \ also change the top ten POIs in a city. By com-\nbining the results from several\
    \ executions of the top POIs \ndetection model, we can discover the mobility patterns\
    \ of \ntourists in the city.\nIn addition, to integrate different ML models and\
    \ track \ndifferent versions of an ML model, the framework should \nbe able to\
    \ keep the metadata of each ML model and con-\nnections between ML models. Metadata\
    \ in the form of \nconnections can be defined between different ML models. \n\
    For example, an ML model can have different evolutionary \nversions that should\
    \ be traceable. Moreover, a combination \nof some special ML models can have a\
    \ noticeable effect \non accuracy. As the framework supports the scalability and\
    \ \nreusability of ML components, different adapted versions \nof an ML model\
    \ on heterogeneous data can be developed. \nEach version of an ML model has its\
    \ own properties, as \nmentioned before.\nOne of the main future goals in the\
    \ context of ML model \nmanagement framework is to reuse the framework and com-\n\
    ponents in different IoT platforms with minor changes for \nadapting ML models\
    \ to manage and automate all the ML \nrelated tasks.\n7  CResource: resource‑aware\
    \ data \nmanagement\nThe data that needs to be managed in an IoT ecosystem \n\
    steadily grows in all of its three big data dimensions: vol-\nume, velocity and\
    \ variety. The volume increases due to \nthe elevating amount of data generating\
    \ devices Atzori \net al. (2010); Gubbi et al. (2013) and velocity by advances\
    \ \nin communication technologies like 5g Rath and Kumar \n(2018). Kaur et al.\
    \ even calls it Internet-of-Big-data (IoBd) \nKaur et al. (2020).\nThe processing\
    \ of this huge amount of data utilizes \nmany resources. Current IoT platforms\
    \ are mainly cen-\ntralized and lack the feature of resource-aware processing\
    \ \nin the sense of edge and fog processing Mineraud et al. \n(2016). Centralized\
    \ processing is generally sub-optimal \nsince it uses the WAN bandwidth highly\
    \ inefficiently due \nto sending all data to the cloud in order to process it\
    \ there. \nFurthermore, cloud computing induces high latency, high \nenergy consumption\
    \ and arises privacy concerns. There \nexists a rule of thumb that you prefer\
    \ computation over \ncommunication when considering resource-awareness. \nProperly\
    \ positioning the processing along the way from \nthe data sources to the sinks\
    \ is the intended strategy. Ena-\nbling edge and fog processing is crucial for\
    \ being resource \nefficient and for real-time low latency applications. The \n\
    data processing in IoT is geographically distributed by the \nnature of the ecosystem\
    \ Chandra et al. (2018); Heintz et al. \n(2015).\nTo summarize, this challenge\
    \ focuses on the following \nresearch question: How can a global query be distributed\
    \ \nin a geographically-distributed data stream management \nsystem considering\
    \ the limitations of the IoT ecosystem?\n7.1  Related work\nIn data stream query\
    \ optimization a query is optimized to \nimprove runtime performance in the sense\
    \ of throughput, \nlatency and resource usage. The throughput is wanted to \n\
    be as high as possible and states how many data points \ncan be processed in a\
    \ specific time unit. The latency is \nwanted to be as less as possible and states\
    \ the time it takes \nfrom a data point entering the processing pipeline until\
    \ \nthe very same data point being reflected in the results. \nThe resource usage\
    \ is wanted to be as low as possible and \nstates the usage of CPU, RAM, network\
    \ bandwidth and \neven battery-/energy-consumption.\nData stream query optimization\
    \ approaches can be cate-\ngorized in 11 classes. An optimization technique can\
    \ either \nchange the data flow/operator-graph or leave it unchanged, \ncan either\
    \ change the semantics of a query, which means \n87\nData-sharing markets for integrating\
    \ IoT data processing functionalities \n1 3\nthat the output will differ from\
    \ the original one, or leave it \nunchanged and can be applied statically before\
    \ runtime or \ndynamically during runtime. An overview of all the query \noptimization\
    \ categories is shown in Table 1.\nThe data stream query optimization category,\
    \ which the \nresource-awareness of data stream processing in IoT fits best, \n\
    is operator placement. This kind of optimization usually \nassigns data stream\
    \ operators to hosts and cores reducing \neither resource usage due to less communication\
    \ or better \nutilizes available resources Schneider et al. (2013); Hirzel \n\
    et al. (2014, 2018).\nAccording to Sharma et al. (2019) who did a survey on \n\
    cost-based distributed query optimizers there are two types \nof query optimization\
    \ procedures which are either cost-\nbased or heuristic.\nDaum et al. proposed\
    \ a framework called Data Stream \nApplication Manager (DSAM) Lauterwald et al.\
    \ (2012) to \ncontrol a network of heterogeneous data stream management \nsystems.\
    \ A cost model Daum et al. (2011) is used to mini-\nmize the overall processing\
    \ and communication costs where \nthe operator placement query optimization is\
    \ modelled as a \ntask assignment problem.\nXu et al. optimize data stream queries\
    \ for distributed/\nedge processing to minimize latency providing a framework\
    \ \ncalled QueryGuard Xu et al. (2018). They are also using a \ncost model and\
    \ a dynamic programming enumeration algo-\nrithm in combination with heuristic\
    \ rules to prune unsatis-\nfied branches in the search space. This approach also\
    \ guar-\nantees preserved privacy for edge computing.\nPietzuch et al. (2006)\
    \ propose a virtual stream-based \noverlay network using a multidimensional metric\
    \ space to \nfind a good latency bandwidth trade-off for operator place-\nment.\
    \ A spring relaxation algorithm minimizes the network \nutilization of a query\
    \ while keeping the latency low.\nFan et al. (2020) used reinforcement learning\
    \ to dynami-\ncally allocate resources to IoT tasks based on historical data.\
    \ \nThe sub-optimal decisions made in real time aim to mini-\nmize computational\
    \ and communication delay.\n7.2  Our approach\nTo enable resource-awareness in\
    \ the IoT ecosystem a dis-\ntributed data stream management system (DDSMS) is\
    \ devel-\noped. As a base, an existing data stream management system \n(DSMS)\
    \ is used which already provides mechanisms and \nabstractions to gain control\
    \ over the data flow. Data stream \nmanagement systems provide semantics for data\
    \ streams and \ndata steam operators enabling high-level query languages \nand\
    \ data stream query optimization.\nThe network of distributed data stream processing\
    \ nodes \nconsist of DSMS nodes and smart sensors. Those nodes are \ncontrolled\
    \ by a central unit, which provides holistic control \nfor the whole network and\
    \ is aware of all node and network \nproperties like bandwidth utilization and\
    \ latency. The DSMS \nnodes are fully fledged data stream management systems \n\
    and capable of processing streaming data using predefined \noperators. Whereas\
    \ the smart sensors provide an interface \nin order to remotely configure basic\
    \ edge processing on the \nsensor itself including select, aggregate and filter\
    \ operators.\nIn the central unit, different distribution strategies can \nbe\
    \ implemented which optimize the resource utilization for \nspecific parameters\
    \ according to a cost model like proposed \nby Wang et al. (2009). A resource\
    \ monitor tracks the per-\nformance of a global query executed under a certain\
    \ distri-\nbution strategy. The monitoring enables the evaluation of \ndifferent\
    \ operator placement strategies for specific use cases \nto minimize resource\
    \ utilization for constrained devices or \nthe overall system.\nThe existing data\
    \ stream management system Odys-\nseus Appelrath et al. (2012) is extended to\
    \ implement this \napproach.\n7.2.1  Resource‑aware dairy cattle activity monitoring\n\
    For demonstration purpose the approach above is applied to \nthe dairy cattle\
    \ activity monitoring.\nTable 1  Query optimization \ncategories\n#\nOptimization\n\

    \ are used to \nmonitor the cattle behavior in the prediction pipeline. The \n\
    prediction pipeline consists of the following steps: \n1. Measurement via sensor\
    \ system\n2. Segmentation\n3. Feature Calculation\n4. Prediction\nIn this pipeline,\
    \ there are many parameters, which need to be \ntuned to be resource-efficient.\
    \ In step 1 the data is generated \nand it may be best for prediction accuracy\
    \ to get as many \ndata as possible but for resource-efficiency you want to have\
    \ \na good trade-off between data frequency and accuracy.\nIn step 2 the sensor\
    \ data is segmented into windows \nwhere a good window size depends on the duration\
    \ of the \nactivities to recognize. However, the window stride param-\neter, which\
    \ configures the amount of window overlap, has \na direct impact on the computational\
    \ costs. Here you want \nto have a good window stride/accuracy trade-off reducing\
    \ \ncomputational costs arising from window overlap.\nIn step 3 the data points\
    \ segmented in windows are aggre-\ngated to features. Optimizing the resource-efficiency\
    \ of the \nfeature calculation relies on a good feature selection strategy. \n\
    You will get a higher accuracy including more features to \nthe model but there\
    \ might be a minimal feature subset which \nhas a nice feature/accuracy trade-off\
    \ reducing computational \ncosts and still fulfilling accuracy needs.\nIn step\
    \ 4 the trained models are fed with the features and \nthe activity is predicted.\
    \ Machine learning algorithms differ \nin computational prediction costs. Therefore,\
    \ choosing a ML \napproach providing less accuracy but reducing resource uti-\n\
    lization significantly is a viable optimization strategy in this \nstep. As project\
    \ complexity grows the amount of training \nmodels and their associated information\
    \ becomes complex \nand usually re-usability and sharing drops due to lack of\
    \ \nframework to manage this ML life-cycle process, paving the \nway to the CModel\
    \ challenge.\nBesides the distribution-agnostic resource optimizations \nmentioned\
    \ above there is another important point to think \nabout. It is crucial to decide\
    \ where which computation will \ntake place. The cloud processing approach which\
    \ sends all \nthe data from step 1 to the cloud and performs steps 2-4 \nthere\
    \ is obviously not optimal due to network bandwidth \nutilization. Computing steps\
    \ 2-3 on the edge and step 4 in \nthe fog or even steps 2-4 on the edge will perform\
    \ better \naccording to resource utilization.\nThe different processing steps\
    \ in the prediction pipe-\nline are implemented as data stream operators in a\
    \ DSMS. \nAccording to the proposed approach above different distri-\nbution strategies\
    \ can be evaluated in the monitoring sys-\ntem of the distributed data stream\
    \ management system to \nfind a resource-saving setup. Also the data stream operators\
    \ \nimplementing steps 1-4 can be parameterized to evaluate \nparameter settings\
    \ for the single processing steps.\n8  Related work\nThe landscape of the work\
    \ related to our discussion here \nis varied and multi-dimensional. It includes\
    \ topics such \nas: IoT, smart cities, data management, analytics, sensor \nnetworks,\
    \ communication protocols, and others. One way \nwe can understand this space\
    \ would be to simplify it into a \ntwo-dimensional vertical and horizontal space.\
    \ Vertically, \nwe will use the IoT architectural structure of: sensor/actua-\n\
    tor, device, gateway, middleware and application provided in \nGuth et al. (2016)\
    \ as a guide, as well as the definitions they \nprovide for these components.\n\
    Sensors and actuators are hardware components, whereas \na sensor measures parameters\
    \ of its physical environment, \nan actuator acts, controls or manipulates its\
    \ environment. A \ndevice is a hardware component as well that connects to a \n\
    sensor/actuator, it can process data from sensors or control \nactuators. Gateways\
    \ can be used to compensate communi-\ncation limitations of devices. IoT (Integration)\
    \ middleware \nserves as a middle point between applications and devices/\ngateways,\
    \ by processing or evaluating received data or send-\ning commands to be executed\
    \ by actuators Guth et al. (2016). \nHorizontally we can place orthogonal fields\
    \ of study that \nintersect with IoT such as smart cities, big data analytics,\
    \ \ndistributed data processing, sensor networks, etc. Figure 5 \ndepicts one\
    \ possible interpretation of the related work space.\nGubbi et al. (2013) present\
    \ an overall vision of IoT is \npresented that is influenced by wireless sensor\
    \ networks. In a \nsimilar vain Pike et al. (2019) applies the intersection of\
    \ IoT \nand sensor networks to the domain of healthcare. Alavi et al. \n(2018)\

    \ Hernandez et al. (2020) models intelligent data \npipelines using an actor-based\
    \ model for IoT-based applica-\ntions. The focus here is to support application\
    \ developers \nin building intelligent data processing actors in a common \necosystem.\
    \ To continue the look into data streams in IoT, \nElsaleh et al. (2020) present\
    \ a lightweight ontology to model \nIoT data streams to support easy data analytics\
    \ and event \ndetection services.\nTurning to existing IoT platforms that are\
    \ beyond research \nwork, we have recently been experimenting with Things-\nBoard5\
    \ and Cumulocity6 and the possibilities of using them \nin our stack. Both these\
    \ solutions implement the basic IoT \nrequirements, and in retrospect we don’t\
    \ see our work as \ncompeting with them but as integrating with them to ben-\n\
    efit from the rich support for communication protocols, and \ndashboarding.\n\
    Another horizontal dimension of work focuses on the \nrepresentation of domain\
    \ entities & assets relevant to the \nIoT platform, be they sensors, actuators,\
    \ users, or others. \nFor example, Mormul and Stach (2020) present a context \n\
    model for holistic monitoring and management of complex \nIT environments, to\
    \ be used in conjunction with the larger \nIoT platform. On the other hand, Sasidharan\
    \ and Somov \n(2014) propose a framework where these assets are modeled \nas either:\
    \ real world objects, virtual objects or composite \nvirtual objects. In many\
    \ ways such solutions have a similar \naim in representing data about domain entities\
    \ at different \nlevels of the IoT platform.\nThe challenges we tackle here can\
    \ be positioned in the \nspace depicted in Fig. 5. The CResource challenge covers\
    \ \nthe continuous space of device, gateway, sensor networks, \nand middleware.\
    \ The CQuality challenge touches on sensor, \ndevice, gateway, middleware, sensor\
    \ networks, smart cities \nas well as linked data. The CModel challenge, touches\
    \ on \nanalytics, smart cities, middleware, applications, and linked \ndata. Our\
    \ approach toward the CPrivacy challenge crosses \nthe IoT stack from sensors\
    \ up to middleware. And finally, \nthe approach we develop to IoT platform design\
    \ falls in the \nlinked data, middleware, and applications.\nAs distinguished\
    \ from the related work discussed ear-\nlier, in this paper, we combine paradigms\
    \ and focus on a \nset of data management problems at different levels of the\
    \ \ndata management stack. For example although an IoT plat-\nform is used as\
    \ a hub for many of the data streams it is not \nthe end goal in itself. Smart\
    \ city scenarios act as a problem \nscenario to motivate the choice of problems\
    \ to solve. Data is \nprocessed at different locations in the web of devices.\
    \ With \nour focus on enriching data quality information, provenance \nand data\
    \ descriptions, we provide new opportunities to work \nwith data. Integrating\
    \ that with the model management and \nlearning, it becomes and multi-function\
    \ data management \ntool-set that is applicable to both research and industry\
    \ use \ncases.\nThe work presented here extends our previous discus-\nsion in\
    \ Steuer et al. (2016) and adds new challenges such \nas model management, sensor\
    \ data quality and knowledge \nmanagement.\n9  Conclusion and future work\nFrom\
    \ the discussion in this paper, we can see that there are \nmany research challenges\
    \ left for data management in IoT \nthat go beyond the discussion of big data\
    \ processing.\nTo optimize data flows across the available edge-fog-\ncloud infrastructure\
    \ (CResource) to save energy and band-\nwidth, the system needs to be aware of\
    \ the operator seman-\ntics. Techniques from the well-known relational algebra\
    \ \ncan be applied to regain control over these heterogeneous \nenvironments.\
    \ However, the cost models used in this optimi-\nzation step need to be re-defined\
    \ to cover novel aspects like \nenergy-consumption of operators or privacy constraints\
    \ (if \ncertain raw data is not allowed to leave a processing node). \nIn addition,\
    \ the algebra might need to be extended to cover \nnovel operators like ML model\
    \ based prediction.\nSince most IoT systems are based on sensors, the achiev-\n\
    able data quality needs to be considered not only during \ninstallation, but also\
    \ online during operation of IoT sys-\ntems (CQuality). If we leave this task\
    \ to the applications, \nsystem-wide and consistent data quality control will\
    \ hardly \nbe achievable. While certain dimensions of data quality \nare application-specific,\
    \ we can model general data qual-\nity dimensions and how they depend on installation\
    \ context \nfor sensors. This model can then be used to auto-generate \nonline\
    \ quality assessment within large-scale IoT infrastruc-\ntures, thus dis-burdening\
    \ the application developers from \nthis tedious step.\nSince more and more sensor-based\
    \ IoT applications are \nbased on machine learning (ML) techniques, ex. for activ-\n\
    ity recognition, the management of the trained ML models \nbecome part of the\
    \ data management challenges (CModel). \nAs we can see from the use case of mobility\
    \ analytics and \nthe dairy cattle use case, the continuous life-cycle of ML \n\
    models raises the demand to keep the information about dif-\nferent ML over time\
    \ and space, so that we can manage and \nautomate all ML related tasks.\nA crosscutting\
    \ concern of large-scale IoT system is pri-\nvacy (CPrivacy), since devices often\
    \ collect raw data that \n5 https ://thing sboar d.io/.\n6 https ://www.softw\
    \ areag .cloud /site/produ ct/cumul ocity -iot.html.\n90\n \nN. Kasrin et al.\n\
    1 3\ncould be used to derive sensitive information, which is not \nalways needed\
    \ or even allowed. We discussed that issue \nwithin the use case of mobility data:\
    \ While individual mobil-\nity is highly sensitive, aggregated mobility is not.\
    \ To fully \nleverage the insights that we could get from such aggregated \nmobility\
    \ data, we need to develop trustable online tech-\nniques for anonymization. As\
    \ with data quality, the task of \nproper data anonymization should be provided\
    \ as standard \nfunctions from an IoT infrastructure so that its application is\
    \ \nnot dependent on the programming skill of single developer \nteams.\nFinally,\
    \ an approach to IoT platform design is needed to \nbe able to integrate such\
    \ heterogeneous data management \nfunctionalities under one roof. The approach\
    \ we follow is \ninfluenced by meta-data management approaches to enable a \n\
    higher level of system support within the IoT infrastructure. \nIn many IoT application\
    \ domains (ex. smart cities), these \ninfrastructures span different organizations\
    \ and stakeholders. \nHence, we propose the IB model and data-sharing markets\
    \ \nto support multiple groups, systems, and functionalities and \nintegrate their\
    \ data in an information-driven manner. The \nsuch structured information can\
    \ be used both by automa-\ntion system (ex. distributed query optimizers or data\
    \ quality \nassessment) and by human stake-holders, like developers, \noperators,\
    \ or even end users (ex. to gain transparency about \ninstalled systems in their\
    \ work environment).\nAs we can see from this discussion, data management for\
    \ \nlarge-scale IoT systems has still many unsolved challenges. \nWhile they all\
    \ could be tackled by individual software devel-\noped and within application-code,\
    \ it is key for long-term \noperation, maintenance, and transparency of such systems\
    \ \nto get more and more support by frameworks and higher-\nlevel programming\
    \ concepts like query languages. Like a \ndatabase system that hides many implementation\
    \ details like \ndata distribution or index usage, future IoT infrastructures\
    \ \nmight as well provide a high-level interface with pre-build \nsupport for\
    \ resource-aware query optimization, online qual-\nity assessment, ML model management,\
    \ privacy-preserving \ndata aggregation, and a cross-organizational knowledge\
    \ \nmanagement.\nFunding Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt\

  main_objective: 'This systematic review on automated systems for real-time irrigation
    management can be interpreted as follows:

    Addressing the global food challenge: The review aims to explore how automated,
    real-time irrigation management systems can contribute to the efficient use of
    water resources and enhance agricultural productivity to meet the growing demand
    for food.

    Evaluating the current state and future potential: The primary objective is to
    critically assess the current state of end-to-end automated irrigation management
    systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. The review also
    seeks to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the
    automated irrigation management system to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation
    management.'

  explanation: The study focuses on adaptive data preprocessing methods to handle
    heterogeneous and often inconsistent data from various sources during real-time
    data processing. These techniques are specifically designed to address data quality
    issues by employing advanced algorithms like data normalization, feature scaling,
    and data fusion techniques such as Dempster-Shafer theory and Bayesian inference.
  extract_1: Adaptive data preprocessing methods, such as data normalization, feature
    scaling, and data fusion techniques (e.g., Dempster-Shafer theory, Bayesian inference),
    are essential for dealing with varying data quality and formats from heterogeneous
    data sources.
  extract_2: These methods help ensure reliable data analysis and accurate decision-making
    in real-time automated irrigation systems.

    Abstract: The Internet of Things consists of “things” made up of small sensors\
    \ and actuators capable\nof interacting with the environment. The combination\
    \ of devices with sensor networks and Internet\naccess enables the communication\
    \ between the physical world and cyberspace, enabling the develop-\nment of solutions\
    \ to many real-world problems. However, most existing applications are dedicated\n\
    to solving a speciﬁc problem using only private sensor networks, which limits\
    \ the actual capacity\nof the Internet of Things. In addition, these applications\
    \ are concerned with the quality of service\noffered by the sensor network or\
    \ the correct analysis method that can lead to inaccurate or irrelevant\nconclusions,\
    \ which can cause signiﬁcant harm for decision makers. In this context, we propose\
    \ two\nsystematic methods to analyze spatially distributed data Internet of Things.\
    \ We show with the results\nthat geostatistics and spatial statistics are more\
    \ appropriate than classical statistics to do this analysis.\nKeywords: Internet\
    \ of Things; quality of data; data analyze; geostatistics; spatial statistics\n\
    1. Introduction\nNowadays, it is possible to easily access services and data through\
    \ the Internet from\nany place and at any moment. It can be observed from recent\
    \ decades that computational re-\nsources are becoming increasingly accessible\
    \ and more powerful. Furthermore, the number\nof devices connected at the Internet\
    \ has increased exponentially increase and is projected\nto amount to 75.44 billion\
    \ worldwide by 2025 (https://www.statista.com/statistics/47\n1264/iot-number-of-connected-devices-worldwide/\
    \ (23 November 2020)). According to\nCisco Annual Internet Report (2018–2023)\
    \ (https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/\ncollateral/executive-perspectives/annual-internet-report/white-paper-c11-741490.html),\n\
    the number of devices connected to Internet Protocol (IP) networks will be more\
    \ than\nthree times the global population by 2023. However, these numbers only\
    \ refer to devices\nsuch as computers, smartphones, and tablets; if considered\
    \ other devices such as sensors,\nthis number would be double easily. With many\
    \ connections, devices communicating with\nhumans and other devices have enabled\
    \ the development of a paradigm called the Internet\nof Things (IoT) [1].\nIoT\
    \ involves anything with network access, for instance, sensors to advise on localized\n\
    fertilizer amounts or targeted pesticide use, self-monitoring health systems,\
    \ air quality,\nand trafﬁc routing [2,3]. These sensors have the ability to transfer\
    \ data over a network\nwith or without requiring humans, and these data can be\
    \ provided in many forms, such as\nstreaming and discrete data, images, and social\
    \ media, among others. The combination of\nsensors network with the Internet enables\
    \ the communication between the virtual and the\nreal world, allowing the decision-making\
    \ without human intervention.\nSensors 2022, 22, 1693. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22051693\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 1693\n2 of 21\nAccording\
    \ to economic analysis from Cisco, “IoT will generate $8 trillion worldwide\n\
    in Value at Stake over the next decade. This will come from ﬁve primary drivers:\
    \ innova-\ntion and revenue ($2.1 trillion); asset utilization ($2.1 trillion);\
    \ supply chain and logistics\n($1.9 trillion); employee productivity improvements\
    \ ($1.2 trillion); and enhanced customer\nand citizen experience ($700 billion)”\
    \ (https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?\narticleId=1621819). By not\
    \ considering many factors that involve quality of service or even\na correct\
    \ data analysis, it can probably cause ﬁnancial losses to organizations. Some\
    \ real\ncases can be cited, such as the following: (1) Gartner has an annual cost\
    \ because of poor\ndata in 2014 on average of $13.3 million dollars [4]; (2) The\
    \ US Postal Service has ﬁnance\nlosses over $1.5 billion due to mail with wrong\
    \ data [5]. The US economy has ﬁnance losses\nof over $3 trillion a year [6].\n\
    The problem of data quality becomes complex and controversial with technology\n\
    evolution. With signiﬁcant ﬁnancial losses caused by weak data, these problems\
    \ have\nbecome the focus of much research from many perspectives. However, most\
    \ of these works\nare dedicated to solving a speciﬁc problem in a particular environment.\
    \ With close ﬂow,\nit is difﬁcult to consider the real capacity of IoT, since\
    \ there is no sharing of information.\nFurthermore, another problem is the accuracy\
    \ of data quality in decision-making.\nThe data quality and data accuracy are\
    \ also related to the data analysis [7–9]; i.e., an\nincorrect data visualization\
    \ or wrong method analysis could lead to misinterpretations\nor wrong decision\
    \ making, even if the data are collected correctly. In this context, this\narticle\
    \ puts forward a systematic approach to support the data analysis by considering\n\
    the sensor spatiality factor and geographic aspects. To validate this approach,\
    \ we applied\nthe methods on an extensive real-world database from the United\
    \ States Environmental\nProtection Agency (US EPA), speciﬁcally involving air\
    \ quality data; we describe the dataset\nin Section 4. The main contributions\
    \ of the paper are as follows:\n•\nA data analysis approach for outdoor sensors\
    \ based on geostatistic data: a non-classic\nstatistical approach to IoT data\
    \ analysis, which it is not used on the majority works,\ndue to the data limitation,\
    \ the scenario space of the analysis, and the fact that the data\nare not from\
    \ the real world;\n•\nA data analysis approach for outdoor sensors based on spatial\
    \ statistics: like the above-\nmentioned approach, however, here we analyze data\
    \ in a discrete space (delimited by\na boundary), and in geostatistic data, it\
    \ considers a continuous geographic area;\n•\nA structuring of several methods\
    \ from geostatistics and spatial statistics aggregated\nwith a multicriteria analysis\
    \ to compose a systematic data analysis on outdoor sensors:\nthis is our main\
    \ contribution, where we structured an outdoor sensors’ data analysis\napproach\
    \ considering the geographic data dispersion and conﬂicted indicators;\n•\nAn\
    \ assessment of the proposed method and comparing other works that apply classi-\n\
    cal statistics.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,\
    \ is works related to IoT\ndata quality and data analysis. Section 3 introduces\
    \ essential concepts to the method.\nThe proposed method analysis is described\
    \ in Section 4. A case study to apply the methods\nis presented in Section 5.\
    \ The application and comparison with the existing techniques are\ndescribed in\
    \ Section 6. Finally, Section 7 discusses the outcomes and recommendations for\n\
    further work.\n2. Related Works\nThe Internet of Things is a highly scalable environment\
    \ in which the data generated\nare tremendous. Thus, the quality of information\
    \ is becoming an issue of great interest\nin both the academic and the industrial\
    \ worlds. In this section, we discuss some of the\nworks related to data quality\
    \ in IoT. Moreover, we also discuss the practices related to the\napplication\
    \ domain of this paper and the related works to the methods that we proposed\n\
    as a solution to make the best data analysis with spatially distributed data.\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 1693\n3 of 21\n2.1. Data Quality in Internet of Things\nThere\
    \ are many works in the literature that address quality of service and data ma-\n\
    nipulation in IoT. For instance, some works apply a publish–subscribe methodology\
    \ to\nsimplify the integration between sensors and the cloud [10–12]. However,\
    \ these solutions\ndo not assess the accuracy of the data or the analysis.\nOther\
    \ works try to apply particular solutions, such as a model-driven framework, to\n\
    data quality management [13], and a Blockchain-based approach was attempted in\
    \ [14].\nThese solutions aim to improve IoT data quality and false data detection.\
    \ On the other\nhand, the solutions are applied in speciﬁc architectures and do\
    \ not present a robust analysis\nof the generated data.\nThere are some authors\
    \ who propose solutions on ontology-based [15,16], where they\nhad a focus on\
    \ identifying missing data or using the quality of information as an indicator\n\
    of IoT trust [15]. Although these solutions even present a math solution model,\
    \ they do\nnot present an assessment or application evaluation of the real-world\
    \ environment or even\nreal data.\nIn [17], the authors propose an attractive\
    \ solution for data cleaning by an incorrect\ndata detection method based on an\
    \ improved local outlier factor. Although the proposed\nmethod was used to detect\
    \ inaccurate data from ofﬂine data, the solution achieved excellent\nperformance\
    \ to identify poor data. However, this solution identiﬁes the incorrect data only\n\
    from the collection point and does not consider the visualization or analysis\
    \ method.\nAnother work with a similar proposal is [18], where the authors developed\
    \ a data\nquality analysis and cleaning strategy for wireless sensor networks.\
    \ For this, the authors\nstudied the impact of the relationship between different\
    \ indicators on the quality assessment\nduring data cleaning. Although the authors\
    \ performed some simulations, they did not\nevaluate the solution in a real-world\
    \ environment; moreover, just like the previous work,\nthey considered only the\
    \ data from the sensor’s point.\nThere are also several other works related to\
    \ the quality of data originating from the\nsensors [19–21]. In [19], the authors\
    \ designed a prototypical implementation of a distributed\nIoT middleware layer\
    \ to manage heterogeneous data sources. In [20], the authors propose\nan altruistic\
    \ approach to data quality assessment for sensor data. Furthermore, in [21],\n\
    the authors present a framework to evaluate and control data quality aspects when\
    \ dealing\nwith social and sensor data. However, all of these works address only\
    \ the data quality in\nthe collection point and speciﬁc scenarios; our proposal\
    \ aims to show how to visualize and\nbuild a correct analysis with IoT spatially\
    \ distributed data.\nThe authors of [7], speciﬁcally disucss the state of the\
    \ art of the data quality of the\nInternet of Things. According to [7], the data\
    \ generated in global scale deployment are\ntremendous, and there are many open\
    \ challenges related to data quality. The authors also\npresented a detailed survey\
    \ about quality features and the signiﬁcance of a robust and\naccurate data analysis.\
    \ In this paper, we apply geostatistics and spatial statistics to make a\nprecise\
    \ data analysis in IoT on the environmental context.\n2.2. Environment and Pollution\
    \ Context in IoT\nTo evaluate our proposal, we applied the methods on an extensive\
    \ real-world IoT\ndatabase from the United States Environmental Protection Agency\
    \ (USEPA), which we\ndescribed in Section 4. Notably, the environment subject\
    \ is also a relevant research topic.\nFor this reason, we also researched in the\
    \ literature on how the data are analyzed in\nthis ﬁeld.\nExciting work in this\
    \ ﬁeld analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on people’s lives and\nthe natural environment\
    \ [22]. For this purposed, the authors investigate the spatial and\ntemporal characteristics\
    \ of the Air Quality Index (AQI) before and during the pandemic in\nmainland China.\
    \ The authors present several analyses with respect to this theme; however,\n\
    all of them apply classical statistical analysis. In this paper, we show that\
    \ IoT spatially\ndistributed data request a different interpretation.\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 1693\n4 of 21\nThere also other works that utilized the USEPA dataset\
    \ to analyze the environmental\ncontext [23,24]. In [23], the authors conducted\
    \ a comparative study of AQI based on factor\nanalysis and USEPA methods for an\
    \ urban environment. Furthermore, in [23], the authors\ndid not use the USEPA\
    \ but used the same recommended method for health risk assessment\nin a similar\
    \ dataset in China. In both works, the authors used traditional statistics to\
    \ analyze\nspeciﬁc points, which could not show the real context of the region.\n\
    In the same ﬁeld, there is a project being conducted at the Alan Turin Institute\
    \ called\nLondon Air Quality (https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/london-air-\n\
    quality). This project utilizes city-wide air quality sensors to develop solutions\
    \ to un-\nderstand and improve air quality over London. This group’s research\
    \ has achieved im-\npressive results by applying machine learning algorithms and\
    \ proposing data science\nplatforms [25–30]. In this paper, we propose a different\
    \ solution by spatial autocorrelation\nanalysis, focusing on data analysis and\
    \ data visualization.\n2.3. Spatial Autocorrelation\nSpatial autocorrelation is\
    \ an association indicator from Geographic Information Science\n(GIScience) [31,32];\
    \ we discuss this in Section III. This theme has been subject of many\nstudies\
    \ [33]. In [34], the authors discuss the big spatiotemporal data analytics as\
    \ a research\nand innovation frontier, and one of the ﬁelds that is considered\
    \ promising is the IoT.\nThere are in the literature some authors who propose\
    \ applying geostatistics in the IoT\nenvironment in many different ways [35–37].\
    \ However, these works do not demonstrate\nthe application method with concrete\
    \ results, and they also do not propose a systematic\nway to apply the techniques—some\
    \ of them only discuss the potential.\nIn a recent study [38], the authors investigated\
    \ rainfall-related tweets to determine\nthe areal units that optimize spatial\
    \ autocorrelation patterns through the combined use of\nindicators of global spatial\
    \ autocorrelation and the variance of local spatial autocorrelation.\nIn our study,\
    \ we propose using the same technique to scale the ideal areal units to analyze\n\
    the data.\nIn this paper, we propose a systematic approach to support the data\
    \ analysis and the\ndecision makers by considering the sensor spatiality factor\
    \ and geographic aspects. For this\npurpose, we applied methods from the spatial\
    \ statistics and geostatistic ﬁelds.\n2.4. Proposal Highlight\nTo highlight our\
    \ contribution, we present in Table 1 the main features of the related\nworks,\
    \ with the following columns:\n•\nRelated work: reference to the related work\
    \ addressed;\n•\nEnvironment: the experimental environment, either Real world\
    \ (e.g., a prototype) or\nSimulator (i.e., a simulated experiments in a ﬁctitious\
    \ environment);\n•\nSpatial: whether the approach considers the spatial dispersion\
    \ in the analysis;\n•\nQoD: whether the approach considers the QoD attributes\
    \ in the data analysis;\n•\nMulti-criteria analysis: whether the approach treats\
    \ the problem as a multi-objective\nproblem and/or considers any conﬂicting objectives.\n\
    By analyzing Table 1, we can observe that our proposal focuses on accurate analysis.\n\
    For this purpose, we use only real-world data to validate our method, geostatistics\
    \ and\nspatial statistics to consider the spatial data dispersion, and a multicriteria\
    \ analysis to\nresolve the conﬂicting objectives. We present the results below.\n\

    \ Information Science\nSpatial statistics and geostatistics are methods from the\
    \ Geographic Information\nScience (GIScience) ﬁeld that encompass a wide array\
    \ of disciplines, such as geography,\ncartography, geodesy, statistics, and computer\
    \ science. GIScience considers the nature of\ngeographic information to develop\
    \ theories and methods for understanding geographic\nprocesses, relationships,\
    \ and patterns at different geographical scales [31,32]. GIScience\nalso includes\
    \ social disciplines that address issues and impacts on society.\n3.1. Spatial\
    \ Data Analysis\nIn the GIScience ﬁeld, the spatial data analysis is consider\
    \ a central topic. It deals\nwith “a collection of techniques and models that\
    \ explicitly use the spatial referencing asso-\nciated with each data value or\
    \ object that is speciﬁed within the system under study” [39].\nThese methods\
    \ are crucial to assess spatial relationships and assumptions in spatially\ndistributed\
    \ data.\nThere are two fundamental concepts in spatial data analysis: (1) spatial\
    \ autocorrelation,\nwhich refers to the degree of dependence from similar objects\
    \ near to others, and (2) spatial\nheterogeneity, which is related to structure\
    \ of these objects [40]. Analyzing these concepts\nmakes it possible to answer\
    \ questions such as “how much does the economics of one\nneighborhood inﬂuence\
    \ another?” and we also hope to answer the questions “what is the\ncorrect areal\
    \ unit to analyze a set of sensors?” and “How can spatially distributed data be\n\
    analyzed?”\n3.2. Spatial Autocorrelation\nThe geography scale, aggregation, and\
    \ detail level are essential to construct an appro-\npriate representation of\
    \ the world, i.e., according to the process of handling the aggregation\nof delimited\
    \ the unit spaces, the data could show different values and interpretations [40].\n\
    In this context, different measures from the real world can covariate, and understanding\n\
    the spatial correlation essence could help to understand the analyzed phenomena\
    \ better.\nSpatial autocorrelation is directly related with the ﬁrst law of geography\
    \ or Tobler’s\nlaw, which says “everything is related to everything else, but\
    \ near things are more related\nthan distant things” [41]. This law is a fundamental\
    \ premise for spatial statistics, and could\nalso be interpreted as a deﬁnition\
    \ for the positive spatial autocorrelation. The opposite of\nthe law implies a\
    \ negative spatial autocorrelation when places close to each other have\nhigh\
    \ spatial heterogeneity.\nThe interrelation between the features of a location\
    \ is an essential aspect of the geogra-\nphy data, which is crucial for real-world\
    \ comprehension [42]. However, this interrelation is\na challenge for classic\
    \ statistics due to the majority method to consider the independence of\nthe observations\
    \ without spatial correlation.\nSensors 2022, 22, 1693\n6 of 21\n4. Methods\n\
    To analyze spatially distributed data in IoT, we propose the use of two methods\
    \ from\nthe GIScience ﬁeld. The ﬁrst one (statistical spatial) is a framework\
    \ proposed by [38] based\non Moran’s index [43], and the second one (geostatistic)\
    \ is an interpolation method for a\ncorrect data visualization [44]. Table 2 describes\
    \ the main variables used in this work.\nTable 2. List of important notation.\n\

    4.1. A Framework to Deﬁnition of the Spatial Granularity\nTo measure the spatial\
    \ autocorrelation level, it is possible to use an index that may\nvary between\
    \ 1 and −1: 1 for the high positive spatial autocorrelation, −1 for high negative\n\
    spatial autocorrelation, and 0 for the absence of spatial autocorrelation [45].\n\
    There are two types of indexes for this association: a global and other local.\
    \ The global\ncoefﬁcient correlation measures the overall spatial autocorrelation\
    \ of the data set, with only\none index value. On the other hand, the local indicator\
    \ of spatial autocorrelation (LISA)\nmeasures different levels of spatial relationships;\
    \ it depends on the scale deﬁned, such as\ndistrict, county, state, country, etc.\n\
    The most common global and local indexes are calculated by Moran’s I. The global\n\
    Moran’s I is the result of the Equation (1) [46].\nI =\nn\n∑n\ni ∑n\nj wij\n·\n\
    ∑n\ni ∑n\nj wij(yi − y)(yj − y)\n∑n\ni (yi − y)2\n(1)\nwhere\nwij, is the matrix\
    \ unit weight, wij = 1 if i and j are neighbors, and wij = 0 otherwise;\nyi and\
    \ y represent the value and the mean of interest on location i;\nn is the total\
    \ observations; and, I is the Moran’s index, a metric used to test the hypothesis\n\
    about spatial autocorrelation.\nThe Moran’s I aims to test the spatial independence\
    \ (null hypothesis). In this context,\nthe null hypothesis is true if its value\
    \ is zero. Positive values, between 0 and 1, point to a\npositive autocorrelation,\
    \ and negative values, between 0 and −1, indicate negative autocor-\nrelation.\n\
    This local indicator utilization together with the global index improves knowledge\n\
    about the process from which the spatial dependence originates. The LISA makes\
    \ a speciﬁc\nvalue for each object, which can identify clusters, outliers, and\
    \ the existence of more than\none spatial pattern.\nSensors 2022, 22, 1693\n7\
    \ of 21\nAccording to [46], a LISA should adhere to two objectives: (1) to allow\
    \ the identiﬁcation\nof signiﬁcant spatial associate patterns and (2) to be a\
    \ decomposition from the global spatial\nassociation index. Equation (2) show\
    \ Moran’s LISA calculation.\nIi =\n(yi − y) ∑n\nj=1 wij(yj − y)\n∑n\ni=1(yi−y)2\n\
    n\n(2)\nwhere\nwij, is the matrix unit weight, wij = 1 if i and j are neighbors,\
    \ and wij = 0 otherwise;\nyi and y represent the value and the mean of interest\
    \ on location i;\nn is the total observations; and, Ii is the Moran’s LISA for\
    \ each map unit.\nIn Equation (2), an Ii > 0 means that i has values very similar\
    \ to its neighbors (positive\nspatial autocorrelation), and Ii < 0 means that\
    \ i has different values from the neighbors\n(negative spatial autocorrelation).\
    \ Furthermore, analogously to the global indicators,\nthe Moran’s LISA should\
    \ be evaluated by the pseudo-signiﬁcance test.\nAs demonstrated in [38], the determination\
    \ of an optimal areal unit for spatial analysis\nis a complex task owing to the\
    \ Modiﬁable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) effects, differences in\nthe ﬁelds of application,\
    \ and uncertainties and conﬂicts arising from the different potential\nspatial\
    \ indicators to be used. For this reason, it is necessary to select the candidate\
    \ solution\n(optimal areal unit) by a Pareto ranking [47].\nTo apply Pareto ranking\
    \ in this framework [38], in order to model a solution, let X be\na set of any\
    \ areal units with different levels of data aggregation. Each spatial granularity\n\
    of aggregation x ∈ X is characterized by different criteria that will be optimized\
    \ by a set\nof objective functions; in this case, the global and local indexes.\
    \ A vector containing m\nobjective functions φm can be represented by\nΦ(x) =\
    \ [φ1(x), φ2(x), · · · , φm(x)] ∈ Rm\n(3)\nA Pareto-optimal solution only contains\
    \ areal units that are not Pareto-dominated by\nany other areal unit [38]. In\
    \ general terms, an areal unit xi ∈ X dominates another xj ∈ X\nwhen it has satisﬁed\
    \ the following two constraints:\n(i)\n∀φ ∈ Φ : φ(xi) ⪯ φ(xj), and\n(ii)\n∃φ ∈\
    \ Φ : φ(xi) ≺ φ(xj)\nwhere ≺ and ⪯ correspond to the ‘general better’ and ‘better\
    \ or equal’ relations, depending\non whether the objective function refers to\
    \ maximization or minimization. It is possible\nto obtain more than one Pareto\
    \ Frontier according to the ranking or even two or more\nsolutions in the Pareto-optimal\
    \ areal units; in this case, additional human expertise is\nrequired for the selection\
    \ of a proper areal unit.\nIn Algorithm 1, we present a systematic way to use\
    \ this framework. First, we provide\nthe input data (line 1); in this paper, we\
    \ use a pollution data set described in Section 5.\nThe ﬁrst step of the method\
    \ is to model the candidate’s areal unit solution, and here it\ndeﬁnes the size\
    \ of the areal unit to make the data aggregation (line 3). In the second step\n\
    (line 4), it assesses the candidate’s areal unit by the deﬁned criteria; in this\
    \ case, they are\nthe global and local autocorrelation index (Global Moran’s I\
    \ and the coefﬁcient of variation\nof Local Moran’s I, respectively). The last\
    \ step is to select an “optimal” areal unit from the\nnon-dominated Pareto frontier\
    \ (line 5).\n4.2. Data Interpolation\nFor a coherent data visualization and correct\
    \ data measure, we apply a data interpola-\ntion method, namely Kriging [44].\
    \ This technique is a regression method from geostatistic\nto data interpolation,\
    \ i.e., to estimate values in unknown data points. In Figure 1, we show\nan example\
    \ situation, where we would like to know the temperature from a local that does\n\
    not have spatial information available.\nSensors 2022, 22, 1693\n8 of 21\nAlgorithm\

    \ areal unit (non-dominated solution)\n6: end for\n7: return Optimal areal unit\n\
    Figure 1. Example of the need to estimate a value that does not have spatial information\
    \ available.\nThere are many other data interpolation techniques in the GIScience\
    \ ﬁeld [42]. How-\never, the Kriging method allows for incorporating three factors\
    \ to improve the estimation\naccuracy: (1) local ﬂuctuation, which makes it possible\
    \ to analyze the spatial autocorrela-\ntion during the data interpolation; (2)\
    \ noise, which makes it possible to identify random\nchanges space independent,\
    \ i.e., detect errors in the collected data; and (3) incorporating\ngeneral trends\
    \ as an auxiliary variable, e.g., using a model with similar behavior to help\
    \ in\nthe estimation. More details about any of those factors can be found in\
    \ [42].\nKriging’s technique measures the surrounding values to derive a prediction\
    \ for a\nlocation with unknown data. The Kriging interpolation formula is formed\
    \ as a weighted\nsum of the data, as described in Equation (4).\nˆZ(S0) =\nN\n\
    ∑\ni=1\nλiZ(Si)\n(4)\nwhere\nZ(Si) is a known value at the location i,\nλi is\
    \ an unknown weight for the measured value at the location i,\nS0 is the location\
    \ with data unknown to the prediction, and\nN is the number of measured values.\n\
    In the Kriging method, the λi is dependent on a ﬁtted model to the value locations,\n\
    the spatial relationship among the known values that surround the prediction location,\n\
    and the distance from the known points to the prediction location. Therefore,\
    \ it is necessary\nto create the variograms and covariance functions to estimate\
    \ the statistical dependence to\nmake a ﬁtted model to the measured points. Details\
    \ about the ﬁtted model features, as well\nthe variograms and covariance functions,\
    \ can be found in [42].\nWe show in Figure 2 the systematic way that apply the\
    \ Kriging interpolation in\nthe IoT context. First, we normalize the input data\
    \ and build a shapeﬁle from the local\narea; the map is only for visualization.\
    \ The second step is to model the variogram (i.e.,\nSensors 2022, 22, 1693\n9\
    \ of 21\nto construct the ﬁtted model) and then apply the Kriging method. The\
    \ last step is to make\nthe map interpolation.\nTo normalize the data values,\
    \ we use the bestNormalize (https://cran.r-project.org/\nweb/packages/bestNormalize/index.html)\
    \ package from the R language. Furthermore,\nwe developed all of the systematic\
    \ methods in R, which are available in https://github.\ncom/Leonild/SpatialDataAnalysis.\n\

    5. Case Study\nIn recent years, high levels of pollution in speciﬁc dry periods\
    \ of the year have\nforced authorities to rethink the organizational strategy\
    \ of cities and propose drastic\nchanges in urban centers. According to the World\
    \ Health Organization (WHO) (https:\n//www.who.int/), half of the world’s population\
    \ lives in urban centers, and the estimate\nfor 2050 is that 70% of the population\
    \ will be urban [48]. This means that urban development\nwill have a direct impact\
    \ on human health.\nHuman health is affected by several correlated factors, factors\
    \ that go beyond the\npower of health agencies. These include residences, sanitation,\
    \ transportation, the energy\nsystem, and parks with green spaces, in addition\
    \ to decent jobs, education, and healthy\nfood [49].\nWith population growth,\
    \ by 2050, it is estimated that 2.5 billion people will inhabit\ncities in addition\
    \ to those who already inhabit them. This presents a unique opportunity to\nplan\
    \ cities that protect and promote public health through well-structured organization.\n\
    In this context, pollution has drawn a great deal of attention, causing irreversible\
    \ damage to\nthe planet, as well as global warming, respiratory diseases, and\
    \ extinction of microbiomes,\namong others [50,51].\nTo assess our approach in\
    \ this context, we chose an extensive real-world IoT database\nto analyze. This\
    \ database is from the United States Environmental Protection Agency\n(US-EPA)\
    \ (https://www.epa.gov/) (download available at aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/\n\
    download_ﬁles.html), which has millions of records (updated daily with new data)\
    \ to\nfour pollutants, Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Carbon Monoxide\
    \ (CO),\nand Ozone (O3). The database contains 28 ﬁelds described in Table 3.\
    \ These data come\nSensors 2022, 22, 1693\n10 of 21\nfrom sensors around all US\
    \ countries from the years 2000 until the present. We show in\nFigure 3 the position\
    \ of the sensors in 2020, including information about SO2.\nFigure 3. Positions\

    \ meaning of the colors is as follows: green,\nair quality is satisfactory, and\
    \ air pollution poses little or no risk; yellow, air quality is\nacceptable, but\
    \ there may be a risk for some people, particularly those who are unusually\n\
    sensitive to air pollution; orange, members of vulnerable groups may experience\

    \ members of the general\npublic may experience health effects, and members of\
    \ sensitive groups may experience\nmore serious health effects; purple, the risk\

    \ aim to determine the areal units that optimize\nspatial autocorrelation patterns\
    \ through the combined use of indicators of global spatial\nautocorrelation and\
    \ the variance of local spatial autocorrelation. Furthermore, we applied\nthe\
    \ Kriging interpolation method for data visualization. Thus, we validate our approach,\n\
    and at the same time, we contribute to solving a real-world problem.\nStudy Areal\
    \ Description\nTo evaluate the methods in these data, we chose two areal unit\
    \ dimensions: a large\none that involves the whole sensors described in Figure\
    \ 3, and a small one, which includes\nthe entire sensors in the state of California.\
    \ We choose California due to the high variability\nbetween sensors’ values and\
    \ the considerable number and distribution of sensors.\nAccording to United Nations\
    \ Statistics Division [52], the United States of America\n(USA) has a total area\
    \ of 9,629,091 km2, and California is the third-largest by area at\n423,970 km2\
    \ (it is also the most populous USA state). The surface in both areal unit\ndimensions\
    \ were partitioned into hexagonal areal units, where each spatial unit aggregated\n\
    the AQI’s pollutants. Furthermore, the hexagonal shape reduced the visual ﬁeld\
    \ bias when\ncompared with the square units [53].\n6. Computational Results\n\
    We implemented the experimental programs in Python (data prepossessing), and we\n\
    made the geostatistic and spatial statistical methods in the R language; this\
    \ made it possible\nto ﬁnd all code and experimental data in our public repository\
    \ (https://github.com/\nLeonild/SpatialDataAnalysis).\nTo evaluate our approach,\
    \ ﬁrst, we applied the framework described on Section 4.1\nto determine the areal\
    \ units that optimize the spatial autocorrelation patterns through the\ncombined\
    \ use of indicators of global and local spatial autocorrelation; this returns\
    \ what\nthe best areal unit to make data analysis is. Then, we applied the interpolation\
    \ method\ndescribed in Section 4.2, to an accurate data visualization. Furthermore,\
    \ we compared the\nresults with the works that use the classical statistics, to\
    \ provide evidence that the analysis\nmethod could lead to wrong interpretations.\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 1693\n12 of 21\n6.1. Spatial Statistics Analysis\nFollowing\
    \ Algorithm 1, we modeled the candidates’ areal units by regular hexagon\nshape,\
    \ and we determined the length of the sides in ﬁve scales: 100 km, 200 km, 300\
    \ km,\n400 km, and 500 km. Furthermore, we analyzed for all the pollutants, but\
    \ here, due to\nthe number of the images and very similar characteristics, we\
    \ present results for only one\npollutant (O3).\nFigure 4 shows Global Moran’s\
    \ I coefﬁcient and the coefﬁcient of variation of Local\nMoran’s I for the areal\
    \ units. Only some of the areal units show an improvement, with\nhigher Global\
    \ Moran’s I and lower coefﬁcient of variation of Local Moran’s I. The other\n\
    areal units just keep values that represent the absence of spatial autocorrelation\
    \ and with\nhigh variation of Local Moran’s I. In this experiment, an areal unit\
    \ of 200 km is linked to a\nhigher pattern of spatial association and lower spatial\
    \ heterogeneity than the other areal\nunits; i.e., the former provides more consistent\
    \ spatial patterns and is thus likely to reﬂect\nmore reliable analytical results.\n\
    To analyze the chart from Figure 5, we should remember the conﬂicting objectives\
    \ that\nwe considered; in this case, the ideal solution should have a higher Global\
    \ Moran’s I (GM)\nand a lower coefﬁcient of variation of Local Moran’s I (LM).\
    \ Let us look at Figure 5. We\nhave ﬁve possible areal units of data aggregated\
    \ to choose for analyzing: (1) 100 km with\na low LM and less high GM; (2) 300\
    \ km in the same context; (3) 500 km, which, however,\nhas a low LM but also has\
    \ a low GM; (4) the worst solution, 400 km, with a lower GM\nand a higher LM;\
    \ and (5) the areal unit of 200 km with the higher GM and the lower LM.\nTherefore,\
    \ according to the results of the multicriteria optimization framework in Figure\
    \ 5,\nthe Pareto-optimal solution is the areal units of 200 km. These areal units\
    \ dominate the\nother ones because their criteria are better; i.e., they are combined\
    \ with a higher Global\nMoran’s I and a lower coefﬁcient of variation of Local\
    \ Moran’s I. This means that the data\naggregated inside the 200 km areal unit\
    \ have a higher correlation than the others.\nFigure 4. Trade-off between the\
    \ global indicator of spatial association (Global Moran’s I) and the\noverall\
    \ degree of structural (in)stability (coefﬁcient of variation of Local Moran’s\

    \ Moran’s I coefﬁcients. Both global\nand local spatial statistics were computed\
    \ for a row-standardized spatial weights matrix based on\nﬁrst-order rook contiguity.\n\

    coordinates data sensors on the maps of the regular hexagons with the side lengths\
    \ of\n200 km, 300 km, 400 km, and 500 km. When we chose an arbitrary areal unit,\
    \ such as\n400 km or 500 km, we obtained different and discordant spatial patterns\
    \ when compared\nwith the Pareto-optimal areal units. In practice, this affects\
    \ the conclusions and may lead to\nmisunderstandings and mistakes by decision-makers\
    \ when applying the strategy to the\nIoT infrastructure planning.\nFigure 6. Comparison\

    \ of magnitude, we replicated the experiment to\na smaller area, in which we used\
    \ the same data but considered only the state of California.\nIn this new experiment,\
    \ we also modeled the candidates’ areal units by a regular hexagons\nshape; however,\
    \ we determined the length of the sides in scales of 100 km, 90 km, 80 km,\n70\
    \ km, 60 km, and 50 km.\nSensors 2022, 22, 1693\n14 of 21\nFigure 7 shows Global\
    \ Moran’s I coefﬁcient and the coefﬁcient of variation of Local\nMoran’s I for\
    \ the areal units in the California states. This makes it possible to observe\
    \ that\nall the areal units show different patterns from each other. In this experiment,\
    \ the areal unit\nof 80 km is linked to a higher pattern of spatial association\
    \ and lower spatial heterogeneity\nthan the other areal units; i.e., the former\
    \ provides more consistent spatial patterns and is\nthus likely to reﬂect more\
    \ reliable analytical results.\nFigure 7. Trade-off between the global indicator\

    \ considering\nthe California states.\nTo conﬁrm the conclusion above, we present\
    \ in Figure 8 the results of the multicriteria\noptimization framework, where\
    \ the 80 km areal unit is alone in the ﬁrst Pareto frontier.\nMoreover, it is\
    \ also possible to observe that the 50 km areal unit is isolated in the last Pareto\n\
    frontier; this means the lower pattern of spatial association and higher spatial\
    \ heterogeneity\nthan the other areal unit.\nFigure 8. Pareto frontier and trade-off\

    \ the\ngeographic coordinates data sensors on the maps of the regular hexagons\

    \ areal unit, such as\n50 km, we obtained different spatial patterns when compared\
    \ with the Pareto-optimal\nareal units. It is essential to highlight that this\
    \ affects the conclusions and may lead to\nmisunderstandings and mistakes by decision-makers\

    \ Interpolation\nTo compare the results of the data interpolation with works that\
    \ utilize classical\nstatistics in the same context, we used data from 2015 related\
    \ to O3 pollutants. Following\nthe systematic method presented in Figure 2, ﬁrst,\
    \ we normalize the data, and then we\nbuild the ﬁtted model. It is essential to\
    \ remember that the map from the location is only for\nvisualization.\nWe show\
    \ in Figure 10 the ﬁtted model used to apply the Kriging method. It can be\nobserved\
    \ that this variogram represents an exponential model; i.e., the spatial autocorre-\n\
    lation disappears entirely only at an inﬁnite distance, which means that the near\
    \ data are\nstrongly autocorrelated.\nSensors 2022, 22, 1693\n16 of 21\nFigure\

    \ of\nKriging interpolation to O3 data in the United States in 2015, where the\
    \ gradient color repre-\nsents the O3 AQI. If we chose an classical statistics\
    \ methods to represent the same data (e.g.,\na simple average) like other literature\
    \ works [23,24], we could obtain a map visualization\nlike Figure 12; the colors\

    \ state (Figure 12), we can\nmake incorrect interpretations about the data. For\
    \ example, considering the average by\ncountry, we can conclude that entire state\
    \ of California has air that could be a risk for some\npeople, particularly those\
    \ who are unusually sensitive to air pollution, which is not valid if\nwe look\
    \ to the interpolation data (Figure 10).\nAnother good example is the state of\
    \ Arizona, which looks like a state with totally\nhealthy air if we considered\
    \ the map in Figure 12 (data collected in few points). However,\nwe see in the\
    \ interpolation map from Figure 11 that it is entirely incorrect to consider the\n\
    Arizona state with entirely healthy air.\nWith the geostatistics in our proposal\
    \ (Kriging method), we can also estimate a pre-\ndiction value; i.e., we can analyze\
    \ the possibility of a factor that exceeds a predetermined\namount. Figure 13\
    \ shows the probability prediction of the O3 pollutant overtaking an AQI\nof 50.\
    \ The estimate ﬂoats from 0 (0%) to 1 (100%).\nFigure 13. Kriging method indicative\
    \ applied to O3 AQI in the United States (2015); the probability\nprediction that\
    \ the O3 pollutant overtakes an AQI of 50.\n6.3. Discussion\nBy summarizing our\
    \ results, we can observe that a classical statistical method is\ninadequate for\
    \ data analysis of outdoor sensors. Furthermore, only a geostatistic or spatial\n\
    static analysis may not be enough either. For this reason, we propose structuring\
    \ several\nSensors 2022, 22, 1693\n18 of 21\nmethods from geostatistics and spatial\
    \ statistic aggregated with a multicriteria analysis to\ncompose a systematic\
    \ data analysis on outdoor sensors.\nAlthough we present results only for the\
    \ environmental context, our proposal is\npromising for a free contextual application\
    \ in outdoor sensors’ data analysis. In the next\nsection, we discuss our proposal’s\
    \ limitation and future work.\n7. Conclusions\nThe combination of devices with\
    \ sensor networks and Internet access enables the\ncommunication between the physical\
    \ world and cyberspace, providing the development of\nsolutions to many real-world\
    \ problems through the IoT.\nIoT involves anything with network access with or\
    \ without human interaction re-\nquired, and the data from these “things” can\
    \ be provided in many forms, such as streaming\nand discrete data, images, and\
    \ social media, among others. The combination of the network\nof sensors with\
    \ the Internet enables the communication between the virtual and real world,\n\
    allowing the decision making without human intervention. However, a wrong decision\n\
    due to poor data quality or erroneous data interpretation can cause signiﬁcant\
    \ ﬁnancial\nharm to companies and institutions.\nThe problem of data quality becomes\
    \ complex and controversial with the evolution of\ntechnology. The data quality\
    \ and data accuracy are also related to the data analysis [7–9].\nIn this context,\
    \ we presented in this paper a systematic approach to support the data analysis\n\
    by considering the sensor spatiality factor and geographic aspects. Moreover,\
    \ we applied\nthe methods on an extensive real-world database from the United\
    \ States Environmental\nProtection Agency (US EPA).\nFirst, we determined the\
    \ areal units that optimize the spatial autocorrelation patterns\nthrough the\
    \ combined use of indicators of global and local spatial autocorrelation, which\n\
    showed what the best areal unit to make data analysis is. Next, we applied the\
    \ Kriging\ninterpolation to an accurate data visualization, and we also provided\
    \ evidence that the\nreport given only by the classical statistics could lead\
    \ to wrong interpretations.\nAlthough we validate our proposed method only in\
    \ the environmental context, we\ncould apply this analysis in any context, including\
    \ a free-context method. However,\nto validate it as it would be validated with\
    \ a free-context method, we would need to realize\nthese speciﬁc analyses. Furthermore,\
    \ it is important to highlight some limitations in the\nexperiments:\n•\nWe only\
    \ did ofﬂine experiments.\n•\nDue to the analysis time, we could not use this\
    \ method in critical applications without\nsubstantial modiﬁcations.\n•\nIt is\
    \ necessary to validate this method in other contexts to ensure that our proposals\n\
    have a free context application.\nIn future work, we intend to perform experiments\
    \ and analysis in micro-regions with\nother study cases, where we hope to evaluate\
    \ the decision-making as well. Furthermore,\nwe also aimed to apply the spatial\
    \ autocorrelation to deduce the correct spatial distributed\nsensor dimensions.\
    \ In another context, we intend to do a performance evaluation to\nconclude if\
    \ it is feasible to use our approach in real-time execution for critical applications.\n\

  key_findings: Adaptive data preprocessing methods can significantly improve the
    quality and reliability of data used for automated decision-making in real-time
    irrigation management systems. Data normalization and feature scaling techniques
    can effectively handle varying data formats and scales, while data fusion techniques,
    such as Dempster-Shafer theory and Bayesian inference, can combine data from different
    sources to improve accuracy and reliability.
  limitations: The study does not provide a detailed evaluation of the computational
    complexity and scalability of the proposed data preprocessing methods, which may
    be important considerations for large-scale real-time irrigation management systems.
  main_objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of adaptive data preprocessing methods
    for handling varying data quality and formats from heterogeneous data sources
    in real-time irrigation management systems.

    are known to be vulnerable to a variety of attacks due to lack of central authority
    or fixed network infrastructure. Many security schemes have been proposed to identify
    misbehaving nodes. Most of these security schemes rely on either a predefined
    threshold, or a set of well-defined training data to build up the detection mechanism
    before effectively identifying the malicious peers. However, it is generally difficult
    to set appropriate thresholds, and collecting training datasets representative
    of an attack ahead of time is also problematic. We observe that the malicious
    peers generally demonstrate behavioral patterns different from all the other normal
    peers, and argue that outlier detection techniques can be used to detect malicious
    peers in ad hoc networks. A problem with this approach is combining evidence from
    potentially untrustworthy peers to detect the outliers. In this paper, an outlier
    detection algorithm is proposed that applies the Dempster-Shafer theory to combine
    observation results from multiple nodes because it can appropriately reflect uncertainty
    as well as unreliability of the observations. The simulation results show that
    the proposed scheme is highly resilient to attackers and it can converge stably
    to a common outlier view amongst distributed nodes with a limited communication
    overhead. Published in: 2009 Tenth International Conference on Mobile Data Management:

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Taipei, Taiwan SECTION 1. Introduction A
    Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork (MANET), as its name suggests, has no fixed infrastructure,
    and is generally composed of a dynamic set of cooperative peers, which are willing
    to share their wireless transmission power with other peers so that indirect communication
    can be possible between nodes that are not in the radio range of each other. The
    nature of MANETs, such as node mobility, unreliable transmission medium and restricted
    battery power, makes them extremely vulnerable to a variety of attacks [1] [2].
    Wireless links, for instance, are generally prone to both passive eavesdropping
    and active intrusion. Moreover, there are various sophisticated attacks that are
    difficult to identify, such as greyhole attacks [3], blackhole attacks [4], wormhole
    attacks [5], and Sybil attacks [6]. Another security concern in ad hoc networks
    is caused by the cooperative nature of the nodes. Attacks from external adversaries
    may disturb communications, but the external intruder generally cannot directly
    participate in the cooperative activities among the nodes, such as routing, because
    they do not possess the proper secure credentials, such as shared keys. However,
    compromised nodes, which are taken over by an adversary, are capable of presenting
    the proper secure credentials, and consequently can interfere with almost all
    of the network operations, such as route discovery, key management and distribution,
    and packet forwarding. Misbehavior surveillance and detection is a crucial method
    that has been used in MANETs to protect them from both external adversaries and
    internal malicious nodes. The misbehaviors observed by neighboring peers typically
    include dropping, modification, misrouting of packets at the network layer, as
    well as false Request/Clears in the MAC layer etc. Nevertheless, many of these
    events may occur due to environmental and mobility related reasons, not just malicious
    intent. For instance, a packet may get dropped when a node''s buffer gets full
    because of its inability to forward packets on a noisy channel. Most of the current
    misbehavior detection schemes rely on either a predefined threshold, or a set
    of well-defined training data to infer thresholds. This threshold is used in the
    detection mechanism to separate malicious behaviors from what is normal given
    the conditions. However, it is generally difficult to set appropriate thresholds,
    because the network is quite dynamic and unpredictable, and environmental conditions
    such as ambient RF noise can vary. Moreover, collecting training datasets representative
    of an attack ahead of time is also problematic. Since the adversaries can constantly
    modify their attack patterns, which may contain location (attack target), type,
    and degree (amount of packets affected) of the attack, it is also difficult to
    gather the training dataset that can appropriately predict the attack pattern
    of the adversaries. On the contrary, we do not need to rely on any previous knowledge
    to find a node that is an outlier with respect to a given observable. In order
    to disrupt communications or launch some other attack, the malicious node will
    have to behave in a way distinct from the “good” nodes. So we can detect node
    misbehaviors by means of outlier detection. Outlier detection is generally an
    important step prior to almost all kinds of data analysis routines. Outliers are
    normally defined as data points that have significant difference from the rest
    of the data according to a certain measure [7], [8]. Outlier detection is used
    to either eliminate or amplify outliers: the first is to reduce the noise in the
    data; the second is to expose the outliers for further analysis. In this paper,
    we develop and evaluate a gossip-based outlier detection algorithm for mobile
    ad hoc networks. In our approach, all the peers in MANETs observe and record the
    abnormal behaviors of their neighbors in a manner similar to existing methods
    such as [9], [10], [11], [12]. In contrast to most existing approaches, each peer
    will then calculate its local version of outliers based on its own observations.
    In the next stage, the peers exchange their local views with their immediate neighbors,
    and they update the local views if the received views are more accurate than their
    own views. The updated local views will be further broadcast to the immediate
    neighbors. The process continues, and it will not halt until there is no more
    view update amongst the peers. The most important step in the proposed outlier
    detection algorithm is the local view update step. In this step, we need to derive
    the updated local view of outliers from multiple local views provided by our (one
    hop) peers. However, the peers may be giving us inaccurate data, either from malicious
    intent or out of ignorance. The contribution of this paper is to see if correct
    outlier decisions can be made in presence of potentially unreliable views. We
    use both the weighted voting method and the Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) [38]
    of evidence to combine the local views from multiple neighbors. The Dempster-Shafer
    theory of evidence is particularly well suited for this type of problem because
    it can capture uncertainty. Furthermore, Dempster''s rule for combination can
    be used to fuse together multiple pieces of views from both reliable and unreliable
    observers. Some important features of our algorithm are: (1) its deployment does
    not rely on any priori knowledge, such as pre-classified training dataset or pre-defined
    security threshold; (2) it is compatible with different outlier detection heuristics;
    (3) it is resilient to attempts by misbehaving nodes to defeat it; (4) it is resilient
    to the motion and failure of nodes in MANETs; (5) it is efficient in terms of
    communication overhead; and (6) all the nodes will stably converge to a common
    view of outliers as long as these nodes do not change their behaviors significantly
    during the convergence time of the algorithm. In the rest of this paper, we give
    a survey of related work in Sec. 2. In Sec. 3, we present our outlier detection
    algorithm. We evaluate the effectiveness of our scheme through simulation in Sec.
    4, and conclude in Sec. 5. SECTION 2. Related work 2.1. Outlier detection Outlier
    detection is a long studied topic in the data mining research, and a variety of
    outlier detection approaches have been proposed for different application domains,
    such as large-scale databases [13], [14], [15], high-dimensional datasets [16],
    [17], [18], and wireless sensor networks [19], [20], [21], [22]. Notably, Branch
    et al. [22] propose an in-network outlier detection scheme to detect the outliers
    in wireless sensor networks. In this scheme, all the sensor nodes will first calculate
    the local outlier(s). Then some messages, which contain the local outlier(s) as
    well as some other supportive information, will be exchanged amongst all the nodes.
    The message exchanging process will not halt until all the nodes have the same
    global view of outlier(s). Our proposed outlier detection algorithm is somewhat
    similar to the method proposed by Branch et al. However, there are three significant
    differences between the two methods. First, the method by Branch et al. does not
    consider the mobility of the nodes, whereas our proposed method takes the mobility
    issue into consideration. Second, there is no malicious behaviors in the discussion
    of the method by Branch et al., i.e., the nodes will not deliberately fabricate
    fake local views or alter incoming local views in their method. On the contrary,
    we have considered the malicious behaviors of the nodes, and applied the knowledge
    of trust and reputation as the countermeasure to the malicious behaviors. Third,
    the method by Branch et al. has not taken uncertainty of the local views into
    consideration: they assume that the information exchange and dissemination process
    amongst the nodes is reliable, and no uncertainty will be introduced to the local
    views during this message exchange process. On the contrary, we have considered
    uncertainty of the local views that may be introduced during the message exchange
    process. 2.2. Misbehavior detection in mobile ad hoc networks Work on misbehavior
    detection (may also be called as intrusion detection) has produced very rich literature
    in traditional, P2P and ad hoc networks. In the latter, most contributions assume
    that there is no fixed network and security infrastructure that misbehavior detection
    mechanism can rely on. Four types of misbehaviors in ad hoc networks are identified
    and discussed in [23], which are failed node behaviors, badly failed node behaviors,
    selfish attacks, and malicious attacks. These four types of node misbehaviors
    are classified with respect to the node''s intent and action. Remarkably, selfish
    attacks are intentional passive misbehaviors, where nodes choose not to fully
    participate in the packet forwarding functionality to conserve their resources,
    such as battery power; malicious attacks are intentional active misbehaviors,
    where the malicious node aims to purposely interrupt network operations. The existence
    of selfishness and malicious behaviors has motivated research in the area of misbehavior
    detection for mobile ad hoc networks. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is an essential
    means to detect various node misbehaviors. Several approaches have been proposed
    to build IDS on each individual peer due to the lack of a fixed infrastructure
    [10], [24], [25], [26]. In these approaches, every node is equipped with an IDS
    sensor, and each IDS sensor is assumed to be always on, which is apparently not
    energy efficient given the limited battery power of nodes in ad hoc networks.
    In contrast, Huang et al. [27] propose a cooperative intrusion detection framework,
    in which clusters are formed in ad hoc networks and all the nodes in each cluster
    will take over the intrusion detection operations in turn. This cluster-based
    approach can definitely reduce the power consumption for each node. Routing misbehavior
    is another kind of malicious activity that is common in ad hoc networks. If an
    attacker aims to degrade the network service of ad hoc network, then he can try
    to compromise some nodes in the ad hoc network, and use them to disturb the routing
    services so as to make part of or the entire network unreachable. Marti et al.
    [28] introduce two related techniques, namely watchdog and pathrater, to detect
    and isolate misbehaving nodes, which are nodes that do not forward packets. There
    are also some other proposed solutions that aim to cope with the routing misbehaviors
    [29], [30], [31]. There is little work in which the Dempster-Shafer Theory has
    been applied to MANETs. The two most relevant research efforts are discussed in
    [40] and [41]. In [40], DST is utilized to combine the direct observation results
    from each IDS sensor, whereas we are using DST to combine views of outliers. Raya
    et al. [41] proposed a trust management scheme for VANET, in which DST is used
    to combine multiple evidences for trust. Nevertheless, there are two major differences
    between our work and theirs. First, there are strong logical relationships among
    the local views in our work, because an updated local view is always derived from
    the previous local views. On the contrary, the report of evidence in [41] may
    be independent. Second, DST is used to combine the local views in real-time in
    our approach. On the other hand, in [41], DST is not applied to combine evidences
    in real-time. In our previous work [32], we have done a preliminary study where
    outlier detection method is adopted to identify node misbehaviors. However, we
    merely utilize weighted voting method to fuse together multiple pieces of local
    views, which may not perfectly reflect uncertainty in the local views. Here we
    apply the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence to combine multiple local views,
    and compare their performances under different criteria in simulation. SECTION
    3. Gossip-based outlier detection algorithm The aim of our gossip-based outlier
    detection algorithm is to identify the top k outliers in terms of some abnormal
    behaviors observed by neighbors, such as packet drops or modifications. Here k
    is a user-defined parameter, and it can be assigned any positive integer value.
    Gossiping in MANETs generally refers to the repetitive probabilistic exchange
    of messages between two peers in MANETs. By the utilization of restricted gossiping
    method in the outlier detection algorithm, the communication overhead of our algorithm
    can be noticeably bounded. 3.1. Preliminaries We denote node as a system entity
    in mobile ad hoc networks that is capable of observing the behaviors of other
    entities within its radio transmission range, and exchanging these observations
    with other entities in its radio transmission range. A neighbor of a node A is
    defined as a node that resides within A''s radio transmission range. The type
    of abnormal behaviors that each node constantly observes can be fully user- defined
    as long as all the nodes observe the same set of abnormal behaviors. While a node
    observes and records the abnormal behaviors that its neighbors demonstrate, it
    also keeps track of the total amount of incoming packets it has observed for each
    neighbor. When a node needs to summarize its observation and thereby form its
    local view of outliers, it will calculate the rate of abnormal behaviors over
    the all behaviors it has observed for the node. For example, if all the nodes
    choose to observe the behaviors of packet drop, modification and misroute, then
    the packet drop rate (PDR), packet modification rate (PMOR) and packet misroute
    rate (PMIR) can be defined as follows, respectively. PDR= Number of Packets Dropped
    Total Number of Incoming Packets PMOR= Number of Packets Modified Total Numer
    of Incoming Packets PMIR= Number of Packets Misrouted Total Number of Incoming
    Packets View Source We define the trustworthiness of a node N k as a real value
    θ k that can properly reflect the probability with which the node will perform
    the exact actions that it is supposed to take. θ k can be assigned any real value
    in the range [0], [1], and the higher the value of θ k , the node N k is more
    reliable and has a higher probability to take the correct actions. For instance,
    some nodes are deployed with stronger encryption mechanisms, closely monitored
    by certain security surveillance system, and better protected against various
    attacks. Given that they are generally less likely to perform faulty actions,
    they are regarded as more trustworthy. The trustworthiness θ k of a node N k is
    defined as a function of all misbehaviors that other nodes have observed for the
    node N k . Namely, the trustworthiness θ k is calculated as follow. θ k =1− ∑
    i P i ∗ M ki View Source Here P i denotes the punishment factor for the i -th
    misbehavior, which indicates the severity degree of its outcome. M ki represents
    the rate of this misbehavior over the total observed behaviors. For example, if
    packet drop, packet modification, and packet misroute are the three exact misbehaviors
    we are observing, then θ k can be derived as follow. θ k =1− P drop ∗PDR− P modification
    ∗ PMOR − P misroute ∗PMIR View Source In our outlier detection framework, trustworthiness
    of nodes is initialized and updated by a trust management scheme described in
    Sec. 3.3. 3.2. Framework description The outlier detection algorithm has the following
    four steps, viz. local view formation, local view exchange, view combination,
    and global view formation. In this algorithm, we have utilized two methods to
    properly combine multiple local views, which are weighted voting and the Dempster-Shafer
    theory of evidence, respectively. Fig. 1 illustrates our framework. Figure 1.
    Gossip-based outlier detection framework Show All Prior to the local view formation,
    each node observes and record the behaviors of their neighbors, and also keeps
    track of the total number of incoming packets each of their neighbors has. Based
    on their observations, the initial local view of outliers is generated. We may
    note that there are a variety of definitions for outliers. Here we adopt two well-known
    distance-based definitions: (1) distance to the nearest neighbor (NN), and (2)
    average distance to k nearest neighbors (k-NN ) [13]. Once all the nodes form
    their initial local views, they broadcast their initial local views to all of
    their immediate neighbors, i.e., all the nodes that are within their direct radio
    transmission ranges. When a node receives a local view from one of its neighbors,
    it then checks whether the incoming view differs from its own local view. If so,
    it combines the two views, and rebroadcasts the combined view to its immediate
    neighbors. If not, it simply retains its local view and keeps silent. Unlike the
    traditional gossiping method, the more the number of nodes that accept the same
    view of outliers, the less the number of new view updates that are sent out. Here,
    we assume that all the nodes will not add any new observation results of their
    own to their own local views once they start exchanging local views with their
    neighbors. Ultimately, the algorithm converges to a global view that all the nodes
    hold. The global view is regarded as a snapshot that can properly illustrate the
    comprehensive observation results of all nodes at the time spot when the nodes
    start exchanging their views. Due to node mobility and changing network topology,
    the status of nodes and the network changes over time. Therefore, the global views
    will get outdated. To address this problem, we can periodically repeat the outlier
    detection process in order to keep the global views up-to-date. The repeat interval
    can be determined by both the availability of resources (bandwidth, battery power,
    etc.) and the levels of node mobility as well as topology change. 3.3. Trust management
    A variety of trust and reputation management approaches have been studied during
    the past decades for instance [33], [34], [35]. All of these trust management
    approaches can fit our system. For the experiments presented in this paper, we
    adopt a simple but well-defined trust management scheme, in which each nodes trustworthiness
    θ k is initially set to a default value. A peers θ k is modified whenever we obtain
    any novel information regarding its trustworthiness in terms of both direct observation
    results from the node itself and indirect observation results from other nodes.
    Direct observation results and indirect observation results are generally called
    first-hand information and second-hand information, respectively [36]. First let
    us see how the direct observation results are obtained and utilized in our trust
    management scheme. As we have mentioned, trustworthiness θ k is initially set
    as 1. Whenever a node observes any misbehavior of its neighbor k ) it reduces
    θ k according to the punishment factors. These can vary for different misbehaviors.
    For instance, packet drop and packet misroute are both misbehaviors. Nevertheless,
    packet drop may be caused by either intentional malicious behavior or power failure.
    On the contrary, if we observe packet misroute by a node, it is more likely that
    this is a deliberate act. This observation is also true for packet modification.
    Therefore, we set a higher punishment factor for both packet modification and
    packet misroute than for packet drop. With the limited radio transmission range
    as well as the mobility of the nodes, it is highly unlikely that a node can have
    the opportunity to observe the behaviors of all other nodes in MANETs. Hence,
    it is essential to integrate second-hand information obtained from other nodes
    to our trust management scheme. However, since malicious nodes can intentionally
    disseminate falsified second-hand information to their neighbors so as to disturb
    the trust management scheme as well as protect themselves from being disclosed,
    second-hand information from other nodes may not be trustworthy at all times.
    Therefore, it is necessary to adopt a proper method to combine multiple pieces
    of second-hand information from both trustworthy and untrustworthy neighbors.
    In our trust management scheme, we may utilize either weighted voting or the Dempster-Shafer
    theory to appropriately integrate multiple pieces of second-hand information into
    the first-hand information that each node directly observes. Fig. 2 shows the
    trust management scheme. Figure 2. Trust Management Scheme Show All 3.4. View
    combination View combination is the most important step in our outlier detection
    algorithm. Because some of the incoming views are not reliable, it is essential
    to find a view combination technique to properly fuse together multiple pieces
    of views. Among the various data fusion techniques, Bayesian approaches [37] and
    Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence [38] are two of the most frequently used techniques.
    There are two fundamental differences between DST and Bayesian theorem. First,
    unlike the definition in the Bayesian theorem, the lack of knowledge about an
    incident is not regarded as a negative evidence for that incident in DST. Second,
    given that there are two incidents in DST that are inconsistent with each other,
    the uncertainty about one of them may be viewed as the positive evidence for the
    other incident. In one word, in DST a node can hold either supportive or uncertain
    opinion toward an event, whereas a node must pick either positive or negative
    attitude toward an event in Bayesian theorem. For instance, suppose a node A observes
    that its neighbor B has dropped 10% of its incoming packets. Then according to
    our definition of PDR in Sec. 3.1, the PDR for node B is 0.1. If we apply the
    Bayesian approach in this example, then we may draw a conclusion that node B has
    90% probability to properly forward the incoming packets, with which we can easily
    conclude that node B is a good node. However, if node A observes 10% packet drops
    because of node movement and attack pattern change (e.g. switch from packet drop
    to packet modification), then we should not have drawn the conclusion that node
    B is good. On the contrary, in DST, we still compute PDR as 10%, but we will mark
    the rest 90% as “uncertain” instead of a refutal of evidence, which makes the
    decision process more realistic. Hence, the Dempster-Shafer theory is more suitable
    when there is uncertainty or even no priori knowledge for the event. In our outlier
    detection framework, each node initially builds its local view for its neighbors
    based on its own observations. Due to the node mobility and limited radio range,
    each node may only observe a part of its neighbors'' behaviors. As a result, the
    initial local views may be biased, and they definitely contain uncertainty. In
    this light, we believe that DST fits well in our framework. In DST, probability
    is replaced by an uncertainty interval bounded by belief and plausibility. Belief
    is the lower bound of this interval and represents supporting evidence. Plausibility
    is the upper bound of the interval and represents non-refuting evidence. For instance,
    if a node N observes that one of its neighbors, say node M , has dropped packets
    with probability p , then node N has p degree of belief in the packet dropping
    behavior of node M and 0 degree of belief in its absence. The belief value with
    respect to an event α i and observed by node N can be computed as the following.
    be l N ( α i )= ∑ e: α e ⊂ α i m N ( α e ) View Source Here α e are all the basic
    events that compose the event α i , and m N ( α e ) represents the view of the
    event α e by node N In our case, since node N only get a single report of node
    M from itself, i.e., α i ⊂ α i . Thus, we can conclude that be l N ( α i )= m
    N ( α i ) . The equation pls( α i )=1−bel( α i ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ) holds for belief and
    plausibility. Therefore, in our example, we can get the following: be l N (M)=
    m N (M)=p and pl s N (M)=1−be l N ( M ¯ )=1 . Given that belief indicates the
    lower bound of the uncertainty interval and represents supportive evidence, we
    define the combined packet dropping level of node A as the following. p d A =bel(A)=m(A)=
    ⨁ k=1 K m k (A) View Source Here m k (A) denotes the view of node k on another
    node A . We can combine reports from different nodes by applying the Dempster''s
    rule, which is defined as following. m B (A)⊕ m C (A)= ∑ q,r: α q ∩ α r =A m B
    ( α q ) m C ( α r ) 1− ∑ q,r: α q ∩ α r =Φ m B ( α q ) m C ( α r ) View Source
    As a comparator, we consider the Weighted Voting method (WV) in our framework.
    As the name suggests, weighted voting method adds up the multiple pieces of views
    with each view weighted by the corresponding trustworthiness to yield the updated
    view of outliers. The weighted voting method can be expressed as: V= ∑ i=1 N w
    i ∗ V i View Source SECTION 4. Performance evaluation In this section, we examine
    the performance of our outlier detection framework. We compare the two view combination
    techniques: DST and WV (which we have recently proposed [32]) against the baseline
    scheme, which utilizes the siMple aVerging method (MV). 4.1. Simulation setup

    our simulation, nodes either abide by various MANET protocols, such as AODV routing
    protocol, or their behaviors deviate from the protocol definition either intentionally
    (i.e. attackers) or unintentionally (i.e. faulty nodes). Both attackers and faulty
    nodes can do harm to the network functionalities, and consequently we regard them
    both as adversaries. In general, adversaries can partially or completely drop,
    modify or misroute any packet that is sent to them. We also assume that they can
    deploy the Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack by continuously sending out Request-To-Send
    (RTS) packets so as to improperly occupy the communication channel all the time,
    which is also regarded as the RTS flood attack. The adversaries may mix all these
    misbehaviors so that it will be more difficult to identify their misbehaviors
    if observed only from one or two perspectives. More importantly, the adversaries
    are capable of deliberately injecting faulty data and spreading these fake data
    to other benign nodes. In this way, the benign nodes may be induced to generate
    faulty reports in which benign nodes can be misclassified as misbehaving nodes.
    4.3. Simulation results The goal of the simulations is to observe the performance
    of our algorithm under different parameter configurations. We have compared the
    performance of our algorithm under the following five conditions: different number
    of nodes, different simulation areas, different radio ranges, different percentage
    of malicious nodes, and different node motion speeds. The simulation results are
    showed in the following Fig. 3 through Fig. 7. Figure 3. CR, CO, CT with different
    number of nodes (number of malicious nodes: 5, area: 600m ×600m, radio range:
    120m, motion speed: 5m/s) Show All Figure 4. CR, CO, CT with different simulation
    areas (number of nodes: 50, number of malicious nodes: 5, radio range: 60m, Motion

    of nodes: 100, number of malicious nodes: 5, radio range: 120m, area: 600m×600m)
    Show All Figure 6. CR, CO, CT with different transmission ranges (number of nodes:
    100, number of malicious nodes: 5, area: 600m×600m, node motion speed: 5m/s Show
    All Figure 7. CR, CO, CT with different percentage of malicious nodes (number
    of nodes: 100, radio range: 120m, area: 600m×600m, node motion speed: 5m/s) Show
    All Fig. 3 exhibits the performance of our algorithm with different number of
    nodes in the network. From Fig. 3 we find that when the number of nodes is increased,
    the algorithm yields a higher correctness rate, but it also introduces more communication
    overhead. This is consistent with our analysis because the information gathered
    to identify the outliers is generally more accurate if there are more observers.
    At the same time, more messages need to be exchanged amongst all the nodes to
    reach a consistent view when there are more nodes. We also note that the both
    DST and WV demonstrate better performance than MV. Moreover, DST has better performance
    over WV in terms of higher correctness rate, lower communication overhead, and
    shorter convergence time. In Fig. 4, we can find the different performance of
    our algorithm with different simulation areas. It is clear that the correctness
    rate decreases as we increase the simulation area for all three methods. We also
    find that the communication overhead is reduced as the simulation area becomes
    larger. Since the nodes have a lower probability to communicate with other nodes
    if the simulation area becomes larger, the correctness rate will surely become
    lower. Moreover, there will also be less communication overhead, and it will generally
    take longer time for all the nodes to reach an agreement on the global view of
    outliers. Similarly as Fig. 3 implies, we can find that both DST and WV produce
    better performance that MV. Moreover, we also note that DST always wins over WV
    in terms of correctness and convergence time when simulation area enlarges. However,
    there is no significant difference between DST and WV in terms of communication
    overhead. The simulation results with different motion speeds are shown in Fig.
    5. We may conclude from Fig. 5 that while the nodes travel in a higher speed,
    the performance for all the methods become worse. This is true because it is harder
    for the nodes to exchange their views when they are traveling in a higher speed.
    However, in spite of the performance downgrade for all the methods, DST still
    achieves a far better performance than both WV and MV when the nodes move fast.
    With a higher mobility of the nodes, it is more difficult for the nodes to exchange
    their views. Hence, there is higher uncertainty in the network. Since DST is suitable
    to deal with the problems with uncertainty, the performance downgrade introduced
    by node mobility is minimized for DST. Fig. 6 illustrates how the simulation results
    differ with different transmission ranges. We find that with a smaller radio range,
    all the three methods suffer from a performance degradation. When it is more difficult
    for the nodes to exchange the local views, the correctness rate of the final global
    view will surely be degraded. Fig. 7 shows the simulation results with different
    percentage of malicious nodes. It is obvious that DST can yield a much better
    performance than WV and MV with a higher percentage of malicious nodes. This is
    true because both WV and MV rely on enough trustworthy information to make a correct
    decision: MV simply follows the decision from the majority of nodes, and the weights
    in WV are also significantly determined by the second-hand information sent by
    other nodes. Hence, when there are a higher percentage of malicious nodes, the
    performances of both WV and MV degrade noticeably. On the other hand, DST can
    properly handle the outlier detection problem even in a more hostile environment
    because it can well deal with unreliability. SECTION 5. Conclusion In this paper,
    an outlier detection framework is proposed that aims to reveal the malicious nodes
    in a MANET environment. We apply both the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence and
    the weighted voting method to combine observation results from multiple nodes.
    The simulation results show that the proposed framework is highly resilient to
    attackers and it can converge stably to a common outlier view amongst distributed
    nodes with a limited communication overhead. One possible future work is to apply
    the Bayesian inference (BI) method to the view combination process, and compare
    the performance of DST with that of BI. Since BI has been widely used to fuse
    together various pieces of evidence, each of these two methods should outperform
    the other in some circumstances. Moreover, some of the misbehaviors, such as packet
    dropping, may result from both intentional denial of forwarding and mobility or
    channel effect. Hence, it will be valuable to try to discriminate malicious nodes
    from faulty nodes. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More

    Abstract Information about human social activities and relationships are exploited
    by an ever increasing number of proposed applications and protocols in several
    scenarios, given the consequent increase in the system performance. Examples are
    data transmission over delay tolerant networks, content recommendation in search
    engines, and advertisement of products and services. An emerging field where social
    networks are being exploited is the Internet of Things, where smart objects connect
    to the network to bring the real world into the virtual dimension. Objects capable
    to communicate on social network sites are able to enter into their owners’ social
    loop so as to automatically publish information of interest for selected communities
    of people and to perform some related automatic actions. In so doing, not only
    can objects be part of the human social networks but they can also build their
    own social network. As a consequence, interactions among them can be fostered
    towards the development of complex services for the direct benefit of people.
    Accordingly, objects mimic the human behavior towards a scalable and effective
    service discovery and composition as well as trustworthiness management. On the
    basis of the importance achieved by this trend in the last couple of years, in
    this paper we intend to review the adopted approaches towards the exploitation
    of social network concepts by the Internet of Things, the technologies behind
    these, and the potentialities. Previous article in issue Next article in issue
    Keywords Internet of ThingsSocial networksSmart objects 1. Introduction The number
    of objects that are currently accessing the Internet, side-by-side to human beings
    to advertise, search for, and accessing enhanced services is growing exponentially.
    Among them are sensors, actuators, wireless and mobile devices, or simply every-day-life
    objects enhanced with capabilities to interact with the external world through
    the Internet. This is a clear signal that the much-vaunted (and sometime abused)
    Internet of Things paradigm is already turned into a reality on which there is
    a strong convergence of the interests of researchers, users, and industries. As
    a main effect, we have today a new approach available to build enhanced applications
    and services involving the communications among objects on the Internet to the
    service of the human beings. Several studies have focused their attention to the
    definition of architectural models and solutions towards the use and the inter-connection
    of Web-enabled objects using open protocols and well-known architectural styles,
    REST and SOAP based Web services (such as, [1], [2]). As a consequence, the obvious
    evolutionary step of the IoT is the so called Web of Things (WoTs) that envisages
    new scenarios and applications where Internet enabled objects become active actors
    and peers in the Web. Sample services, applicable to Smart Cities or Smart Homes,
    are given below: • The car driver knows about the status of her car and of the
    roads on the path towards her destination. Such awareness is achieved by accessing,
    through her mobile phone (or through any communication technology in her car),
    web services that are fed by data collected from sensors scattered both in her
    car and in the areas of interest. • The domestic appliances may be accessed by
    the owner through web services from remote sites and some actions can be performed
    on them to prepare comfortable conditions for a better welcome home. • Eco-compatible
    houses may be equipped with controllers and sensors able to measure the local
    energy production and consumption and manageable through web services towards
    a reduction of the environmental impact. Besides the obvious advantages of the
    depicted sample scenarios, one cannot hide the doubts on the ability of the proposed
    solutions to effectively harness the full potential of the new paradigm without
    colliding with the limitations of the current Web service platforms in the presence
    of trillions of additional actors (objects, precisely). In our opinion, Web of
    Things is a paradigm which goes in the right direction but is not the solution
    to the cited issues. To foster resource visibility, service discovery, object
    reputation assessment, source crowding, and service composition in a Web populated
    by people and countless things there is the necessity to strongly push towards
    solutions that exploit concepts directly derived from the sole platforms that
    currently seem to be able to effectively allow peer-to-peer exchanges among huge
    numbers of actors, i.e., Social Networks. Even if several aspects of the social
    networking among humans cannot be directly applied to the objects’ world due to
    the specific distinctive characteristics (e. g., high heterogeneity and limited
    intelligence), such a need has brought to a substantial convergence of the “Internet
    of Things” and “Social Networks” domains. Interesting ideas have recently appeared
    in the IoT arena, which testify to the interests in Social Network oriented solutions
    for the Internet of Things. People at the User Experience Lab at Ericsson Research
    started from the idea that the complexity of network solutions that underlie the
    Internet of Things are hardly understood (and mentally accepted) by all users.
    Thus, it is wise to make this complexity completely transparent during the user-thing
    interactions. Differently, the concept of “friendship” and ‘social relations’
    are understood by virtually everyone, as they are intuitive concepts. As a consequence,
    they proposed a solution to both the practical scalability and understand-ability
    issues which is simply “dressing” a network of things as if it was a social network
    [3]. They have been the first to introduce the concept of “Social Web of Things”
    and also made some applications’ prototypes. Further studies and implementations
    of this concept have been carried out around the world. An example is given by
    the work in [4], where the authors propose a Social Web of Thing Framework based
    on the Restful Web Service and Social Networks, discuss the relevant key technologies
    and use cases, and introduce a case study named MagicHome. Furthermore, even a
    prototype of a scalable architecture for a large scale social Web of Things for
    smart objects and services, named Paraimpu, has been developed [5]. In line with
    this evolutionary path, but from a different perspective, the authors of [6],
    [7] introduce the concept of Social Internet of Things. In analogy with the social
    networks of human beings, they (i) define of a notion of social relationship among
    objects, (ii) design a reference architectural model implementing a social Internet
    of Things based on codified inter-object relationships, (iii) analyze the social
    network structure, which derives from the objects interactions based on the defined
    social relationships. The examples above make us realize that the time is ripe
    for a serious reflection on the possible ways of integrating objects into social
    networks, whether they are shared with those of their owners or they are independent
    and autonomous. Aim of the present paper is to analyze the potentials of a synergic
    use of Social Networks and Internet of Things concepts towards the deployment
    of effective service platforms able to face the future challenges of a future
    world of trillions of inter-connected objects. We will illustrate the main solutions
    that are appearing in the IoT arena to let things enter the so called “social
    loop” and compare their points of strength and their weaknesses by also highlighting
    their technological requirements and architectures. This paper is organized as
    follows. In Section 2 we present the technologies behind the Web of Things as
    one of the prevailing approaches towards the integration of the objects into the
    Internet. In Section 3, we describe how this paradigm can be extended by providing
    the things with the capabilities to take part to the human social activities on
    relevant social network websites. In Section 4 we describe a complementary approach
    that allows objects to build their own social networks, so that interactions among
    them can be fostered towards the development of complex services. In Section 5
    we present the ongoing projects that come out from the concepts described in the
    previous sections. Finally, in Section 6 we draw final conclusions. 2. Web of
    Things paradigm and technologies The ongoing evolution of the Internet of Things
    towards the Web of Things (WoTs), where Web-enabled smart objects connect and
    communicate with each other by using the Web, has raised several research issues
    ranging from the adoption of the right protocol and communication paradigms to
    the choice of the most suitable architectural styles. WoT was not born as a field
    in academic research but rather as the attempt to build an ecosystem from an heterogeneous
    variety of services and products, often not conceived in a way to interoperate.
    Several efforts have focused their attention to the definition of architectural
    models and solutions, towards the use and the interconnection of Web-enabled objects,
    which exploit open protocols and well-known architectural styles, such as Representational
    State Transfer (REST) and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) based Web services.
    In [8], an architecture is defined for the development of composite applications,
    to interconnect physical devices, on top of the open and simple standards that
    made the success of the Web (REST, XML, HTTP, or Atom). The layered architecture
    is composed as follows: • Device accessibility layer: a layer that from the application
    point of view enables consistent access to all kinds of connected objects. • Find-ability
    layer: a layer that, given an ecosystem of billions of smart things, allows for
    finding their services. • Sharing layer: although device accessibility and find-ability
    can technically allow for sharing data too, this layer is specifically designed
    to manage a social circle authentication, based on accounting and authorization
    procedures. • Composition layer: a layer that enables users to create composite
    applications on top of smart things. The overall goal of this layered architecture
    is to facilitate the integration of smart things with existing services on the
    Web and to facilitate the creation of Web applications by using smart things.
    The layers above are not directly mapped onto the ISO OSI model, but are rather
    useful to understand the foundations of WoT as an ecosystem. The next subsections
    analyze the main aspects relevant to the design choices for architecting the WoT.
    These include: the architectural style (SOAP/REST), the degree of centralization,
    the device/thing degree of accessibility to the network, and the ways in which
    data, services and objects can be composed together. 2.1. SOA(P) vs. REST The
    choice between the SOAP and the REST software architecture styles deserves a deeper
    investigation. In [9] the authors go towards the definition of an architecture
    where devices are viewed as services, in order to integrate a wide range of physical
    devices into distributed IT enterprise systems adopting a Service-Oriented Architecture
    (SOA). In a similar way, the projects WS4D7 and SOCRADES [10] apply a SOA approach
    to the context of embedded networks. Moreover, existing standards for Web Services
    (WSs), focused on embedded devices, such as Device Profile for Web Services (DPWSs)
    [11], confirm a real consensus and effort towards a SOAP-based WoT. On the other
    side, some recent research works (i.e. [12], [13], [14]) adopt REST for IoT/WoT
    architectures. According to the experience documented in [13], the programmatic
    complexity of SOAP based services is not well-suited for the end-user to create
    ad hoc applications, while the authors of [14] state that, in many cases, the
    SOAP complexity becomes superfluous whereas RESTful services can support “a la
    Mash-up” integrations. In a RESTful architecture, the main resources, such as
    entities, collections, or anything else that is worth being represented in the
    application domain, are uniquely identified by its own URI. The reference methods
    - in this case, the HTTP verbs - are mapped onto application semantics in a very
    simple and straightforward way. Many new Internet companies (see the trends in
    Fig. 1) that face the market, often prefer to provide their services through a
    RESTful API rather than a solution based on SOAP. This suggests that, probably,
    REST is more immediate and less expensive for rapid prototyping. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. REST API vs. SOAP API in Google trends. The main advantages
    of REST web services can be summarized as it follows: • Lightweight – not a lot
    of extra XML markup. • Human Readable Results – in some cases (i.e., a GET request
    of a resource representation), RESTful services can be directly invoked by typing
    the URL in a common web browser. • Easy to build – no toolkits required. SOAP
    also has some advantages mainly related to the formal definition of service interfaces:
    • Easy to consume – clients can be automatically generated on the basis of the
    exact specification provided in the WSDL document. • Rigid – type checking adheres
    to a programming contract and XML schemas are provided for data exchanged to filter
    unacceptable inputs/outputs. • Development tools and business process definition
    (e.g., BPEL language). Even if the locution “Web Service” was often associated
    to the SOAP stack, this is not the way the Web works. Whereas SOAP is aimed at
    the next phase of Internet development defining a set of brand new specifications,
    REST is more the realization that the existing principles and protocols of the
    Web are already there to create robust Web services. Summarizing, even if the
    strong type checking of SOAP based Web services is a plus, in the context of the
    IoT, the RESTful Web Services have some advantages over SOAP such as less overhead,
    less parsing complexity, statelessness, and tighter integration with existing
    HTTP. Moreover, the RESTful protocol called CoAP [15] is similar to HTTP but re-designed
    especially for devices with small footprint and constrained computing environments.
    According to the recent studies mentioned in this paper it seems that the use
    of standards like CoAP and EXI and web paradigms are the key factors for extending
    the Internet making the vision of the IoT become reality. 2.2. Device accessibilty
    It is useful to explore how things can be classified according to their computation
    and communication capabilities. The following list provides a coarse classification:
    • Virtual Things. Like web sites, e-mail boxes and social networks, just to mention
    some. These “objects” can be easily wrapped and then referenced in a HTTP addressing
    space like resources (REST) or like services (WSDL) or they already provide such
    abstractions and interfaces. • HTTP-enabled Smart Appliances. Like wireless printers,
    networked screens, and smartphones. These are already equipped with a network
    connection and a complete HTTP stack but usually do not provide a WS stack; thus,
    it is necessary to deploy a proxy or to install a minimal WS stack in the device,
    where possible. Usually, HTTP-enabled objects are not able to receive incoming
    requests from outside. In many cases, they are deployed under firewall restrictions
    and only can act as clients. One possibility is to deploy in the middle a relay
    like YALER [16], which enables secure Web access to embedded systems behind a
    firewall/NAT/network gateway. A simple HTTP handshake makes a Web service running
    on the hidden device accessible from any HTTP client. Another option is WebSocket,
    which provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
    The WebSocket API is being standardized by the W3C, and the WebSocket protocol
    has been standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455. • Internet-enabled Things that
    are not equipped with a complete HTTP stack but can still communicate at the TCP/IP
    or UDP/IP level. For those objects it is straightforward to build a HTTP wrapper
    and a WS stack as a proxy. A viable protocol alternative to HTTP is CoAP [15].
    CoAP could be viewed as a compression or redesign of HTTP by taking power, memory,
    and computation constraints into account. Just like HTTP, which is designed as
    a transfer protocol for traditional web media content, CoAP is redesigned as a
    transfer protocol for devices to implement interoperations. • Network-enabled
    Things that cannot communicate over IP networks, but still can communicate with
    different protocols like ZigBee, Bluetooth or X10. For those objects a proxy can
    be deployed to present them in the HTTP addressing space, by also using WS technology
    standards. A viable solution to extend IP also to small devices that usually are
    not equipped with IP-stack is 6LoWPAN [17]. • Things not digitally enabled, bare
    physical objects. For these objects a digital counterpart must be built and published
    online. RFID or barcode sticks can be used to interface these objects with devices
    and networks. 2.3. Centralized vs. decentralized Decentralized architectures have
    a number of theoretical advantages, such as single-point-of-failure robustness
    and privacy/anonymity enforcing capability. When analyzing the Web, one discovers
    that (i) the degree of decentralization is quite low, (ii) the prominent topology
    is client–server, and (iii) even if P2P networks have gained popularity in some
    application areas, the idea to move computation at the boundaries of the Internet
    is more a niche than a main stream. The distinction between client–server and
    P2P architectures is no longer a technological distinction, but a matter of governance.
    The so-called “clouds” often adopt their own solutions of P2P load-balancing and
    fault tolerance, but the control is centralized in the hands of one provider.
    Cloud computing and Software-as-a-Service demonstrate that large IT companies
    are concentrating computation inside large globally distributed infrastructures;
    thus, transforming personal computing in a mere user interface to remote computing
    services. Also, in the new field of Internet-enabled objects, we foresee that
    P2P connections between objects are unlikely to occur unless hard real-time and
    multimedia communications are involved. A centralized online service can speak
    multiple protocols and data formats on top of HTTP and can act as a broker to
    let services meet in a logical space; it can be a proxy of data coming from sources
    and can be a relay of data to consumer services; moreover, it can make data format
    adaptation where required. In other words, it can operate at all the layers described
    above, from device accessibility to composition. In a centralized WoT tool the
    workload is put at the extreme. Some applications need to have samples on every
    second, and even only one thousand sensors connected to a central server would
    produce 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 = 86400000 events per day. The load is structured
    in many small HTTP POST messages with a keep-alive connection. The requirements
    for a cloud-based Web of Things architecture (see Fig. 2) can be summarized as
    it follows: • C10 K+[18] capable web servers (C10 K + stands for 10,000 or more
    HTTP connections handled simultaneously, i.e. non-blocking servers that do not
    map every connection to a system thread); • database engine able to be horizontally
    partitioned over a grid of machines in a transparent way (sharding); • event handling
    and data processing delegated to a pool of worker processes distributed among

    but insightful benchmark between a non-blocking web server, like Nginx, versus
    a thread-based server, like Apache, is presented. The plots show (Fig. 3, Fig.
    4) how the throughput of Nginx are still high even with a large number of connections
    and with a very low memory usage. Nevertheless, the WoT system designer must consider
    that to fully gain an advantage from a non-blocking Web server, all the components
    in the backend must be designed to be non-blocking as well. Download : Download

    (threaded) web servers [19]. 2.4. Smart objects in service orchestrations A big
    issue in composing objects/services to form an application logic, is how to ensure
    that data coming from a data source can be properly read and processed by a recipient
    data sink. The intuitive, but not widely practicable solution, is to adopt a rigorous
    set of data schemas shared by all participants. In this way connections could
    be handled with no pains because every object that consumes data is able to receive
    and to decide what to do with the data. Unfortunately, having a common set of
    data types defined and shared for all interconnected objects is far to be realistic.
    Objects are built from different manufacturers for vertical applications, often
    inside walled gardens or with small capabilities to interoperate with external
    entities. A more realistic assumption is to consider objects able to produce data
    in a format among those commonly encapsulated into HTTP messages. So we can expect
    that a data source can push a string containing either numbers or alphanumeric
    values, or more structured data like JSON objects or XML instances. As an example,
    Paraimpu [20] implements the concept of mapping as a couple of expressions in
    the form of (cond, repl), where cond is a boolean expression while the repl expression
    is a valid instance of the data type expected by the sink (the actuator). This
    approach can be subsumed in the more general IF-THEN paradigm applied to events,
    data and actions in the IoT. The online service called IFTTT (IF This Than That),
    although initially conceived for social networks and not for physical mashups,
    is the immediate proof-of-concept of how this mechanism can work. Also other sensor
    data collectors like COSM (former Pachube) implements the concept of trigger (IF
    condition on datum THEN post datum on URL). A more versatile approach is to use
    business process definition to declare a more complex composition logic. In the
    case of SOAP-based WoT mashups, interactions can be described in two ways: executable
    processes and abstract processes. Both can be modeled by BPEL. Executable processes
    model the actual behavior of a participant as interactions, while abstract processes
    describe the observable behavior and/or process template. BPEL extends the WS-∗
    interaction model to enable business transactions. BPEL defines an interoperable
    composition model that enables the extension of automated process integration
    both within and between businesses. Pintus et al. [21] also propose a SOA framework
    where smart things are described by using the WSDL standard, while logical connections
    between smart things are modeled as web services orchestrations by using the BPEL
    language. The availability of an API to be consumed by clients, of course, opens
    also the possibility to write third-party programs or scripts in arbitrary programming
    languages and build applications as a result of the composition of data coming
    from source objects, processed and transformed into actions for other smart objects.
    3. Adding the social aspect to WoT To date, IoT has been conceived as a top-down
    technology that silently takes the control of objects in a machine-to-machine
    internetworking with large benefit for logistics, manufacturing, and business
    productivity. On the other hand, the point we stress here is that for IoT/WoT
    to acquire some socialization value, end-users should be enabled to be active
    and creative in the definition of new relationships where smart things become
    either an instrument or a toy to share or to play with collaboratively. In this
    respect, it is important to provide users with enabling platforms, based on known
    and understandable metaphors, to manage, control and personalize the composition
    between sensor data and actions in the real life. In order to enable a wide adoption
    of WoT in all sectors of the society, the WoT architecture and its protocols should
    motivate every citizens to contribute to a growing number of devices and smart
    objects in order to build new streams of information available to the community.
    We can identify at least two generic use cases. The first one is the participatory
    sensing and the second one is the “device in a circle”. Participatory sensing
    applications use data of mobile sensor nodes collected in collaboration with the
    device owner. With the right tools, community groups may participate in campaigns
    to collect data on highly-focused topics, such as traffic patterns, pollution-safe
    routes for school buses, without waiting for an institutional body or private
    agency to perform the detection. For example, the NoiseTube project [22], started
    in 2008 at the Sony Computer Science Lab in Paris and currently hosted by the
    BrusSense Team at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, proposes a participative approach
    for monitoring noise pollution by involving the general public. For users to become
    active in the bottom-up construction of a participatory sensing scenario, aspects
    like trust, reputation, control of distributed devices and tracking of information
    flows must be appropriately adjusted to control what is happening with the information
    and devices contributed. The identities of users are not harvested and should
    be kept anonymous while on the other hands the management of reputation of the
    data produced must be deployed to allow the participatory sensing to become effective
    and discard malicious or irrelevant data. In the “device in the social circle”
    use case the social-ability is a key element to share and collaboratively use
    the smart things in the Web. Device accessibility layer and findability layer
    can technically allow sharing as well, but to manage physical objects in a social
    circle, features like authentication, accounting and authorization need to be
    properly designed and implemented. Integrating smart objects and main-stream social
    networks is another key aspect. Every WoT system who aims to become popular and
    adopted by users, should integrate and communicate with social media in some way.
    In some extent, existing social media are the precursor of the future social IoT
    because they have already faced a number of issues like privacy concerns, content
    moderation, insights visualization and so forth. The integration of Social media
    and Web of Things can occur in many ways: • User login/authentication: users can
    access a system by using existing credentials without building a brand new profile.
    Thanks to the Oauth protocol, the user is redirected to her/his preferred social
    tool to perform the login. This leads to the immediate benefit to have contacts/friends
    imported in the new system. In this way, it would be possible for a generic WoT
    site to connect its users with their Facebook or Twitter counterparts. • Social
    network as monitoring tool, for instance the IoT portal [23]: it allows users
    to quickly connect sensors and actuators to the system, and then create dashboard
    visualizations as Facebook applications. These applications allow users to share
    and monitor sensed data and control actuators in the real world. • Sensors/actuators:
    a social entity, such as user’s Facebook wall and the Twitter flow associated
    to an hashtag, can be considered a sensor or an actuator (or both) just like physical
    things in the implementation of virtual-to-physical mashups. For instance, the
    “device in the circle” could be a set of parking sensors and the social circle
    could be the list containing the customers’ contacts of a restaurant keeper. As
    an example, the restaurant manager can build a geographical selection of parking
    sensors in the neighborhood saving this selection as a datasource in her work
    space called “parkingSlots”. Then she can create a link between the selected datasource
    and her customer list using for instance his Facebook profile. In so doing, her
    customers will receive the number of free slots directly on their mobile or PC
    and decide to go there by car or by other means. As dual example, the “device
    in the circle” can be a device shared and controlled by means of social media,
    like for example, a multimedia installation, even on a large scale (e.g., night-time
    lighting of a skyscraper). The social circle may be the set of users of a certain
    social network that post messages to a certain topic (for example, a topic with
    a hash tag on twitter). Analytics based on text recognition (or even mood recognition)
    on tweets may trigger different actions on the installation (for example, the
    ignition with certain colors or with certain choreography). • The social dimension
    is useful for device/thing find-ability: the navigability of users’ profiles enables
    to discover objects shared by friends, but also to find new friends and new devices/things.
    4. Evolution of social Internet of Things 4.1. Objects that handle social relationships
    In the IoT, everything real becomes virtual, which means that each person and
    thing has a locatable, addressable, and readable counterpart on the Internet.
    These virtual entities can produce and consume services and collaborate toward
    a common goal. The car driver might know about the status of her car and of the
    roads towards her destination, thanks to the autonomous communications of the
    sensors and actuators in her car with those installed in other vehicles and along
    the road. The embedded system in a swimming pool could share its state with other
    virtual entities. All these scenarios are possible with an intense interaction
    between objects and related services, enabling the most powerful and fascinating
    applications. For instance, in [24] the authors introduce the idea of objects
    able to participate in conversations that were previously only available to humans.
    Those envisioned are objects aware of dynamic community structures, thus being
    able to develop a spontaneous networking infrastructure based on the information
    to be disseminated other than information on the objects themselves. Analogously,
    the research activities reported in [25] consider that, being things involved
    into the network together with people, social networks can be built based on the
    Internet of Things and are meaningful to investigate the relations and evolution
    of objects in IoT. Again, IoT and social network technologies and concepts are
    jointly exploited towards the development of tools that can make people’s lives
    easier. This time the idea is to use social networking elements in the Internet
    of Things to allow objects to autonomously establish social relationships. The
    driving motivation is that a social-oriented approach is expected to put forward
    the discovery, selection and composition of services and information provided
    by distributed objects and networks that have access to the physical world. The
    proposed social-oriented approach is characterized by the capabilities of the
    objects to autonomously establish social relationships of different kinds [24],
    [26], [7]. Within the resulting object social network, a key objective will be
    to publish information and services, find them, and discover novel resources to
    support the implementation of complex services and applications. This can be achieved
    in a trusty and efficient way by navigating a social network of “friend” objects,
    instead of relying on typical Internet discovery tools that cannot scale to billions
    of future devices. Indeed, social networking concepts have proven to be of great
    importance for handling the relationships among humans and, in the same way, these
    are expected to have a great impact on the management of services in the IoT.
    Specifically, in [7] the Social Internet of Things (SIoTs) has been proposed.
    According to this model, a set of forms of socialization among objects are foreseen
    as shown in Fig. 5. The parental object relationship is defined among similar
    objects, built in the same period by the same manufacturer (the role of family
    is played by the production batch). Moreover, objects can establish co-location
    object relationship and co-work object relationship, like humans do when they
    share personal (e.g., cohabitation) or public (e.g., work) experiences. A further
    type of relationship is defined for objects owned by the same user (mobile phones,
    game consoles, etc.), which is named ownership object relationship. The last relationship
    is established when objects come into contact, sporadically or continuously, for
    reasons purely related to relations among their owners (e.g., devices/sensors
    belonging to friends); it is named social object relationship. These relationships
    are created and updated on the basis of the objects features (such as: object
    type, computational power, mobility capabilities, brand) and activity (frequency
    in meeting the other objects, mainly). The parental and ownership relationships
    are determined by just the static characteristics of the object (or slowly varying
    characteristics): type, brand, ownership. The others are determined by the movement
    of the object and by the other nodes it encounters. The relationships’ management
    is implemented in the cloud, in the object gateways, and in the objects themselves,
    if capable of supporting the relevant logic. Clearly, the configuration of these
    functionalities is controlled by the object owner; accordingly, the resulting
    links are asymmetrical. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Sketch of
    the five types of relationships defined in the SIoT paradigm. To manage the resulting
    network and relationships, the foreseen SIoT architecture is made of four major
    components (among others). The Relationship management introduces into the SIoT
    the intelligence that allows objects to start, update, and terminate relationships.
    The selection of which friendship to accept is based on human control settings.
    Service discovery is finalized to find which objects can provide the required
    service in the same way humans seek for friendships and information. Indeed, to
    discover the service, the object queries its social relationship network. Service
    composition enables the interaction among objects. The service discovery exploits
    the object relationships to find the desired service, which is then activated
    by this component. Both a reactive and a proactive approach to service composition
    are envisaged. This component will also include the functionality of crowd information
    processing, to process the information obtained from different objects and obtain
    the most reliable answer to a query on the basis of different visions. Trustworthiness
    management is aimed at understanding how the information provided by other members
    has to be processed. 4.2. The SIoT architecture In [6], a possible SIoT architecture
    has been proposed, which follows the simple three-layer architectural model for
    IoT. In this model, the sensing layer is devoted to data acquisition and node
    collaboration in short-range and local networks. The network layer is aimed at
    transferring data across different networks. Finally, the application layer is
    where the IoT applications are deployed together with the middleware functionalities.
    The application layer is the key part in the SIoT, making this architectural proposal
    distinctive with respect to alternative solutions. It consists of three sub-layers,
    with the base sub-layer devoted to the database for the storage and management
    of the data and relevant descriptors, which record the social member profiles
    and their relationships, as well as the activities carried out by the objects
    in the real and virtual worlds. The component sub-layer works on top of the base
    sub-layer and implements the functionalities described in the previous subsection,
    i.e., relationship management, service discovery, service composition, trustworthiness
    management. The application layer is where the application are located, relying
    on the social-oriented behavior of the objects. With the intent to highlight the
    distinctive features of the SIoT architecture, in Fig. 6 we provide a mapping
    of the major SIoT components into the reference model provided in [27] by the
    IoT-A European research project, which represents a major effort in defining a
    reference architecture for the existing and future IoT solutions. In this figure,
    we show the five functional layers with the main functionalities in gray-colored
    boxes. In the upper layer are located the applications that are built on top of
    an implementation of the IoT-A architecture. This represents instances of the
    process execution and service orchestration, which indeed is used to combine different
    services (also provided by different system implementations) to implement complex
    services. The relevant APIs are also a key part of this layer. The virtual entity
    (VE) and information is the layer that maintains and organizes information related
    to physical entities, enabling search for services exposing resources associated
    to physical entities. Accordingly, it is intended to response to queries about
    a particular physical entity by providing with addresses of the service related
    to the physical entity. The lower layer, i.e., the IoT service and resource, links
    specific services to the related resources. It also notifies application software
    and services about events related to resources and corresponding physical entities.
    The Device connectivity and communication layer provides the set of methods and
    primitives for device connectivity and communication. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Major functionalities of the SIoT system (in blue color) in the
    IoT-A reference architecture. In Fig. 6, we have highlighted the main features
    of the SIoT solution. At the second layer, the SIoT system may require the extension
    of the object descriptions to support the creation and management of the social-oriented
    behavior and relationships, such as: owner ID; object position, which can be changing
    over the time depending on the object mobility features; power supply status,
    that defines whether the object is either battery-powered (and the battery power
    level is provided), socket-connected (and whether is currently connected or not),
    or it harvests power from the environment; amount of traffic generated in terms
    of number of connections and overall bit-rate. The objects could also be grouped
    into different classes, depending on their main characteristics, such as mobility,
    computational and communication capabilities, interfaces, sensing capabilities,
    power supply. At the third layer, the major part of the SIoT functionalities needs
    to be introduced. These also call for the definition of specific ontologies and
    semantic engines. The ontologies are used to represent a semantic view of the
    social activities, which is extracted through appropriate semantic engines. The
    objective is to provide a machine interpretable environment for representing attributes
    and operations of the IoT devices. Many works have already been conducted in this
    area, which could be partially used in the SIoT scenario, e.g., Ontology Web Language
    for Services (OWL-S) model, which has already been used as the basis of a semantic
    service modeling framework for the IoT [28], [29]. Accordingly, services are used
    as an interface that represents the IoT resources (i.e., the physical world devices)
    and provide an access to the functions and capabilities of these resources. Ontologies
    to manage and control heterogeneous systems have also been investigated in [27].
    This highlights that an automatic discovery will be impossible without ontological
    classification and semantic annotation processes. In [30], the importance of the
    ontology has been analyzed from a social network perspective as a format to represent
    the object information which is relevant to end users. Other approaches for creating
    semantic service descriptions could be used as described in [31]. These include:
    Semantic Annotations for WSDL (SAWSDL), Unified Service Description Language (USDL),
    Web Service Modelling Language (WSML), Web Service Modelling Ontology (WSMO),
    and Semantic Annotations for Representational State Transfer SA-REST [32]. The
    relationship management module is the one responsible to establish, update, and
    terminate the relationships among the objects in their virtual representation.
    It also elaborates the social network to facilitate the discovery of the services
    by identifying different clusters of resource relationships. Possible approaches
    are to make use of similarity measures and multi-scale renormalization and synergetic
    – self organization techniques. These should be embodied into the SIoT learners
    and adaptors of virtual resources following the cognitive networks paradigm. Consequently,
    an object social graph is built with objects that are linked by edges representing
    the established relationships, each one weighted by its computed degrees. This
    module is also responsible for calculating several topological features of the
    resource social graph such as: between-ness, closeness, degree/eigenvector hubs
    and authorities centrality measures. This allows for determining the most “central”
    nodes/resources, which is a key activity because the identified “central” nodes/resources
    will be those that control the data flows in SIoT and influence the rest of nodes/resources.
    By doing so, the “central” nodes will be marked as landmarks, representative for
    their local neighborhood. The service discovery functionality is key in the third
    layer, since it is needed to find which objects can provide a service requested
    in the target application. This functionality should be implemented into the SIoT
    system by following the rules the humans adopt to seek for friendships and for
    any information in the social networking services. The discovery will be guided
    by the object social graph as described above. The trust management module is
    the one responsible to address the inherent risks in transactions with no prior
    experience with regard to the reputation of every other node. In doing this, it
    exploits the resource social graph to build a reputation-based trust mechanism
    for the IoT that can effectively deal with certain types of malicious behavior
    that intend to mislead other nodes [33]. In such a scenario, two possible models
    for the implementation of the Trustworthiness management can be followed. One
    is the subjective trustworthiness, derived from a social point of view, where
    each node computes the trustworthiness of its friends on the basis of its own
    experience and on the basis of its friends’ experiences. If two nodes are not
    friends, then the trustworthiness is calculated by word of mouth through a chain
    of friendships. The other is the objective trustworthiness, obtained from P2P
    scenarios, where the information about each node is distributed and stored by
    making use of a DHT (Distributed Hash Table) structure. This information is visible
    to every node but is only managed by special nodes that we call Pre-Trusted Objects
    (PTOs). Finally, the service composition component enables the interaction between
    services provided by different objects to achieve complex services and applications.
    Most of the time, the interaction is related to an object that wishes either to
    retrieve an information about the real world or to find a specific service provided
    by another object. In fact, the main potential we see in deploying SIoT is its
    capability to foster such an information retrieval. 5. On-going projects The projects
    listed here bring together the technological aspects, related to the functionality
    offered by the so-called smart objects, with the social aspects. Projects in this
    list mainly fall into one of the three scenarios emerged from the previous sections:
    participatory sensing, device-in-the-circle, and devices-that-socialize. The tools
    to compose and build personalized and social application that merges together
    data from different sources belong to a field in continuous evolution and such
    tools are often the basis for other projects: they are mainly cloud-based because
    the cloud is always there, up and running, it is reachable from everywhere, and
    a large amount of application complexity can be moved from the target devices
    to the cloud components. Among these tools are: Ninja Blocks [34], IFTTT [35]
    and Paraimpu [36]. Ninja Blocks is a project started in 2012 from the crowdfunding
    platform Kickstarter.com. Ninja Blocks are cloud-based devices that can sense
    their environment and can act by controlling lights, power sockets, and other
    actuators. The system provides a tool to compose actions and sensing with common
    social web sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. Among the sensors there is
    also a camera. IFTTT is a San Francisco based startup whose service enables customers
    to create and share within minutes very simple applications that fit the “if this
    then that” rule. An example of application can be IF “someone tags me on Facebook
    picture” then “put the picture on my Dropbox”. IFTTT was initially conceived for
    Internet services and social media and only later, in June 2012, the service crossed
    over to the physical world by integrating with Belkin WeMo [37] devices allowing
    IFTTT rules to compose social media events with home automation. Paraimpu is a
    cloud-based research prototype from CRS4, which provides the functionality to
    manage smart Things and to compose them with services already on the Web to create
    personalized applications. Common DIY (Do It Yourself) boards like Arduino, can
    be easily integrated as the system automatically generates the code for these
    boards to produce/receive data. Paraimpu allows people to share smart things and
    devices in their social circle enabling social physical-virtual Web mash-ups.
    The availability of such tools is fostering the development of personalized and
    interesting installation. At the moment these are generated by a small niche of
    geeks and early adopters but, to some extent, pave the way for a future diffusion
    and adoption of smart things in everyday social life. Among the installations,
    here are reported three “device-in-the-circle” cases: • Jardimpu [38] (based on
    Arduino and Paraimpu) is an automated irrigation system based on the sensing of
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, light conditions, which is then used to
    control the level of water in some plant’s saucers (e.g. Dionaea Muscipula). This
    system is not an absolute novelty in the field of sensors-based garden irrigation,
    but it is one of the first examples of “social” gardening: people in the social
    circle can activate the drippers, can see plants in a live streaming, and can
    monitor their parameters. • TLight is a permanent installation created by the
    Quit group [39] and connected to the web thanks to Paraimpu, which allows everyone
    to change the color tones and the behavior of the lights placed on the top of
    the big glass tower of the T-Hotel in Cagliari. To interact with the lights, a
    twitter user can post a message on with hashtag:#thotel followed by any phrase
    containing one of the following words: red, blue, green, orange, yellow, white,
    cyan, purple, wave, different, couple, full, pulse e random. • Natural Fuse [40]
    is a social IoT game based on COSM [41]. Participants get a Natural Fuse unit
    which consists of a houseplant and a power socket. The amount of power available
    to the socket is limited by the capacity of the plant to offset the carbon footprint
    of the energy expended. If people cooperate on energy expenditure then the plants
    thrive (and everyone may use more energy). But if people do not cooperate, then
    the network starts to randomly kill plants. The electricity depends on the plants
    just as the plants depend on the electricity. The work carried on in the field
    of Social Web of Things by Ericsson also deserves a citation as “devices-that-socialize”
    use case. Researchers at Ericsson in fact are working on methods for connecting
    device into a social media platform for nodes that are not people. Recently they
    have presented at the Connected House exhibit, a social network interface that
    linked all of the different connected nodes in a home as well as trusted points
    in the public sphere. Another very popular project is Waze. Waze is a company
    based on Israel which developed a service called social-GPS. The service is aimed
    at avoid traffic, and it is based on a large community spread all over the world.
    It allows, through a smart phone equipped with GPS, to share real-time traffic
    information and help everyone to save time and fuel. Even if it does not make
    use of any exotic hardware but it totally relies on the smartphone functionalities,
    it is a perfect example of tool for participatory sensing. At the same time, it
    is also a case of “device-in-the-circle” because the connection with Facebook
    allows participants to see their friends on the map to coordinate arrival times
    to give or get rides or meet up with other participants. In the field of Smart
    Cities, the project CityScripts [42] is an experiment built on top of the SmartSantander
    [43] platform (with a base of 12,000 urban sensors deployed in the city of Santander).
    The CityScripts project is aimed at integrating and experimenting a Web of Things
    scenario in which sensors and actuators in the city have a digital counterpart
    and can be used by citizens to compose personal applications integrating sensor
    data with social networks and other online data sources. 6. Conclusions In this
    paper, we have reviewed the main approaches followed during the last years to
    make objects part of the human social loop and grant them a role within the human
    social network sites. This objective has been achieved by extending the paradigm
    of Web of Things to give things the capabilities to automatically post information
    on the social network sites and to be reached through these as well. A complementary
    approach is the one according to which objects have their own social network,
    which is independent from those of the humans but still controlled by them (albeit
    progressively less, as technologies progresses). The two approaches can be combined
    so that part of the information and actions of relevance for one social network
    type, that is the one where humans rule, can be exported/imported to/into the
    other one, where objects rule. Certainly, the objective of these approaches is
    to address the complexity in the management of the trillions of objects that will
    be connected to the network in a couple of years and to exploit their major potentialities.
    Through the presented survey of ongoing projects, we learned that the implementations
    deployed so far are limited in their potentialities. These only focus on specific
    applications and do not converge on an interoperable platform where social networking
    concepts are adopted as the major principles that drive the object interactions.

    Abstract Scientific measurements from single or multiple sensors are usually incomplete
    and uncertain. A process making use of the concept of data fusion has been developed
    to try to encompass this problem by combining information from multiple sensors.
    The objective to synergistic use of information from multiple sources is to reduce
    uncertainty and increase the confidence level of a measurand. The implementation
    of data fusion to the field of NDT is relatively new. This paper summarizes the
    achievements of current research on data fusion applied to NDT. A theoretical
    data fusion strategy is described and experimental results generated from weld
    inspection are presented. Previous article View issue table of contents Next article

  explanation: The study focuses on deep learning-based methods to automatically estimate
    spectral features (e.g., NDVI) in situations when optical data are missing due
    to cloud cover. The specific application in this paper is the prediction of NDVI
    from Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical data time series. The proposed approach
    leverages the information from both SAR and optical data sources. The methods
    were tested on a dataset covering the Koumbia region in Burkina Faso for a period
    of several months. Different models are developed to account for different data
    availability scenarios, such as causal (using only data available up to the target
    date) or non-causal (using all available data) approaches. The results show that
    deep learning-based methods significantly outperform conventional statistical
    methods, especially in the presence of large temporal gaps or when only SAR data
    is available.
  extract_1: The proposed CNN-based algorithms outperformed consistently the conventional
    temporal interpolators, even when only optical data were used. When also SAR data
    were considered, a further signiﬁcant improvement of performance was observed,
    despite the very different nature of the involved signals. It is worth underlining
    that no peculiar property of the NDVI was exploited, and therefore, these results
    have a wider signiﬁcance, suggesting that other image features can be better estimated
    by cross-sensor CNN-based fusion.
  extract_2: In all cases, the proposed methods outperform largely the conventional
    references, especially in the presence of large temporal gaps. Besides proving
    the potential of deep learning for remote sensing, experiments have shown that
    SAR images can be used to obtain a meaningful estimate of spectral indexes when
    other sources of information are not available.

    Sensitivity to weather conditions, and specially to clouds, is a severe limiting\
    \ factor\nto the use of optical remote sensing for Earth monitoring applications.\
    \ A possible alternative is\nto beneﬁt from weather-insensitive synthetic aperture\
    \ radar (SAR) images. In many real-world\napplications, critical decisions are\
    \ made based on some informative optical or radar features related\nto items such\
    \ as water, vegetation or soil. Under cloudy conditions, however, optical-based\
    \ features\nare not available, and they are commonly reconstructed through linear\
    \ interpolation between\ndata available at temporally-close time instants. In\
    \ this work, we propose to estimate missing\noptical features through data fusion\
    \ and deep-learning. Several sources of information are taken\ninto account—optical\
    \ sequences, SAR sequences, digital elevation model—so as to exploit both\ntemporal\
    \ and cross-sensor dependencies. Based on these data and a tiny cloud-free fraction\
    \ of the\ntarget image, a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained\
    \ to perform the desired\nestimation. To validate the proposed approach, we focus\
    \ on the estimation of the normalized\ndifference vegetation index (NDVI), using\
    \ coupled Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time-series acquired\nover an agricultural\
    \ region of Burkina Faso from May–November 2016. Several fusion schemes are\n\
    considered, causal and non-causal, single-sensor or joint-sensor, corresponding\
    \ to different operating\nconditions. Experimental results are very promising,\
    \ showing a signiﬁcant gain over baseline methods\naccording to all performance\
    \ indicators.\nKeywords: coregistration; pansharpening; multi-sensor fusion; multitemporal\

    The recent launch of coupled optical/SAR (synthetic aperture radar) Sentinel satellites,\
    \ in the\ncontext of the Copernicus program, opens unprecedented opportunities\
    \ for end users, both industrial\nand institutional, and poses new challenges\
    \ to the remote sensing research community. The policy\nof free distribution of\
    \ data allows large-scale access to a very rich source of information. Besides\n\
    this, the technical features of the Sentinel constellation make it a valuable\
    \ tool for a wide array of\nremote sensing applications. With revisit time ranging\
    \ from two days to about a week, depending\non the geographic location, spatial\
    \ resolution from 5–60 m and wide coverage of the spectrum, from\nvisible to short-wave\
    \ infrared (~440–2200 nm), Sentinel data may decisively impact a number of Earth\n\
    monitoring applications, such as climate change monitoring, map updating, agriculture\
    \ and forestry\nplanning, ﬂood monitoring, ice monitoring, and so forth.\nRemote\

    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 236\n2 of 20\nEspecially valuable is the diversity of information\
    \ guaranteed by the coupled SAR and\noptical sensors, a key element for boosting\
    \ the monitoring capability of the constellation. In fact,\nthe information conveyed\
    \ by the Sentinel-2 (S2) multi-resolution optical sensor depends on the spectral\n\
    reﬂectivity of the target illuminated by sunlight, while the backscattered signal\
    \ acquired by the\nSentinel-1 (S1) SAR sensor depends on both the target’s characteristics\
    \ and the illuminating signal.\nThe joint processing of optical and radar temporal\
    \ sequences offers the opportunity to extract the\ninformation of interest with\
    \ an accuracy that could not be achieved using only one of them. Of course,\n\
    with this potential comes the scientiﬁc challenge of how to exploit these complementary\
    \ pieces of\ninformation in the most effective way.\nIn this work, we focus on\
    \ the estimation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)\nin critical\
    \ weather conditions, fusing the information provided by temporal sequences of\
    \ S1 and S2\nimages. In fact, the typical processing pipelines of many land monitoring\
    \ applications rely, among other\nfeatures, on the NDVI for a single date or a\
    \ whole temporal series. Unfortunately, the NDVI, as well\nas other spectral features\
    \ are unavailable under cloudy weather conditions. The commonly-adopted\nsolution\
    \ consists of interpolating between temporally-adjacent images where the target\
    \ feature is\npresent. However, given the availability of weather-insensitive\
    \ SAR data of the scene, it makes sense\nto pursue fusion-based solutions, exploiting\
    \ SAR images that may be temporally very close to the\ntarget date, as it is well\
    \ known that radar images can provide valuable information on vegetation [1–4].\n\
    Even if this holds true, however, it is by no means obvious how to exploit such\
    \ dependency. To address\nthis problem, beneﬁting from the powerful learning capability\
    \ of deep learning methods, we designed\na three-layer convolutional neural network\
    \ (CNN), training it to account for both temporal and\ncross-sensor dependencies.\
    \ Note that the same approach, with minimal adaptations, can be extended\nto estimate\
    \ many other spectral indices, commonly used for water, soil, and so on. Therefore,\
    \ besides\nsolving the speciﬁc problem, we demonstrate the potential of deep learning\
    \ for data fusion in\nremote sensing.\nAccording to the taxonomy given in [5]\
    \ data fusion methods, i.e., processing dealing with data\nand information from\
    \ multiple sources to achieve improved information for decision making can be\n\
    grouped into three main categories:\n–\npixel-level: the pixel values of the sources\
    \ to be fused are jointly processed [6–9];\n–\nfeature-level: features like lines,\
    \ regions, keypoints, maps, and so on, are ﬁrst extracted\nindependently from\
    \ each source image and subsequently combined to produce higher-level\ncross-source\
    \ features, which may represent the desired output or be further processed [10–17];\n\
    –\ndecision-level: the high-level information extracted independently from each\
    \ source is combined\nto provide the ﬁnal outcome, for example using fuzzy logic\
    \ [18,19], decision trees [20],\nBayesian inference [21], Dempster–Shafer theory\
    \ [22], and so forth.\nIn the context of remote sensing, with reference to the\
    \ sources to be fused, fusion methods can be\nroughly gathered for the most part\
    \ into the following categories:\n–\nmulti-resolution: concerns a single sensor\
    \ with multiple resolution bands. One of the most\nfrequent applications is pansharpening\
    \ [6,23,24], although many other tasks can be solved under\na multi-resolution\
    \ paradigm, such as segmentation [25] or feature extraction [26], to mention\n\
    a few.\n–\nmulti-temporal: is one of the most investigated forms of fusion in\
    \ remote sensing due to the\nrich information content hidden in the temporal dimension.\
    \ In particular, it can be applied to\nstrictly time-related tasks, like prediction\
    \ [13], change detection [27–29] and co-registration [30],\nand general-purpose\
    \ tasks, like segmentation [7], despeckling [31] and feature extraction [32–34],\n\
    which do not necessarily need a joint processing of the temporal sequence, but\
    \ can beneﬁt from it.\n–\nmulti-sensor: is gaining an ever growing importance\
    \ due both to the recent deployment of many\nnew satellites and to the increasing\
    \ tendency of the community to share data. It represents also the\nmost challenging\
    \ case because of the several sources of mismatch (temporal, geometrical, spectral,\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 236\n3 of 20\nradiometric) among the involved data. As\
    \ for other categories, a number of typical remote\nsensing problems can ﬁt this\
    \ paradigm, such as classiﬁcation [10,16,35–37], coregistration [15],\nchange\
    \ detection [38] and feature estimation [4,39–41].\n–\nmixed: the above cases\
    \ may also occur jointly, generating mixed situations. For example,\nhyperspectral\
    \ and multiresolution images can be fused to produce a spatial-spectral\nfull-resolution\
    \ datacube [9,42]. Likewise, low-resolution temporally-dense series can be fused\
    \ with\nhigh-resolution, but temporally sparse ones to simulate a temporal-spatial\
    \ full-resolution sequence\n[43]. The monitoring of forests [21], soil moisture\
    \ [2], environmental hazards [12] and other\nprocesses can be also carried out\
    \ effectively by fusing SAR and optical time series. Finally, works\nthat mix\
    \ all three aspects, resolution, time and sensor, can also be found in the literature\
    \ [11,22,44].\nTurning to multi-sensor SAR-optical fusion for the purpose of vegetation\
    \ monitoring, a number\nof contributions can be found in the literature [4,11,16,21,45].\
    \ In [11], ALOS POLSAR and Landsat\ntime-series were combined at the feature level\
    \ for forest mapping and monitoring. The same problem\nwas addressed in [21] through\
    \ a decision-level approach. In [45], the fusion of single-date S1 and\nsimulated\
    \ S2 was presented for the purpose of classiﬁcation. In [4], instead, RADARSAT-2\
    \ and\nLandsat-7/8 images were fused, by means of an artiﬁcial neural network,\
    \ to estimate soil moisture\nand leaf area index. The NDVI obtained from the Landsat\
    \ source was combined with different SAR\npolarization subsets for feeding ad\
    \ hoc artiﬁcial networks. A similar feature-level approach, based on\nSentinel\
    \ data, was followed in [16] for the purpose of land cover mapping. To this end,\
    \ the texture\nmaps extracted from the SAR image were combined with several indices\
    \ drawn from the optical bands.\nAlthough\nsome\nfusion\ntechniques\nhave\nbeen\n\
    proposed\nfor\nspatio-temporal\nNDVI\nsuper-resolution [43] or prediction [13],\
    \ they use exclusively optical data. None of these papers\nattempts to directly\
    \ estimate a pure multispectral feature, NDVI or the like, from SAR data. In most\n\
    cases, the fusion, occurring already at the feature level, is intended to provide\
    \ high-level information,\nlike the classiﬁcation or detection of some physical\
    \ item. Conversely, we can register some notable\nexamples of indices directly\
    \ related to physical items of interest, like soil moisture or the area leaf\n\
    index, which have been estimated by fusing SAR and optical data [4,39].\nIn this\
    \ work, we propose several CNN-based algorithms to estimate the NDVI through the\n\
    fusion of optical and SAR Sentinel data. With reference to a speciﬁc case study,\
    \ we acquired temporal\nsequences of S1 SAR data and S2 optical data, covering\
    \ the same time lapse, with the latter partially\ncovered by clouds. Both temporal\
    \ and cross-sensor (S1-S2) dependencies are used to obtain the\nmost effective\
    \ estimation protocol. From the experimental analysis, very interesting results\
    \ emerge.\nOn the one hand, when only optical data are used, CNN-based methods\
    \ outperform consistently the\nconventional temporal interpolators. On the other\
    \ hand, when also SAR data are considered, a further\nsigniﬁcant improvement of\
    \ performance is observed, despite the very different nature of the involved\n\
    signals. It is worth underlining that no peculiar property of the NDVI was exploited,\
    \ and therefore,\nthese results have a wider signiﬁcance, suggesting that other\
    \ image features can be better estimated by\ncross-sensor CNN-based fusion.\n\
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the dataset\
    \ and describe\nthe problem under investigation. In Section 3, the basics of the\
    \ CNN methodology are recalled.\nThen, the speciﬁc prediction architectures are\
    \ detailed in Section 4. In Section 5, we present fusion\nresults and related\
    \ numerical accuracy evaluation. Finally, a detailed discussion of the results\
    \ and\nfuture perspectives is given in Section 6, while conclusions are drawn\
    \ in Section 7.\n2. Dataset and Problem Statement\nThe objective of this work\
    \ is to propose and test a set of solutions to estimate a target optical\nfeature\
    \ at a given date from images acquired at adjacent dates, or even from the temporally-closest\n\
    SAR image. Such different solutions also reﬂect the different operating conditions\
    \ found in practice.\nThe main application is the reconstruction of a feature\
    \ of interest in a target image, which is available,\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 236\n\
    4 of 20\nbut partially or totally cloudy. However, one may also consider the case\
    \ in which the feature is built\nand used on a date for which no image is actually\
    \ available.\nIn this work, we focus on the estimation of the normalized difference\
    \ vegetation index, but it\nis straightforward to apply the same framework to\
    \ other optical features. With reference to Sentinel\nimages, the NDVI is obtained\
    \ at a 10-m spatial resolution by combining, pixel-by-pixel, two bands,\nnear\
    \ infrared (NIR, 8th band) and red (Red, 4th band), as:\nNDVI ≜ NIR − Red\nNIR\
    \ + Red ∈ [−1, 1]\n(1)\nThe area under study is located in the province of Tuy,\
    \ Burkina Faso, around the commune\nof Koumbia. This area is particularly representative\
    \ of West African semiarid agricultural landscapes,\nfor which the Sentinel missions\
    \ offer new opportunities in monitoring vegetation, notably in the\ncontext of\
    \ climate change adaptation and food security. The use of SAR data in conjunction\
    \ with\noptical images is particularly appropriate in these areas, since most\
    \ of the vegetation dynamics take\nplace during the rainy season, especially over\
    \ the cropland, as smallholder rainfed agriculture is\ndominant. This strongly\
    \ reduces the availability of usable optical images in the critical phase of\n\
    vegetation growth, due to the signiﬁcant cloud coverage [46] by which SAR data\
    \ are only loosely\naffected. The 5253 × 4797 pixels scene is monitored from 5\
    \ May–1 November 2016, which corresponds\nto a regular agricultural season in\
    \ the area.\nFigure 1 indicates the available S1 and S2 acquisitions in this period.\
    \ In the case of S2 images,\nthe bar height indicates the percentage of data that\
    \ are not cloudy. It is clear that some dates provide\nlittle or no information.\
    \ Note that, during the rainy season, the lack of sufﬁcient cloud-free optical\n\
    data may represent a major issue, preventing the extraction of spatio-temporal\
    \ optical-based features,\nlike time-series of vegetation, water or soil indices,\
    \ and so on. S1 images, instead, are always completely\navailable, as SAR data\
    \ are insensitive to meteorological conditions.\nmay-05\nmay-15\njun-04\naug-03\n\

    \ and test areas. For the selected S2 images (solid bars in Figure 1),\nthe corresponding\
    \ dates are indicated on the x-axis. Our dataset was then completed by including\
    \ also\nthe S1 images (solid bars), which are temporally closest to the selected\
    \ S2 counterparts. The general\nidea of the proposal is to use the closest cloud-free\
    \ S2 and S1 images to estimate the desired feature\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 236\n\
    5 of 20\non the target date of interest. Therefore, among the seven selected dates,\
    \ only the ﬁve inner ones are\nused as targets. Observe, also, that the resulting\
    \ temporal sampling is rather variable, with intervals\nranging from ten days\
    \ to a couple of months, allowing us to test our methods in different conditions.\n\
    To allow temporal analyses, we chose a test area, of a size of 470 × 450, which\
    \ is cloud-free\nin all the selected dates, hence with the available reference\
    \ ground-truth for any possible optical\nfeature. Figure 2 shows the RGB representation\
    \ of a complete image of the Koumbia dataset (3 August),\ntogether with a zoom\

    \ usable\narea remains, from which a sufﬁciently large number of small (33 × 33)\
    \ cloud-free patches is randomly\nextracted for training and validation.\n11°18ʹ0″N\n\

    \ data acquired in interferometric wide swath (IW) mode, in the\nhigh-resolution\
    \ Ground Range Detected (GRD) format as provided by ESA. Such Level-1 products\
    \ are\ngenerally available for most data users and consist of focused SAR data\
    \ detected in magnitude, with a\nnative range by azimuth resolution estimated\
    \ as 20 × 22 meters and a 10 × 10 meter pixel spacing.\nA proper multi-looking\
    \ and ground range projection is applied to provide the ﬁnal GRD product at a\n\
    nominal 10 m spatial resolution. On our side, all images have been calibrated\
    \ (VH/VV intensities to\nsigma naught) and terrain corrected using ancillary data\
    \ and co-registered to provide a 10-m resolution,\nspatially-coherent time series,\
    \ using the ofﬁcial European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel Application\nPlatform\
    \ (SNAP) software [47]. No optical/SAR co-registration has been performed, assuming\
    \ that the\nco-location precision provided by the independent orthorectiﬁcation\
    \ of each product is sufﬁcient for\nthe application. Sentinel-2 data are provided\
    \ by the French Pole Thématique Surfaces Continentales\n(THEIA) [48] and preprocessed\
    \ using the Multi-sensor Atmospheric Correction and Cloud Screening\n(MACCS) Level-2A\
    \ processor [49] developed at the French National Space Agency (CNES) to provide\n\
    surface reﬂectance products, as well as precise cloud masks.\nIn addition to the\
    \ Sentinel data, we assume the availability of two more features, the cloud masks\n\
    for each S2 image and a digital elevation model (DEM). Cloud masks are obviously\
    \ necessary to\nestablish when the prediction is needed and which adjacent dates\
    \ should be involved. The DEM is\na complementary feature that integrates the\
    \ information carried by SAR data and may be useful to\nimprove estimation. It\
    \ was gathered from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) 1 Arc-Second\n\
    Global, with 30-m resolution resampled at 10 m to match the spatial resolution\
    \ of Sentinel data.\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 236\n6 of 20\n3. Convolutional Neural\
    \ Networks\nBefore moving to the speciﬁc solutions for NDVI estimation, in this\
    \ section, we provide some\nbasic notions and terminology about convolutional\
    \ neural networks.\nIn the last few years, CNNs have been successfully applied\
    \ to many classical image processing\nproblems, such as denoising [50], super-resolution\
    \ [51], pansharpening [8,24], segmentation [52],\nobject detection [53,54], change\
    \ detection [27] and classiﬁcation [17,55–57]. The main strengths of\nCNNs are\
    \ (i) an extreme versatility that allows them to approximate any sort of linear\
    \ or non-linear\ntransformation, including scaling or hard thresholding; (ii)\
    \ no need to design handcrafted ﬁlters,\nreplaced by machine learning; (iii) high-speed\
    \ processing, thanks to parallel computing. On the\ndownside, for correct training,\
    \ CNNs require the availability of a large amount of data with the\nground-truth\
    \ (examples). In our speciﬁc case, data are not a problem, given the unlimited\
    \ quantity of\ncloud-free Sentinel-2 time-series that can be downloaded from the\
    \ web repositories. However, using\nlarge datasets has a cost in terms of complexity\
    \ and may lead to unreasonably long training times.\nUsually, a CNN is a chain\
    \ (parallels, loops or other combinations are also possible) of different layers,\n\
    like convolution, nonlinearities, pooling and deconvolution. For image processing\
    \ tasks in which the\ndesired output is an image at the same resolution of the\
    \ input, as in this work, only convolutional\nlayers interleaved with nonlinear\
    \ activations are typically employed.\nThe generic l-th convolutional layer, with\
    \ N-band input x(l), yields an M-band stack z(l) computed as:\nz(l) = w(l) ∗ x(l)\
    \ + b(l),\nwhose m-th component can be written in terms of ordinary 2D convolutions:\n\
    z(l)(m, ·, ·) =\nN\n∑\nn=1\nw(l)(m, n, ·, ·) ∗ x(l)(n, ·, ·) + b(l)(m).\nThe tensor\
    \ w is a set of M convolutional N × (K × K) kernels, with a K × K spatial support\n\
    (receptive ﬁeld), while b is an M-vector bias. These parameters, compactly, Φl\
    \ ≜\n\x10\nw(l), b(l)\x11\n, are\nlearned during the training phase. If the convolution\
    \ is followed by a pointwise activation function\ngl(·), then the overall layer\
    \ output is given by:\ny(l) = gl(z(l)) = gl(w(l) ∗ x(l) + b(l)) ≜ fl(x(l), Φl).\n\
    (2)\nDue to the good convergence properties it ensures [55], the rectiﬁed linear\
    \ unit (ReLU), deﬁned as\ng(·) ≜ max(0, ·), is a typical activation function of\
    \ choice for input or hidden layers.\nAssuming a simple L-layer cascade architecture,\
    \ the overall processing will be:\nf (x, Φ) = fL( fL−1(. . . f1(x, Φ1), . . .\
    \ , ΦL−1), ΦL),\n(3)\nwhere Φ ≜ (Φ1, . . . , ΦL) is the whole set of parameters\
    \ to learn. In this chain, each layer l provides\na set of so-called feature maps,\
    \ y(l), which activate on local cues in the early stages (small l), to become\n\
    more and more representative of abstract and global phenomena in subsequent ones\
    \ (large l). In this\nwork, all proposed solutions are based on a simple three-layer\
    \ architecture, and differ only in the input\nlayer, as different combinations\
    \ of input bands are considered.\nOnce the architecture has been chosen, its parameters\
    \ are learned by means of some optimization\nstrategy. An example is the stochastic\
    \ gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, specifying the cost to be\nminimized over\
    \ a properly-selected training dataset. Details on training will be given below\
    \ for our\nspeciﬁc solution.\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 236\n7 of 20\n4. Proposed\
    \ Prediction Architectures\nIn the following developments, with reference to a\
    \ given target S2 image acquired at time t,\nwe will consider the items deﬁned\
    \ below:\n•\nF: unknown feature (NDVI in this work) at time t;\n•\nF− and F+:\
    \ feature F at the previous and next useful times, respectively;\n•\nS ≜ (SVV,\
    \ SVH): double polarized SAR image closest to F (within ±5 days for our dataset);\n\
    •\nS− and S+: SAR images closest to F− and F+, respectively;\n•\nD: DEM.\nThe\
    \ several models considered here differ in the composition of the input stack\

    \ solution and will be made explicit below.\nIn order to provide output values\
    \ falling in the compact interval [−1,1], as required by the NDVI\nsemantics (Equation\
    \ (1)), one can include a suitable nonlinear activation, like tanh(·), to complete\
    \ the\noutput layer. In such a case, it is customary to use a cross-entropy loss\
    \ for training. As an alternative,\none may remove the nonlinear output mapping\
    \ altogether and simply take the result of the convolution,\nwhich can be optimized\
    \ using, for example, a Ln-norm. Obviously, in this case, a hard clipping of\n\
    the output is still needed, but this additional transformation does not participate\
    \ in the error back\npropagation, hence it should be considered external to the\
    \ network. Through preliminary experiments,\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 236\n8 of\
    \ 20\nwe have found this latter solution more effective than the former, for our\
    \ task, and therefore, we train\nthe CNN considering a linear activation in the\
    \ last layer, g3(z(3)) = z(3).\nWe now describe brieﬂy the different solutions\
    \ considered here, which depend on the available\ninput data and the required\
    \ response time.\nConcerning data, we will consider estimation based on optical-only,\
    \ SAR-only and optical + SAR\ndata. When using SAR images, we will also test the\
    \ inclusion of the DEM, which may convey relevant\ninformation about them. Instead,\
    \ the DEM is useless, and hence neglected, when only optical data\nare used. All\
    \ these cases are of interest, for the following reasons.\n–\nThe optical-only\
    \ case allows for a direct comparison, with the same input data, between the\n\
    proposed CNN-based solution and the current baseline, which relies on temporal\
    \ linear\ninterpolation. Therefore, it will provide us with a measure of the net\
    \ performance gain guaranteed\nby deep learning over conventional processing.\n\
    –\nAlthough SAR and optical data provide complementary information, the occurrence\
    \ of a given\nphysical item, like water or vegetation, can be detected by means\
    \ of both scattering properties and\nspectral signatures. The analysis of the\
    \ SAR-only case will allow us to understand if signiﬁcant\ndependencies exist\
    \ between the NDVI and SAR images and if a reasonable quality can be achieved\n\
    even when only this source is used for estimation. To this aim, we do not count\
    \ on the temporal\ndependencies in this case, trying to estimate a S2 feature\
    \ from the closest S1 image only.\n–\nThe optical-SAR fusion is the case of highest\
    \ interest for us. Given the most complete set of relevant\ninput and an adequate\
    \ training set, the proposed CNN will synthesize expressive features and is\n\
    expected to provide a high-quality NDVI estimate.\nTurning to response time, except\
    \ for the SAR-only case, we will distinguish between “nearly”\ncausal estimation,\
    \ in which only data already available at time t, for example D, F−, S−, or shortly\n\
    later, can be used, and non-causal estimation, when the whole time series is supposed\
    \ to be available,\nand so future images (F+ and/or S+) are involved. In the former\
    \ case causality can be violated only by\nS and this happens only in two dates\
    \ out of ﬁve, 15 May (three-day delay) and 2 September (one-day\ndelay), in our\
    \ experiments.\n–\nCausal estimation is of interest whenever the data must be\
    \ used right away for the application\nof interest. This is the case, for example,\
    \ of early warning systems for food security. We will\ninclude here also the case\
    \ in which the closest SAR image becomes available after time t, since\nthe maximum\
    \ delay is at most ﬁve days. Hereinafter, we will refer to this “nearly” causal\
    \ case as\ncausal for short.\n–\nOn the other hand, in the absence of temporal\
    \ constraints, all relevant data should be taken into\naccount to obtain the best\
    \ possible quality, therefore using non-causal estimation.\nTable 2 summarizes\
    \ all these different solutions.\nTable 2. Proposed models. The naming reﬂects\
    \ the input stacking, explicated on the right. “SAR” refers\nto S1 images and\
    \ “Optical” to S2 products (F±). “+” marks the inclusion of the DEM. Moreover,\
    \ “C”\nstands for causal.\nInput Bands\nModel Name\nbx\nOptical\nSAR\nDEM\nSAR\n\

    \ to learn the network parameters, a sufﬁciently large training set, say T, of\
    \ input-output\nexamples t is needed:\nT ≜ {t1, . . . , tQ},\nt ≜ (x, yref)\n\
    In our speciﬁc case, x will be a sample of the concatenated images from which\
    \ we want to estimate\nthe target NDVI map, with yref the desired output. Of course,\
    \ all involved optical images must be\ncloud-free over the selected patches.\n\
    Formally, the objective of the training phase is to ﬁnd:\nΦ = arg min\nΦ\nJ (T,\
    \ Φ) ≜ arg min\nΦ\n1\nQ ∑\nt∈T\nL(t, Φ)\nwhere L(t, Φ) is a suitable loss function.\
    \ Several losses can be found in the literature, like Ln norms,\ncross-entropy\
    \ and negative log-likelihood. The choice depends on the domain of the output\
    \ and\naffects the convergence properties of the networks [58]. Our experiments\
    \ have shown the L1-norm\n(Equation (4)) to be more effective than other options\
    \ for training; therefore, we keep this choice, which\nproved effective also in\
    \ other generative problems [24]:\nL(t, Φ) ∝ || f (x, Φ) − yref||1.\n(4)\nAs for\
    \ minimization, the most widespread procedure, adopted also in this work, is the\
    \ SGD with\nmomentum [59]. The training set is partitioned into batches of samples,\
    \ T = {B1, . . . , BP}. At each\niteration, a new batch is used to estimate the\
    \ gradient and update parameters as:\nν(n+1) ← µν(n) + α∇ΦJ\n\x10\nBjn, Φ(n)\x11\
    \nΦ(n+1) ← Φ(n) − ν(n+1)\nA whole scan of the training set is called an epoch,\
    \ and training a deep network may require from\ndozens of epochs, for simpler\
    \ problems like handwritten character recognition [60], to thousands of\nepochs\
    \ for complex classiﬁcation tasks [55]. The accuracy and speed of training depend\
    \ on both the\ninitialization of Φ and the setting of hyperparameters like learning\
    \ rate α and momentum µ, with α\nbeing the most critical, impacting heavily on\
    \ stability and convergence time. In particular, we have\nfound experimentally\
    \ optimal values for these parameters, which are α = 0.5 × 10−3 and µ = 0.9.\n\
    For an effective training of the networks, a large cloud-free dataset is necessary,\
    \ with geophysical\nproperties as close as possible to those of the target data.\
    \ This is readily guaranteed whenever all\nimages involved in the process, for\
    \ example F−, F and F+, share a relatively large cloud-free area.\nPatches will\
    \ be extracted from this area to train the network, which, afterwards, will be\
    \ used to estimate\nF also on the clouded area, obtaining a complete coverage\
    \ at the target date.\nFor our relatively small networks (~7 × 104 weights to\
    \ learn in the worst case; see Table 1), a set\nof 19,000 patches is sufﬁcient\
    \ for accurate training, as already observed for other generative tasks\nlike\
    \ super-resolution [51] or pansharpening [8] addressed with CNNs of a similar\
    \ size. With our\npatch extraction process, this number requires an overall cloud-free\
    \ area of about 1000 × 1000 pixels,\nnamely about 4% of our 5253 × 4797 target\
    \ scene (Figure 2). If the unclouded regions are more\nscattered, this percentage\
    \ may somewhat grow, but remains always quite limited. Therefore, a perfectly\n\
    ﬁt training set will be available most of the times (always, in our experiments).\
    \ However, if the scene is\nalmost completely covered by clouds at the target\
    \ date, one may build a good training set by searching\nfor data that are spatially\
    \ and/or temporally close, characterized by similar landscape dynamics,\nor resorting\
    \ to data collected at other similar sites. This case will be discussed in more\
    \ detail with the\nhelp of a temporal transfer learning example in Section 6.\
    \ In the present case, instead, for each date,\na dataset composed of 15,200 33\
    \ × 33 examples for training, plus 3800 more for validation, was created\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2018, 10, 236\n10 of 20\nby sampling the target scene with an eight-pixel\
    \ stride in both spatial directions, always skipping test\narea and cloudy regions.\
    \ Then, the whole collection was shufﬂed to avoid biases when creating the\n128-example\
    \ mini-batches used in the SGD algorithm.\nTo conclude this section, we present\
    \ in Figure 4 some preliminary results about the evolution\nof the loss computed\
    \ on the validation dataset during the training process for a sample proposed\n\
    architecture and for some deviations from it. Although the L1 loss (or mean absolute\
    \ error) has not\nbeen directly considered for the accuracy evaluation presented\
    \ in the next section, which refers to\nwidespread measures of quality, it is\
    \ strictly related to them and can provide a rough preview of the\nperformance.\
    \ For the sake of simplicity, we gather in Figure 4 only a subset of meaningful\
    \ orthogonal\nhyperparameter variations. The ﬁrst observation is that after 500\
    \ training epochs, all models are about\nto converge, and doubling such a number\
    \ would provide a negligible gain as tested experimentally.\nDecreasing the number\
    \ of layers w.r.t. the reference architecture implies a considerable performance\n\
    drop. On the other side, increasing the network complexity with an additional\
    \ layer does not bring\nany gain. The number of features is also a factor that\
    \ can impact on accuracy. Figure 4 reports the\ncases when the number of features\
    \ for the ﬁrst layer is changed from 48 (proposed) to either 32 or 64.\nIn this\
    \ case, however, the losses are very close to each other, with the proposed and\
    \ the 64-feature\ncase almost coincident at the end of the training. The last\
    \ two plots show the impact of the learning\nrate α, and again, the proposed setting\
    \ (5 × 10−3) is “optimal” if compared with neighboring choices\n(10−3 and 10−2).\
    \ It is also worth underlining that using an higher learning rate, e.g., 10−2,\
    \ one can\ninduce a steep decay in the early phase of training, which can be paid\
    \ with a premature convergence.\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n5\n6\n7 ·10−2\nepochs\n\

    \ variants obtained by\nchanging one hyper-parameter at time.\nBesides accuracy,\
    \ complexity is also affected by architectural choices. For the same variants\n\
    compared in Figure 4, we report the average training time in Table 3, registered\
    \ using an NVIDIA GPU,\nGeForce GTX TITAN X. The test time is instead negligible\
    \ in comparison with that of training and is\ntherefore neglected. For all models,\
    \ the total cost for training is in the order of one hour. However,\nas expected,\
    \ increasing the number of network parameters adding layers or features impacts\
    \ the\ncomputational cost. Eventually, the proposed architecture is the result\

    3263\n3264\n5. Experimental Results\nIn order to assess the accuracy of the proposed\
    \ solutions, we consider two reference methods for\ncomparison, a deterministic\
    \ linear interpolator (temporal gap-ﬁlling), which can be regarded as the\nbaseline,\
    \ and afﬁne regression, both in causal and non-causal conﬁgurations. Temporal\
    \ gap ﬁlling\nwas proposed in [46] in the context of the development of a national-scale\
    \ crop mapping processor\nbased on Sentinel-2 time series and implemented as a\
    \ remote module of the Orfeo Toolbox [61]. This is\na practical solution used\
    \ by analysts [46] to monitor vegetation processes through NDVI time-series.\n\
    Besides being simple, it is also more generally applicable and robust than higher-order\
    \ models, which\nrequire a larger number of points to interpolate and may overﬁt\
    \ the data. Since temporal gap ﬁlling is\nnon-causal, we add a further causal\
    \ interpolator for completeness, a simple zero-order hold. Of course,\ndeterministic\
    \ interpolation does not take into account the correlation between available and\
    \ target\ndata, which can help in performing a better estimate and can be easily\
    \ computed based on a tiny\ncloud-free fraction of the target image. Therefore,\
    \ for a fairer comparison, we consider as a further\nreference the afﬁne regressors,\
    \ both causal and non-causal, optimized using the least square method.\nIf suitable,\
    \ post-processing may be included for spatial regularization, both for the reference\
    \ and\nproposed methods. This option is not pursued here. In summary, the following\
    \ alternatives are\nconsidered for comparison:\nbF =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\

    \ out on the basis of three commonly-used indicators,\nthe correlation coefﬁcient\
    \ (ρ), the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and the structural similarity\n\
    measure (SSIM). These are gathered in Tables 4–6, respectively, for all proposed\
    \ and reference methods\nand for all dates. The target dates are shown in the\

    \ and the previous and next dates used for prediction, respectively.\nThe following\

    \ and Future Perspective\nIn this section, we will discuss the accuracy of the\
    \ proposed methods both objectively, through\nthe numerical results gathered in\
    \ Tables 4–6, and subjectively by visually inspecting Figures 5 and 6.\nThen,\
    \ we conclude the section discussing critical conditions when training data cannot\
    \ be retrieved\nfrom the target.\nLet us start with the numerical evaluation focusing\
    \ for the time being on the ρ Table 4 and in\nparticular on the last column with\
    \ average values, which accounts well for the main trends. First of\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2018, 10, 236\n15 of 20\nall, the fully-cross-sensor solutions, based on only-SAR\
    \ or SAR + DEM data, respectively, are not\ncompetitive with methods exploiting\
    \ optical data, with a correlation index barely exceeding 0.6.\nNonetheless, they\
    \ allow one to obtain a rough estimate of the NDVI in the absence of optical coverage,\n\
    proving that even a pure spectral feature can be inferred from SAR images, thanks\
    \ to the dependencies\nexisting between the geometrical and spectral properties\
    \ of the scene. Moreover, SAR images provide\ninformation on the target, which\
    \ is not available in optical images, and complementary to it. Hence,\ntheir inclusion\
    \ can help with boosting the performance of methods relying on optical data.\n\
    Turning to the latter, we observe, as expected, that non-causal models largely\
    \ outperform the\ncorresponding causal counterparts. As an example, for the baseline\
    \ interpolator, ρ grows from\n0.761 (causal) to 0.846 (non-causal), showing that\
    \ the constraint of near real-time processing has\na severe impact on estimation\
    \ quality.\nHowever, even with the constraint of causality, most of this gap can\
    \ be ﬁlled by resorting to\nCNN-based methods. By using the very same data for\
    \ prediction, that is, only F−, the optical/C\nmodel reaches already ρ = 0.821.\
    \ This grows to 0.847 (like the non-causal interpolator) when also\nSAR data are\
    \ used and to 0.852 when also the DEM is included. Therefore, both the use CNN-based\n\
    estimation and the inclusion of SAR data guarantee a clear improvement. On the\
    \ contrary, using\na simple statistical regressor is of little or no help (causal\
    \ interpolator and regressor behave equally\nw.r.t. ρ by deﬁnition). Looking at\
    \ the individual dates, a clear dependence on the time gaps emerges.\nFor the\
    \ causal baseline, in particular, the ρ varies wildly, from 0.610–0.976. Indeed,\
    \ when the previous\nimage is temporally close to the target, like for 15 May,\
    \ and hence strongly correlated with it, even this\ntrivial method provides a\
    \ very good estimation, and more sophisticated methods cannot give much of\nan\
    \ improvement. However, things change radically when the previous available image\
    \ is acquired\nlong before the target, like for the 3 August or 12 October dates.\
    \ In these cases, the baseline does\nnot provide acceptable estimates anymore,\
    \ and CNN-based methods give a large performance gain,\nensuring a ρ always close\
    \ to 0.8 even in the worst cases.\nMoving now to non-causal estimation, we observe\
    \ a similar trend. Both reference methods\nare signiﬁcantly outperformed by the\
    \ CNN-based solutions working on the same data, and further\nimprovements are\
    \ obtained by including SAR and DEM. The overall average gain, from 0.851–0.907,\n\
    is not as large as before, since we start from a much better baseline, but still\
    \ quite signiﬁcant. Examining\nthe individual dates, similar considerations as\
    \ before arise, with the difference that now, two time gaps\nmust be taken into\
    \ account, with previous and next images. As expected, the CNN-based methods\n\
    provide the largest improvements when both gaps are rather large, that is, 30\
    \ days or more, like for the\n3 August and 2 September images.\nThe very same\
    \ trends outlined for the ρ are observed also with reference to the PSNR and SSIM\n\
    data, shown in Tables 5 and 6. Note that, unlike ρ and SSIM, the PSNR is quite\
    \ sensitive to biases on\nthe mean, which is why, in this case, the statistical\
    \ afﬁne regressor provides signiﬁcant gains over the\nlinear interpolator. In\
    \ any case, the best performance is always obtained using CNN-based methods\n\
    relying on both optical and SAR data, with large improvements with respect to\
    \ the reference methods.\nFurther insight into the behavior of the compared methods\
    \ can be gained by visual inspection of\nsome sample results. To this end, we\
    \ consider two target dates, 4 June and 3 August, characterized by\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ temporal changes in spectral features with respect to the closest available\
    \ dates. In the ﬁrst\ncase, a high correlation exists with the previous date ρ\
    \ = 0.8925, but not with the next ρ = 0.6566.\nIn the second, both correlation\
    \ indexes are quite low, 0.6566 and 0.6704, respectively. These changes\ncan be\
    \ easily appreciated in the images, shown in the top row of Figures 5 and 6, respectively.\
    \ In both\nﬁgures, the results of most of the methods described before are reported,\
    \ omitting less informative\ncases for the sake of clarity. To allow easy interpretation\
    \ of results, images are organized for increasing\ncomplexity from left to right,\
    \ with causal and non-causal versions shown in the second and third row,\nrespectively.\
    \ As the only exception, the first column shows results for SAR+ and non-causal\
    \ interpolator.\nMoreover, in the last two rows, the corresponding absolute error\
    \ images are shown, suitably magnified,\nwith the same stretching and reverse\
    \ scale (white means no error) for better visibility.\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10,\
    \ 236\n16 of 20\nFor 4 June, the estimation task is much simpliﬁed by the availability\
    \ of the highly correlated\n15 May image. Since this precedes the target, causal\
    \ estimators work almost as well as non-causal ones.\nModerate gradual improvements\
    \ are observed going from left to right. Nonetheless, by comparing\nthe ﬁrst (interpolator)\
    \ and last (optical-SAR+) non-causal solutions, a signiﬁcant accumulated\nimprovement\
    \ can be perceived, which becomes obvious in the error images. In this case, the\
    \ SAR-only\nestimate is also quite good, and the joint use of optical and SAR\
    \ data (fourth column) provides\nsome improvements.\nFor the 3 August image, the\
    \ task is much harder; no good predictor images are available, especially\nthe\
    \ previous image, 60 days old. In these conditions, there is clear improvement\
    \ when going from\ncausal to non-causal methods, even more visible in the error\
    \ images. Likewise, the left-to-right\nimprovements are very clear, both in the\
    \ predicted images (compare for example the sharp estimate of\noptical-SAR+ with\
    \ the much smoother output of the regressor) and in the error images, which become\n\
    generally brighter (smaller errors) and have fewer black patches. In this case,\
    \ the SAR-only estimate is\ntoo noisy, while the joint solution (fourth column)\
    \ provides a sensible gain over the others.\nTable 7. Temporal transfer learning\
    \ results for model “Optical-SAR+”. The (i, j) table entry corresponds\nto the\
    \ accuracy (ρ) obtained on the j-th date (column) when training is carried out\

    0.9289\nTo conclude this discussion, let us now focus on the learning-related\
    \ issues. In particular,\na fundamental question is how to proceed when no training\
    \ data can be collected from the target\nimage at a given time (fully cloudy condition).\
    \ To what extent we can use a machine learning model\ntrained elsewhere? This\
    \ is a key problem in machine learning and is very relevant for a number of\n\
    remote sensing applications, such as coregistration [62] or pansharpening [24].\
    \ In [62], the importance\nof selecting training data which are homogeneous with\
    \ the target has been underlined. In [24], it is\nshown that the performance of\
    \ a CNN can drop dramatically without a proper domain adaptation\nstrategy, and\
    \ the target-adaptive solution is proposed.\nTo gain insight into this critical\
    \ point, we beneﬁt from a simple test that gives an idea of the scale\nof the\
    \ problem. In particular, we have considered several training-test mismatches\
    \ by transferring\ntemporally the learned models. The accuracy assessed in terms\
    \ of the correlation index (similar results\nare obtained for PSNR and SSIM) for\
    \ all transfer combinations is shown in Table 7. The i-th row collects\nthe results\
    \ obtained on all dates by the model trained on the i-th date. Surprisingly, given\
    \ a target date,\nthe best model does not necessarily lie on the matrix diagonal,\
    \ as in three out of ﬁve cases, a model\ntransferred from a neighboring date outperforms\
    \ the model trained on the target date. More in general,\nwith one exception,\
    \ entry (2 September, 3 August), diagonal-adjacent values are relatively high,\
    \ while\nmoving away from diagonal (toward cross-season transfer), the accuracy\
    \ deteriorates progressively.\nIn other words, this table suggests that when weather\
    \ conditions are such that no training data can be\ncollected from the target,\
    \ one can resort to some extent to models trained in the same period of the year\n\
    as the spatio-temporal landscape dynamics are likely very similar. This means\
    \ also that one can refer\nfor training to acquisitions of previous years in similar\
    \ periods. It is also worth visually inspecting\nsome related estimates. In Figure\
    \ 7, for two sample target dates, we show the results obtained in\nnormal conditions\
    \ or by transferring the learning from different dates, the best (same season)\
    \ and the\nworst (cross-season) cases. Again it can be observed that models trained\
    \ within the season of the target\ncan work pretty well. On the contrary, although\
    \ preserving spatial details, when crossing the season,\nover- or under-estimate\
    \ phenomena can occur. In particular, if the model is trained in the rainy season\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 236\n17 of 20\n(rich vegetation) and tested in the dry\
    \ season (poor vegetation), we get over-estimation, while in the\nopposite case,\
    \ we get under-estimation.\nGround-truth\nno transfer: ρ = 0.978\nbest transfer:\

    \ for the estimation of spectral features when\noptical data are missing. Several\
    \ models have been considered, causal and non-causal, single-sensor\nand joint-sensor,\
    \ to take into account various situations of practical interest. Validation has\
    \ been\nconducted with reference to NDVI maps, using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2\
    \ time-series, but the proposed\nframework is quite general and can be readily\
    \ extended to the estimation of other spectral features.\nIn all cases, the proposed\
    \ methods outperform largely the conventional references, especially in the\n\
    presence of large temporal gaps. Besides proving the potential of deep learning\
    \ for remote sensing,\nexperiments have shown that SAR images can be used to obtain\
    \ a meaningful estimate of spectral\nindexes when other sources of information\
    \ are not available.\nSuch encouraging results suggest further investigation on\
    \ these topics. First of all, very deep\nCNN architectures should be tested, as\
    \ they proved extremely successful in other ﬁelds. However,\nthis requires the\
    \ creation of a large representative dataset for training. In addition, more advanced\n\
    deep learning solutions for generative problems should be considered, such as\
    \ the recently-proposed\ngenerative adversarial networks [63]. Finally, cross-sensor\
    \ estimation from SAR data is a stimulating\nresearch theme and certainly deserves\
    \ further study.\nSupplementary Materials: The software, developed in Python 2.7,\

    Technological advances in sensors and communications have enabled discrete integration
    into everyday objects, both in the home and about the person. Information gathered
    by monitoring physiological, behavioural, and social aspects of our lives, can
    be used to achieve a positive impact on quality of life, health, and well-being.
    Wearable sensors are at the cusp of becoming truly pervasive, and could be woven
    into the clothes and accessories that we wear such that they become ubiquitous
    and transparent. To interpret the complex multidimensional information provided
    by these sensors, data fusion techniques are employed to provide a meaningful
    representation of the sensor outputs. This paper is intended to provide a short
    overview of data fusion techniques and algorithms that can be used to interpret
    wearable sensor data in the context of health monitoring applications. The application
    of these techniques are then described in the context of healthcare including
    activity and ambulatory monitoring, gait analysis, fall detection, and biometric
    monitoring. A snap-shot of current commercially available sensors is also provided,
    focusing on their sensing capability, and a commentary on the gaps that need to
    be bridged to bring research to market. Previous article in issue Next article

    Many countries, including the United Kingdom, have an ageing population, with
    an increase in the average age and proportion of older people [1]. In 2010, there
    were approximately 10 million people over the age of 65 in the United Kingdom,
    with this number projected to rise by over 50% by 2020 [2]. One consequence of
    the ageing population is an increase in life expectancy implying greater healthcare
    needs. However, the relationship between age and dependency is complicated and
    not determined by age alone. Indeed, the risk factor profile of those born more
    recently is worse than previous generations [3]. This can be attributed, in part,
    to the link between economic development and increased risky behaviours [4]. Risk
    factors such as tobacco and alcohol use, inactivity, and poor diet choices are
    associated with chronic diseases including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and
    diabetes [4]. Recent advances in wearable technology including microelectromechanical
    (MEM) devices, physiological sensors, low-power wireless communications, and energy
    harvesting, have set the stage for a significant change in health monitoring.
    Technology can be discreetly worn and used as a means to monitor health and potentially
    enable older adults to live safely and independently at home. Early detection
    of key health risk factors enables more effective interventions to reduce the
    impact of, or even avoid, serious or chronic illness. Inertial measurement devices,
    such as accelerometers, represent a range of sensors that can be used for healthcare
    monitoring and are being extensively investigated for the monitoring of human
    movement [5] and daily activity [6]. Another application for wearable systems
    is rehabilitation [7]. There are also currently many systems commercially available
    for the monitoring of sports and some aspects of health. The richness of data
    available using wearable sensors presents challenges in the way that it is processed
    to provide accurate and relevant outputs. To fully exploit this data for the purposes
    of healthcare monitoring, data fusion techniques can be employed to make inferences
    and improve the accuracy of the output. Hall and Llinas [8] provide a detailed
    introduction and discussion to multisensor data fusion. A review of data fusion
    techniques is also provided by Castanedo [9] including the different categories
    of data fusion techniques. With a focus on body sensor networks, Fortino et al.
    [10] discuss wearable multisensor fusion with an emphasis on collaborative computing.
    This paper introduces wearable sensors for human monitoring in the context of
    health and well-being, including a snap shot of current commercial wearable sensor
    systems. An overview of data fusion techniques and algorithms is offered, including
    data fusion architecture, feature selection, and inference algorithms. These are
    put into the context of wearable technology for healthcare applications including
    activity recognition, falls detection, gait and ambulation, biomechanical modelling,
    and physiological sensing. Related challenges of data fusion for healthcare are
    presented and discussed. 2. Wearable sensors Wearable sensors can be considered
    in three categories: motion, biometric, and environmental sensors. Sensors used
    to capture human motions include inertial sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes,
    and magnetometers. By combining a tri-axial accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer,
    inertial measurement units can be made for 9 degree of freedom tracking and are
    used for biomechanical modelling. Common biometric sensors are used to measure
    heart rate, muscle activation, respiration, oximetry, blood pressure, galvanic
    skin response, heat flux, perspiration, and hydration level. Electrocardiogram
    (ECG) and electromyography (EMG) detect the electrical activity produced by the
    heart and muscles respectively and are interpreted into heart rate and muscle
    activation. For a wearable monitoring system to be practical it needs to meet
    several key criteria: to be non-invasive, intuitive to use, reliable, and provide
    relevant feedback to the wearer. The number of devices, location, and attachment
    method would be considered during design, and are usually application specific.
    Wearable sensor systems also have to take the target users’ needs, such as dexterity
    or cognitive ability, into account. Devices can be either attached directly to
    the skin using some form of adhesive, mechanically using a clip, strap or belt,
    or incorporated directly into clothing or shoes. Advanced fabrication techniques
    can now create ‘flexible/stretchable electronics’ for integrated circuits, electronics
    and sensors [11]. Such systems can be applied directly to the skin enabling discrete
    sensing possibilities e.g. devices developed by MC10 Inc. [12]. It is essential
    the system is reliable and measures with acceptable accuracy, providing the user
    with relevant feedback. In the research literature this is often presented as
    the accuracy of identifying specific events or health aspects, or in terms of
    selectivity and specificity, the proportion of the data that is positively identified
    correctly and the proportion of the data that is negatively identified correctly,
    respectively. The past decade has seen major advances in sensing technologies,
    including MEMs and physiological sensors. Wireless low power communications, such
    as BLE, enable sensing technology to be integrated into wearable devices, clothing,
    and in the future embedded about the person without the restrictions of wires
    or the need to download data. Low power sensing and communications also enable
    wearable energy harvesting to be a viable option for powering and recharging these
    systems. Commercially, wearable sensor systems are available for human monitoring
    and some of their output features are tabulated in Table 2. Much of the software
    developed for commercial devices is proprietary; however, some systems are able
    to provide raw data, or have been explicitly designed for the purposes of research.
    Table 3 describes wearable devices that are commercially available for activity,
    physiological, and biomechanical monitoring, including both consumer and research
    devices. The table presented gives a snapshot overview of commercial wearable
    devices as this is a wide and rapidly changing landscape, with the features monitored
    and the sensors used for daily monitoring, including a few examples for specific
    applications. Devices that only provide step count have not been included. A large
    proportion of these sensors target the health and fitness industry, and track
    the amount and intensity of activity performed including measures such as an estimate
    of energy expenditure and calories burned. For purposes of research however, a
    much broader range of outputs are being investigated and will be described in
    greater detail, including the techniques used to achieve them, in Section 5. Table

    for health monitoring is motivated by three main driving forces: (1) what data
    is required or provided by the sensors; (2) where it is considered acceptable
    to wear the sensors; and (3) the number of sensors the user is willing to wear.
    For commercial systems the most common place to wear a sensor is on the wrist
    or arm although many systems can be worn at multiple locations, such as on the
    chest using a clip or as a pendent, and the thigh and ankle (Table 3). The waist
    and wrist are intuitive and unobtrusive places to wear sensors as many people
    are already accustomed to wearing watches or belts. In a study conducted by van
    Hess et al. [13] to investigate the estimation of daily energy expenditure using
    a wrist-worn accelerometer, the acceptability of wearing the device on the hip
    or wrist was also examined. It was found that both sensor placements were rated
    as highly acceptable, however, men on average preferred wearing the sensor on
    the wrist. Systems with more niche applications need to be worn at more specific
    locations relevant to the information being acquired, e.g. the Reebok Checklight
    with MC10 helmet [14] that determines the number and severity of impacts to the
    head while participating in sports. Sensor placement for activity recognition
    has been investigated in several studies. Atallah et al. [15] investigated the
    most relevant features and sensor locations for discriminating activity levels,
    demonstrating the dependence of sensor location on the activities being monitored.
    Liu et al. [16] investigated different combinations of sensors and locations for
    physical activity assessment. The “best” results, i.e. the ones giving the highest
    activity recognition accuracy, were obtained using all the sensors, followed by
    a combination of the wrist and waist worn sensors. Patel et al. [17] also investigated
    the different combinations of sensors for monitoring patients with chronic obstructive
    pulmonary disease (COPD) and again found the “best” results were obtained using
    all the sensors (in this case 10 accelerometers distributed about the body). The
    “best” single sensor location was found to be on the left or right thigh. Pärkkä
    et al. [18] conducted a study to determine which sensors are most information
    rich for activity classification and included both motion and physiological sensors.
    Accelerometers were found to be most informative for activity monitoring, however
    the position of the sensors (on the wrists) did not enable the separation of sitting
    and standing. Interestingly, physiological sensors did not prove as useful for
    activity monitoring due to the delay in physiological reactions to activity changes,
    whereas accelerometers react immediately. Sensor orientation can also effect classification
    accuracy. Thiemjarus et al. [19] compared the performance of the k-NN (k-nearest
    neighbour) classifier using accelerometry data of activities with the sensor orientated
    in different directions. By transforming the signal to eliminate the orientation
    of the sensor an overall accuracy of 91% was achieved. 3. Data fusion This section
    discusses data fusion models and the different levels of data fusion. A description
    of the possible types of features that can be extracted to characterise the data
    and techniques to select them are also described. 3.1. Data fusion models A useful
    data fusion model is The Joint Directors of Laboratory model described by Hall
    and Llinas [8] that was developed to improve communications among military researchers
    and system developers. Work by Luo and Kay [20] define a hierarchical model consisting
    of four levels of abstraction at which fusion can take place; signal level fusion,
    pixel level fusion (for image data), feature level fusion, and symbol level fusion.
    Dasarathy [21] expanded on the hierarchical data fusion models by defining five
    fusion processes characterised by each processes input-output mode, e.g. data
    in - feature out fusion. For the application of healthcare many models have been
    suggested. Lee et al. [22] proposed a hierarchical model for the application of
    pervasive healthcare to minimise the probability of unacceptable error. Fortino
    et al. [10] described a framework for collaborative body sensor networks, C-SPINE.
    Gong et al. [23] proposed a multi preference-driven data fusion model and demonstrated
    its application for a wireless sensor network healthcare monitoring system. Fig.
    1 describes a generic centralised hierarchical data fusion architecture for a
    wearable health monitoring systems, drawing on three of the data fusion levels
    of abstraction (signal, feature, and decision) and elements from the previously
    described models. Data is sampled from the sensors (at a frequency appropriate
    to the sensor type and application) and transferred to the fusion centre which
    may reside on a smart phone or a gateway. An obvious way to do this is by using
    wireless radio communications, such as Low Energy Bluetooth (BLE) or Zigbee. Alignment
    and cleaning of the data takes place at the pre-processing stage to take into
    account differences in sampling rates, timing offsets, and lost or corrupt data.
    Filtering would also take place at this stage. Data can then be processed at the
    appropriate level of fusion. Additionally, some sensors may operate by being activated
    by an event trigger which may be the result of the systems output. Potentially,
    in the case of a suspected fall detected using body worn accelerometry, a camera
    could be activated to gain additional context of the event. Download : Download

    architecture for wearable health monitoring systems incorporating concepts from
    [8] and [20]. To interpret the sensor data three main hierarchical levels at which
    data fusion takes place are commonly used: signal level data fusion (sometimes
    referred to as direct or raw data fusion), feature level fusion, and decision
    (symbolic or inference) level fusion [8]. Signal level fusion can be applied to
    combine commensurate data i.e. data measuring the same property, directly. For
    example, to deduce kinematic parameters for biomechanical modelling, the Kalman
    filter (KF) can be used to estimate the state. For data that is non-commensurate,
    fusion takes place at the feature level [8]. Features are extracted from the sensor
    data and used to form a feature vector that, after fusion, will result in a higher
    level representation of the data. If appropriate, output from the signal level
    fusion can be used as part of the feature vector. There are a wide range of parametric
    and non-parametric algorithms that can be used to classify the data into higher
    levels of abstraction, which will be described in further detail in Section 4.
    Decision level fusion is performed at the highest level of abstraction from sensor
    data and can be based on raw data, features extracted from the raw data, and symbols
    defined at the feature level fusion to make higher level deductions. Probabilistic
    methods are commonly used at the decision level due to the high levels of uncertainty;
    however other methods that are also tolerant of uncertainty can also be used including
    artificial intelligence, fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms. 3.2. Feature extraction
    and selection To combine data for the classification or detection of an activity
    or event characteristics, or features, are extracted from the sensor data as input
    for the data fusion algorithm. The features represent the information in the original
    signal and are usually calculated over fixed time windows that can range from
    0.5 to 10 s long. Using a fixed window, an overlap in the data can be applied,
    with the effect of smoothing the output. Typically, a 1 s window is sufficient,
    with a 50% overlap with the previous window, however this is application dependent
    and a longer or shorter window maybe more appropriate. Features can be summarised
    into two main domains: time and frequency, however some features incorporate both
    temporal and frequency elements, such as wavelets [24]. A summary of some of these
    features can be found in Table 4. Table 4. Example features that can be extracted
    from sensor data. Domain Type Feature Time Signal characteristics Absolute value
    Range Maximum/minimum Zero crossings Derivative Integral Jerk Root mean square

    characteristics Mean Median Variance Standard deviation Skew Kurtosis Interquartile
    range Percentiles Pearson coefficients Cumulative histograms Cross correlation
    Entropy Frequency Fourier coefficients Energy Power Wavelet features Power spectral
    density Feature selection describes the process by which features are chosen.
    This is sometimes based on empirical observation, however, search strategies can
    provide an objective means to select appropriate features. Search strategies fall
    broadly under two types; filter based, where the properties of the data are examined
    without knowledge of the inference algorithms to be used; and wrapper based that
    use the performance of the target learning algorithm to inform the set of features
    [25]. An introduction to feature selection has been provided by Guyon and Elisseeff
    [26]. For wearable sensor applications, selecting the most appropriate features
    can make a great difference to the quality of the inference. Atallah et al. [15]
    compared feature sets for activity recognition compiled using several filter based
    feature selection algorithms including Relief and Simba, that aim to maximise
    the margins between decision boundaries, and minimum redundancy maximum relevance.
    A common problem for multi-sensory systems is high dimensionality feature space
    which leads to increased computational costs and higher demands on memory. Algorithms
    such as independent component analysis and principal component analysis [24] can
    be used to reduce the dimensionality of feature space. Deep learning, offers an
    alternative approach building features at multiple levels of a deep network. While
    deep learning has often been applied to static data, Längkvist et al. [27] provided
    a review of deep learning for time-series data. Plötz et al. [28] compared different
    types of features used to represent human activity data including: statistical
    metrics, fast Fourier transform coefficients, principal component analysis based
    features, and those derived using deep learning methods. A standard nearest neighbour
    classifier, which will be described later, was used to demonstrate the effectiveness
    of the features. For systems reliant on wireless communications, including body
    worn systems, power consumption also requires consideration i.e. the trade-off
    between transmitting raw data to the fusion centre vs. extracting features for
    transmission on the sensing device. 4. Data fusion algorithm overview In the following
    sections an overview of the different types of data fusion algorithms are presented
    and examples given from the research literature. For feature level data fusion,
    non-parametric algorithms (that do not make assumptions regarding the distribution
    of the data) and parametric algorithms are presented. At the decision level, algorithms
    including Bayesian approaches, fuzzy logic, and topic models will be described.
    4.1. Signal level algorithms • Weighted averages - is a simple signal level fusion
    method for combining commensurate information by taking an average of all the
    sensor readings [20]. The contribution of the “worst” sensor’s error will be alleviated
    in the final estimate, although not eliminate it completely. To reduce the impact
    of large erroneous sensor readings weighted averages can be used [24]. For example,
    the weighted average of physiological temperature measurements could be taken
    from an array of body worn thermistors to find a single best estimate. • The Kalman
    filter (KF) - is a popular statistical state estimation method that can be used
    to fuse dynamic signal level data. The state estimates of the system are determined
    based on a recursively applied prediction and update algorithm and assumes the
    state of a system at the current time is based on the state of the system at the
    previous time interval. One of the main advantages of the KF is that it is computationally
    efficient [29]. The KF is often used to fuse accelerometer and gyroscope information
    to provide better estimates, an example of which is the use of the KF to detect
    postural sway during quiet standing (standing in one spot with out performing
    any other activity or leaning on anything) [30] . For non-linear filtering the
    extended KF or unscented KF can be used. • Particle filtering (PF) - Particle
    filtering is a stochastic method to estimate moments of a target probability density,
    when they can’t be computed analytically. The principle is to generate random
    numbers called particles, from an “importance” distribution that can be easily
    sampled. Then, each particle is associated a weight that corrects the dissimilarity
    between the target and the importance probabilities. In the Bayesian context,
    particle filters are often used to estimate the mean of the posterior density.
    They have the benefit of estimating the full target distribution without any assumption,
    which makes them particularly useful for nonlinear /non-Gaussian systems. Djurić
    et al. [31] and Arulampalam [32] both provided a tutorial of PF theory. The PF
    can be used for biomechanical state estimation based on accelerometer and gyroscope
    data. 4.2. Feature level non-parametric algorithms • k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN)
    - One of the simplest classification algorithms, k-NN measures the distance between
    the unlabelled observations and the training samples to infer which class they
    belong to. The unlabelled observation is assigned the label of its nearest neighbours
    where k is the number of training observations to be taken into account. Distance
    measures include the Euclidean and Manhattan distance. Use of k-NN has been widely
    used and reported in the literature for activity classification applications [15],
    [16], [19], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. Bicocchi et al. [37], in particular,
    compared k-NN to several other instance based learning algorithms using a real-life
    activity set and achieved a precision of about 75% with k equal to 1. • Decision
    Trees (DT) - DT or rule-based algorithms are a popular method used for classification.
    Rules are defined in the form of a “tree”, starting at the root that is split
    into decision nodes which refine the class prediction with each level of decision
    nodes. Leaf nodes represent the predicated class of the unknown data [5]. DT can
    be constructed manually by empirically defining rules; however, algorithms are
    available to automatically generate trees based on the data such as ID3 and C4.5.
    Other DT algorithms include CART, random tree, random forest, and J48. Examples
    of the use of DT for activity recognition include [17], [18], [34], [35], [38],
    [39], [40], [41]. • Support Vector Machines (SVM) - SVM have been extensively
    used for human activity classification [16], [17], [36], [39], [42], [43] and
    can be used for both linear and non-linear classification problems. SVM is a binary
    classifier finding separation between two classes. The data is mapped into a high
    dimensional space using a kernel function (such as a Gaussian, sigmoid, or radial
    basis function). A hyperplane is then found that maximises the decision boundary
    between the examples of the classes [44]. In a comparative study by Liu et al
    [16] to determine the best sensor configuration to recognise activities, SVM performed
    better than the k-NN and Naive Bayes classifiers with an accuracy of 76% using
    a single hip worn accelerometer, to 88% using a hip and wrist worn accelerometer
    and a ventilation sensor that measures features associated with breathing. • Artificial
    Neural Network (ANN) and Deep Learning - An ANN is a biologically inspired computational
    model to describe functions consisting of a network of simple computing elements,
    or nodes [45]. An ANN structure is composed of several layers of nodes connected
    by weighted links. Inputs into the ANN are propagated forward through the layers
    to compute the output of the network, as follows: for each node, the sum of the
    weights multiplied by the input value of all inputs is found. The output for this
    node is then calculated by the activation function, such as the sigmoid function.
    To train the network, the internal connective weights are adjusted using techniques
    such as back propagation which minimises the error between the network’s output
    and the target output [45]. ANN have been applied to the problem of classifying
    human activity recognition; some examples include [18], [36], [46], [47]. Pärkkä
    et al. [18], Roy et al. [46], and Altun et al. [36] conducted studies to compare
    the performance of ANN to other algorithms. Yang et al. [47] implemented an activity
    recognition strategy based on two phase neural classification. During the first
    phase, activities are classified as either static or dynamic activities, then
    during the second phase more detailed activity recognition is performed. Recently,
    success with deep learning methods, based on neural networks, have attracted interest
    from many domains including image classification and natural language processing
    [48]. As mentioned previously, deep learning can be used to learn features for
    activity recognition [28], and as well as perform classification. 4.3. Feature
    level parametric algorithms • Gaussian mixture model (GMM) – GMM can be used as
    a parametric classifier by modelling the probability distribution of continuous
    measurements or features. A GMM consists of a weighted sum of Gaussian distributions
    that can be trained with example data using algorithms such as expectation-maximisation
    (EM) [38], [49]. A GMM is trained for each class, then the new data examples are
    classified by determining the GMM that provides the highest likelihood of producing
    the data. Allen et al. [38] used GMM to distinguish postures and movements for
    the monitoring of older patients based on accelerometer data, comparing it to
    the performance of a heuristic DT system. Wang et al. [49] classified five gait
    patterns using GMM. • k-Means – k-means is an unsupervised iterative distance-based
    clustering algorithm. It aims to classify data based on the distance of a data
    point to the mean centroid of each cluster. The classifier is trained by defining
    k centroids, one for each cluster. These can be defined randomly or by defining
    the initial centroid based on all the training data and subsequent centroids using
    the data points furthest away from the initial centre [24]. An iterative process
    is then used to minimise the distance of the centroids from the data points. Each
    data point is assigned to the nearest centroid, after which the centroid is recalculated
    based on the clusters that are formed. This process is repeated until the criteria
    to stop have been met. After this process, data for classification is assigned
    to the closest centroid. Ghassemzadeh et al. [33] used k-means clustering to define
    motion primitives which, in combination, form transcripts that can be used for
    activity recognition. Machado et al. [50] applied k-means clustering to the problem
    of activity recognition using accelerometry successfully predicting activities
    with an accuracy of 89% for the user independent case. 4.4. Decision level algorithms
    • Bayesian inference - Approaches, based on Bayes theorem, relate the posterior
    probability, i.e. the probability of the hypothesis occurring given the observations
    (or features), the prior probability of the hypothesis, and the likelihood, i.e.
    the probability of the observations given the hypothesis. Bayesian methods enable
    the inclusion of prior probabilities that can take into account known information
    and can be updated based on the observations. The Naive Bayes classifier is a
    popular method for inferring activity from sensor data. Despite the assumption
    of independence between features, which is often considered poor, it can perform
    well. Atallah et al. [51] used Bayesian classification for activity recognition
    from an ear worn accelerometer based device. One drawback of Bayesian inference
    is the requirement that competing hypotheses are mutually exclusive, however,
    this is not generally compatible with the way humans assign belief [24]. Dempster–Shafer
    theory, also known as belief function theory or evidential reasoning, provides
    a framework for reasoning with uncertainty by extending the Bayesian approach
    [24]. • Fuzzy logic - or fuzzy set theory, is a fusion technique that can be applied
    at the decision level and have been used for the recognition of human activities
    using both wearable and ambient sensors [52], [53]. Fuzzy logic describes input
    data in terms of possibility, i.e. the possibility the input data describes some
    property [24]. Medjahed et al. [53] describe three main steps for the application
    of fuzzy logic. First, fuzzification takes place converting the data into fuzzy
    sets. Secondly, a fuzzy inference system is applied which consists of fuzzy rules
    that take the IF/THEN form and fuzzy set operators including the union, complement
    and intersection [24]. Finally, defuzzification is applied to convert fuzzy variables
    generated by the process into real values. • Topic models - are an unsupervised
    machine learning algorithm originally designed for aiding understanding of large
    corpuses of text. They allow hidden thematic patterns in a dataset to be discovered
    using latent Dirichlet allocation. Huynh et al. [54] showed that Topic Models
    could be used to discover routine behaviours (e.g. lunch) from other activities
    (e.g. queuing, eating). Seiter et al. [55] further investigated the robustness
    of Topic Models for daily routine discovery by varying the characteristics of
    simulated datasets based on the original data collected by Huynh et al. and identified
    optimal values of dataset properties required to achieve good performance stability.
    5. Applications of data fusion for health monitoring 5.1. Activity recognition
    Activity monitoring using wearable technology has received a vast amount of attention.
    A person’s level of functional mobility can directly reflect quality of life (QoL)
    and overall health. From information provided by wearable sensors, feature level
    data fusion techniques and inference methods can be used for activity recognition
    at different levels of detail: activity intensity levels, static and dynamic postures,
    and activities of daily living (ADL). Static postures refer to activities which
    are globally still, such as lying and sitting, where as dynamic postures refer
    to activities during which someone is actively moving, such as bipedal activities
    and during transitions, e.g. moving from sitting to standing. Standing can be
    referred to as a dynamic activity, e.g. [19], or a static activity, e.g. [56],
    depending on the perspective and application. Standing is a globally stationary
    activity, however, to maintain a standing posture active work is required on the
    part of the person. Corrective movements are continuously made which can be detected
    using a trunk worn accelerometer and have been used to investigate standing balance
    [57]. In contrast to maintain static postures such as sitting or lying, no active
    work is required on the part of the person. There are links between health and
    the amount of dynamic activity a person performs in the form of physical activity,
    such as walking, thus, even simple measures can provide insight into well-being
    [58]. Static and dynamic postural information can be used to determine the time
    spent in various positions and the amount of dynamic activity being carried out.
    ADL describe in greater detail the essential tasks of daily living. The ability
    with which individuals can perform these tasks are commonly assessed using questionnaires
    [59]. The research literature reflects the interest in using body-worn sensors
    to identify these activities, which can be treated either as individual activities
    [37] or by dividing the ADL into the levels of physical intensity each activity
    requires [51]. It can be seen from the research literature that accelerometers
    are the most widely used sensors for these applications. Exceptions include Pawar
    et al. [60], who performed body movement classification using artifacts present
    in wearable ECG signals, and Roy et al. [46] who combined surface EMG with accelerometers
    for activity recognition. Gyroscopes are also used for activity recognition, although
    not as frequently. Potentially this is due to their high power consumption while
    accelerometers can operate at very low power making them attractive for battery
    powered systems. An in-depth review of the technology used in wearable systems
    for health applications can be found in a review by Lowe and OLaighin [61]. It
    is worth noting that heuristic algorithms are often employed and used to great
    effect for activity recognition. These can be used alone or in conjunction with
    other data fusion techniques. For example, thresholds can be used to define the
    limits between one state and another, distinguish between periods of static and
    dynamic activity, and identify posture [19], [56], [62], [63], [64], [65]. Culhane
    et al. [64] used two bi-axial accelerometers attached to the thigh and sternum
    and by applying a threshold to the standard deviation of the sensor data, it could
    be determined if the wearer was static or dynamic. During static activities, posture
    was inferred using the accelerometer by measuring the tilt of the trunk and thigh.
    Dalton et al. [65] compared the mean of accelerometer data to thresholds that
    had been pre-defined to differentiate between activities. There are a wide range
    of approaches used for general activity recognition, however some studies are
    more disease specific. Tsipouras et al. [66] developed a method for the automatic
    assessment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia for patients living with Parkinson’s
    disease. Using data from body worn accelerometers and gyroscopes, levodopa-induced
    dyskinesia could be detected and the severity assessed. Salarian et al. [67] and
    Rodriguez-Martin et al. [43] also investigated the use of activity classification
    for Parkinson’s disease using fuzzy classification and SVM, respectively. Other
    participant cohorts that were the focus of different studies include: those who
    had recently been in hospital [62], rehabilitation [64], stroke [46], and COPD
    [17], [68]. 5.2. Fall detection and prediction Fall detection, often performed
    in conjunction with activity recognition [63], [69], [70], is another widely researched
    application for wearable sensing technology. The incidence of falls and the risk
    of injury due to a fall increases as people age, affecting QoL and confidence.
    After a fall, it may not be possible to call for help or attract attention which
    could result in a sustained period of time without assistance. During this time,
    dehydration, hunger, and injuries sustained during the fall can lead to prolonged
    hospital stays and potentially prove fatal. Heuristics are often employed for
    fall detection including work by Bourke et al. [71] who investigated fall detection
    using 2 tri-axial trunk and thigh worn accelerometers. The resultant was calculated
    for both accelerometers and an upper falls thresholds applied capable of identifying
    100% of falls from normal activities. In subsequent work, Bourke et al. [72] applied
    thresholds to the resultant of the angular velocity from a trunk mounted gyroscope.
    Karantonis et al. [63] used a single waist worn accelerometer and thresholds to
    determine activity, rest, posture and falls. Benocci et al. [73] also conducted
    falls detection using an accelerometer attached to the sacrum and simulated falls
    from standing, walking, out of bed, and sliding down a wall. Wang et al. [74]
    described a three-fold threshold system that combine a trunk worn accelerometer
    and cardiotachometer to detect falls. The thresholds test for high accelerometer
    values, angle of the trunk, and heart rate to detect a fall. One of the greatest
    predictors of a fall is having fallen previously, therefore it is of equal importance
    to be able to predict a fall such that preventative measures can be put in place.
    As well as the detection of falls, work by Giansanti et al. [75] used wearable
    sensors to determine the risk of falls using 60 s balance tests. An accelerometer
    and gyroscope were worn on the trunk and a four layer ANN were used to classify
    participants into fall risk levels. 5.3. Gait and ambulatory monitoring Gait analysis
    can provide insight into functional mobility, ranging from the ability to perform
    various bipedal activities to a detailed account of the gait cycle. Gait analysis
    and biomechanical modelling are traditionally performed in laboratory environments
    using optical motion capture to track body segment motion. More recently body
    worn inertial devices have been investigated as an alternative, eliminating the
    need to collect data in specialised laboratories. Biomechanical modelling of the
    lower body could be used to build unique gait models such that deviations from
    the norm could indicate the need for treatment or intervention. Moe-Nilssen and
    Helbostad [76] used a low back mounted accelerometer to monitor gait variability
    in the anterior-posterior and mediolateral plane, and estimate cadence, step,
    and stride length over a known distance and was used to differentiate between
    fit and frail older adults. Xu et al. [77] examined the walking parameters of
    those recovering from stroke with a hemiparetic gait for rehabilitation purposes.
    A hierarchical approach using Naïve Bayes and dynamic time warping methods were
    used to classify walking, then gait parameters are computed including walking
    speed, cadence, stride length, and distance travelled. In the clinical environment,
    gait has been used to predict the risk of falling using tools such as the Tinetti
    gait and balance assessment [78]. Body-worn sensors could be used as an alternative
    or complementary assessment. Caby et al. [79] collected accelerometry data from
    10 sensors during a walking test and the Timed Up-and-Go for the objective classification
    of fallers and non-fallers. Accelerometry and force sensitive resistors have also
    been used to distinguish between normal and abnormal gait [80]. Ishigaki et al.
    [81] determined pelvic movement from an accelerometer and gyroscope mounted on
    the sacrum during 10m of free walking to find correlations with stability in older
    adults. Less pelvic motion was found for those classed as unstable based on a
    single leg balance test. The differences in bipedal locomotion styles imposed
    by environmental conditions such as a flat or sloped surface, and stairs are subtle.
    The ability to negotiate these conditions can be an indication of physical well-being
    and used to monitor those with limited mobility. To this end, Wang et al. [82]
    decomposed the acceleration data from a single waist mounted sensor into frequency
    features using wavelets to classify the different walking patterns using a multilayer
    perceptron neural network. In further work, Wang et al. [83] included walking
    up and down two different gradients and used GMM for classification. Lau et al.
    [84] focused on walking conditions for those with uni-lateral drop foot and deployed
    two accelerometers and a single gyroscope on the affected side to distinguish
    the aforementioned conditions and compare classification results from several
    data fusion methods. Muscillo et al. [85] adopted an adaptive Kalman-based Bayes
    estimation method to differentiate between locomotor conditions for both young
    and older adults. By analysing gait events, such as heel contact, heel-off, and
    toe-off, body-worn sensors can be used to characterise gait for applications such
    as drop foot stimulation [86]. Kotiadis et al. [87] investigated gait phase detection
    for drop foot, exploring trigger timings for a stimulator. For those suffering
    from Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis gait disturbances, such as freezing
    of gait, can be an indication of a higher risk of a fall. Tripoliti et al. [88]
    used body worn accelerometers and gyroscopes for the automatic detection of freezing
    of gait. Accelerometers can also be used to recognise an individual’s gait [89]
    which in a multi-resident home or scenario where sensors are shared could aid
    identification of the wearer. 5.4. Biomechanical modelling Parametric state estimation
    algorithms, such as the KF and PF, can be used to measure biomechanical motions
    by combining accelerometer and gyroscope data to estimate the kinematic parameters.
    These algorithms come under the banner of signal level fusion methods as they
    combine commensurate data to achieve the best estimation of a parameter. Musić
    et al [90] used an extended KF to fuse inertial sensor data for the reconstruction
    of body segment trajectories in the sagittal plane of sit-to-stand motions. Takeda
    et al. [91] presented a method for gait analysis by calculating the 3-dimensional
    position of each lower body segment using 7 tri-axial accelerometers and gyroscopes,
    joint-range-of-motion, the contribution of gravity to the accelerometer signals,
    and frequency features that describing the cyclic nature of walking. Due to the
    high power consumption of gyroscopes other methods using multiple accelerometers
    are being developed such as the double-sensor difference algorithm presented by
    Liu et al. [92] for the measurement of rotational angles of human segments. Djurić-Jovičić
    et al. [93] used pairs of tri-axial accelerometers for the estimation of leg segment
    angles and trajectories in the sagittal plane through the removal of sensor drift.
    5.5. Physiological monitoring By monitoring physiological aspects of health, an
    insight can be gained into how well our bodies are functioning, and can be used
    to monitor cardiovascular health, and the potential onset of illness (i.e. body
    temperature). A novel use of accelerometers was presented by Lapi et al. [94]
    to detect respiratory rate by positioning sensors on opposite sides of the chest
    wall. Li and Kim [95] developed a patch style sensor for wireless heart rate monitoring
    and movement index incorporating a HR monitor and accelerometer. Stress is another
    area of well-being that has drawn interest by the research community due to its
    impact on health and well-being. A system presented by Healey and Picard [96]
    was able to classify stress during real-world driving tasks into three levels
    based on wearable sensors including two skin conductivity sensors, ECG, EMG, chest
    expansion respiration sensor. Ikehara and Crosby [97] used physiological sensors
    to assess cognitive load. Sensors used in this study included those to measure
    electrodermal temperature and blood flow, an eye tracker extracting related features,
    and an oximeter. Luprano et al. [98] incorporated textile electrodes and an accelerometer
    into a shirt to measure ECG and perform activity recognition. Fletcher et al.
    [99] developed a system for cognitive behavioural therapy for drug addiction that
    monitors for unusual arousal patterns using accelerometer, temperature, and electrodermal
    activity sensors (with optional ECG). When specific arousal events are detected
    a message was automatically sent to the wearer’s phone with an empathetic message.
    Bandodkar et al. [100] described sodium sweat sensors applied as a temporary stick
    on ‘tattoo’ sensor. These sensors were tested in a laboratory during stationary
    cycling activities. Indeed there are many biological MEMs sensors being developed
    that can be applied to physiological monitoring such as the triglyceride biosensor,
    C-reactive protein detector to monitor increases which may cause heart attacks
    or cardiovascular disease, and membrane-based glucose sensors for diabetics [101].
    6. Discussion and further considerations 6.1. Wearable sensors Energy remains
    a dilemma for long term wearable research as it dictates not only how the wearable
    is used by the individual, but also the quality and availability of the data.
    For the application of activity recognition, inertial sensors such as accelerometers
    and gyroscopes provide the most appropriate data. The number of sensors required
    depends largely on the application. If we consider the use of one to five sensors,
    for the purpose of identifying fundamental static and dynamic postures a single
    sensing device can be sufficient. Wrist worn devices, as favoured commercially,
    are not well placed to accurately distinguish between sitting and standing postures
    but can detect overall activity level. For the general population, measuring activity
    intensity may be sufficient, however, for those that live with chronic disease
    or have restricted movement, the distinction between sitting and standing would
    provide further insight into their well-being and health. A single waist or trunk
    worn sensor will provide information on the transitions between sitting and standing
    and the global pose of the body, improving activity recognition accuracy. A single
    waist worn sensor can also be used to monitor gait variability, cadence, step
    and stride length [76] as described in Section 5.3. However, these methods were
    developed for walking in a straight line using a known distance and would not
    be suitable for free living monitoring. A two-sensor scenario would include a
    sensor on the wrist which would provide information related to ADL, e.g. cooking,
    eating and drinking. With the addition of a third sensor on an ankle or foot,
    more detailed parameters regarding gait can be extracted such as unilateral step
    length and height. An optional sensor positioned on the thigh would provide more
    definitive information regarding body posture, however maybe redundant if used
    in conjunction with a waist worn sensor. Five sensors, worn at the waist, wrists
    and ankles, would provide even greater levels of detail regarding both leg and
    arm movement that can be used for bilateral gait analysis and increase the accuracy
    of activity recognition algorithms. For applications that require data from many
    sensors to address specific diseases or conditions, the benefits of an improved
    QoL may well outweigh the inconvenience of wearing multiple sensors. This presents
    several challenges regarding the usability of the system, such as taking the sensors
    on and off, recharging the sensors, and overall adherence of wearing the system.
    With the wide availability of small, cheap, low powered sensors, incorporating
    them directly into clothing where needed could address some of these challenges.
    Further, near field charging would negate the need to directly connect the system
    to a power source. 6.2. Data fusion models and algorithms The data fusion model
    presented in this paper is based on a centralised hierarchical data fusion model
    and can be seen to be the most commonly used model for most commercial health
    monitoring and many research systems. Most of these systems are aimed at personal
    health and well-being monitoring and focus on determining specific features related
    to that individual. For more complex environments and scenarios, this type of
    architecture can be extended, such that the output, i.e. the local view, can be
    used to contribute towards the global view. This is similar to a distributed architecture
    [9] and could be used in the study of epidemiology, e.g. disease surveillance
    in hospitals. This architecture also naturally lends itself towards a decentralised
    architecture where data fusion takes place at each node and does not rely on a
    single fusion centre making it more robust to intermittent or unreliable communications
    services [9]. In this case each personal system becomes part of a community of
    nodes, each contributing information as and when it can and could be implemented
    in situations such as disaster sites. The choice of data fusion algorithm used
    depends on the target application. Influences include the required output, system
    accuracy, computational complexity, available processing power, battery power
    available, and expected operational time. Many of these aspects constitute a direct
    trade off. Low complexity data fusion algorithms, such as heuristic thresholds,
    weighted averages, k-NN, and k-means, are well suited to simple activity recognition
    applications. These include estimating activity intensity and fundamental static
    and dynamic postures. These are ideal for applications where a long battery life
    is expected and on-wearable user feedback is given. These algorithms can be trained
    in advance and could be implemented on the wearable using simple features extracted
    from the sensor data. These type of algorithms are well suited to everyday free
    living situations as targeted by many commercial systems. Medium complexity data
    fusion algorithms, require more computational power, and in turn more energy to
    run. The data can be treated in two ways, (1) implement the algorithm on-wearable,
    or, (2) transmit the data off-wearable to the fusion centre. Both methods require
    more energy and will shorten the battery life of the wearable system. These algorithms
    include activity recognition algorithms that can infer more complex ADL such as
    Naive Bayes, GMM, DT, and NN. Kinematic estimation algorithms such as the KF which
    can be used towards biomechanical and gait analysis, however, require a high sampling
    frequency of typically 50-100Hz, higher than many sampling frequencies required
    for activity recognition. For research applications, data is often collected using
    wearable sensor nodes and then post-processed. Medium complexity, as previously
    mentioned, to high complexity algorithms have been used for activity recognition
    including SVM, deep learning, and Bayesian networks. To extract and process the
    the relevant data for biomechanical and gait analysis, as previously described,
    KF, extended KF, and PF can be used for the kinematic state estimation. Feature
    level algorithms can then be used to extract features such as clinically relevant
    outputs. Depending on the algorithm, there is more or less transparency of how
    the algorithm maps the sensor data to the output features. Algorithms based on
    neural networks and deep learning provide little insight into this process and
    requires training with large example data sets. Where as model based algorithms,
    for example the KF, control how the sensor data maps to the features but requires
    a predefined model. 6.3. Annotation and system validation Collecting accurately
    labelled activity data in a natural environment to apply to machine learning techniques
    is time consuming and expensive. To reduce the amount of labelled data needed
    to train activity recognition algorithms, techniques can be used such as semi-supervised
    training and active learning [102], [103], [104], [105]. Semi-supervised training
    approaches use small amounts of labelled training data to initially train the
    activity recognition algorithms which are then used to label the unlabelled data.
    Stikic et al. [102] demonstrated two approaches to semi-supervised training, self-training
    (the classification model is updated iteratively based on the most confidently
    predicted newly labelled data) and co-training (the same as self-training but
    uses additional information to augment the process). Active learning finds the
    unlabeled data with the most information and queries the user to label them. Various
    strategies can be used to decide what data has the most information such as the
    data that is classified with the least confidence, or the amount of disagreement
    between two classifiers [102]. This reduces the cost of annotating all the data
    and is a good alternative to manual annotation. Hoque and Stankovic [104] used
    a clustering technique to group activities based on data from a smart home environment
    and asked users to label each cluster rather than label all data. Active learning
    techniques can also be used to update a classifier after deployment. Longstaff
    et al. [105] explored active learning as a means to dynamically augment mobile
    activity classifiers. Diethe et al. [106] proposed a Bayesian active transfer
    learning framework for smart home environments. Although there is a wealth of
    research being carried out in the area of body worn sensors for health applications,
    further validation for many of the methods developed is needed using realistic
    conditions such as: matched participant cohorts, target environments, and natural
    behavioural conditions. This is especially true of fall detection where the algorithms
    used are often developed using simulated data from young healthy participants
    by tripping onto a crash mat or mattress. Algorithms based solely on laboratory
    data have been shown to fail and lead to unacceptably high rates of false alarms
    [107]. In a similar way, people rarely perform activities and ambulation in the
    same way as they would naturally when being cued to do it, or carrying out a script.
    Although features and data fusion algorithms may appear to be successful based
    on laboratory training and testing data, they may fail when used in real-world
    situations or from one person to the next. 6.4. Data loss and synchronisation
    Another challenge for data fusion for health monitoring is the imperfection introduced
    throughout the data fusion health monitoring system. Khaleghi et al. [108], in
    an in-depth review of the state-of-the-art in multisensor data fusion, provided
    a taxonomy of data imperfection including uncertainty, imprecision (vagueness,
    ambiguity and incompleteness), and granularity. Transferable belief models could
    be used as a method for modelling sensor reliability [109]. As well as error introduced
    by the sensors, wireless communications present another source of system error.
    For the application of body worn sensors, wireless transmission of data to a fusion
    centre is a desirable and practical option allowing it to be analysed continuously
    without unnecessary user interaction. Disruption in the communication of data
    to the fusion centre could severally affect the quality of the received data and
    be caused by: operation outside the range of the receiver; loss of power; receiver
    error, and packet loss. Retransmission of lost or corrupted packets can increase
    data reliability using two way communications, i.e. acknowledgement of received
    packets [69], however, there is a power trade off associated with receiving and
    resending packets and there will be a time delay introduced. Data transmitted
    from different sources will arrive to the fusion centre at different times and
    need to be aligned prior to analysis. This raises the issue of data synchronisation.
    Sensor data that is collected using more than one stand alone module can be synchronised
    by providing an input that each sensor can pick up, e.g. a series of taps made
    during recording. Any drift can then be calculated and the data resampled. Systems
    employing wireless communications can correct for clock drift by broadcasting
    a regular beacon from a master clock which can be used determine drift. Including
    this additional information with the time stamp of when the data was received
    can be used to reorder the data before fusion. The synchronisation of sensors
    is an open and often overlooked area of research and methods are restrained by
    the target application requirements, power consumption, sampling and transmission
    frequency, and robustness to data loss. Alemdar and Ersoy [110] presented a survey
    on wireless sensor networks for healthcare and discussed design considerations.
    The wireless sensor network system was broken down into five subsystems including:
    body area network, personal area network, gateway to the wide area network, and
    the end-user healthcare monitoring application. Each subsystem has a different
    set of design considerations. Gravina et al. [111] presented a framework called
    SPINE that can be used for multiple body worn sensor applications. Baker et al.
    [112] described wireless sensor network prototypes for home healthcare. 7. Conclusions
    This paper outlined the state-of-the-art and future concepts for using wearable
    sensors in healthcare applications. It describes some principles of data fusion
    and many of the foundation techniques that can be used to perform data fusion
    on wearable sensor data. The commercial landscape of wearable sensors is constantly
    changing, however a snap shot of some of the currently available products has
    been given, providing context for an overview of the research literature conducted
    in the area of wearable sensors for healthcare applications. Applications of wearable
    technology for healthcare has been described including activity recognition, falls
    detection, ambulatory monitoring, and biomechanical monitoring. A discussion of
    other considerations that need to be addressed to augment wearable sensor technology
    has been provided, highlighting potential directions for research and issues such
    as data collection, algorithm training, quality of data, infrastructure and the
    potential fusion of wearable sensors with other external data sources. Conflict
    of interest There are no known conflicts of interest. Acknowledgements This work

  explanation: This study proposes two Bayesian inference-based data fusion methods,
    the Bayesian minimum error fusion rule and the Bayesian minimum risk fusion rule,
    to combine identity declarations from individual sensors and improve grape variety
    classification. The methods are applied to aroma sensors, FT-IR spectrometers,
    and UV spectrometers, resulting in significantly enhanced classification accuracy
    compared to individual sensors.
  extract_1: The Bayesian minimum error fusion rule combines identity declarations
    from individual sensors to maximize the probability of the most likely class,
    thus improving classification accuracy. This method was applied to individual
    sensors, resulting in a significant improvement in white grape variety classification
    from 9.6% to 6.5% error.
  extract_2: The Bayesian minimum risk fusion rule further improves the classification
    accuracy by considering error costs associated with different types of misclassifications.
    This method allows for the incorporation of expert knowledge and prioritization
    of specific classification scenarios, leading to a further reduction in error
    rate to as low as 4.7%.

    Get rights and content Abstract The objective of this study is to present a fusion
    method based on the Bayesian inference to combine the outputs of various sensors.
    The sensors studied here are aroma sensors, FT-IR and UV spectrometers. The application
    deals with classifying musts of white grapes according to their variety. The fusion
    procedure is not based on the combination of the signals, but of the class assignments
    provided individually by each sensor. Two methods have been developed based on
    the Bayesian inference: the Bayesian minimum error fusion rule and the minimum
    risk rule. The latter involves both experimental knowledge, in computing error
    probability values, and expert knowledge, through the level of error costs. The
    paper presents the mathematical theory concerning the Bayesian approach and the
    results obtained on white grape classification. This effective fusion method leads
    to a significant improvement in the grape variety discrimination: the final misclassification
    error is 4.7%, whereas the best individual sensor (FT-IR) gave a misclassification
    error twice as high, i.e. 9.6%. Bayesian fusion proved to be very well suited
    to the combination of all kinds of analytical measurements or sensors (curves
    or single value outputs), as long as they provide individual classification outputs.
    Furthermore, Bayesian fusion is able to cope with sensors providing large, noisy
    and redundant data as well as sensors showing very dissimilar efficiency levels.

    1. Introduction Due to increasing consumer demand for information on food product
    quality and origin, food industry operators are increasingly anxious to guarantee
    the authenticity of their products. This is even more important for food products
    that are guaranteed to come from a precise geographic origin or to belong to a
    specific vegetal variety. In wine production, variety-based wine is increasingly
    popular with consumers. The ability to guarantee that a grape is, or is not, from
    an expected variety is of prime interest to wine makers. To certify the origin
    or the variety of products, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based technology can
    be used, which gives highly accurate results but is time consuming and costly.
    The alternative is to use several high-speed non-specific techniques and to combine
    their outputs [1]. This alternative is also called sensor or data fusion. Sensor
    fusion is analogous to the cognitive process used by humans to constantly integrate
    data given by their senses to make inferences about the external world. So far,
    in agriculture and food areas, it has been widely applied to robotics [2], [3]
    or remote sensing [4], [5]. Less common is sensor or data fusion applied to food
    quality control [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Ref. [7] propose to organise data fusion
    methods in three levels. 1. The first and most basic level involves concatenating
    raw sensor outputs and then processing them as if they were a single signal. This
    method, called low-level fusion, was applied beforehand to the data presented
    here and did not lead to significant improvement [11]. At present, the main difficulty
    in the application of the low-level fusion method concerns the manipulation of
    raw signals, frequently made up of noisy and redundant data, and which have an
    adverse effect on the classification results. 2. Mid-level fusion consists of
    extracting features from the signal of each sensor and in processing them. Mid-level
    fusion has been quite thoroughly explored [12], [13], [14]. It is particularly
    pertinent when few features are sufficient to provide all the information, for
    instance, when a curve can be modelled by a simple function. Spectra cannot be
    easily modelled using few features. However, “feature extraction” can be carried
    out, for instance, through wavelength selection. We have successfully applied
    it on this databank to FT-IR spectra [11]. 3. High-level fusion is carried out
    on the classification outputs of all the individual sensors. The classification
    output, i.e. the quality class that is assigned to the measured product based
    on the sensor signal, is called the “identity declaration”. In high level fusion,
    the identity declarations of each sensor are combined in order to give the final
    identity declaration. This method can be applied to all types of analytical measurements,
    since it combines class assignments and not analytical signals. Various techniques
    are used in high-level fusion [15]. They are either heuristic (elementary voting
    techniques), based on probability estimation such as the Bayesian inference [16],
    or methods based on possibility (or evidence theory), like the Dempster–Shafer
    theory [17], which is a generalization of Bayesian techniques applied to data
    with a high level of uncertainty. The Bayesian approach has been adopted in this
    study because probability values can be directly computed from the results of
    individual sensor classifications. Thus, this method is particularly well suited
    to pattern recognition issues. However, the Bayesian approach has rarely been
    applied to multisensor fusion [5], [18], [19]. The objective is to present two
    data fusion methods derived from the Bayesian inference. The application deals
    with classifying musts of white grapes according to their variety. The devices
    used are aroma sensors, FT-IR and UV spectrometers. The first step of these research
    studies has been published previously [11]. After a rapid description of material
    and classification methods—which can be fully retrieved in Ref. [11]—this paper
    presents the Bayesian inference used to establish the two multisensor fusion rules:
    the Bayesian minimum error fusion rule and the Bayesian minimum risk fusion rule.
    These high-level fusion procedures are then applied to the identity declarations
    given by the individual sensors. Finally, these results are compared to those
    produced by each individual sensor and the low-level fusion (tested in Ref. [11]);
    a discussion is proposed on the potential of high-level fusion rules to deal with
    an array of sensors capable of generating individual identity declarations. 2.
    Experimental This part is not thoroughly detailed as every experimental point
    has been described in Ref. [11]. 2.1. Samples Must samples (107) of white grapes
    have been collected and divided in four classes with regards to variety: 44 “Sauvignon”,
    14 “Mauzac”, 14 “Colombard” and a fourth class made of 35 samples of various other
    white varieties (“Chardonnay”,“Loin de l''œil”, “Riesling”, etc.). This class
    distribution mirrors the grape population distribution in the south of France.
    Each must sample has been prepared following the French Technical Institute for
    Wines (ITV) methodology [20]. 2.2. Materials 2.2.1. Aroma sensors The aroma sensor
    device was an upgraded LCA 1000 prototype (Midivaleur, Toulouse, France) based
    on five SnO2 gas sensors; the apparatus and the optimal experimental conditions
    used were described in a previous study [21]. The temperature of both measurement
    cell and headspace was set at 60 °C; 50-ml headspace was injected with a syringe
    into the 500-ml cell; then, each sample was measured. The cell was cleaned using
    desiccated and filtered air at a 500 ml min−1 flow rate. The five output curves
    were concatenated after removing the baseline value in order to create a unique
    aroma sensor curve. 2.2.2. FT-IR spectrometer The absorbance signal was acquired
    in the 4000–800 cm−1 range, with a 4 cm−1 acquisition step, using a Fourier-Transform
    mid-Infrared spectrometer (Bruker IFS 25, Bruker, Wissembourg, France). The samples
    were analyzed in an ATR cell (ZnSe, 10 reflections). The reference was distilled
    water. A triangular apodisation function was applied. Spectra were pre-processed
    using genetic algorithms (GA) to select the most suitable wavelengths for pattern
    recognition. 2.2.3. UV spectrometer The UV spectrometer (Secomam S1000, Secomam,
    Ales, F) measures the UV absorbance between 200 and 500 nm, including parts of
    UV and visible bands with a 1-nm resolution. Spectra were pre-processed using
    genetic algorithms. 2.3. Pre-processing and pattern recognition methods In a previous
    work [11], different pre-processing and pattern recognition methods were tested
    to provide the best classification results based on the outputs of each sensor.
    The FT-IR and UV spectra were pre-processed using Genetic Algorithms (GA) in order
    to select the most discriminant wavelength subset from the whole spectra. GA is
    now a well-known evolutionary-based technique used for feature (wavelength) selection
    to improve the robustness and the accuracy of multivariate models based on numerous
    correlated data [22], [23], [24]. A population of chromosomes, representing the
    various selected variable subsets, evolves using crossover during reproduction
    and mutations to produce the feature selection producing the best classification
    model. The genetic algorithm selection procedure as well as the parameters used
    in this application (population size, mutation rate, stop criterion, etc.) have
    been detailed in a previous paper [11]. The most accurate classification technique
    was based on Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression technique, adapted to pattern
    recognition by predicting the four classes of grapes using PLS2 algorithm with
    an exclusive binary coding scheme (four columns with 0:1): PLS-Discriminant Analysis
    (PLS-DA) [25]. For each sample, the PLS-DA model provides four figures, i.e. prediction
    values for the four grape variety classes; the sample is then assigned to the
    class predicted with the highest rate. For each sensor, the global classification
    error rate is computed using a leave-one-out cross-validation. 3. Theory In order
    to combine the information coming from each sensor, Bayesian inference is employed.
    Bayesian methods explicitly use probabilities for quantifying uncertainty in inference
    based on statistical data analysis. In this paper, the Bayesian inference method
    will first be described using one sensor, and then generalized for multisensor
    fusion. The population of the white grape samples is divided into g classes (or
    hypotheses) (k∈G={1,…,g=4} varieties), which are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.
    3.1. Bayesian minimum error fusion 3.1.1. Bayesian minimum error rule The Bayesian
    minimum error rule (Eq. (1)) aims at classifying the sample x into the most probable
    class k, based on its description Pr(k∣x), that is the conditional posterior probability
    of the hypothesis k, after considering the effect of evidence x: (1) This expression
    means that Ŷ(x)=k, for the hypothesis k which maximizes Pr(k∣x), i.e. the sample
    x is assigned to the most probable class (with the highest probability Pr(k∣x)).
    However, the conditional posterior probability Pr(k∣x) is not a direct output
    of the experiments. The aim of Bayes'' theorem is to express it using probability
    values that can be determined from the experiment. Thus, the posterior probability
    Pr(k∣x) is expressed using the probability of evidence x assuming the hypothesis
    k, Pr(x∣k) (also called likelihood function or conditional prior probability),
    the prior probability of the hypothesis k independent of the evidence x, pk and
    the evidence x probability Pr(x), which is independent from the hypotheses. (2)
    Using Bayes'' theorem (Eq. (2)), Eq. (1) becomes: (3) ∀k∈G Pr(x) is constant,
    being independent from the hypotheses.Thus, Eq. (3) gives: (4) As we will see
    in the “Application paragraph” (Section 3.3), Pr(x∣k) can be directly computed
    from the confusion matrix experimentally obtained for each sensor and pk depends
    on the sample population. 3.1.2. Bayesian minimum error fusion rule As far as
    N sensors are concerned, Eq. (4) can be generalized as the Bayesian minimum error
    fusion rule (Eq. (5)). It deals with a set of N identity declarations for sample
    Xt={X1,…,XN}. (5) To express the joint probability of N identity declarations
    (Pr(X1,…, XN)), several aggregation operators can be used (AND, OR, MAX, MIN,
    etc.). Following previous studies [18], [19], we have adopted the intersection
    operator AND. (6) The joint probability can be broken down into conditional probabilities,
    as shown in the following equation: (7) However, if the sensor independence hypothesis
    is assumed, the joint probability is the simple product of the individual probabilities,
    as shown in the following equation: (8) The independence hypothesis between sensors
    measuring similar characteristics of the same samples is difficult to ascertain.
    Nevertheless, Eq. (8) will be used to design a simplified Bayesian model, based
    on the independence assumption. If this model is not efficient enough, a more
    complex model could be built, taking into account conditional probabilities (Eq.
    (7)). Following Eq. (8) which states the sensor independence, Eq. (6) becomes
    the Bayesian minimum error fusion rule: (9) 3.2. Bayesian minimum risk fusion
    rule 3.2.1. Bayesian minimum risk rule The assignment rule based on Bayesian minimum
    risk does not attempt to minimize the classification error but the consequence
    of this error, i.e. the risk induced by the error. For instance, if you classify
    mushrooms in toxic/non-toxic classes, the risk is very high when a toxic mushroom
    is assigned to the nontoxic class. The more serious the consequence of affecting
    a sample belonging to class k, to class h, the higher the risk value C(k,h). The
    risk function is defined as follows: (10) The Bayesian minimum risk rule consists
    of minimizing the error risk average on the g classes: (11) When applying Bayes''
    Theorem (Eq. (2)), Eq. (11) leads to the Bayesian minimum risk classification
    rule involving prior probabilities, able to be applied: (12) where Pr(x∣k) is
    obtained with the confusion matrix and ph is determined by the structure of the
    population. 3.2.2. Bayesian minimum risk fusion rule In the same way as before,
    Eq. (12) can be generalized to N sensor measurements. If the same intersection
    operator is used to combine the conditional probabilities, Eq. (12) becomes: (13)
    The error risk C(k,h) is the same whatever the sensor used. Assuming the sensor
    independence, Eq. (8) stands and then Eq. (13) is changed into Eq. (14), i.e.
    the Bayesian minimum risk fusion rule: (14) 3.3. Application example 3.3.1. Conditional
    probability assessment To apply the Bayesian rules, the class probabilities pk
    and the likelihood values Pr(h∣k) must be assessed. Pr(h∣k) is based on the error
    frequency supplied by the individual sensor classification results. These results
    are gathered in a “confusion matrix”, in which each element (h,k) is the number
    of samples belonging to the class k and assigned to the class h for each of the
    three sensors (aroma sensors, FT-IR and UV spectrometers); these confusion matrices
    are given in Ref. [11]. All the likelihood values are computed by dividing the
    value of (h,k) by the class size. They are all assembled in a “Causality Matrix”
    Mi={Pr(Xi∣k)}; an example is shown in Table 1. The causality matrices computed
    for the three sensors are given in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4 based on the results
    of Ref. [11]. Table 1. Causality matrix Mi, for the sensor i Empty Cell Real classes

    the Bayesian minimum risk fusion rule (Eq. (14)) requires the definition of classification
    error risks C(k,h). These risks, also called costs, are determined using the expert
    knowledge about the problem being considered. The main goal of this classification
    is to distinguish the “Sauvignon” variety from all the others, since it is the
    most appetizing and expensive of all the grape varieties tested. Thus, the most
    important point is to avoid mistaking grapes from all other varieties ( ) with
    that of the “Sauvignon” (Sa); therefore, the risk is very high =100 in Eq. (14).
    But it is also important to recognize the “Sauvignon” samples (cost effectiveness),
    i.e. it is risky to misclassify them: =10. It is less important to misclassify
    varieties that are not “Sauvignon”: C(h/k)=1/. All the error risks are detailed
    in Eq. (15) and can be compiled in a risk matrix C for further mathematical computations
    (cf. Table 5). (15) Table 5. The risk matrix C Empty Cell Real classes Predicted

    results provided by the FT-IR and UV spectrometers, which are the discriminations
    based on the spectra pre-processed by genetic algorithms (cf. Fig. 1). Second,
    the aroma sensor classification is combined with them, whereby three-sensor fusion
    is obtained. All the individual classification results as well as the sensor fusion
    results are gathered in Fig. 1. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. White

    minimum risk fusion rule. 4.1. Spectral fusion based on Bayesian minimum error
    rule The Bayesian minimum error fusion rule (Eq. (9)), when applied to the FT-IR
    and UV identity declarations, produces different decisions displayed in the “decision
    matrix” (Table 6). When there is a conflict between their decision, the FT-IR
    judgement is given more weight (10 white boxes) than the UV one (1 gray box).
    This is due to the difference between the individual classification performances:
    the error rate of variety discrimination using FT-IR data is 9.6%, whereas it
    is as high as 22.9% with UV data (cf. Fig. 1). Thus, confidence in the FT-IR decision
    is higher. Table 6. Decision matrix computed by the Bayesian minimum error fusion
    based on FT-IR and UV spectra The empty box (∅) corresponds to a case that never
    happens in this prediction procedure. aAttribution that is altered by the introduction
    of error risks. This Bayesian minimum error fusion obviously improves the grape
    classification, achieving a 6.5% error rate, with seven misclassified samples
    among 107 (cf. Table 7). Table 7. Confusion matrix of the FT-IR and UV spectra
    fusion based on Bayesian minimum error rule 4.2. Spectral fusion based on Bayesian
    minimum risk rule Even though sensor fusion leads to a significant improvement
    compared to individual classification error rates, there remains one “Sauvignon”
    sample misclassification and three “Other varieties” samples which are affected
    to the “Sauvignon” class. The involvement of classification error costs in the
    Bayesian minimum risk fusion rule (Eq. (14)) should rule out this type of error,
    which induces severe consequences (and thus high error costs, cf. Eq. (15)). In
    fact, the introduction of risks in the decision rule alters only one assignment:
    when the FT-IR measurement assigns the sample to the “Sauvignon” class and the
    UV indicates that it belongs to the “Other varieties” class, then the decision
    based on the sensor fusion agrees now with the UV spectra (* in Table 6). The
    misclassification of non-“Sauvignon” samples to the “Sauvignon” class is therefore
    diminished. Table 8 shows the difference induced by this decision change in the
    grape classification: the global error rate is the same, but no “Other varieties”
    sample is attributed to the “Sauvignon” class (gray box); on the contrary, three
    “Sauvignon” samples are not recognized any longer (black box). Table 8. Confusion
    matrix of the FT-IR and UV spectra fusion based on Bayesian minimum risk rule
    In conclusion, in the classifications established by the two Bayesian rules, six
    samples appear to be ambiguous (black boxes in Table 7, Table 8). In reality,
    three samples belong to the “Sauvignon” class and the three others to the “Other
    varieties” class; they are all assigned to the “Sauvignon” class by the FT-IR
    sensor and to the “Other varieties” class by the UV one. Thus, the present Bayesian
    rules will inevitably misclassify three samples (whatever the sensor fusion decision).
    4.3. Spectral and aroma sensor fusion based on Bayesian minimum error Although
    insufficient for grape variety classification, aroma sensors might improve the
    high-level fusion decision based on FT-IR and UV sensors. Introducing aroma sensor
    identity declaration in the final decision alters only two decision cases which
    concern the fusion carried out on the spectral data alone (Table 9). These two
    changes slightly improve the classification error rate, which falls to 4.7%, thanks
    to two additional samples correctly classified. Table 9. Confusion matrix of the
    aroma sensor, FT-IR and UV data fusion based on Bayesian minimum error rule All
    the “Sauvignon” and “Mauzac” samples are now accurately identified. However, three
    samples belonging to “Other varieties” are still affected to the “Sauvignon” class,
    as in the case where only the spectrometer results and the Bayesian minimum error
    rule were combined (Section 4.2). This problem should be overcome when the minimum
    risk rule is applied. 4.4. Spectral and aroma sensor fusion based on Bayesian
    minimum risk The aroma sensor introduction in the Bayesian minimum risk classification
    leads to a 5.6% error rate (cf. Table 10). Table 10. Confusion matrix of the aroma
    sensor, FT-IR and UV data fusion based on Bayesian minimum risk rule The introduction
    of classification error costs alters some sample attributions with respect to
    the Bayesian minimum error decision. No sample is misclassified in the “Sauvignon”
    variety, thanks to the high cost associated with this kind of mistake, whereas
    four “Sauvignon” samples are affected to the “Other varieties” class. 5. Discussion
    and conclusion High-level multi-sensor fusion significantly improves the white
    grape must variety classification with regards to individual discriminations.
    The error rate falls to 4.7% or 5.6%, respectively, for the Bayesian minimum error
    fusion or the Bayesian minimum risk fusion. Although olfaction does not seem to
    be the best way to discriminate grape varieties—and therefore the “Sauvignon”
    flavour—the adjunction of the aroma sensor identity declaration slightly improves
    FT-IR and UV spectral classification efficiency. Thus, unlike with low-level fusion,
    the combination of data coming from rather inefficient sensors (in this case,
    aroma sensors) does not worsen the overall performance (cf. Fig. 1). The aroma
    sensor even improves (although only slightly) fusion results, whereas the addition
    of its signals in low-level fusion completely disabled the discrimination outputs.
    Accordingly, this high-level fusion procedure is very well suited to combining
    the outputs of all sensors, even those with very divergent performance levels,
    since the probability assessment reflects the confidence attached to each sensor
    (the more accurate the sensor, the more the fusion process relies on its classification
    results). High-level fusion is definitively better suited to white grape variety
    classification than the low-level one; this assumption can be generalized to most
    of the discrimination problems based on analytical methods or sensors providing
    numerous noisy and redundant data as well as dissimilar efficiency levels. In
    this pattern recognition application, the unbalanced class size might have enhanced
    the problems linked to noise and redundancy. Furthermore, the high-level fusion
    process can be applied to all kinds of analytical measurements capable of providing
    identity declarations. Moreover, the introduction of expert knowledge using classification
    error costs is an original and important step forward, which combines experimental
    and expert information. The Bayesian minimum risk rule makes the discrimination
    more specific, by allowing some kinds of errors and forbidding others. This risk
    assessment is based on expert knowledge. This would be particularly suited for
    an authentication process using different analytical techniques. For instance,
    when dealing with white grape variety classification, “Sauvignon” was the most
    important variety; thus, the first- and second-order errors in “Sauvignon” variety
    discrimination had to be avoided. The risk values must be carefully adjusted,
    since a too high-risk value can lead to systematically avoiding assigning grapes
    to the “Sauvignon” class. During the Bayesian inference development, the sensor
    independence hypothesis has been assumed in order to simplify the joint probability
    computation of the different sensor measurements. Data correlation analysis showed
    that small wavelength bands of UV and FT-IR spectra are redundant. However, since
    the classification results based on this “simplified” model are very satisfying
    (4.7% error rate), only slight improvements could be expected from a more complex
    model. In a further study, Bayesian inference application to fusion processes
    might be somewhat improved in three ways: 1. in taking into account the conditional
    probability values with regards to all the sensors involved in the fusion to express
    the joint probability; 2. in adjusting more accurately the decision to each sample.
    The current sensor–fusion decisions were established in a global and Boolean way
    by using the whole database with a 0:1 classification, once and for all the samples.
    However, every sample is assigned to a class by each sensor with a decimal number
    prediction (not a 0:1, but for e.g. 0.2 or 0.8). Consequently, it would make good
    sense to allow for the sensor classification confidence for each sample, that
    is the membership level to every class instead of a simple Boolean assignment;
    3. in selecting the best suited aggregation operator used to combine the likelihood
    values of the different sensors , with regards to the classification problem.
    These different generalization procedures of the current Bayesian fusion rules
    can help in improving the classification results in very complex discrimination
    issues. Acknowledgements This work received financial support from Association

    In most data fusion systems, the information extracted from each sensor (either
    numerical or symbolic) is represented as a degree of belief in an event with real
    values, taking in this way into account the imprecise, uncertain, and incomplete
    nature of the information. The combination of such degrees of belief is performed
    through numerical fusion operators. A very large variety of such operators has
    been proposed in the literature. We propose in this paper a classification of
    these operators issued from the different data fusion theories with respect to
    their behavior. Three classes are thus defined. This classification provides a
    guide for choosing an operator in a given problem. This choice can then be refined
    from the desired properties of the operators, from their decisiveness, and by
    examining how they deal with conflictive situations. Published in: IEEE Transactions

    Abstract: Wireless sensor networks are being increasingly used in several application
    areas,

    particularly to collect data and monitor physical processes. Non-functional requirements,
    like

    reliability, security or availability, are often important and must be accounted
    for in the application

    development. For that purpose, there is a large body of knowledge on dependability
    techniques for

    distributed systems, which provide a good basis to understand how to satisfy these
    non-functional

    requirements of WSN-based monitoring applications. Given the data-centric nature
    of monitoring

    applications, it is of particular importance to ensure that data are reliable
    or, more generically,

    that they have the necessary quality. In this survey, we look into the problem
    of ensuring the

    desired quality of data for dependable monitoring using WSNs. We take a dependability-oriented

    perspective, reviewing the possible impairments to dependability and the prominent
    existing

    solutions to solve or mitigate these impairments. Despite the variety of components
    that may form a

    WSN-based monitoring system, we give particular attention to understanding which
    faults can affect

    sensors, how they can affect the quality of the information and how this quality
    can be improved

    and quantiﬁed.

    1. Introduction

    In order to increase the dependability of monitoring applications in wireless
    sensor network (WSN)

    settings, one must be aware that the quality of monitoring data can be affected
    by faults. In essence,

    there is a problem of data quality assurance, which can be faced taking two main
    perspectives: either

    by deploying dependability techniques to mask faults and enforce the reliability
    of the system or

    by enhancing the system with means to continuously assess and characterize the
    quality of data [1].

    In the former case, the system will not be aware of the quality of data, and hence,
    if a certain quality

    is needed, it must be enforced by design, conﬁning the effects of faults a priori.
    Considering sensors

    to be the main source of data, errors in sensing measurements are handled by procedures
    that are

    established based on a deep understanding of the characteristics of the sensors
    [2]. Missing readings

    may be handled by oversampling, and glitches, like outliers and noise, can be
    masked by averaging.

    In the latter case, given that the system can be aware of the quality of data
    at run-time, it is better

    suited to be used in environments where full knowledge of the operational conditions
    is not known

    in advance. In this case, mitigation techniques must be deployed to handle faults
    and data quality

    problems at run-time, for instance exploiting application semantics to determine
    appropriate data

    corrections and to regain the needed data quality. Given that no system can be
    built to exhibit 100%

    reliability, the two perspectives can be combined. In this paper, we take the
    latter perspective and

    consider that the quality of sensor data can be assessed, providing an indication
    of the overall system

    health, encompassing sensors, the wireless network and the processing tasks.

    Assuring the quality of sensor data for a dependable operation is particularly
    challenging in

    some WSN-based monitoring applications. In fact, it is often the case that the
    sensors and the

    WSN are deployed in harsh environments and exposed to extreme physical conditions,
    thus being

    more likely affected by faults. The problem becomes critical when dependability
    is an important

    application requirement. For instance, in water-related information systems, inaccurate
    information in

    aquatic monitoring may lead to false warnings being issued or harmful situations
    not being detected

    early enough (e.g., ﬂoods or pollution events). As another example, WSNs are deployed
    in data

    centers for ﬂexible temperature monitoring and energy-efﬁcient control of air-cooling
    equipment [3,4].

    Therefore, ensuring the accuracy of collected data is also necessary for effectiveness
    reasons. In these

    examples, the operational conditions are typically hard to accurately predict,
    ensuring that the

    reliability of operations is often hard or costly, and the consequences of inaccurate
    sensor data collection

    can be severe.

    In this survey, we characterize and systematize existing solutions to dependable
    monitoring in

    WSNs by approaching them in two steps. In the ﬁrst step, we look at the root cause
    of dependability

    problems concerning the quality of sensor data, that is we identify and analyze
    several kinds of faults

    that may affect the system operation, in particular at the sensor and network
    levels, describing

    the speciﬁc effect on the sensor data and the relevant failure modes [5] that
    allow abstracting

    particular kinds of faults. When appropriate, we also refer to particular mitigation
    solutions to

    automatically adjust the sensors measurements according to each disturbance. Then,
    we provide a

    comprehensive overview of the solutions to achieve improved sensor data quality
    and dependable

    operation of WSN-based monitoring applications. In addition to detection and correction
    strategies,

    fault-tolerance strategies based on sensor data fusion procedures, exploiting
    the availability of

    redundant measurements or available modeling surrogates, are surveyed. However,
    there is a focus on

    works and solutions related to monitoring in aquatic environments, noting that
    these solutions are also

    applicable in many other contexts, but that the opposite might not be true, in
    particular concerning

    solutions that are not agnostic to the semantics of the monitored data.

    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 exposes a set of
    fundamental ideas

    related to the issue of data quality in WSNs, motivating the need for dependability,
    introducing the

    baseline architecture for a WSN-based monitoring system and referring to the main
    dependability

    strategies that may be employed. Section 3 describes the notion of data quality
    and the main aspects

    that may affect this quality during monitoring. Section 4 presents an overview
    of solutions for

    dependable sensor networks. We will conclude in Section 5, with a discussion of
    the possible results of

    the solutions mentioned herein.

    2. Overview of Key Issues

    2.1. Motivation

    Complex and powerful forecast systems are now able to predict environmental variables
    such as

    storm events with small errors, but they depend on a continuous ﬂow of conﬁrmation
    with real-time

    data for robustness. Real-time monitoring data, such as surface water elevation,
    ﬂow or water quality

    variables depend solely on the sensor hardware deployed in the physical environment
    (oceans, river,

    lakes, etc.) and its proper maintenance.

    The effectiveness of existing emergency warning and forecast procedures for natural
    and

    man-made hazardous events may be limited by several factors, including an often
    sparse and unreliable

    real-time observational network, the use of coarse-resolution prediction models
    and the reliance on

    traditional approaches to convey warning and forecast information.

    In spite of the vast research on the dependability of distributed systems, in
    particular on

    computational architectures/frameworks for reliable and timely operations, monitoring
    systems

    pose new challenges to dependability. The sensory and sensor network technologies,
    which are now

    becoming widely available, are subject to diverse hazards and are not sufﬁciently
    reliable and robust

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    3 of 23

    against harsh exogenous and/or environmental factors. In this ﬁeld, there is still
    a lack of architectural,

    fault-tolerant and system management solutions, which are essential for dependable,
    robust remote

    monitoring, necessary for adequate water management.

    Ensuring the quality of monitoring data is fundamental to avoid false alarms or
    ignoring relevant

    data. However, because these sensors are located in the physical environment,
    they are constantly

    being subjected to factors that directly interfere with the data quality, such
    as potentially strong

    currents, debris accumulation and tough weather conditions. Consequently, there
    is a trust issue

    related to the collected data, which demands an extensive human intervention in
    terms of time and

    knowledge specialization, data validation tasks and periodic maintenance of sensors.
    To deal with this

    problem, it is necessary to continuously and automatically characterize the quality
    of collected data.

    Hence, the application of techniques based in the existence of redundancy at the
    data collection and

    data processing levels is a promising approach.

    2.2. Monitoring and Data Processing

    The process of environment monitoring requires sensor devices to be deployed within
    the system.

    These sensors will be the entities responsible for measuring the parameters of
    interest, like temperature,

    water level or salinity. A sensor essentially converts a physical quantity in
    its input to an electrical

    signal, produced as the output, which is usually proportional to the input. Further
    to the sensor itself,

    additional components are needed to perform signal processing functions, store
    measured values

    and communicate these values to other systems. It is hence usual to refer to these
    more complex

    components as smart sensors or intelligent sensors [6], typically interconnected
    to other smart sensors

    to form wireless sensor networks.

    For monitoring and control purposes, wireless sensor networks have become a subject
    of interest

    in recent years, mostly due to enormous advances in sensing and communication
    technology, which

    has fostered the use of smart sensors, with applications in many ﬁelds: (a) military
    applications;

    (b) environmental monitoring; (c) commerce; (d) human-centric applications; and
    (e) applications to

    robotics (Arampatzis et al. [7]). WSNs are formed by smart sensor nodes, and each
    sensor node may

    have several individual sensors, in which case they are said to be clustered.
    Information collected by

    sensor nodes is typically transmitted to a sink or controller node.

    After the sensors measurement step, performed usually through a WSN, there is
    another layer

    in the overall system that comprises the gathering and analysis of the measurements,
    including

    information fusion (Section 4). This phase is commonly referred to as data processing
    (see Figure 1).

    Our goal is to describe and enumerate the processes involved in each layer of
    the scheme in

    Figure 1. In a bottom-up perspective, the ﬁrst layer is the physical environment
    (it can also be deﬁned

    as the object or the event to be monitored), which can have a great inﬂuence on
    the measurements.

    Although there are many speciﬁc external factors related to perturbation events
    or objects in all of the

    different applications of WSNs, we decided to tackle the problems of the involved
    water body by ﬁrst

    enumerating well-known limitations of sensor devices in Section 3.2.

    On the second layer, we are considering that in terms of faults and validity issues,
    monitoring

    has two abstraction levels: the sensors and communication between them. Each level
    has a particular

    fault model, with faults arising from different sources (see Figure 2). We will
    explore these subjects in

    Sections 3.2 and 3.3 with the respective mitigation solutions.

    Finally, in order to centrally analyze all of the sensing information, a third
    layer appears in the

    system. In the data processing layer, it is possible to infer the quality of the
    gathered information,

    through fusion processes of redundant and related measurements, by multi-sensor
    fusion methods,

    or by expert-knowledge of the system model. In fact, this is where we can ultimately
    handle both

    sensor and network-level problems and apply the mitigation techniques identiﬁed
    already in Figure 2.

    These techniques will be addressed in Section 4.

    2.3. Dependability Strategies

    When designing a fault-tolerant and dependable system, the typical means to deal
    with system

    errors and faults include error detection and error or fault recovery. In this
    context, endowing the

    system with redundant components can be instrumental to compensate existing errors
    or faults

    affecting some component.

    The affected component can be replaced in its tasks by the spare,

    redundancy component, which will ensure that the system function will continue
    to be provided.

    However, redundancy does not refer solely to having multiple similar components,
    which is a form of

    space redundancy. It is also possible to implement forms of redundancy in the
    time (e.g., repeating

    some action multiple times) and in the value domains (e.g., adding extra information)
    [8].

    Some examples of space redundancy include storing information in several disks,
    machines

    or data centers, having multiple nodes performing the same computation (either
    in parallel, called

    active replication, or with some nodes in stand-by mode, called passive replication),
    or sending a

    network message through multiple network paths. Time redundancy is typically explored
    in reliable

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    5 of 23

    communication systems that retransmit messages when they suspect that these messages
    might have

    been lost in previous transmissions. Restarting an aborted transaction or a deadlocked
    computation

    are also examples of time redundancy. Finally, value redundancy is observed in
    data storage and

    communication systems that use error correcting codes associated with the stored
    or transmitted data,

    allowing the original information to be reconstructed when some bits or parts
    of the information

    become corrupted. To deal with malicious forms of information corruption, cryptographic
    signatures

    may be used.

    In the application of these concepts to sensor validation, [9] stated that there
    are two

    classical approaches that are widely used: (a) analytical redundancy and (b) hardware
    redundancy.

    Analytical redundancy uses mathematical relationships between measurements to
    predict or infer a

    sensor’s value. Two disadvantages of this approach are the possible inefﬁciency
    of the mathematical

    processes when we have a large number of sensors and the model complexity increases
    and the fact

    that the mathematical relationships can be very data speciﬁc, and a slight modiﬁcation
    may require

    signiﬁcant efforts to stabilize. Hardware redundancy is not always possible because
    of the costs

    implied by additional sensors and their installation and maintenance operations.

    The right approach to be used depends on several issues, like the assumed fault
    model, the

    criticality of the application, the cost or timeliness requirements. In some cases,
    several dependability

    techniques can be used in a single system to deal with different problems or to
    achieve the needed

    levels of assurance. This is particularly true in complex systems, like aquatic
    systems, in which

    different techniques can be applicable to mitigate faults in the sensing process
    and to handle WSN

    faults. Combinations of the solutions mentioned later in this survey (Section
    4.1) may thus be used in

    the design of a single system.

    3. Sensor Data Quality

    When the quality of sensor data is an important attribute for the dependability
    of the application,

    it becomes necessary to somehow express this quality, which can be done in various
    ways. Additionally,

    a priori knowledge about the possible causes of quality degradation, translated
    into faults and a

    corresponding fault model, is also relevant. It will enable a more accurate characterization
    of the quality

    of sensor data and the possibly of incorporating in the system some techniques
    to mitigate the effects

    of speciﬁc faults assumed in the fault model. These aspects are addressed in the
    following sections.

    3.1. Expressing Data Quality

    The interpretation and modeling of the available information into adequate theoretical

    frameworks is the main means to characterize the quality of the obtained sensor
    data. These qualitative

    interpretations of sensor data can become confusing when different authors introduce
    an array of

    terms for quality (the most generic), including:

    •

    Validity is typically employed when a determined requirement about the quality
    of data is

    available, against which it is possible to compare some quality measure and declare
    if the data

    are valid [1,10].

    •

    Conﬁdence is an attribute that may be elaborated from the continuous observation
    of sensor data,

    without the need for a quality requirement to be available. It is generally used
    when datasets are

    available and can be characterized in a probabilistic way, along with model ﬁtting
    or threshold

    deﬁnition techniques, to yield continuous or multi-level conﬁdence measures [11].

    •

    Reliability is a typical dependability attribute [12], expressing the ability
    of a system to provide

    the correct service (or the correct data, for that matter) over a period of time.
    The term data

    reliability in sensor networks is often considered when transmissions and/or communications

    may be subject to faults like omissions or a total crash [13,14].

    •

    Trustworthiness is mostly employed in connection with security concerns, namely
    when it

    is assumed that data can be altered in a malicious way. In the context of sensor
    networks,

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    6 of 23

    it characterizes the degree to which it is possible to trust that sensor data
    have not been tampered

    with and have thus the needed quality [15].

    •

    Authenticity is also used, in particular in a security context, but to express
    the degree to which it is

    possible to trust the claimed data origin [16]. This is particularly important
    when the overall quality

    of the system or application depends on the correct association of some data to
    their producer.

    This terminology does contain other terms, including other aspects of data quality
    that are

    implicit and brieﬂy approached herein, such as timeliness, precision, tunability,
    completeness, usability,

    accuracy, throughput, affordability and reusability [17]. We will also describe
    herein the diverse

    typologies of data quality and how to obtain a quality parameter, either for each
    individual sensor

    or for the global system, according to several studies. Therefore, in terms of
    applicability, we must

    differentiate single-sensor validity from multi-sensor fusion validity, when several
    sensors exist and

    sensor fusion can be applied.

    In single-sensor situations, there are models or related information that allow
    reasoning about

    an individual sensor’s data quality without requiring other sensors’ data. The
    work in [18] tried

    to identify faulty situations (see Section 3.2) such as noise and outliers in
    chlorophyll concentration

    sensors deployed in lake water, by implementing different fault detection methods:

    •

    Rule-based methods that use expert knowledge about the variables that sensors
    are measuring to

    determine thresholds or heuristics with which the sensors must comply.

    •

    Estimation methods that deﬁne a “normal” behavior by considering spatial and temporal

    correlations from sensor data. A sensor reading is matched alongside its forecasted
    value to

    assess its validity.

    •

    Learning-based methods that deﬁne models for correct and faulty sensor measurements,
    using

    collected data for building the models.

    In the example from [18], all three methods were used to assert the correctness
    (or incorrectness)

    of the collected data, thus adopting a Boolean approach to quality characterization.
    However, the

    same methods may be employed in other ways, as a means to characterize quality
    in a step-wise or

    even continuous way. For instance, and still considering a single-sensor situation,
    [11] employed fuzzy

    logic rules to obtain a qualitative sense of a sensor’s validity based on its
    own historical behavior

    represented by a conﬁdence measure.

    In a multi-sensor situation, the quality of sensor measurements is characterized
    by using

    redundant or correlated data obtained from the different sensors. This redundancy
    allows for data

    fusion methods to be deployed at the network level, resulting in improved (fused)
    sensor data, as

    well as improved data quality characterization. Various quality-oriented network
    meta-models can be

    explored according to the application requirements. For instance, in [17], the
    data quality is calculated

    through the several nodes (and the sink) on the entire WSN structure.

    Sensor data fusion methods will be detailed in Section 4. As for the quality characterization
    process

    when data fusion is performed, the applicable methodology depends on the available
    information

    concerning the quality of individual sensor measurements. In fact, this information
    can also be used in

    the data fusion process itself.

    For instance, in [11], the approach relied on a statistical method (Parzen estimation
    of the

    probability density function) to determine the variance of sensors’ data and to
    calculate the average of

    the sensors, considering just the sensors with a high-quality standard in the
    data fusion process. If all

    sensors are producing high-quality data, then the fusion will also reach the highest
    possible quality.

    Otherwise, better results will be achieved when discarding sensor data with lower
    quality, rather than

    using these data in the fusion process.

    Another example can be found in [19], where reliability estimates are calculated
    for sensor data,

    using Bayesian networks or random forests to obtain reliability coefﬁcients, and
    then, these reliability

    estimates are used in a sensor fusion process to discard sources that are considered
    unreliable if the

    reliability estimate is below a deﬁned threshold.

    Regarding the quantiﬁcation of data quality, the two main approaches consist of
    considering

    discrete quality classes or continuous quality values.

    In the discrete approach, it is possible to use binary classes, such as {valid,
    invalid} [20], or to use

    a multi-level class, like {verylow, low, high, veryhigh} [11]. These discrete
    classiﬁcations can be applied

    to each sensor (individual sensor data) or to the whole network of sensors (fused
    data).

    In the continuous approach, a conﬁdence level is usually derived, ranging in a
    well-deﬁned

    continuous interval (often [0, 1] or equivalently [0%, 100%]).

    Therefore, the validity of sensor

    information may not only have the values “true and” “false”, especially if one
    must process

    continuously-valued data [1,9]. For instance, a noisy sensor (internal or external
    noise) may deliver

    useful data within some error margin, but the quality of that data is lower than
    that from a non-noisy

    sensor. In a multi-sensor fusion application, the quality quantiﬁcation can be
    calculated using a

    cumulative association of each sensor quality coefﬁcient [21] or calculating the
    percentage of sensors

    used in the fusion against the sensors in the network.

    3.2. Sensor Level Faults

    In this subsection, we present a systematization of the main types of sensors
    and their

    characteristics, classifying the various data errors that may be produced by sensors.
    From the

    perspective of building modular dependable systems, what is interesting is to
    group the several

    possible faults and the consequent data errors into well-deﬁned sensor failure
    modes. We thus identify

    the relevant failure modes under which a sensor can fail and produce data with
    degraded quality.

    The focus herein is on the sensor level, whereas the next subsection addresses
    network level faults.

    Finally, we also focus on possible mitigation techniques to handle sensor faults.

    3.2.1. Sensor Characteristics

    We begin to dissect sensor faults by exploring the transducing processes, enumerating
    the different

    methods to convert the various physical effects into electric signals, as well
    as each one’s advantages

    and limitations. This enumeration is important to the survey, to understand the
    most basic origins of

    faults in sensors. The sensor material characteristics or the harshness of the
    environmental conditions

    lead to the production of a speciﬁc kind of fault. Some sensors strive to perceive
    an object that is

    moving in dusty environments, while others experience issues reading a correct
    level observation

    in ﬂuids. For instance, capacitive sensors present a considerable sensitivity
    and require low energy

    usage, making them an attractive choice for many areas, but as pointed out by
    [22], the response

    characteristics of these sensors are very nonlinear, and the offset capacitance
    is non-negligible and

    must be handled to correctly detect capacitance variations due to the applied
    pressure and to avoid

    errors. In summary, from a dependability perspective, it is important to distinguish
    sensors in terms of

    their operation and robustness to distinct environment conditions. When a sensor
    is highly sensitive,

    but frequently faulty, a redundancy solution must be considered, possibly using
    a sensor that offers

    the same sensitivity, but is more reliable.

    The main types of sensors according to the exploitation of displacement effects
    are

    the following [23]:

    •

    Resistance: Resistive sensors, also termed potentiometers, are based on an electromechanical

    instrument that transforms a mechanical variation, like a displacement, into an
    electrical signal

    capable of being monitored following conditioning;

    •

    Induction: Inductive sensors are primarily based on the principles of magnetic
    circuits and may

    be categorized as self-generating or passive;

    •

    Capacitance: Capacitive sensors depend on variations in capacitance in reply to
    physical changes.

    A capacitive level pointer uses the changes in the comparative permittivity among
    the plates;

    •

    Piezoelectricity: Piezoelectricity is the term used to determine the capacity
    of speciﬁc materials to

    create an electric charge that is relative to a directly applied mechanical pressure;

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    8 of 23

    •

    Laser: Laser sensors compare changes in optical path length and in the wavelength
    of light, which

    can be determined with very little uncertainty. Laser sensors achieve a high precision
    in the

    length and displacement measurements, where the precision achieved by mechanical
    means is

    not enough;

    •

    Ultrasonic: Uses the time-of-ﬂight method as the standard for the use of ultrasound
    for monitoring

    purposes. A pulse of ultrasound is transmitted in a medium, reﬂecting when it
    reaches another

    medium, and the time from emission to recognition of the reﬂected pulsation is
    read;

    •

    Optical: Optical sensors encompass a variety of parts that use light as the means
    to convert

    kinetics into electrical signals, comprised mostly of two components: a main diffraction
    grating,

    representing the measurement standard (scale); and a detection system. What is
    detected is the

    position of one regarding the other;

    •

    Magnetic: A magnetic sensor is either triggered to function by a magnetic ﬁeld
    or the use of the

    ﬁeld that deﬁnes the properties of the sensor;

    In Table 1, a summary of the relative advantages and disadvantages of each of
    the described

    displacement effects is presented. The goal here is not to choose the best type
    of sensor, but to

    discriminate the strong and weak points of all of the types.

    Table 1. Advantages and disadvantages of the various displacement effects [23–25].

    vary with temperature).

    loud noise; slow measurements in

    proximity sensors; changes in the

    environment affect the response; targets

    with low density may absorb sound energy;

    minimum sensing distance required.

    Optical encoding

    Inherently digital (which makes the

    interface easy for control systems); fast

    measurements; long durability.

    Fairly complex; delicate parts; low

    tolerance to mechanical abuse; low

    tolerance to high temperatures.

    Magnetic

    Non-contacting; high durability; high

    sensitivity; small size; output is highly

    linear.

    Very sensitive to fabrication tolerances;

    calibration needed after installation.

    Beyond the limitations of the transducers, [26] explained other causes of measurement
    uncertainty

    and how only an estimation of the observed physical property can be given. When
    considering

    individual sensor measurements, the possible types of errors observed in measurement
    values can be

    classiﬁed as follows:

    •

    Random errors are described by an absence of repeatability in the readings of
    the sensor, for

    instance due to measurement noise. These errors tend to happen on a permanent
    basis, but have a

    stochastic nature;

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    9 of 23

    •

    Systematic errors are described through consistency and repeatability in the temporal
    domain.

    There are three types of systematic errors at the sensor level:

    –

    Calibration errors result from errors in the calibration procedure, often in relation
    to

    linearization procedures;

    –

    Loading errors emerge when the intrusive nature of the sensor modiﬁes the measurand.

    Along with calibration errors, loading errors are caused by internal processes;

    –

    Environmental errors emerge when the sensor experiences the surrounding environment

    and these inﬂuences are not considered. In contrast with the previous two types
    of errors,

    environmental errors are due to external factors;

    •

    Spurious readings are non-systematic reading errors. They occur when some spurious
    physical

    occurrence leads to a measurement value that does not reﬂect the intended reality.
    For instance, a

    light intensity measurement in a room can provide the wrong value if obtained
    precisely when a

    picture of the room is taken and the camera ﬂash is triggered.

    3.2.2. Sensor Failure Modes

    The classiﬁcation presented above builds essentially on the persistence and nature
    of the

    observable value errors. An alternative way to acknowledge and to deal with the
    fact that sensor

    measurements are affected by uncertainties, which is commonly used when building
    modular

    distributed systems, is to identify relevant sensor failure modes. Independently
    of the several factors

    leading to a sensor fault and the consequent measurement error(s), the faulty
    behavior of the sensor

    component is observed through its interface, that is, through the values it produces.
    Therefore, a

    failure mode characterizes a certain deviating behavior, abstracting its causes
    and considering only the

    measurement values produced at the sensor interface.

    The main sensor failures modes, depicted in Figure 3, are the following [1]:

    1.

    Constant or offset failure mode: The observations continuously deviate from the
    expected value

    by a constant offset.

    2.

    Continuous varying or drifting failure mode: The deviation between the observations
    and the

    expected value is continuously changing according to some continuous time-dependent
    function

    (linear or non-linear).

    3.

    Crash or jammed failure mode: The sensor stops providing any readings on its interface
    or gets

    jammed and stuck in some incorrect value.

    4.

    Trimming failure mode: The observations are correct for values within some interval,
    but are

    modiﬁed for values outside that interval. Beyond the interval, the observation
    can be trimmed at

    the interval boundary or may vary proportionally with the expected value.

    5.

    Outliers failure mode: The observations occasionally deviate from the expected
    value, at random

    points in the time domain;

    6.

    Noise failure mode: The observations deviate from the expected value stochastically
    in the value

    domain and permanently in the temporal domain.

    a ﬁlled line, whereas the

    real values are depicted with a dashed line.

    Comparing this classiﬁcation of sensor failure modes with the classiﬁcation of
    sensor errors

    previously introduced, it is interesting to note the direct correspondence between
    the class of random

    errors and the noise failure mode and between the class of spurious errors and
    the outliers failure

    mode. The remaining four failure modes can be seen as specializations of the systematic
    errors class.

    3.2.3. Mitigation Techniques

    Regarding mitigation techniques to address faults and respective value errors,
    we make a

    separation between what can be done at the sensor level and what can be done at
    the distributed

    system level, namely within the application that uses the sensor data, possibly
    exploiting additional

    sources of information. Considering an individual sensor, it is possible to use
    dependability techniques

    to prevent or tolerate the occurrence of faults and achieve an improved behavior,
    possibly even

    removing some failure modes. This can be described as a “basic quality improvement”,
    and in

    what follows, we describe two basic techniques that are usually carried out to
    achieve this objective:

    calibration and measurand reconstruction. The general approaches for improving
    the quality of data

    in WSN monitoring applications are then covered in Section 4.

    Commonly, calibration is deﬁned as a test under speciﬁc conditions in which pre-determined

    known values of the measurand are given to the transducer and the corresponding
    outputs are

    recorded. In a formal way, calibration consists of deﬁning a function f (r, β)
    that, along with a set of

    selected device parameters β ∈ R, will translate real sensor output r to the intended
    output r*.

    Calibration actions are required every time a sensor is deployed in a different
    environment, as

    the physical measurement elements must be adjusted or even dedicated to the monitored
    device or

    process, providing at the start a reduction of measuring uncertainty and minimal
    interference with

    sensor functions. However, periodic calibrations are also needed, since during
    the operation, we can

    assist the change of conditions with respect to those known during the calibration
    process and to

    the impact of various external factors that could be absent in the laboratory
    calibration conditions.

    These factors can be the base cause of many errors and should hence be continuously
    re-evaluated.

    For instance, in aquatic sensors, offset and drifting errors are related to the
    accuracy range becoming

    unbalanced, which is solvable by recalibration. This is done off-ﬁeld (removing
    the sensor of the

    monitoring environment and recalibrating it in a container with water in controlled
    conditions), with

    potential data loss if no redundant way of collecting sensor data is available,
    and with re-deployment

    costs. It can also be done in the ﬁeld, which is a time-consuming task with sometimes
    difﬁcult

    conditions and, especially, exposing the calibration process to environmental
    factors that may affect the

    calibration accuracy.

    As alternatives to manual calibration, two generic options can be considered:
    factory sensor

    calibration, with the advantage of reducing the time consumption efforts of the
    initial manual process,

    but not completely eliminating the problems mentioned before; and auto or self-calibration,
    enabling

    sensors to monitor themselves and recalibrate using a reference. This latter option,
    which, being

    adaptive, is potentially better for dealing with varied and even unpredicted misbehavior,
    is designated

    as measurand reconstruction or sensor compensation.

    Auto-calibration refers to methods aimed at diminishing the effect of the disturbing
    parameters in

    the input/output features of sensors. Preferably, the transduced value must have
    a direct relation with

    the measurand, which should not be sensible to past information, interfering environmental
    factors,

    noise, error gain, etc. To try to compensate all of these disturbances, numerical
    techniques have to be

    used. These techniques are applied after the transformed signal has been quantiﬁed,
    through digital

    signal processing that must transform the sensor output signal (r*) into a corrected
    value ( ˆr*).

    Several auto-calibration techniques have been used with relative success, for
    instance exploiting

    statistical regression based on a priori knowledge [27] or artiﬁcial neural networks
    [28,29]. In the

    statistical regression approach, the goal is to determine the polynomial approximation
    to the

    characteristics of the sensor. In the artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) approach,
    the inputs are the

    measurements, and the ideal outputs are the measurand. This model inversion is
    the reason why it is

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    11 of 23

    called measurand reconstruction. Other machine-learning algorithms have also been
    applied, such

    as Kalman ﬁlters [30] and support vector machines [31], especially in order to
    overcome the ANN

    disadvantages: neural network training may not converge to the global optimum,
    and training may

    need to be repeated several times, which will be prejudicial with respect to the
    computational cost; and

    the poor generalization capabilities that may arise from insufﬁcient data, from
    over- or under-training

    or from under- or over-ﬁtting.

    3.3. Communication Faults in WSNs

    When connecting individual sensor nodes in a wireless sensor network, additional
    faults affecting

    sensor data can be introduced by the network. In this subsection, we focus on
    the main kinds of

    network faults that may affect the quality of sensor data in order to achieve
    a reliable network operation,

    speciﬁcally considering faults in the time domain and faults in the value domain.

    In the time domain, a crash, omission or delay faults could occur. Crash faults
    (for instance of the

    radio subsystem in a sensor node) lead to data absence and can only be mitigated
    with redundancy (e.g.,

    a dual-radio system). Omissions correspond to missing sensor readings due to lost
    messages. They can

    be prevented by enforcing communication reliability, for instance based on message
    retransmission.

    However, reliable communication protocols are not very common in WSNs due to the
    additional

    resources (namely energy) they require. Therefore, omissions do happen in sensor
    networks and for

    the most part emerge because of sensor failures and packet losses. Heavy packet
    loss and asymmetric

    links occur frequently in WSNs [32,33], for instance due to signal strength fading
    and intermittent or

    continuous environmental interference (e.g., wind or rain). Absent values inﬂuence
    the outcome of

    any query over sensor readings. The resulting inaccuracies can be critical as
    in in-network processing

    and aggregations [33–35]. Several solutions have been suggested to tolerate these
    types of errors such

    as masking lost values through redundant information or estimating using past
    values [34]. Although

    this problem has been studied and solved in many applications, one must be aware
    that it is impossible

    to fully avoid omissions. Finally, delay faults are only relevant when the correctness
    of the application

    depends on the timeliness of sensor data. This is typically the case in real-time
    control, where the

    temporal validity of sensor data is bounded [36]. Sensor data become useless after
    a certain amount of

    time due to not reﬂecting the present reality with sufﬁcient accuracy, possibly
    leading to system failures

    if used in the control process. Existing solutions to avoid timing failures are
    based on techniques from

    the real-time area, namely seizing the needed resources and using synchronized
    clocks to timestamp

    data and discard the outdated data. The existence of redundant sensor nodes can
    also be explored, to

    avoid missing important events.

    In the value domain, a communication fault is translated into a message corruption.

    However, communication protocols typically incorporate data integrity veriﬁcation
    mechanisms

    that allow the detection of corrupted messages, discarding those messages and
    hence transforming

    value faults into omission faults. Therefore, the only chance that received data
    do not correspond to

    what has been sent is when some part of the communication stack in the sending
    or receiving node

    (or both) is affected by an accidental fault not covered by the integrity veriﬁcation
    mechanisms or

    when it has been intentionally corrupted. In fact, WSNs and sensor nodes can be
    subject to attacks

    that may signiﬁcantly affect the quality of sensor data, among other consequences
    for the application.

    Therefore, in critical applications, it is important to deploy security techniques
    to avoid attacks or to

    mitigate their effects. These security techniques are, however, outside the scope
    of this survey.

    4. Solutions for Dependable Data Quality

    Several methods have been proposed in the literature to improve the quality of
    sensor data.

    Our focus is on solutions to mitigate the negative effects of faults on data quality.
    The ones that are

    applicable at the sensor level to mitigate data errors at the sensor interface
    have already been addressed

    in Section 3.2. In this section, we discuss what can be done at sink or processing
    nodes. We start

    by identifying and characterizing the three different forms of redundancy that
    may be explored for

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    12 of 23

    dependable data quality. They are related to the available sources of information,
    to which data

    analysis and processing techniques can be applied: (a) single sensor data stream,
    (b) multi-sensor data

    streams or (c) multi-source data streams.

    Then,

    and given our focus on dependability aspects,

    we present a taxonomy for

    dependability-oriented data quality in WSNs. We identify the relevant dimensions
    to reason about

    dependable data quality, classifying the options within each of these dimensions.
    In this exercise,

    we introduce dependability-related categories concurring with the goal of estimating
    the quality of

    sensor data. In most cases, WSN-based monitoring systems address concerns (sometimes
    implicitly) of

    improving the quality of data, but not of estimating the achieved quality. The
    resulting systematization

    underlies the survey on concrete techniques for data processing, further ahead
    in the section.

    4.1. Exploiting Redundancy

    Redundancy is a fundamental dependability technique to achieve reliability, availability
    and even

    improved performance. Therefore, WSN applications naturally exploit the existence
    of multiple sensor

    nodes and the spatial redundancy they offer. In fact, if information relative
    to a certain environmental

    process is collected through several sensors, then it is possible to apply a range
    of data processing

    techniques to fuse the multiple data streams (from the different sensor nodes).
    This approach permits

    obtaining the resulting data with more quality, masking possible faults affecting
    data provided by

    some of the nodes. In sensor networks, it is also possible to exploit value redundancy
    [8] for improving

    the quality of data. This redundancy is offered, for instance, by environmental
    models describing the

    monitored dynamic process or setting limits to the static or dynamic attributes
    of this process. Finally,

    if sensor data from multiple sensor nodes cannot be correlated, then it is still
    possible to exploit a form

    of temporal redundancy. This temporal redundancy is intrinsic to continuous transmission,
    in a single

    ﬂow, of data samples that can be correlated over time.

    4.1.1. Spatial Redundancy

    The techniques aimed at exploiting spatial redundancy in WSN-based applications
    are known as

    sensor fusion techniques. Sensor fusion deals with sensor data from sensors in
    the same monitoring

    area. Through processes of comparison, combination and/or smart voting schemes,
    it may be

    possible to detect faulty behaviors, erroneous information and derive a corrected
    observation from the

    remaining (considered correct) data samples [37–39].

    Sensor fusion is realized by employing a collection of techniques, such as classical
    Bayesian,

    Dempster–Shafer inference, artiﬁcial neural networks and fuzzy logic. The less
    mature techniques

    are dominated by heuristic and ad hoc methods. The major algorithm categories
    and techniques are

    discussed in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2.

    Sensor fusion is very useful in several situations, in particular in the following:
    (a) when some

    sensors measure correctly the intended phenomena, but others do not, due to failures;
    (b) when all

    sensors measure correctly, but some respond to a different phenomenology; (c)
    when the data of a

    sensor may be masked or counter measured with respect to one sensor, but not to
    another; (d) when

    one sensor may be blocked or unable to measure, but another sensor located elsewhere
    may have the

    correct data. In this case, the data from the sensor with the correct view may
    be combined with past

    information from the blocked sensor to update the overall measurements.

    The work in Reference [40] categorizes multi-sensor data fusion systems regarding
    what is

    observed by several sensors. Data fusion can take place:

    1.

    across sensors when several sensors observe the same variable; for instance, when
    the temperature

    of a particular object is monitored by a set of temperature sensors;

    2.

    across attributes when sensors observe several quantities related with one event;
    for instance,

    when measurements of water temperature and water conductivity are combined to
    deﬁne the

    water salinity;

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    13 of 23

    3.

    across domains when sensors observe one speciﬁc attribute in several places. An
    example

    is when sensors in different places measure the temperature and the measured values
    are

    somehow correlated.

    4.

    across time when new readings are fused with past data. For example, historical
    information from

    a former calibration can be incorporated to make adjustments on current measurements.
    Note

    that this is a particular case that applies to systems with single sensors, which
    we speciﬁcally

    discuss later as a form of temporal redundancy.

    The work in Reference [41] provides a slightly different classiﬁcation of a multi-sensor
    data fusion

    system, which partially overlaps with the previous classiﬁcation. They consider
    that sensor fusion

    can be:

    1.

    competitive when every sensor conveys an autonomous reading of the same variable.
    The purpose

    of this type of fusion is to diminish the effects of uncertain and incorrect monitoring.

    Competitive fusion corresponds to sensor fusion across sensors, in the terminology
    of [40];

    2.

    cooperative when the data measured by many autonomous sensors is utilized to infer
    information

    that would not be accessible through each of the sensors. This corresponds to
    sensor fusion

    across attributes;

    3.

    complementary when sensors are not directly dependent, but might be merged with
    the

    speciﬁc goal of providing a more comprehensive view of what the network is trying
    to observe.

    Thus, complementary fusion can assist in solving the incompleteness problem. This
    category

    does not entirely match the categories by [40]; it is closer to sensor fusion
    across attributes, but

    the idea is not to extract information, but to complement it.

    From the above, it is clear that data fusion can take place in many ways and for
    different purposes,

    some of which are not speciﬁcally concerned with dependability issues, but rather
    functional issues.

    This is the case of cooperative sensor fusion, whose the objective is to derive
    new information rather

    than correcting the existing information.

    Unfortunately, sensor fusion is not always possible. For instance, when considering
    monitoring

    activities over a wide physical area, it may be better or even necessary (namely
    for cost-effectiveness

    reasons) to scatter the sensors in pre-identiﬁed points according to area dynamics
    expertise and local

    knowledge, to cover the most signiﬁcant events. For instance, this is often the
    case when monitoring

    water bodies [42], because of their typically large extension and the involved
    complex water dynamics,

    requiring expert knowledge when determining the deployment locations scattered
    to cover the highly

    variable environmental dynamics. Moreover, water monitoring usually requires costly
    sensors [43],

    which makes it infeasible to have more than one in a conﬁned area. Exploiting
    sensor fusion in these

    conditions is thus very hard or even impossible.

    Even when sensor fusion can be opted as an alternative for achieving increased
    dependability,

    there are a number of technical problems that may have to be addressed. For example,
    when monitoring

    environmental processes with fast dynamics, it may be necessary that all measurements
    are obtained

    at roughly the same time [37] so that they can be correlated. However, timing
    aspects are hard to

    deal with in distributed settings, and issues like network delays or incorrect
    clock synchronization of

    sensor nodes, if not accounted for during system design, can lead to incorrect
    data being produced

    by sensor fusion algorithms. Given the real-time nature of sensor data, there
    is a temporal validity

    interval during which the difference between the measured data value and the real
    value is acceptable

    for the application. After this temporal validity interval, data become outdated
    and must be discarded.

    Therefore, data should be timestamped as soon as they are collected, and the temporal
    validity interval

    must be known at design time. This will allow setting up mechanisms to discard
    outdated data.

    The clocks of the different nodes in the system must be synchronized and the precision
    (the maximum

    difference between all of the clocks) must also be known and taken into account
    when deciding

    whether some sensor data are already outdated. Dependable sensor fusion thus requires
    additional

    design efforts, to adapt the solution to the speciﬁc application characteristics
    and requirements.

    4.1.2. Value Redundancy

    While sensor fusion relies on the physical (space) redundancy provided by the
    existence of several

    sensors, it is possible to consider data fusion [44,45] as an alternative approach.
    It does not require

    physically redundant sensor nodes, but relies on the value redundancy provided
    by extra information,

    obtained by other means. The notions of sensor fusion and (multi-sensor) data
    fusion are often used

    interchangeably. In fact, data fusion can be considered a generalization of sensor
    fusion, when data

    fusion is applied to multi-sensor data. Data fusion, in general, is related to
    the fusion of data, no matter

    its source, whereas sensor fusion (or multi-sensor data fusion) describes the
    use of more than one

    sensor in a multi-sensor system to enhance the accuracy of measured data or to
    handle missing data.

    The process of data fusion deals with the identiﬁcation, association, correlation,
    estimation and

    combination of spatially- and temporally-indexed data or information from numerous
    inputs with

    the speciﬁc goal of enhancing the analysis and understanding of this information.
    The techniques

    employed for data fusion are essentially the ones referred to for sensor fusion,
    which are discussed

    below. However, from a dependability perspective, it is important to note that
    data fusion opens new

    perspectives (in comparison to sensor fusion) regarding exploitable redundancy.
    We refer, in particular,

    to two forms of value redundancy that are exploitable with data fusion:

    •

    Signal analysis or analytical redundancy: This is used to monitor parameters such
    as frequency

    response, signal noise and amplitude change velocity among others [46]. It is
    a robust approach in

    the case of strange behavior in a controlled system. If there is a strong variability
    of a variable, then

    a sensor is categorized as faulty (or the system under monitoring has been altered).
    This necessarily

    requires some bounds to be established a priori, against which the parameters
    can be fused to

    perform the intended classiﬁcation.

    •

    Model-based redundancy: With the help of simulation/mathematical models of the
    monitored

    system, it is possible to obtain values to validate the measurements. The author
    in Reference [47]

    was a big promoter of this type of redundancy, where the system model calculates
    the measured

    variable, and then it, is compared to the sensor measurement.

    One potential difﬁculty in applying model-based redundancy is deﬁning relevant
    and accurate

    models. The problem becomes even more difﬁcult when these models characterize
    physical

    processes that change over time, which is often the case when monitoring environmental
    systems.

    Forecasting modeling techniques include simulation, estimation and syntactic methods
    [48]. Simulation

    is used when the physical characteristics to be measured can be accurately and
    predictably modeled.

    These models can be used in all types of scenarios, but most studies present examples
    based on

    terrestrial (indoor) applications [49], whereas the theme of the work herein concentrates
    on the

    complexity of the aquatic environment (e.g., water circulation). It is for this
    exact reason that current

    aquatic systems do not support real-time model-based data fusion [50]. Ideally,
    at run-time, a

    forecasting model represents a reference to validate the sensing data, which can
    also be applied

    for optimization and planning [51].

    4.1.3. Temporal Redundancy

    In WSN applications, sensor nodes continuously send new measurements of the monitored

    network, typically in a periodic way, to satisfy the temporal accuracy requirements
    of the application.

    The sequential measurements arriving at the sink or processing node constitute
    a time series

    to which data processing techniques can be applied with dependability objectives.
    In other words,

    if past measurements are considered historical data, then sensor fusion techniques
    can be applied to

    fuse the historical data with the current measurement. For instance, it is usual
    that noise reduction

    techniques are applied to single data streams, as a preliminary data enhancement
    step before any

    other data processing algorithms are applied. Outlier detection techniques [52]
    are also commonly

    applied to single data streams, detecting a faulty measurement when it deviates
    too much from the

    recent measurement history. Given the deviations caused by intrinsic noise and
    complex failure modes

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    15 of 23

    affecting the transducing process [53], choosing the adequate margins to achieve
    accurate outlier

    detection is usually a difﬁcult problem. One approach to this problem is to use
    detection patterns

    rather than thresholds, applied to the incoming data stream. This approach allows
    detecting other

    phenomena, in addition to or instead of outliers [54]. Interestingly, outlier
    detection is a problem

    common to several areas including network intrusion, fraud detection, performance
    assessment and

    weather forecasting, among others [55].

    The identiﬁcation of outliers contributes to improving the data fusion processes
    and hence the

    quality of the resulting data. If performed by intermediate nodes, it may also
    contribute to enhancing

    the network performance by preventing the transmission of messages containing
    outliers (thus

    transforming outlier faults into omission faults, possibly a good strategy in
    systems with redundant

    information sources).

    We note that temporal redundancy and value redundancy strategies, as described
    here, can be

    combined with spatial redundancy in a single system.

    4.2. A Taxonomy for Dependability-Oriented Data Quality in WSNs

    To help the reader understanding the main dimensions, aspects and techniques that
    are related to

    the problem of achieving data quality and dependability in WSNs, we provide in
    Figure 4 a schema

    with a tree-like organization of the relevant taxonomy. Note that the redundancy
    approaches presented

    earlier serve as a base for the application of the techniques described ahead.

    We consider three main dimensions that are relevant when addressing the problem
    of data quality

    and dependability improvement: goals to be achieved, functions to be performed
    and techniques to

    be applied.

    We identify two distinct goals. The ﬁrst consists of improving the quality of
    data, which is the

    most common in WSN applications that aim at satisfying non-functional requirements
    (often not

    explicitly speciﬁed), like reliable or safe operation. The second goal is less
    common. It consists of

    estimating the quality of data to enable assessing if non-functional requirements
    are satisﬁed. Although

    it may not be easy to explicitly deﬁne these requirements, the advantage is that
    it becomes possible to

    deﬁne mechanisms to mitigate the negative effects of deviations from the speciﬁcation.
    For instance,

    users can be notiﬁed that the application is not working properly, or the application
    may be stopped in

    a fail-safe state instead of performing some unsafe operation.

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    16 of 23

    To meet these goals, it is necessary to execute speciﬁc functions, which we classify
    into two

    categories: state oriented and data oriented. State-oriented functions are meant
    to evaluate the health

    of system components, in particular sensors (or sensor nodes), on the assumption
    that this health is

    affected by faults. Several fault detection functions are thus considered, to
    deal with the different

    failure modes identiﬁed in Section 3.2. These functions are important to both
    improve and estimate

    the quality of data, respectively by providing information that allows differentiating
    good and bad

    information sources in sensor fusion processes and by allowing distinguishing
    the quality of results

    obtained with source components in different health conditions. Data-oriented
    functions include all

    those that are meant to process sensor data, namely (but not exclusively) to calibrate,
    ﬁlter, correct or

    reconstruct data that are affected by faults. Calibration performs an automatic
    adjustment of values,

    for instance to compensate the effect of an offset. Filtering can be used to remove
    outliers or noise

    effects. Correction allows modifying values, for instance when it is know that
    they are drifting from

    the real values or that they are trimmed. Reconstruction is helpful for instance
    when a value is missing

    or when it is removed due to being an outlier and a replacement value needs to
    be produced. All of

    these functions are meant to improve the quality of data, rather than estimating
    this quality. They can

    be combined with each other and also with state-oriented functions, for better
    results concerning data

    quality improvement.

    There is a vast range of techniques and speciﬁc algorithms that may be employed
    to process sensor

    data and perform the mentioned functions. In this survey, we go through the main
    ones, providing

    illustrating references, and considering the two broad categories of supervised
    and unsupervised

    techniques. No matter the function to which it contributes, when a technique requires
    model training

    and training datasets, it is characterized as a supervised learning technique.
    In this category, the

    constructed and trained models are used at run-time to classify data, estimate
    new values and correct

    existing data, among other. On the other hand, unsupervised techniques are characterized
    by directly

    inferring the possible relations between data, without the need for a correcting
    model output reference.

    In the following sections, we include examples to help the reader understanding
    that for a given

    problem involving data quality issues, it may be possible to use multiple solutions
    or techniques.

    For instance, in [56] Kreibich et al. present two solutions for the evaluation
    of sensor-fusion quality in

    an industrial WSN that suffers from temporary losses of data and interferences
    in data streams, using

    fuzzy logic and Dempster–Shafer theory. Moreover, the authors mention that other
    techniques could

    be used (such as Bayesian, Kalman ﬁlter, artiﬁcial neural network or voting fusion).

    4.2.1. Supervised Techniques

    Since data fusion is a concept that exists in works dated from the 1980s until
    now, many authors

    present data fusion taxonomies for detection, classiﬁcation and identiﬁcation
    algorithms [45,57–59].

    These are low-level processing algorithms that can be applied in sensor nodes
    of a WSN. The goals

    here are to detect if an object is present, to classify the object and to identify
    it as accurately as possible.

    Within the supervised techniques, we group the major algorithm categories into
    feature-based

    inference techniques and techniques based on behavioral models, as illustrated
    in the scheme

    of Figure 4.

    Feature-based inference techniques achieve information mapping through classiﬁcation
    or

    detection. An example is the use of statistical knowledge about an object or information
    about

    its features, as a means for its identiﬁcation.

    These techniques can be further partitioned into

    several classes. In the following paragraphs, we will refer to some of the most
    frequently-used

    techniques, namely parametric such as Bayesian inference, Dempster–Shafer evidential
    theory (DST)

    and Kalman ﬁlters, and artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN), which is a well-known
    information theoretic

    technique. We note that there are many other machine learning techniques that
    may be of use,

    such as entropy-measuring techniques, pattern recognition, parametric templates,
    ﬁgures of merit,

    whose description falls out of the scope of this survey (we refer the interested
    reader, for example, to

    Reference [45], for further details on feature-based methods for information fusion
    in sensor networks).

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    Bayesian inference techniques use likelihood models applied to collected data
    to make deductions

    about observed quantities and even gain insights about quantities that have not
    been observed.

    Bayesian inference is used to solve the problem of efﬁcient data gathering in
    sensor networks. The work

    in Reference [60] used this approach in a temperature and pressure sensor network
    composed of

    500 nodes, to solve the problem of missing data, and to infer that missing information.
    The work in

    Reference [61] used a Bayesian-network-based approach to detect global outliers
    in an environmental

    monitoring network. Bayesian inference is a computationally-complex process, in
    which learning the

    classiﬁcation model can be challenging, if there is a large number of correlations
    in the WSN.

    The difﬁculty and uncertainty included in integrating sets of data gathered from
    numerous sources

    promoted the development of alternatives to Bayesian inference. Among them, Dempster–Shafer

    theory (DST) has turned out to be one of the more considered [62,63], for the
    most part because of the

    fundamental Dempster’s combination rule [64]. The biggest beneﬁt of this method
    is the simplicity of

    consolidating possibly contradictory evidence, independently of whether it was
    collected as direct or

    indirect data. DST adapts better to the situations than the Bayesian approach
    as no former probabilities

    must be presumed regarding the potential node behavior, and acceptance of a theory
    does not deﬁne

    rejection of the contrasting proposition, which allows handling contradictory
    indications quantitatively.

    In addition, Reference [65] studied a DST approach to evaluate sensor nodes misbehavior.

    Kalman ﬁltering is a well-known estimation-based approach to solve data quality
    problems in

    WSNs. One recent example [66] presents an algorithm to correct rough and missing
    information

    grounded on Kalman ﬁltering to surpass the issue with querying faulty information
    and to enhance

    the exactness of data in a 1000-node WSN in a synthetic environment. Another example
    is presented

    in Reference [67], in the context of an aquatic monitoring application, in which
    Kalman ﬁltering was

    used with forecasting algorithms to assess the quality of the monitoring data
    series.

    Artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) are hardware or software systems that need a training
    process

    consisting of mapping input information to target values or classes. The conversion
    of this input

    information into the yields is executed by artiﬁcial neurons that try to imitate
    the complicated, nonlinear

    and hugely parallel procedures that happen in natural sensory systems. ANNs have
    been used in WSNs

    for the most varied applications, many of which are related to fault-detection
    [68–70]. In consonance

    with the theme of the work herein, [71] presented an ANN-based approach to detect
    disaster events

    through an environmental sensor network. Additionally, [72] presents another ANN-based
    approach

    to detect biofouling events (thus, fault events) in an aquatic sensor network.

    The behavioral (cognitive-based) models group encompasses techniques that attempt
    to imitate

    and mechanize the decision-making procedures utilized by human analysts. These
    include event

    algebra, rule-based systems and fuzzy logic. The latter technique is the most
    studied and applied,

    which justiﬁes our particular attention to it.

    According to [73], fuzzy set theory allows for imprecise knowledge to be mathematically
    treated

    by making it easier to represent or classify system state variable information.
    The use of fuzzy

    associative memory (also known as production rules) allows a proposition to have
    a membership

    value in a given class ranging from zero (absolutely does not belong in the category)
    to one (absolutely

    belongs in the category). An expert speciﬁes the production rules and fuzzy sets
    that represent the

    characteristics of each input and output variable. Fuzzy data fusion application
    to WSNs has at least

    as much popularity as ANN-based fusion; therefore, its applications range from
    fault detection [74–76]

    to applications in industrial WSNs [77], the environment [78] and aquatic-related
    WSNs [79].

    There are some other mathematical approaches that have been developed in recent
    years, which

    include random set theory, conditional algebra and relational event algebra [48].

    Random set theory complements the existing theories of random vectors and of random
    functions

    serving as a mechanism for modeling observed phenomena, which are sets rather
    than precise points.

    It can be applied to incorporate ambiguous evidence (e.g., natural language reports
    and rules) and

    various expert system methods into multi-sensor estimation. Conditional event
    algebra refers to

    sets with one or more ﬁnitary operations deﬁned on it that satisfy a list of axioms,
    whose domain

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    18 of 23

    consists of logical objects using a type of probabilistic calculus suited for
    contingency problems such

    as knowledge-based rules and contingent decision making. Relational event algebra
    is an extension

    of conditional event algebra where functions of probabilities formally representing
    single event

    probabilities represent actual relational events considering appropriately determined
    larger probability

    spaces, providing a systematic basis for solving problems involving pooling of
    evidence.

    4.2.2. Unsupervised Techniques

    There are several unsupervised data processing techniques (Figure 4), which serve,
    just

    like supervised techniques, to perform the needed functions in WSN-based monitoring
    systems,

    like detection, ﬁltering or correction.

    Various statistical analysis methods can be used as unsupervised techniques for
    data processing.

    For instance, the work in [80] resorts to statistical analysis to identify events,
    recognize observation

    errors and predict absent measurements in ecological WSNs. The proposed method
    requires learning

    statistical distributions of differences between measurements of a sensor and
    those of its neighbors,

    as well as between sequences of single-sensor measurements. According to the author,
    there is a

    large degree of spatiotemporal correlation in scalar physical variables, which
    provides a spectrum

    of oscillations between adjoining or successive readings with little differences.
    Based on successive

    readings, it is possible to learn their distribution and then detect outliers
    when a reading value is lower

    than a determined threshold, in the statistical signiﬁcance test.

    Clustering techniques are quite common in WSN-based applications. The general
    procedure

    is to integrate analogous information into groups with identical comportment.
    Data not belonging

    to these clusters or belonging to a smaller cluster would be considered outliers,
    if this is the goal.

    A simple and well-known clustering algorithm is the nearest neighbor, which associates
    the most

    similar measurements. For example, the approach was used by [81] to handle unsupervised
    outlier

    detection and, in particular, to identify global-wise outliers. Every node utilizes
    distance similitude

    to locally distinguish anomalous readings and transferring those readings to the
    nearby nodes for

    conﬁrmation. These nearby nodes will repeat this process until the entire network
    ultimately agrees

    on the overall anomalous readings. The downside of this method is the lack of
    scalability to large-scale

    networks. The most used method to measure the similarity between two data instances
    is the Euclidean

    distance. For instance, this is used in [82] in the context of target classiﬁcation
    in a multi-channel

    seismic network.

    The spectral decomposition-based approach aims at deﬁning standard behaviors in
    the data by

    utilizing principal component analysis (PCA). PCA allows decreasing the magnitude
    of an information

    set in which there are many interrelated variables, while holding as much as could
    be expected of the

    variety present in the set. The work in Reference [83] proposed a PCA-based method
    to address the

    data integrity arising from the imprecision triggered by faulty sensor nodes.
    The method requires a

    model of the standard behavior to be built a priori, by selecting appropriate
    principal components

    (PCs), and allows the detection of outliers.

    Voting methods are useful to fuse information from several sensors, particularly
    when applied to

    detection and classiﬁcation declarations from multiple sensors. These declarations
    are treated as votes,

    to which majority, plurality or decision-tree rules are applied to obtain a result
    that is more dependable

    than what would be obtained with a single sensor output [48]. This allows, for
    instance, masking false

    alarms when the sensors are used to detect the occurrence of some event, thus
    preventing premature

    reactions or countermeasures. In this sense, voting methods are also appropriate
    for fault-detection, to

    decide which node is the faulty one [84,85]. Finally, they are used in several
    other application contexts,

    such as WSN security [86] and sensor faults in on-body sensor networks [87].

    5. Conclusions

    Assuring the quality of sensor data is important in WSN-based monitoring applications.
    In the

    last decade, this dependability aspect has been explicitly or implicitly addressed
    in many works,

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2010

    19 of 23

    notably by exploiting the redundancy provided by the multiple sensor nodes typically
    existing in

    a WSN. Various speciﬁc problems need to be addressed when aiming at a dependable
    WSN-based

    monitoring solution, from ensuring the reliability of the transducing process
    to achieving a correct

    interpretation of data collected from several correlated sensors.

    In this paper, we present an encompassing perspective of the several facets of
    the problem,

    focusing on dependability aspects speciﬁc to individual sensors, to the network
    that interconnects

    the sensor nodes and the processing nodes and to the processing tasks that are
    performed within the

    processing nodes. This separation of concerns allows one to: (a) clearly expose
    the possible causes

    of data quality loss from the source to the ﬁnal output; (b) describe speciﬁc
    mitigation solutions;

    (c) provide a dependability perspective on what can be explicitly done to achieve
    improved data

    quality and assess this quality. Particular focus is given to the different forms
    of redundancy that may

    be exploited to achieve the dependability objectives: spatial, value and temporal
    redundancy. These are

    intrinsically related to the many sensor and data fusion techniques commonly employed,
    also surveyed

    in the paper. We provide many references on publications with theoretical and
    practical applications

    of the techniques, chosen to illustrate the multitude of options that are studied
    to solve directly or

    indirectly data quality problems. A speciﬁc outlook on data quality issues and
    open problems in water

    monitoring applications is ﬁnally given.

    \ technology has received signiﬁcant attention in a variety of ﬁelds, as\nit combines\
    \ the collected information from multi-sensors, which can enhance the robustness\
    \ and\nsafety of a system. In wireless sensor networks applications, however,\
    \ the data that are collected\nfrom the sensors are often imprecise and uncertain\
    \ [1]. How to model and handle the uncertainty\ninformation is still an open issue.\
    \ To address this problem, many mathematical approaches have been\npresented,\
    \ such as the fuzzy sets theory [2,3], that focuses on the intuitive reasoning\
    \ by taking into\naccount human subjectivity and imprecision; the intuitionistic\
    \ fuzzy sets theory [4] which generalizes\nfuzzy sets by considering the uncertainty\
    \ in the assignment of membership degree known as the\nhesitation degree; evidence\
    \ theory [5–7], as a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty,\nwith understood\
    \ connections to other frameworks such as probability, possibility, and imprecise\n\
    probability theories; rough sets theory [8,9] where its methodology is concerned\
    \ with the classiﬁcation\nand analysis of imprecise, uncertain, or incomplete\
    \ information and knowledge, which is considered\none of the ﬁrst non-statistical\
    \ approaches in data analysis; evidential reasoning [10,11] which is a\ngeneric\
    \ evidence-based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach for dealing\
    \ with problems\nhaving both quantitative and qualitative criteria under various\
    \ uncertainties including ignorance\nand randomness; Z numbers [12,13], that intend\
    \ to provide a basis for computation with numbers\nwhich are not totally reliable;\
    \ D numbers theory [14–17] which is a generalization of Dempster–Shafer\ntheory,\
    \ but does not follow the commutative law; and so on [18–21]. In addition, mixed\
    \ intelligent\nSensors 2018, 18, 1487; doi:10.3390/s18051487\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2018, 18, 1487\n2 of 20\nmethods have been applied in decision making\
    \ [22], risk analysis [23], supplier selection [24], pattern\nrecognition [25],\
    \ classiﬁcation [26], human reliability analysis [27], and fault diagnosis [28],\
    \ etc. In this\npaper, we focus on evidence theory to deal with the uncertain\
    \ problem of multi-sensor data fusion.\nDempster–Shafer evidence theory was ﬁrstly\
    \ presented by Dempster [5] in 1967; later, it was\nextended by Shafer [6] in\
    \ 1976. Dempster–Shafer evidence theory is effective to model both of the\nuncertainty\
    \ and imprecision without prior information, so it is widely applied in various\
    \ ﬁelds for\ninformation fusion [29–32]. Nevertheless, it may result in counter-intuitive\
    \ results when combining\nhighly conﬂicting pieces of evidence [33]. To address\
    \ this issue, many methods have been presented in\nrecent years [34–36]. On the\
    \ one hand, some researchers focused on amending Dempster’s combination\nrule.\
    \ On the other hand, some researchers tried to pretreat the bodies of evidence\
    \ before using\nDempster’s combination rule. In terms of of amending Dempster’s\
    \ combination rule, the major works\ncontain Smets’s unnormalized combination\
    \ rule [37], Dubois and Prade’s disjunctive combination\nrule [38], and Yager’s\
    \ combination rule [39]. However, the modiﬁcation of combination rule often\n\
    breaks the good properties, like commutativity and associativity. Furthermore,\
    \ if the sensor failure\ngives rise to the counter-intuitive results, the modiﬁcation\
    \ of combination rule is considered to\nbe unreasonable. Therefore, in order to\
    \ resolve the fusion problem of highly conﬂicting pieces of\nevidence, researchers\
    \ prefer to pretreat the bodies of evidence. With respect to pretreating the bodies\n\
    of evidence, the main works contain Murphy’s simple average approach of the bodies\
    \ of evidence [40],\nand Deng et al.’s weighted average of the masses based on\
    \ distance of evidence [41]. Deng et al.’s\nmethod [41] conquered the deﬁciency\
    \ of the method in [40]. However, the impact of evidence itself\nwas neglected\
    \ in the decision-making process.\nHence, in this paper, a weighted combination\
    \ method for conﬂicting pieces of evidence in\nmulti-sensor data fusion is proposed\
    \ to resolve fusion problem of highly conﬂicting evidence. First,\nthe credibility\
    \ degree of each piece of evidence is determined on the basis of the modiﬁed cosine\n\
    similarity measure of basic probability assignment [42]. Then, credibility degree\
    \ of each piece of\nevidence is modiﬁed by adopting the belief entropy function\
    \ [43] to measure the information volume\nof the evidence. Finally, the modiﬁed\
    \ credibility degree of each piece of evidence is used to adjust its\ncorresponding\
    \ body of evidence to obtain the weighted averaging evidence before using Dempster’s\n\
    combination rule. A numerical example is given to illustrate the feasibility and\
    \ effectiveness of the\nproposed method. Additionally, the proposed method is\
    \ applied in data classiﬁcation and motor rotor\nfault diagnosis, which validates\
    \ the practicability of it.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section\
    \ 2 brieﬂy introduces the preliminaries of\nthis paper. After that, Section 3\
    \ proposes the novel method, which is based on the similarity measure\nof evidence\
    \ and belief function entropy. Then, Section 4 gives a numerical example to show\
    \ the\neffectiveness of the proposed method. A statistical experiment is carried\
    \ out in Section 5. Afterwards,\nthe proposed method is applied to Iris data set\
    \ classiﬁcation, and motor rotor fault diagnosis is\nperformed in Section 6. Finally,\
    \ Section 7 gives the conclusions.\n2. Preliminaries\n2.1. Data Fusion\nData fusion\
    \ can be identiﬁed as a combination of multiple sources to obtain improved information\n\
    with less expensive, higher quality, or more relevant information [44]. General\
    \ data fusion structure can\nbe classiﬁed into three types based on the different\
    \ stages: data-level, feature-level, and decision-level,\nas referred in [45].\n\
    In the data-level fusion, all raw data from sensors for a measured object are\
    \ combined directly.\nThen, a feature vector is extracted from the fused data.\
    \ Fusion of data at this level consists of the\nmaximum information so that it\
    \ can generate good results. However, sensors used in the data-level\nfusion,\
    \ such as the sensors reporting vibration signals, must be homogeneous. As a consequence,\n\
    the data-level fusion is limited in the actual application environment, because\
    \ many physical quantities\nSensors 2018, 18, 1487\n3 of 20\ncan be measured for\
    \ a more comprehensive analysis. In the feature-level fusion, heterogeneous\n\
    sensors can be used to report the data. According to the types of collected raw\
    \ data, the features are\nextracted from the sensors. Then, these heterogeneous\
    \ sensor data are combined at the feature-level\nstage. All of the feature vectors\
    \ are combined into a single feature vector, which is then utilized in a\nspecial\
    \ classiﬁcation model for decision-making. In the decision-level fusion, the processes\
    \ of feature\nextraction and pattern recognition are sequentially conducted for\
    \ the data collected from each sensor.\nThen, the produced decision vectors are\
    \ combined by using decision-level fusion techniques such as\nthe Bayesian method,\
    \ Dempster–Shafer evidence theory, or behavior knowledge space.\nBecause of the\
    \ advantages of multi-sensor data fusion technology, it has been widely applied\
    \ in\nvarious ﬁelds, such as in fault diagnosis [46–48], target tracking [49,50],\
    \ health care analysis [51,52],\nimage processing [53], attack detection [54],\
    \ estimation of ship dynamics [55], and characterization of\nbuilt environments\
    \ [56].\nIn this paper, we focus on decision-level fusion, and try to improve\
    \ the performance of the system\nbased on Dempster–Shafer evidence theory.\n2.2.\
    \ Dempster-Shafer Evidence Theory\nDempster–Shafer evidence theory was ﬁrstly\
    \ proposed by Dempster [5] and was then further\ndeveloped by Shafer [6]. Dempster–Shafer\
    \ evidence theory, as a generalization of Bayesian inference,\nasks for weaker\
    \ conditions, which makes it more ﬂexible and effective to model both the uncertainty\n\
    and imprecision. The basic concepts are introduced as below.\nDeﬁnition 1. Let\
    \ U be a set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive events, indicated\
    \ by\nU = {C1, C2, . . . , Ci, . . . , CN}.\n(1)\nThe set U is called frame of\
    \ discernment. The power set of U is indicated by 2U, where\n2U = {∅, {C1}, {C2},\
    \ . . . , {CN}, {C1, C2}, . . . , {C1, C2, . . . , Ci}, . . . , U},\n(2)\nand\
    \ ∅ is an empty set. If A ∈ 2U, A is called a proposition or hypothesis.\nDeﬁnition\
    \ 2. For a frame of discernment U, a mass function is a mapping m from 2U to [0,\
    \ 1], formally defined by\nm : 2U → [0, 1],\n(3)\nwhich satisﬁes the following\
    \ condition:\nm(∅) = 0 and ∑\nA∈2U\nm(A) = 1.\n(4)\nIn Dempster–Shafer evidence\
    \ theory, a mass function can be also called as a basic probability\nassignment\
    \ (BPA). If m(A) is greater than 0, A will be called as a focal element, and the\
    \ union of all of\nthe focal elements is known as the core of the mass function.\n\
    Deﬁnition 3. For a proposition A ⊆ U, the belief function Bel : 2U → [0, 1] is\
    \ deﬁned as\nBel(A) = ∑\nB⊆A\nm(B).\n(5)\nThe plausibility function Pl : 2U →\
    \ [0, 1] is deﬁned as\nPl(A) = 1 − Bel( ¯A) =\n∑\nB∩A̸=∅\nm(B),\n(6)\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 1487\n4 of 20\nwhere ¯A = U − A.\nApparently, Pl(A) is equal or greater\
    \ than Bel(A), where the function Bel is the lower limit\nfunction of proposition\
    \ A and the function Pl is the upper limit function of proposition A.\nDeﬁnition\
    \ 4. Let the two BPAs be m1 and m2 on the frame of discernment U. Assuming that\
    \ these BPAs\nare independent, Dempster’s rule of combination, denoted by m =\
    \ m1 ⊕ m2, known as the orthogonal sum, is\ndeﬁned as below:\nm(A) =\n\n\n\n\
    1\n1−K\n∑\nB∩D=A\nm1(B)m2(D),\nA ̸= ∅,\n0,\nA = ∅,\n(7)\nwith\nK =\n∑\nB∩D=∅\n\
    m1(B)m2(D),\n(8)\nwhere B and D are also the elements of 2U, and K is a constant\
    \ that presents the conﬂict between the two BPAs.\nNote that Dempster’s combination\
    \ rule is only practicable for the two BPAs with the condition\nK < 1.\n2.3. Modiﬁed\
    \ Cosine Similarity Measure of BPAs\nA modiﬁed cosine similarity measure is proposed\
    \ by Jiang [42]. Because it considers three\nimportant factors, namely, angle,\
    \ distance, and vector norm, the modiﬁed cosine similarity measure is\nan efﬁcient\
    \ approach to measure the similarity between vectors more precisely. The modiﬁed\
    \ cosine\nsimilarity measure among the BPAs can determine whether the pieces of\
    \ evidence conﬂict with each\nother. A large similarity indicates that this piece\
    \ of evidence has more support from another piece of\nevidence, while a small\
    \ similarity indicates that this piece of evidence has less support from another\n\
    piece of evidence.\nDeﬁnition 5. Let E = [e1, e2, . . . , en] and F = [ f1, f2,\
    \ . . . , fn] be two vectors of Rn. The modiﬁed cosine\nsimilarity between vectors\
    \ E and F is deﬁned as\nSI(E, F) =\n(\n1\n2{α−P + min( |E|\n|F|, |F|\n|E|)}sicos(E,\
    \ F),\nE ̸= 0, F ̸= 0,\n0,\nE = 0 or F = 0,\n(9)\nwhere α is a constant whose\
    \ value is greater than 1, P is the Euclidean distance between the two vectors\
    \ E and F,\nα−P is the distance-based similarity measure, min( |E|\n|F|, |F|\n\
    |E|) is the minimum of |E|\n|F| and |F|\n|E|, and sicos(E, F) is the\ncosine similarity.\
    \ The larger the α is, the greater the distance impact on vector similarity will\
    \ be.\nDeﬁnition 6. Let m1 and m2 be the BPAs in the frame of discernment U =\
    \ {C1, C2, . . . , CN}. The two vectors\nare expressed as\nBeli = [Beli(C1), Beli(C2),\
    \ . . . , Beli(CN)],\ni = 1, 2,\nPli = [Pli(C1), Pli(C2), . . . , Pli(CN)],\n\
    i = 1, 2.\n(10)\nThen, the belief function vector similarity SI(Bel1, Bel2) and\
    \ the plausibility function vector similarity\nSI(Pl1, Pl2) can be calculated.\
    \ The new similarity of BPAs is deﬁned as\nSIBPA = (1 − λ) ∗ SI(Bel1, Bel2) +\
    \ λ ∗ SI(Pl1, Pl2),\n(11)\nwith\n0 ≤ λ ≤ 1,\n(12)\nSensors 2018, 18, 1487\n5 of\
    \ 20\nwhere λ is the total uncertainty of BPAs, which is deﬁned as\nλ =\n2\n∑\n\
    i=1\nN\n∑\nj=1\n(Pli(Cj) − Beli(Cj))\n2\n∑\ni=1\nN\n∑\nj=1\n(Pli(Cj))\n.\n(13)\n\
    Because Pli(Cj) ≥ Beli(Cj) and Bel ≥ 0, if Pli(Cj) = Beli(Cj), then λ = 0. Otherwise,\
    \ if Beli(Cj) =\n0, then λ = 1. The larger the uncertainty λ is, the greater the\
    \ inﬂuence on the similarity of BPA will be.\n2.4. Belief Entropy\nA novel type\
    \ of belief entropy, known as the Deng entropy, was ﬁrst proposed by Deng [43].\n\
    When the uncertain information is expressed by probability, the Deng entropy degenerates\
    \ to the\nShannon entropy. Hence, the Deng entropy is regarded as a generalization\
    \ of the Shannon entropy.\nIt is an efﬁcient mathematical tool to measure the\
    \ uncertain information, especially when the uncertain\ninformation is expressed\
    \ by the BPA. Because of its advantage in measuring the uncertain information,\n\
    the Deng entropy is applied in a variety of areas [57,58]. The basic concepts\
    \ are introduced below.\nDeﬁnition 7. Let B be a hypothesis or proposition of\
    \ the BPA m in the frame of discernment U and |B| be the\ncardinality of B. The\
    \ Deng entropy of the BPA m is deﬁned as follows:\nEd(m) = − ∑\nB⊆U\nm(B) log\n\
    m(B)\n2|B| − 1.\n(14)\nWhen the belief value is only allocated to the singleton,\
    \ the Deng entropy degenerates to the Shannon\nentropy, i.e.,\nEd(m) = − ∑\nB∈U\n\
    m(B) log\nm(B)\n2|B| − 1 = − ∑\nB∈U\nm(B) log m(B).\n(15)\nThe larger the value\
    \ of the cardinality of the hypothesis or proposition, the larger the value\n\
    the Deng entropy of evidence, which means that the piece of evidence involves\
    \ more information.\nTherefore, if a piece of evidence has a large Deng entropy\
    \ value, it has more support from other pieces\nof evidence, indicating that this\
    \ piece of evidence plays an important role in the evidence combination.\n3. The\
    \ Proposed Method\nIn this paper, a weighted combination method for conﬂicting\
    \ pieces of evidence multi-sensor data\nfusion is proposed by combining the modiﬁed\
    \ cosine similarity measure of evidence with the belief\nentropy function. In\
    \ contrast to the method of Jiang et al. [42], in the proposed method, the impact\
    \ of\nevidence itself is considered in the process of fusion of multiple pieces\
    \ of evidence by leveraging the\nbelief entropy [43], i.e., a useful uncertainty\
    \ measure tool, to measure the information volume of each\npiece of evidence,\
    \ so that the proposed method can combine multiple pieces of evidence with greater\n\
    accuracy. This will be discussed further in the next section.\n3.1. Process Steps\n\
    The proposed method is composed of the following procedures. The credibility degree\
    \ of the\npieces of evidence is ﬁrst determined on the basis of the similarity\
    \ measure among the BPAs. Then,\nthe credibility degree is modiﬁed by leveraging\
    \ the belief entropy function to measure the information\nvolume of the evidence.\
    \ Afterwards, the ﬁnal weight of each piece of evidence is obtained and adopted\n\
    to adjust the body of evidence before using Dempster’s combination rule. The speciﬁc\
    \ calculation\nprocesses are listed as follows. The ﬂowchart of the proposed method\
    \ is shown in Figure 1.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1487\n6 of 20\nStep 3: Calculate the\
    \ credibility degrees of the pieces of evidence.\nStep 1: Measure the similarities\
    \ between the pieces of evidence.\nStep 2: Obtain the support degrees of the pieces\
    \ of evidence.\nStep 4: Measure the information volume of the pieces of evidence.\n\
    Step 7: Normalise the modified credibility degrees of the pieces of evidence.\n\
    Step 5:  Normalise the information volume of the pieces of evidence.\nStep 6:\
    \ Modify the credibility degrees of the pieces of evidence.\nStep 8:  Obtain the\
    \ weighted average evidence.\nStep 9: Fuse the multiple weighted average pieces\
    \ of evidence.\nFigure 1. The ﬂowchart of the proposed method.\nStep 1: Measure\
    \ the similarities between the pieces of evidence.\nThe similarity measure SIBPA(ij)\
    \ between the BPAs mi and mj can be obtained by\nEquations (11)–(13). Then, a\
    \ similarity measure matrix (SMM) can be constructed as follows:\nSMM =\n\n\n\
    SIBPA(11)\n· · ·\nSIBPA(1i)\n· · ·\nSIBPA(1k)\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\nSIBPA(i1)\n\

    SIBPA(ki)\n· · ·\nSIBPA(kk)\n\n\n.\n(16)\nStep 2: Obtain the support degrees\
    \ of the pieces of evidence.\nThe support degree of the BPA mi (i = 1, . . . ,\
    \ k), denoted as SD(mi), is deﬁned as follows:\nSD(mi) =\nk\n∑\nj=1,j̸=i\nSIBPA(ij).\n\
    (17)\nStep 3: Calculate the credibility degrees of the pieces of evidence.\nThe\
    \ credibility degree of the BPA mi (i = 1, . . . , k), denoted as CD(mi), is deﬁned\
    \ as follows:\nCD(mi) =\nSD(mi)\n∑k\nl=1 SD(ml)\n.\n(18)\nSensors 2018, 18, 1487\n\
    7 of 20\nStep 4: Measure the information volume of the pieces of evidence.\nAccording\
    \ to Equation (14), the belief entropy Ed(mi) of the BPA mi (i = 1, . . . , k)\
    \ can be calculated.\nTo avoid assigning zero weight to the evidence, the information\
    \ volume IV(mi) is used for measuring\nthe uncertain information of mi. It is\
    \ deﬁned as follows:\nIV(mi) = eEd(mi) = e\n− ∑B⊆U m(B) log\nm(B)\n2|B|−1 .\n\
    (19)\nStep 5: Normalize the information volume of the pieces of evidence.\nThe\
    \ information volume of the BPA mi (i = 1, . . . , k) will be normalized as below:\n\
    IV(mi) =\nIV(mi)\n∑k\nl=1 IV(ml)\n.\n(20)\nStep 6: Modify the credibility degrees\
    \ of the pieces of evidence.\nBased on the normalized information volume, the\
    \ credibility degree of the BPA mi (i = 1, . . . , k)\nwill be modiﬁed, denoted\
    \ as MCD(mi):\nMCD(mi) = CD(mi) × IV(mi)(\n∑k\nl=1 CD(ml)\nk\n−CD(mi)).\n(21)\n\
    Step 7: Normalize the modiﬁed credibility degrees of the pieces of evidence.\n\
    The modiﬁed credibility degree MCD(mi) of the BPA mi (i = 1, . . . , k) will be\
    \ normalized as\nbelow, and is considered as the ﬁnal weight to adjust the bodies\
    \ of evidence.\nMCD(mi) =\nMCD(mi)\n∑k\nl=1 MCD(ml)\n.\n(22)\nStep 8: Obtain the\
    \ weighted average evidence.\nBased on the modiﬁed credibility degree of the BPA\
    \ mi (i = 1, . . . , k), the weighted average\nevidence WAE(m) is deﬁned as follows:\n\
    WAE(m) =\nk\n∑\ni=1\n(MCD(mi) × mi).\n(23)\nStep 9: Fuse multiple weighted average\
    \ pieces of evidence.\nWhen k number of pieces of evidence exist, the weighted\
    \ average evidence will be fused through\nDempster’s combination rule Equation\
    \ (7) via k − 1 times as below,\nFus(m) = (((WAE(m) ⊕ WAE(m))1 ⊕ · · · )h ⊕ WAE(m))(k−1).\n\
    (24)\nUltimately, we can obtain the ﬁnal fusion result of the evidence.\n3.2.\
    \ Algorithm\nLet m = {m1, . . . , mi, . . . , mk} be a set of multiple pieces\
    \ of evidence. After receiving k pieces of\nevidence, a fusion result is expected\

    \ support target a, Dempster’s\ncombination method [5] always generates a counterintuitive\
    \ result. As the number of pieces of evidence\nincreases to three, Murphy’s combination\
    \ method [40] and Deng et al.’s combination method [41]\ncannot deal with the\
    \ highly conﬂicting pieces of evidence very well, because the BPA values of object\
    \ a\ngenerated by Murphy’s method [40] and Deng et al.’s method [41] are 33.24%\
    \ and 44.77%, respectively,\nwhich are smaller than 50%. When the number of pieces\
    \ of evidence increases from four to ﬁve,\nMurphy’s combination method [40] and\
    \ Deng et al.’s combination method [41] work well, and the\nBPA values of object\
    \ a generated by Murphy’s method [40] and Deng et al.’s method [41] increase up\n\
    to 83.89% and 94.99%, respectively.\nOn the other hand, as shown in Table 4, Qian\

    \ and can efﬁciently deal with the highly conﬂicting pieces of evidence\nas the\

    \ to make a sound comparison, a statistical experiment is carried out with\nmultiple\
    \ pieces of initial data for the comparison of the proposed method with other\
    \ related methods.\nThis statistical experiment is implemented based on Example\
    \ 1. In the experimental setting,\nfor generating multiple initial data 100 times,\
    \ we provide a variation range [−0.1, 0.1] for each BPA of\nm1, and vary the values\
    \ of BPAs of m1 randomly.\nThen, the generated multiple pieces of initial data\
    \ are fused by utilizing the different methods,\nnamely, Dempster’s combination\
    \ method [5], Murphy’s combination method [40], Deng et al.’s\ncombination method\
    \ [41], Jiang et al.’s combination method [42], and the proposed method.\nThe\
    \ experimental results of target a’s BPA generated by different combination methods\
    \ are shown\nin Figure 3. From the comparison results, it is obvious that Murphy’s\
    \ combination method [40],\nDeng et al.’s combination method [41], Jiang et al.’s\
    \ combination method [42], and the proposed\nmethod are more efﬁcient than Dempster’s\
    \ combination method [5], because Dempster’s combination\nmethod cannot effectively\
    \ deal with the conﬂicting pieces of evidence, and thus always generates\ncounterintuitive\
    \ results where target a’s BPA value is 0 (under 0.5). In contrast, the other\
    \ methods can\neffectively cope with the conﬂicting evidence and recognize the\
    \ target a, where its corresponding BPA\nvalue is always larger than 0.5 under\
    \ multiple experiments. On the other hand, because Murphy’s\ncombination method\
    \ is a simply average-weighted approach to the bodies of evidence, its overall\n\
    performance is poorer than that of Deng et al.’s combination method, Jiang et\
    \ al.’s combination method,\nand the proposed method to a certain extent.\nFurthermore,\
    \ as shown in Figure 3a, Jiang et al.’s combination method [42] which is based\
    \ on the\nmodiﬁed cosine similarity measure, is more effective than Deng et al.’s\
    \ combination method [41] that\nis based on the Jousselme distance as a whole.\
    \ This is the reason that the modiﬁed cosine similarity\nmeasure is considered\
    \ in this study.\nIn order to improve the performance of Jiang et al.’s combination\
    \ method, we investigate and\nﬁnd that in the process of fusion of multiple pieces\
    \ of evidence, the impact of the evidence itself is\noverlooked in their method.\
    \ Hence, we also take the belief entropy into consideration to measure\nthe information\
    \ volume of each piece of evidence in the course of fusion and design the proposed\n\
    method. Consequently, as shown in Figure 3b, it can be noted that the proposed\
    \ method is superior to\nJiang et al.’s combination method [42] with a higher\
    \ target a BPA value.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1487\n12 of 20\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n\

    m({Ve, Vi}) = 0.0164,\nm({Se, Ve, Vi}) = 0.0015.\nStep 9:\nBy fusing the weighted\
    \ average evidence via Dempster’s combination rule four times, the\nﬁnal fusion\
    \ result of the evidence can be produced as follows:\nm({Se}) = 0.8693,\nm({Ve})\
    \ = 0.1254,\nm({Vi}) = 0.0053,\nm({Se, Ve}) = 1 × 10−7,\nm({Se, Vi}) = 7 × 10−10,\n\
    m({Ve, Vi}) = 1 × 10−6,\nm({Se, Ve, Vi}) = 5 × 10−11.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1487\n\
    14 of 20\nThe fusion results based on different combination approaches that were\
    \ applied on the Iris data\nset are presented in Table 6. From the experimental\
    \ results, it can be seen that Dempster’s combination\nmethod [5] and Murphy’s\
    \ combination method [40] always generate counterintuitive results and\nclassify\
    \ the species of Iris ﬂower as versicolor, even when the number of pieces of evidence\
    \ increases\nfrom two (mSL, mSW) to four (mSL, mSW, mPL, mPW). By contrast, Deng\
    \ et al.’s combination method [41]\nworks well when the number of pieces of evidence\
    \ is increased up to four (mSL, mSW, mPL, mPW),\nbecause it can classify the species\
    \ of Iris ﬂower as the target setosa with a belief value of 73.01%.\nTable 6.\

    Supposing there are three types of faults for a motor rotor given by {F1, F2,\
    \ F3} = {rotor unbalance,\nrotor misalignment, pedestal looseness} in the frame\

    \ conducting the steps in Section 3, the weighted average evidence with regard\
    \ to motor rotor\nfault diagnosis at 1X frequency is obtained as below:\nm({F2})\
    \ = 0.5442,\nm({F3}) = 0.0006,\nm({F1, F2}) = 0.0773,\nm({F1, F2, F3}) = 0.3780.\n\
    Then, the final fusion results for motor rotor fault diagnosis at 1X frequency\
    \ are computed as follows:\nm({F2}) = 0.9055,\nm({F3}) = 0.0002,\nm({F1, F2})\
    \ = 0.0404,\nm({F1, F2, F3}) = 0.0541.\n6.2.2. Motor Rotor Fault Diagnosis at\
    \ 2X Frequency\nBy carrying out the steps in Section 3, the weighted average evidence\
    \ with respect to motor rotor\nfault diagnosis at 2X frequency is obtained as\
    \ follows:\nm({F2}) = 0.7387,\nm({F1, F2, F3}) = 0.2613.\nAfterwards, the ﬁnal\
    \ fusion results in terms of motor rotor fault diagnosis at 2X frequency are\n\
    generated as below:\nm({F2}) = 0.9822,\nm({F1, F2, F3}) = 0.0178.\nSensors 2018,\
    \ 18, 1487\n16 of 20\n6.2.3. Motor Rotor Fault Diagnosis at 3X Frequency\nBy applying\
    \ the steps in Section 3, the weighted average evidence with respect to motor\
    \ rotor\nfault diagnosis at 3X frequency is obtained as follows:\nm({F1}) = 0.3111,\n\
    m({F2}) = 0.4346,\nm({F1, F2}) = 0.2115,\nm({F1, F2, F3}) = 0.0428.\nThen, the\
    \ final combination results for motor rotor fault diagnosis at 3X frequency are\
    \ shown below:\nm({F1}) = 0.3345,\nm({F2}) = 0.6321,\nm({F1, F2}) = 0.0333,\n\
    m({F1, F2, F3}) = 0.0001.\nFrom the experimental results as shown in Tables 10–12,\
    \ it can be seen that the proposed method\ndiagnoses the fault type as F2, in\
    \ accordance with Jiang et al.’s method [48].\nFurthermore, the proposed method\
    \ outperforms Jiang et al.’s method [48] in dealing with the\nuncertainty as shown\
    \ in Figures 5–7, because by utilizing the proposed method, the belief degrees\n\
    allocated to the target fault type F2 at 1X frequency, 2X frequency and 3X frequency\
    \ increase up to\n90.55%, 98.22%, and 63.21%, respectively; however, by using\
    \ Jiang et al.’s method [48], the belief\ndegrees allocated to the target F2 at\
    \ 1X frequency, 2X frequency and 3X frequency are 88.61%, 96.21%,\nand 59.04%,\
    \ respectively.\nAdditionally, by utilizing the proposed method, the uncertainty\
    \ {F1, F2} falls from 0.0582 to 0.0541,\nand the uncertainty {F1, F2, F3} falls\
    \ from 0.0555 to 0.0404 at 1X frequency; the uncertainty {F1, F2, F3}\ndecreased\
    \ from 0.0371 to 0.0178 at 2X frequency; the uncertainty {F1, F2} falls from 0.0651\
    \ to 0.0333,\nand the uncertainty {F1, F2, F3} drops from 0.0061 to 0.0001 at\
    \ 3X frequency. As a result, the proposed\nmethod can diagnose motor rotor faults\
    \ more accurately than the related work.\nTable 10. Fusion results by using different\

    \ combination method for conﬂicting evidence in multi-sensor data\nfusion was\
    \ proposed by combining the modiﬁed cosine similarity measure of the pieces of\
    \ evidence\nwith the belief entropy function. The proposed method was a kind of\
    \ pretreatment of the bodies\nSensors 2018, 18, 1487\n18 of 20\nof evidence, which\
    \ was effective to handle the conﬂicting pieces of evidence in a multi-sensor\n\
    environment. A numerical example was illustrated to show the feasibility and effectiveness\
    \ of the\nproposal. In addition, applications in data classiﬁcation and motor\
    \ rotor fault diagnosis were presented\nto validate the practicability of the\
    \ proposed method, where it outperformed the related methods with\nbetter accuracy.\n\

    SECTION I. Introduction Sensor fusion involves combining data from several sensors
    to obtain better information for perception. Humans and animals process multiple
    sensory data to reason and act and the same principle is applied in multi-sensor
    data fusion. Multi-sensor fusion combines data from different sensors into a common
    representation format [1], [2]. In developing robotic systems, multi-sensor fusion
    plays a crucial role since interaction with the environment is instrumental in
    successful execution of the task. Significant applications of multi-sensor fusion
    can be found in applications such as mobile robots [2]–[5], defense systems (such
    as target tracking [2], [6]–[8]), medicine [9], [10], transportation systems [11],
    [12] and industry [13]–[15]. The motivation for sensor fusion is discussed in
    section II. Section III describes the various types of sensor fusion proposed
    in literature. The various topologies and models for sensor fusion is covered
    in sections IV and V. Sections VI, VII provide an overview of signal and decision
    level fusion. SECTION II. Motivation The main goal of multi-sensor fusion is to
    achieve better operation of the system using the collective information from all
    sensors. This is also referred to as the synergistic effect [16]–[18]. Combining
    the data from a single sensor at different time intervals can also produce this
    effect [18]. In order to have better spatial and temporal coverage multiple sensors
    can be used. Also, with multiple sensors there is increased estimation accuracy
    and fault-tolerance [18]. SECTION III. Sensor Fusion Categories Depending upon
    the sensor configuration, there are three main categories of sensor fusion: Complementary,
    Competitive and Co-operative [19]. These are described below as follows: A. Complementary
    In this method, each sensor provides data about different aspects or attributes
    of the environment. By combining the data from each of the sensors we can arrive
    at a more global view of the environment or situation. Since there is no dependency
    between the sensors combining the data is relatively easy [19], [20]. B. Competitive
    In this method, as the name suggests, several sensors measure the same or similar
    attributes. The data from several sensors is used to determine the overall value
    for the attribute under measurement. The measurements are taken independently
    and can also include measurements at different time instants for a single sensor.
    This method is useful in fault tolerant architectures to provide increased reliability
    of the measurement [19], [20]. C. Co-Operative When the data from two or more
    independent sensors in the system is required to derive information, then co-operative
    sensor networks are used since a sensor individually cannot give the required
    information regarding the environment. A common example is stereoscopic vision
    [19], [20]. Several other types of sensor networks exist such as corroborative,
    concordant, redundant etc [18]. Most of them are derived from the above mentioned
    sensor fusion categories. Dasarthy [21], [22] classified sensor fusion types depending
    upon the input/output characteristics. Figure 1 [21], shows the various sensor
    fusion types. Only a few combinations are allowed in Dasarthy''s scheme for the
    inputs and outputs. Fig. 1. Dasarthy''s classification of multi-sensor fusion
    [21]. Show All SECTION IV. Sensor Fusion Topologies There are different topologies
    namely, Centralized, Decentralized and Hybrid [18], [20], [23], [24]. Each of
    these is described as follows: A. Centralized Architecture In this architecture,
    a single node handles the fusion process. The sensors undergo preprocessing before
    they are sent to the central node for the fusion process to take place. Figure
    2 shows a typical centralized architecture [18], [20]. B. Decentralized Architecture
    In this architecture, each of the sensor processes data at its node and there
    is no need for a global or central node. Since the information is processed individually
    at the node, it is used in applications that are large and widespread such as
    huge automated plants, spacecraft health monitoring etc. [20]. Figure 3 shows
    a typical decentralized architecture [18], [20]. C. Hierarchical Architecture
    This architecture is a combination of both centralized and distributed type. When
    there are constraints on the system such as a requirement of less computational
    workload or limitations on the communication bandwidth, distributed scheme can
    be enabled. Centralized fusion can be used when higher accuracy is necessary [20],
    [23]. A simple comparison between the centralized and decentralized topologies
    is shown below in Table I [18], [20]. SECTION V. Multi Sensor Fusion Models The
    application that uses the sensor fusion plays a vital role in determining the
    type of architecture. Hence there is no specific model or architecture that is
    definitive for all applications [25]–[27]. In this section, the two most widely
    used architectures namely, the JDL Fusion architecture and the Waterfall Fusion
    Process Model are discussed. A. Jdl Fusion Architecture JDL stands for the US
    Joint Directors of Laboratories that was established under the guidance of Department
    of Defense and was proposed in 1985. The JDL model is functionality dependent
    and can be customized depending on the application. Varieties of applications
    from sensor networks to human robot interface can be implemented using this model
    [20]. Fig. 2. Centralized topology [23]. Show All Fig. 3. Decentralized topology
    [23]. Show All Table I. Centralized and decentralized topologies [18], [20] The
    model uses five levels for data processing and a database. These components can
    communicate through a bus interface [20], [24], [26]. The JDL model is shown in
    Figure 4 [24], [26]. These levels could be executed sequentially or concurrently
    during the application. Sources, in the JDL model can consist of sensor data or
    data given by the user such as user input, reference data or geographical data.
    The Man-Machine Interaction block, as the name suggests, enables the user to interact
    with the system through user command, reports etc. Furthermore, this block helps
    in providing alert messages and could use multimedia tools such as displays, sounds
    etc. to achieve communication with the user. The Source Pre-Processing also referred
    to as Level 0, performs pre-screening of data and then allocates it to the appropriate
    process [24], [26]. In the Object Refinement or Level 1, the following operations
    are performed namely, alignment of data using frame transformation, data association,
    tracking and estimation of the current and future position of the object. Also,
    Level 1 can be considered to be composed of kinematic and identity fusion [20].
    In kinematic fusion, the velocity, acceleration of the object is determined. In
    identity fusion, the type of the object such as aircraft or missile is determined
    using parametric estimation [20], [24]. After processing the data from Level 1,
    based on the situation the contextual relationship is determined between the event
    and the object under observation. This process of refinement is called as Situation
    Refinement or Level 2. Depending on the a priori data and the future situation
    prediction inferences are drawn in Level 3 or Threat Refinement. The inferences
    are used to identify the vulnerabilities and the opportunities for the operation.
    This level uses game theoretic techniques [24]. Process Refinement or Level 4
    deals with monitoring the system performance (handles real time constraints) and
    sensor allocation to satisfy mission objectives and goals. This level does not
    perform data processing operations and uses sensor management techniques [20],
    [24], [26]. The Database Management System helps monitor, update, add and provide
    information to the fusion process [20], [24], [26]. Although the JDL model helps
    in basic understanding of the sensor fusion process it is data centric and hence
    hard to extend or reuse the applications based on this model. It is abstract and
    interpretation could be difficult [24], [26]. Table II [24] highlights the summary
    of various components used in JDL model. Fig. 4. JDL fusion model [24], [26].
    Show All Table II. Summary of JDL process components [24]. B. Waterfall Fusion
    Process Model The Waterfall fusion process model (WFFM) deals with the low level
    processing of data and is shown in Figure 5 [24], [28]. The Waterfall model has
    a lot of common features as the JDL model. The processing stages of the Waterfall
    models relate to the levels of the JDL model [24], [26], [28] and the comparison
    is shown in Table III. However, similar to the JDL model the Waterfall fusion
    model is abstract and doesn''t have feedback between the stages. It is an acyclic
    model. The modified WFFM is described in [20] that provides for some feedback
    between the stages. This modified model is action oriented and has the provision
    for control loop action or feedback loop as shown in Figure 6 [20]. Several other
    fusion models exist such as the Omnibus model [29], Boyd or OODA model [30], LAAS
    Architecture [31]. Fig. 5. Waterfall fusion process model [28]. Show All Fig.
    6. Modified waterfall fusion model [20]. Show All Table III. JDL and waterfall
    fusion models [24], [26], [28] SECTION VI. Signal Level Fusion In signal level
    fusion, data from multiple sources (sensors) are combined to obtain better quality
    data and higher understanding of the environment being observed. Signal level
    fusion often has either or both of the following goals: Obtain a higher quality
    version of the input signals i.e. higher signal to noise ratio [32]. Sensor measurements
    from several sensors which have same physical properties are combined to determine
    the parameter being measured, more accurately [18]. This minimizes and sometimes
    eliminates any uncertainty or inaccurate predictions caused by measurements from
    faulty sensors, measurement noise and state noise. F or instance, readings from
    multiple temperature sensors in close proximity in a given space can be used for
    this kind of fusion. Obtain a feature or mid-level information about the system
    that a single measuring node cannot reveal. A feature is the first stage in understanding
    the state of the environment that helps the system in formulating a decision.
    Heterogeneous sensors are often employed for this process. For instance, signals
    from radar and images from camera are used in target recognition [24]. For sensor
    data to undergo signal level fusion, it is essential to condition the signals
    in the signal preprocessing phase. The signals have to be in a common representation
    format [18]. The stages involved in this process, as shown in Figure 7, include
    but not limited to: Signal alignment, normalization and scaling [18]. There are
    several methods by which signal level fusion can be achieved. The choice of method
    depends on various factors like the scenario and type of application, type of
    data or signal, relationship between the data or the state representation of the
    system. Fig. 7. Common representation format functions [18]. Show All The following
    are some of the commonly used signal fusion methodologies: A. Weighted Averaging
    Signal fusion can be achieved by taking an average of the various sensor signals
    measuring a particular parameter of the environment. If signals from some sensors
    can be trusted more than the other, a higher weight is assigned to that sensor
    to increase its contribution towards the fused signal. The confidence level is
    a function of variance of the sensor signal. [32] x fused = ∑ i=0 n w i x i (1)
    View Source where, wi = f(variance) B. Kalman Filter The Kalman filter method
    is a common adaptive method of sensor fusion to remove redundancy in the system
    and to predict the state of the system. This is a linear model and the current
    state of the system is dependent on the previous state. The system is represented
    by the following state-space model: x(k)=F x(k−1)+B u+G w z(k)=H x(k)+v View Source
    where, x: state vector, F: state transition matrix, B: Input transition matrix,
    u: Input vector, G: Process noise transition matrix, w: process noise vector,
    H: Measurement matrix, v: measurement noise vector. The covariance matrices of
    wand v are Q(k) and R(k) respectively. There are two phases of state estimation
    with Kalman filter: Predict Phase x ^ k =A  x ^ k−1 +B  u k (2) P k =A  P k−1  A
    T (3) View Source Update Phase K k = P k C T (C P k C T +R ) −1 x ^ k = x ^ k
    + K k ( z k −C x ^ k ) P k =(1− K k C) P k (4) (5) (6) View Source where, P: estimation
    covariance, K: Kalman gain In the update or correction phase, the estimate from
    the predict phase is updated with the observation. If there are two sensors and
    both of them sending data simultaneously, then Z = [z1, z2]. If the sensors are
    sending data one after the other, then the reading from first sensor can be used
    as a priori information before observation from second sensor is used to update
    the prediction. [32] C. Track to Track Fusion Track to track fusion methodology
    has local tracks generated by distinct local sensors. Then at a central node the
    tracks are fused as shown in Figure 8 [33]. The local track can be individual
    Kalman filter nodes that provide state estimation at the local track level. These
    states are then fused into a state vector that has combined information from all
    the local sensor nodes. Sometimes, this new estimate is sent as feedback to the
    local sensor nodes. The new state estimate is obtained by the following formula
    [33]. X ^ k|k = x ^ 1 k|k + [ P 1 k|k − P 12 k|k I P 1 k|k + P 2 k|k + P 12 k|k
    + P 21 k|k ] −1 ( x ^ 2 k|k − x ^ 1 k|k ) (7) View Source where, P m k|k is the
    error covariance matrix of the corresponding state estimation x ∧ m k|k . P 12
    k|k is the cross covariance matrix of the two state vectors where P 12 k|k =(
    P 12 k|k ) T . P 12klk is defined by the following equation: P 12  k|k =(1− K
    1 k H 1 k ) F k−1 P 12 k−1|k−1 F r k−1 (1− K 2 k H 2 k ) +(1− K 1 k H 1 k μ k−1
    Q k−1 G T k−1 (1− K 2 k H 2 k ) T (8) View Source This configuration can be extended
    for multiple sensors. A modified track-to-track fusion and three fusion algorithm
    are explained in detail in [33]. There are other ways to define the track fusion
    algorithm such as taking confidence weighted averaging of the tracks based on
    variance [33]. D. Neural Networks An artificial neural network consists of interconnection
    of processing nodes called neurons. There is a pattern of interconnection between
    the neuronal layers that are weighted and the learning process that updates these
    weights. Data fusion models can be established using neural networks such that
    neurons and interconnecting weights are assigned based on the relationship between
    the multi-sensor data input and the signal output. The neural networks can be
    multilayer feed-forward or recurrent type. [34] Unlike Kalman filters, neural
    networks offer non-linear transfer functions and parallel processing capabilities.
    This can help in performing image fusion. Figure 9 shows a basic structure of
    three layer neural network with nonlinear mapping. Fig. 8. Track to track fusion
    architecture [33]. Show All Fig. 9. Neural network structure for sensor fusion
    [34]. Show All The fused output is a combination of input signal and corresponding
    weights calculated by the equation [34]: y= ∑ i=0 n w i x i (9) View Source where,
    wi is the weight; Xi is the sensor data. Several fusion methodologies are used
    and depending on the input and outputs required the stages in the model can perform
    either signal, feature or decision level fusion. These methods are either used
    as standalone or can be combined with aforementioned signal fusion methods. The
    probabilistic approach for sensor fusion includes the use of joint probability
    distributions and Gaussian distributions [38]. Other fusion methods include Bayesian,
    least-squares for feature extraction [39] and some statistical approaches. [18],
    [32], [40]. In [35]–[37] the authors explain various approaches for modeling sensor
    fusion architecture using neural networks. SECTION VII. Decision Level Fusion
    Also known as Symbol level fusion, the decision level fusion combines several
    sub-decisions or features to yield a final or higher decision that can be used
    to take an action. Symbol could be an input decision. In this case, fusion of
    symbolic information insists the use of reasoning and inference while handling
    uncertainty. Symbol level fusion increases the confidence or truth value and is
    considered as decision fusion [41], [42]. Identity and Knowledge based methods
    form the two categories of decision fusion [20], [42]. Table IV [20], [42] lists
    few of the decision fusion methods or Al techniques for each category. One of
    the most widely used decision or inference method is Dempster-Shafer theory (D-S
    theory). This method is very useful for human-robot interaction based applications
    [41], [42], [45], [46]. We describe in detail the D-S theory in the following
    sub-section followed by a comparison with Bayesian inference which is another
    widely used decision fusion technique. A. Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence D-S
    theory is a generalization of the probability theory [41], [43]–[45]. In this
    method, a frame of discernment Ω is defined which is set of elementary hypotheses:
    Ω={ a i },i=1,…,n (10) View Source Table IV. Decision fusion models [20], [42]
    The sum of the mass function of all hypotheses is one. Belief function is used
    to express inaccurate beliefs. Mass values are assigned to the elements of the
    power set 2 Ω of the frame of discernment which hold the following properties:
    belief(null)=0 View Source belief (hypothesis) = Sum of all mass functions for
    all evidence to support the proposition. The confidence interval is upper-bounded
    by the plausibility value to include all observations that don''t rule out the
    proposition supported by the corresponding belief function. In order to combine
    two mass functions m1 and m2 the Dempster-Shafer theory defines the following
    rule [43], [44]: m 1 ⊕ m 2 (∅)=0 m 1 ⊕ m 2 (H)= ∑ X∩Y=H m 1 (X) m 2 (Y) 1− ∑ X∩Y=∅
    m 1 (X) m 2 (Y) (11) (12) View Source B. Dempster-Shafer and Bayesian Fusion Comparison
    Although both these methods are widely used in inference engines there are few
    differences between them [42], [46]. The main difference being the concept of
    support and plausibility to define uncertainty limits in Dempster-Shafer [42]–[44]
    which is not found in Bayesian inference. D-S theory is an evidential reasoning
    method where belief masses can be assigned to elements and sets, and on sets of
    sets [42]. Capturing ignorance or uncertainty is another strong feature of evidential
    reasoning methods which is not achievable in probabilistic methods. It is not
    necessary to have a prori probabilities and data is provided only at the time
    when sensor reads them [42], [46] during observation. Dempster-Shafer theory of
    evidence finds widespread use in human-robot interactive (HRI) applications. A
    review of a few applications of HRI can be found in [47]. By using the power set
    as the frame of discernment beliefs can well represented. However, when the set
    is continuous the number of subsets cannot be measured and hence this is a significant
    limitation that is found in evidential reasoning methods [41], [42] that work
    well with discrete sets. In our current research, we are working on a sensor fusion
    framework for robotic vehicle navigation in an unknown terrain. The framework
    is similar to waterfall fusion model and uses track to track fusion and Dempster-Shafer
    theory of evidence for signal and decision level fusions. SECTION VIII. Conclusion

    \ as the key technology for uncertain data fusion, is the core to obtain reasonable\
    \ multisensor\ninformation fusion results. DS evidence theory is a typical and\
    \ widely applicable decision-making method. However, DS evidence\ntheory makes\
    \ decisions without considering the sensors’ difference, which may lead to illogical\
    \ results. In this paper, we present\na novel decision-making algorithm for uncertain\
    \ fusion based on grey relation and DS evidence theory. The proposed algorithm\n\
    comprehensively takes consideration of sensor’s credibility and evidence’s overall\
    \ discriminability, which can solve the uncertainty\nproblems caused by inconsistence\
    \ of sensors themselves and complexity of monitoring environment and simultaneously\
    \ ensure the\nvalidity and accuracy of fusion results. The innovative decision-making\
    \ algorithm firstly obtains the sensor’s credibility through the\nintroduction\
    \ of grey relation theory and then defines two impact factors as sensor’s credibility\
    \ and evidence’s overall discriminability\naccording to the focal element analyses\
    \ and evidence’s distance analysis, respectively; after that, it uses the impact\
    \ factors to modify\nthe evidences and finally gets more reasonable and effective\
    \ results through DS combination rule. Simulation results and analyses\ndemonstrate\
    \ that the proposed algorithm can overcome the trouble caused by large evidence\
    \ conflict and one-vote veto, which\nindicates that it can improve the ability\
    \ of target judgment and enhance precision of uncertain data fusion. Thus the\
    \ novel decision-\nmaking method has a certain application value.\n1. Introduction\n\
    In practical applications, single sensor is difficult to meet\nthe requirements\
    \ like target accuracy and identification\nperformance. Thus, there is a broad\
    \ application of decision-\nmaking algorithm on data fusion about target’s attributes,\n\
    characteristics, and types through comprehensive processing\nof information obtained\
    \ from multisensor. Currently, data\ndecision-making technology [1–3] based on\
    \ multisensor is\nhighly valued by scholars at home and abroad. In addition,\n\
    a lot of theorems and algorithms emerge in the area of\ndata decision-making.\
    \ However, due to constraints on the\nattributes as well as the types of data,\
    \ there is still no unified\ntheoretical framework or unique algorithm for classification\n\
    issue of multisensor data decision-making.\nFor multisensor decision-making field,\
    \ the traditional\nalgorithms are statistical method [4], empirical reasoning\
    \ [5],\nvoting method [6], Bayesian inference [7], template method\n[5], and adaptive\
    \ neural network [8], among others. These\ntypical methods all can settle the\
    \ decision fusion of multisen-\nsor information to some extent, whereas they all\
    \ have some\ndefects. Statistical method, empirical reasoning, and voting\nmethod\
    \ are too simple to achieve the reliable decision results\nfor multisensor information\
    \ fusion. Bayesian inference needs\nthe prior knowledge of environment to finish\
    \ the reasoning,\nwhich cannot be guaranteed in actual applications. And\ntemplate\
    \ method would waste time and energy of system\nwhen selecting the suitable template\
    \ according to certain\nrules. Although adaptive neural network can fulfill a\
    \ reason-\nable decision fusion, it is usually not adopted in practical\napplications\
    \ because of its large computation complexity. DS\nevidence theory [9, 10] is\
    \ favored for its ability of dealing with\nuncertainty, integration of measurement\
    \ information, and\nreasonable theoretical derivation. Thus, DS evidence theory\n\
    has become the mainstream method in multisensor decision-\nmaking field.\nAs a\
    \ wildly used decision-making algorithm for uncertain\ndata fusion, DS evidence\
    \ theory is able to deal with the uncer-\ntainty and imprecision of multisensor\
    \ information fusion.\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\nJournal of Sensors\nVolume\

    2\nJournal of Sensors\nHence, DS evidence theory can properly handle the incon-\n\
    sistency of sensor conditions and complexity of monitoring\nenvironment. With\
    \ its introduction and perfection put for-\nward by Dempster and Shafer, respectively,\
    \ DS evidence the-\nory occupies a lot in the development of intelligent computing\n\
    and identification theory for multisensor information fusion.\nAlong with its\
    \ development, DS evidence theory has been\nwidely applied in various fields,\
    \ like pattern recognition [11],\ntarget identification [12], cognitive radio\
    \ network [13], fault\ndiagnosis [14], signal recognition [15], and decision-making\n\
    [16], among others. Although there are some problems of\nDS evidence theory itself,\
    \ these problems can be effectively\nsolved through rigorous theoretical derivation,\
    \ scientific\nimprovements, and combination with other methods. For\nexample,\
    \ a new entropy, named as Deng entropy, is proposed\nin [17] to handle the uncertain\
    \ measure of BPA, which is\nthe generalization of Shannon entropy. The new entropy\n\
    provides a promising way to measure the uncertainty of\nmultisensor fusion system.\
    \ Besides, Deng entropy is applied\nin [18] to realize the measurement of information\
    \ volume\nof the evidence. This improvement makes the application\nof DS evidence\
    \ theory with more validity and robustness.\nDue to limit space, the classic modified\
    \ methods [19–31]\nare exhibited in references and partially taken as compared\n\
    methods in Section 5.2.\nIn this paper, systematic research is implemented on\n\
    DS evidence theory, and the multisensor decision-making\nalgorithm is realized\
    \ by the combination of DS evidence\ntheory and grey relation analysis [32, 33].\
    \ The proposed\ndecision-making algorithm for uncertain data fusion firstly\n\
    utilizes sensors’ report generator to settle the acquisition\nprocessing of sensor’s\
    \ credibility by the introduction of grey\nrelation theory. Then, the sensor’s\
    \ credibility is consecutively\nadjusted by two different processes of consistency\
    \ and conflict\nanalysis in focal elements. At the same time, the novel method\n\
    defines the evidence’s overall discriminability according to\nthe concept of evidence’s\
    \ distance function. Finally, the\noriginal evidences are modified by two impact\
    \ factors as\nsensor’s credibility and evidence’s overall discriminability,\n\
    which can ensure getting more reasonable and effective\ndecision-making results\
    \ after evidences combine.\nThis paper is organized as follows. The theoretical\
    \ theo-\nrem and derivation of DS evidence theory and grey relation\ntheory are\
    \ briefly introduced in the next section. And the\nimplementation diagram and\
    \ flow chart of uncertain data\nfusion system are given in Section 3. Then, Section\
    \ 4 high-\nlights the implementation method and specific steps of the\nnew decision-making\
    \ algorithm for uncertain data fusion,\nand Section 5 presents the simulation\
    \ results and comparative\nanalyses. Concluding remarks are given in the last\
    \ section of\nthis paper.\n2. Theoretical Foundations\nDS evidence theory and\
    \ grey relation theory are separately\npresented in this section, which are the\
    \ foundations of the\nnovel decision-making algorithm in this paper.\n2.1. DS\
    \ Evidence Theory. DS evidence theory, also called\nDempster-Shafer theory, is\
    \ an effective data decision-making\nmethod to deal with the uncertainty of multisensor\
    \ infor-\nmation fusion system. Relative to probability theory [5], DS\nevidence\
    \ theory can settle imprecise data and has a more\nextensive application area.\
    \ Similar to Bayesian inference [7],\nDS evidence theory uses the prior probability\
    \ to represent the\nevidence interval of posterior probability, which can quantify\n\
    the credible degree and plausibility degree of propositions. DS\nevidence theory\
    \ is briefly comprised by the following four key\npoints.\n2.1.1. Frame of Discernment\
    \ and the Power Set. In DS model,\nthe frame of discernment (FoD) denoted by Θ\
    \ indicates a set\nof \U0001D441 mutually exclusive and exhaustive hypotheses,\
    \ which\nrepresents all interested propositions. And FoD is defined as\nthe form\
    \ of function set as\nΘ = {\U0001D43B1, \U0001D43B2, . . . , \U0001D43B\U0001D441\
    } = {\U0001D43B\U0001D456 | \U0001D456 = 1, 2, . . . , \U0001D441} ,\n(1)\nwhere\
    \ \U0001D43B\U0001D456 is the \U0001D456th hypothesis belonging to Θ and \U0001D441\
    \ is the\nnumber of hypotheses.\nOn the basis of FoD, we can derive 2Θ as the\
    \ power set,\nwhich is composed of 2\U0001D441 propositions of Θ (all subsets\
    \ of\nFoD).\n2Θ = {0, {\U0001D43B1} , {\U0001D43B2} , . . . , {\U0001D43B\U0001D441\
    } , {\U0001D43B1, \U0001D43B2} , {\U0001D43B1, \U0001D43B3} , . . . ,\n{\U0001D43B\
    1, \U0001D43B\U0001D441} , . . . , {\U0001D43B1, \U0001D43B2, . . . , \U0001D43B\
    \U0001D441}} ,\n(2)\nwhere 0 is the empty set, which belongs to any propositions.\n\
    2.1.2. Basic Probability Assignment. The basic probability\nassignment (BPA) is\
    \ a mass function \U0001D45A : 2Θ → [0, 1] defined\non 2Θ, which should satisfy\
    \ the following demands:\n\U0001D45A (0) = 0,\n∑\n\U0001D434⊆Θ\n\U0001D45A (\U0001D434\
    ) = 1,\n(3)\n∀\U0001D434 ∈ 2Θ. \U0001D45A(\U0001D434) is called the mass function\
    \ of proposition\n\U0001D434 that represents the basic belief degree and initial\
    \ support\ndegree strictly assigned to proposition \U0001D434 [17].\nDue to the\
    \ lack of further knowledge, \U0001D45A(\U0001D434) cannot be\nsubdivided. Any\
    \ proposition satisfying that \U0001D45A(\U0001D434) > 0 (\U0001D434 ∈\n2Θ) is\
    \ called the focal element, and the set of all focal elements\nis named as the\
    \ core of BPA.\n2.1.3. Belief Function and Plausibility Function. DS evidence\n\
    theory designates two uncertain measurements as the belief\nfunction (Bel) and\
    \ plausibility function (Pl). Similar to the\ndefinition of BPA, Bel and Pl can\
    \ be defined, respectively, as\nBel (\U0001D434) = ∑\n\U0001D435⊆\U0001D434\n\U0001D45A\
    \ (\U0001D435) ,\n(4)\nPl (\U0001D434) =\n∑\n\U0001D435∩\U0001D434 ̸=0\n\U0001D45A\

    \ ∈ 2Θ, where Bel(\U0001D434) is interpreted as the low probability\nof \U0001D434\
    , while Pl(\U0001D434) is interpreted as the upper probability of\n\U0001D434\
    . The relationship between Bel(\U0001D434) and Pl(\U0001D434) is derived as\n\
    follows:\nBel (\U0001D434) ≤ Pl (\U0001D434) ,\nPl (\U0001D434) = 1 − Bel (\U0001D434\
    ) ,\n(6)\nwhere \U0001D434 is the complement set of \U0001D434.\nAccording to\
    \ the relationship between Bel(\U0001D434) and Pl(\U0001D434),\nDS evidence theory\
    \ also divides the evidence interval into\nsupporting interval, uncertainty interval,\
    \ and rejecting inter-\nval, which are shown in Figure 1.\nThe interval [Bel(\U0001D434\
    ), Pl(\U0001D434)] is named the uncertainty\ninterval, which represents the uncertainty\
    \ and imprecision of\nmultisensor fusion system.\nThe concept of uncertainty interval\
    \ is similar to prob-\nability, but not entirely expressed as probability. The\
    \ inter-\nval makes the proposition possibly real; that is, it does\nnot directly\
    \ support or reject the proposition. That feature\ndemonstrates that DS evidence\
    \ theory needs weaker axiom\nthan probability theory and can represent the difference\n\
    between uncertainty and unknown of proposition [9]. Thus,\nDS evidence theory\
    \ is the generalization of probability theory\nand is an effective solution method\
    \ when the prior knowledge\nis absent.\n2.1.4. DS Combination Rule. DS evidence\
    \ theory provides a\nuseful evidence combination function. Suppose that there\n\
    are 2 independent and not completely conflict evidences that\nexist on the same\
    \ FoD in system; we can get a synthesis\nsupport degree for propositions by DS\
    \ combination rule. The\ncombination rule can be computed by the orthogonal sum\
    \ of\ntheir mass functions; that is,\n\U0001D45A (\U0001D434) = [\U0001D45A1 ⊕\
    \ \U0001D45A2] (\U0001D434)\n=\n1\n1 − \U0001D458\n∑\n\U0001D434\U0001D456∩\U0001D435\
    \U0001D457=\U0001D434\n\U0001D45A1 (\U0001D434\U0001D456) ⋅ \U0001D45A2 (\U0001D435\
    \U0001D457) ,\n(7)\n∀\U0001D434 ∈ 2Θ, where ⊕ represents the orthogonal sum operator.\
    \ \U0001D458\nis the global conflict factor, which demonstrates the conflict\n\
    degree between \U0001D45A1 and \U0001D45A2:\n\U0001D458 = 1 −\n∑\n\U0001D434\U0001D456\
    ∩\U0001D435\U0001D457=0\n\U0001D45A1 (\U0001D434\U0001D456) ⋅ \U0001D45A2 (\U0001D435\
    \U0001D457) .\n(8)\nIf \U0001D458 is close to 0, 2 evidences are on the verge\
    \ of\nconformity. While \U0001D458 is close to 1, 2 evidences are totally\nconflict.\
    \ The denominator 1/(1−\U0001D458) is the normalization factor\nwhich ensures\
    \ that (3) are contented.\nThe equations and properties of DS combination rules\n\
    based on 2 evidences are exhibited here; readers can deduce\nthe equations and\
    \ properties of multiple evidences’ synthesis\nwith similar principle.\nObviously,\
    \ the DS combination rule satisfies both com-\nmutative law and associate law.\n\
    \U0001D45A1 ⊕ \U0001D45A2 = \U0001D45A2 ⊕ \U0001D45A1,\n(\U0001D45A1 ⊕ \U0001D45A\
    2) ⊕ \U0001D45A3 = \U0001D45A1 ⊕ (\U0001D45A2 ⊕ \U0001D45A3) .\n(9)\n2.2. Grey\
    \ Relation Theory. Grey relation theory [34] is the\nquantity processing and ordering\
    \ procedure of systems with\nincomplete information or uncertain data. It can\
    \ be seen\nas a global analysis of system. Since appropriate reference\nis essential\
    \ to obtain reasonable sensor credibility result, a\ncertain sensor is used as\
    \ a comparative standard to determine\nthe credibility degree of multisensor [35].\n\
    2.2.1. Grey Relation Factor. Grey relation factor is the basis of\ngrey relation\
    \ analysis [32]. The space of Grey relation factors is\ndetermined by sequence\
    \ that has properties as comparability,\naccessibility, and extreme consistency.\n\
    Suppose that the sequences of system are \U0001D465\U0001D456 = [\U0001D465\U0001D456\
    (1),\n\U0001D465\U0001D456(2), . . . , \U0001D465\U0001D456(\U0001D45B)], \U0001D456\
    \ = 0, 1, 2, . . . , \U0001D45A, where \U0001D4650 is the reference\nsequence\
    \ and \U0001D465\U0001D456, \U0001D456 = 1, 2, . . . , \U0001D45A, is the comparison\
    \ sequence.\n\U0001D6FE(\U0001D4650(\U0001D458), \U0001D465\U0001D456(\U0001D458\
    )) represents the comparison measurement of \U0001D4650\nand \U0001D465\U0001D456\
    \ at the \U0001D458th point in grey relation factors’ space. Then we\ndefine the\
    \ grey relation factor of \U0001D465\U0001D456 as \U0001D6FE(\U0001D4650, \U0001D465\
    \U0001D456), which is the\naverage value of \U0001D6FE(\U0001D4650(\U0001D458\
    ), \U0001D465\U0001D456(\U0001D458)) at all points. Hence, the degree\nof grey\
    \ relation factor is defined as\n\U0001D6FE (\U0001D465\U0001D456, \U0001D465\
    0) = 1\n\U0001D45B\n\U0001D45B\n∑\n\U0001D458=1\n\U0001D6FE (\U0001D4650 (\U0001D458\

    The modification of evidences takes full advantage of\nsensor’s credibility and\
    \ real-time information provided by\nsensors to ameliorate evidences. If one modified\
    \ evidence\nhas zero focal element, we choose to delete the evidence\nand replace\
    \ it with the average of other evidences. This\nprocedure will not only guarantee\
    \ a reasonable fusion results,\nbut also effectively avoid the occurrence of one-vote\

    \ into two parts. One is the experiment\npreparation that discusses the value\

    \ of the new decision-\nmaking method.\n5.1. Experiment Preparation. Prior to\
    \ the experiment, the\nanalysis about the accurate expression of evidences’ conflict\n\
    and the selection of the regulatory factor are described in this\nsection.\n5.1.1.\

    \ average\nconflict coefficient \U0001D458∗ in the novel method is shown in\n\
    Figure 4.\nIt is obvious in Figure 4 that \U0001D458 in DS evidence theory is\n\
    getting larger along with the increasing of evidences’ number.\nHowever, the acquisition\
    \ of evidences is the processing to\nget support for propositions, not the processing\
    \ to get more\nconflict. Thus, \U0001D458 is not able to accurately represent\
    \ the conflict\nsituation. However, \U0001D458∗ in the novel method is the effective\n\
    expression of actual evidences’ conflict. Thus, Figure 4 indi-\nrectly illustrates\
    \ the rationality of the new decision-making\nmethod.\n5.1.2. Analysis of the\
    \ Regulatory Factor. During the consec-\nutive adjustments of sensor’s credibility,\
    \ there is an indis-\npensable index as the regulatory factor \U0001D6FC. To analyze\
    \ the\nnumerical selection of \U0001D6FC, statistical methods are adopted. As\n\

    \ increasing of\nthe regulatory factor \U0001D6FC, sensor’s credibility gradually\
    \ tends to\nbe stable. It proves that the perfect regulatory factor can be\nconfirmed.\n\
    In order to further reflect the numerical range of \U0001D6FC,\nthe number of\
    \ sensors is increased to finish the simulation.\nFigure 6 shows the relationship\
    \ of sensor’s credibility and the\nregulatory factor with 4 evidences.\nFrom Figure\

    \ such as high conflict and one-vote veto and\nulteriorly realizing uncertain\
    \ data fusion correctly.\nAssume that FoD is Θ = {\U0001D434, \U0001D435, \U0001D436\
    }, where \U0001D434, \U0001D435, \U0001D436 are\nmutually exclusive. The standard\
    \ and reference sensor’s judg-\nment value is \U0001D45A0 = {0.5, 0.3, 0.2}.\n\
    Four groups of sensor’s judgment values obtained by mul-\ntisensor data fusion\
    \ system and the corresponding sensor’s\ncredibility are shown in Table 2.\nIt\
    \ is checked in Table 2 that the commonsensical fusion\nresult should give proposition\
    \ \U0001D434 the largest support as two\nsensors with big credibility both support\
    \ proposition \U0001D434 to a\ngreat extent. With similar principle, proposition\
    \ \U0001D436 in fusion\nresult should own the minimum support.\nThe data fusion\
    \ of 4 sensors is divided into 3 steps.\nAnd we take 12 common improved methods\
    \ in [20–31]\nas the compared algorithms. These methods are separately\nabbreviated\
    \ as LIU [20], YAGER [21], GUO [22], LI [23], TAN\n[24], CHENG [25], CHEN [26],\
    \ HE [27], YE [28], YAO [29],\nFLOREA [30], and MURPHY [31].\nFirstly, the data\
    \ fusion of sensor 1 and sensor 2 is achieved\nand the result is shown in Table\
    \ 3.\nFrom Table 3, we can see that all methods give proposition\n\U0001D434 the\
    \ largest support except GUO, which demonstrates that\nGUO makes the wrong decision.\
    \ Moreover, CHENG, CHEN,\nand FLOREA allocate Θ a lot of support, which is not\n\
    conducive to final judgment. Concerning method YE, the\nfusion result is averagely\
    \ allocated to each proposition, in\nwhich the support to proposition \U0001D436\

    LIU, YAGER, LI, TAN, HE, YAO, and MURPHY offer\nproposition A the largest support,\
    \ the numerical difference\nof support to propositions \U0001D434 and \U0001D435\
    \ is too tiny to facilitate\ndecision-making fusion. Thus, only the improved method\
    \ can\nget the proper fusion result.\nIn addition, sensor 3 is added in uncertain\
    \ data fusion\nto strengthen effectiveness validation of the new decision-\nmaking\
    \ method. Table 4 is the fusion result of 3 sensors.\nAs can be seen from Table\
    \ 2, sensor 3 is significantly\ndifferent from others which leads to high conflict,\
    \ and the\nsupport to proposition \U0001D434 is zero which leads to zero focal\n\
    element. In view of the particularity properties of sensor\n3, we can see in Table\
    \ 4 that one-vote veto phenomenon\nexists in YAGER, LI, TAN, CHEN, and HE. It\
    \ reveals that\nthe appearance of zero focal element directly deteriorates\nthe\
    \ fusion result. FLOREA still assigns a lot of support\nto Θ and increases the\
    \ uncertainty in fusion result. LIU,\nGUO, CHENG, YE, FLOREA, and MURPHY are unable\n\
    to reasonably handle zero focal element and utilize sensor’s\ncredibility. The\
    \ fusion results of them all give proposition\n\U0001D435 the excessive support\
    \ as the incorporation of sensor 3.\nThe proposed algorithm modifies the 3rd evidence\
    \ via taking\nsensor’s credibility into account as well as the overall situation\n\
    of all evidence’s discriminability, which reduces its influence\non fusion result.\
    \ Thus, in the fusion of 3 sensors, the proposed\nmethod is still the optimal\
    \ resolution for uncertain data\nfusion.\nFinally, in order to verify the priority\
    \ of the proposed\nmethod, evidence with relatively higher sensor credibility\
    \ is\nimported, and the data fusion is accomplished with 4 sensors.\nThe decision-making\
    \ processing is also completed, whose\nresult is displayed in Table 5. The threshold\
    \ values in decision-\nmaking rule are \U0001D7001 = 0.40 and \U0001D7002 = 0.15.\n\
    We can see from Table 5 that the occurrence of zero focal\nelement in sensor 3\
    \ seriously affects the data fusion. Even\nsensor 4 with large sensor’s credibility\
    \ supports proposition \U0001D434\nexplicitly, one-vote veto phenomenon still\
    \ exists in YAGER,\nLI, TAN, CHEN, and HE, and the decision fusions of LIU and\n\

    \ reflects that the\nproposed method makes the reliable and accurate decision\n\
    in comprehensive consideration of sensor’s credibility and\noverall evidence’s\

    \ multisensor information fusion is broadly applied in many\ncivil and military\
    \ areas, the valid decision-making method for\nuncertain information fusion is\
    \ under great attention. This\npaper raises a neoteric decision-making algorithm\
    \ based on\ngrey relation and DS evidence theory to solve the uncertainty\ncaused\
    \ by inconsistence of sensors itself and complexity of\nmonitoring environment.\
    \ The new algorithm is carried out\nwith three innovative treatments: generation\
    \ of sensor’s cred-\nibility based on grey relation theory, focal element analyses\n\
    as overall weighted factor analysis and proportional factor\nanalysis, and evidences’\
    \ overall discriminability processing.\nSimulation results and analyses show that\
    \ the proposed\nalgorithm can make precise decision without worrying about\nsensors’\
    \ unreliability and evidence’s high conflict. Thus, it\nhas great application\
    \ significance and excellent engineering\nprospect.\nIn further study, the decision-making\
    \ method for uncer-\ntain data fusion should pay close attention to relieve the\
    \ huge\ncomputation burden for system as the increasing number of\n10\nJournal\
    \ of Sensors\nsensors and try to realize the on-time and on-line decision-\nmaking\
    \ system.\nCompeting Interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict\

    Get rights and content Abstract Two ways of introducing spatial information in
    Dempster–Shafer evidence theory are examined: in the definition of the monosource
    mass functions, and, during data fusion. In the latter case, a “neighborhood”
    mass function is derived from the label image and combined with the “radiometric”
    masses, according to the Dempster orthogonal sum. The main advantage of such a
    combination law is to adapt the importance of neighborhood information to the
    level of radiometric missing information. The importance of introducing neighborhood
    information has been illustrated through the following application: forest area
    detection using radar and optical images showing a partial cloud cover. Previous

    images are mainly used for medical purposes in diagnoses, or to assist a surgeon
    [5–8]. Many studies have been carried out to take full use of such data [9], especially
    in the frame of statistical data analysis covering image classification, image
    segmentation and image change detection, all of which can be perceived as pixel
    labeling problems where one has to recover a label “field” from an observable
    image. In the probabilistic framework of this paper, the latter is considered
    as a noisy version of the label field. Show abstract A manifold learning approach

    for smart city data fusion. • Review the smart city applications data fusion techniques
    for each domain. • List down current research trend within sub-domains in the
    smart city. • Discuss future challenges for implementing data fusion in the smart
    city. Abstract The advancement of various research sectors such as Internet of
    Things (IoT), Machine Learning, Data Mining, Big Data, and Communication Technology
    has shed some light in transforming an urban city integrating the aforementioned
    techniques to a commonly known term - Smart City. With the emergence of smart
    city, plethora of data sources have been made available for wide variety of applications.
    The common technique for handling multiple data sources is data fusion, where
    it improves data output quality or extracts knowledge from the raw data. In order
    to cater evergrowing highly complicated applications, studies in smart city have
    to utilize data from various sources and evaluate their performance based on multiple
    aspects. To this end, we introduce a multi-perspectives classification of the
    data fusion to evaluate the smart city applications. Moreover, we applied the
    proposed multi-perspectives classification to evaluate selected applications in
    each domain of the smart city. We conclude the paper by discussing potential future
    direction and challenges of data fusion integration. Previous article in issue

    of thingsMulti-perspectives classification 1. Introduction According to UN estimates
    [1], 68% of the world population would be living in cities by 2050. Hence, managing
    the existing resources and infrastructure to cater sustainable urban living conditions
    for the growing needs of the urban population has become ever more challenging.
    Fortunately, the advancement in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT),
    Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Data Mining, and Data Fusion is gradually
    paving path for the emergence of smart cities [2], [3], [4]. In this paper, we
    adopt the following definition of smart city [5]: “A city combining ICT and Web
    2.0 technology with other organizational, design and planning efforts to de-materialize
    and speed up bureaucratic processes and help to identify new, innovative solutions
    to city management complexity, in order to improve sustainability and livability”
    The integration of aforementioned technologies into various urban domains enables
    city managers to equip with the necessary information for better planning and
    resource management. Several cities around the world have already been leveraging
    these technologies to improve the comfort, security, mobility, health, and well-being
    of their citizens. To better evaluate rapid progress and to recognize the efforts
    of urban planners, smart city ranking systems have been established. For instance,
    IESE cities in motion index [6] has suggested 83 indicators to rank 165 cities
    over 80 countries. New York, London, and Paris are the top three smart cities
    in 2018. Smart city projects in New York [7] aim to consistently improve the quality
    of residents’ life, reduce the environmental impacts, increase the street light
    efficiency, and enhance the water quality. Meanwhile, the focus of Smart London
    Projects [8] is to collect city wide data to provide world class connectivity,
    security, and smarter streets to its residents. Digital transformation, sustainability,
    and urbanization for improving citizen services are at the cores of Paris Smart
    City Projects [9]. The following up of the top smart city list includes Singapore
    and Tokyo, which are some other notable smart cities in the world. In Singapore,
    Smart Nation Project [10] has been proposed, which includes e-payment systems,
    smart nation sensor platform, smart urban mobility, and smart community initiatives,
    with the aim to enhance the national digital identity of its citizens. On the
    other hand, Tokyo [11] aims to become the greenest city in Asia Pacific by improving
    the transportation and other sectors of their economy. Local governments in several
    Chinese cities [12], such as, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Beijing are also
    shaping up their cities to facilitate economic and social development to build
    high income smart cities. In addition, there are several research institutes and
    laboratories focusing on developing smart city applications, which are currently
    leading the worldwide effort in smart domains. These include MIT Senseable Lab
    [13], Future Cities Laboratory [14], SINTEF Smart Cities [15], SMART [16], etc.
    Nowadays, communication technology is the backbone for the smart city applications
    as it provides a channel for applications to transfer data effortlessly. The ongoing
    quest for novel, more efficient, low-latency, and cost-effective communication
    technologies and networks, such as, 5G [27], [28], [29], wireless sensor networks
    (WSN) [30], [31], [32], Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) [33], [34], and Narrow
    Band IoT (NB-IoT) [35], [36] and their integration in smart city projects is also
    relentless. These advancement has made many data sources available due to the
    potential of sensors collecting data with better coverage and power efficiency
    of the communication platform. With the large amounts of data becoming readily
    available in a smart city, data mining techniques [37], [38] are commonly used
    in the collected data. It helps in identifying the essential and important data
    sources in the smart city applications such as monitoring, control, resource management,
    anomaly detection, etc. With the availability of parallel data sources in various
    smart city domains, data fusion techniques that combine multiple data sources,
    lie at the heart of smart city platform integration. The major objectives of data
    fusion are to address problematic data while enhancing the data reliability and
    extracting knowledge from multiple data sources. The existing survey papers related
    to smart city applications or data fusion classification are summarized in Table
    1. Majority of these review papers [18], [39], [40], [41] strictly focus on one
    particular smart city domain or one genre of classification perspective. In [19],
    Alam et al. have conducted a review on data fusion technique based on mathematical
    model in IoT environment. Alternately in [20], Wang et al. have described the
    frameworks of data fusion within the smart city application. Interested readers
    can follow these references for additional technical details. However, there is
    only a handful of limited work to provide a multi-perspectives approach for data
    fusion problems in smart cities and this literature gap further motivates our
    study. Table 1. Literature review for data fusion on smart city. Surveys Objectives
    and topics covered Khaledgi et al. [17] Provides insights on the different types
    of data fusion techniques by exploring their concept, benefits, and challenges.
    Castanedo [18] Provides an overall view on the different data fusion techniques
    and methods. The author also reviewed common algorithms such as data association,
    state estimation, and decision fusion. Alam et al. [19] Provides a comprehensive
    survey on the mathematical model used in data fusion for specific IoT environments.
    Wang et al. [20] Proposes an IoT architecture concept to survey on the different
    sensor data fusion techniques and also provides an overall view on their evaluation
    framework. Zheng [21] Discusses about differences on fusing sources and varying
    techniques for cross domain data fusion. El et al. [22] Provides a survey on the
    intelligent transportation systems, which use data fusion techniques. Esmaeilian,
    B. et al. [23] Provides a throughout study on waste management for smart city
    aspects with three categories: (1) infrastructure for the collection of product
    lifecycle data, (2) new adapting business model, and (3) waste upstream separation
    techniques. Da Xu et al. [24] Provides an overall view on the current state of
    the industries for IoT and discusses key enabling technologies such as communication
    platforms, sensing technologies, and services. Chen et al. [25] Reviews the building
    occupancy estimation and detection techniques while providing a comparison between
    different sensor types for cost, detection and estimation accuracy, and privacy
    issues. Qin and Gu [26] Introduces the data fusion algorithms in IoT domains and
    data acquisition characteristics. Therefore, a different perspective to look at
    data fusion in smart city domains is necessitated by the expanding scale and scope
    of data sources, data collection techniques, and data processing system architectures.
    In order to cater evergrowing highly complicated applications, studies in smart
    city have to utilize data from various sources and evaluate their performance
    based on multiple aspects. To this end, we propose multiple generic perspectives
    with the ability to cover the entire depth and breadth of data fusion problems
    in smart city. These perspectives include data fusion objectives, data fusion
    techniques, data input and data output types, data sources, data fusion scales,
    and platform architectures for data processing. Utilizing proposed perspectives,
    we provide an overall view of classification techniques found in the seven domains
    of smart city applications such as: Smart Living, Smart Urban Area Management,
    Smart Environment, Smart Industry, Smart Economics, Smart Human Mobility, and
    Smart Infrastructure. A simple illustration of seven application domains discussed
    in this paper can be found in the Fig. 1. In each domain, we only select notable
    papers to demonstrate the universality and effectiveness of our multi-perspective
    approach on evaluating the data fusion techniques. Please note that we do not
    provide a comprehensive review of all the smart city applications. Afterwards,
    we talk about emerging data fusion trends in smart cities, while outlining the
    best practices for deploying a smart city application. In addition, data fusion
    challenges in different smart city applications are also identified and discussed.

    (each domain is enclosed in the dotted pink box). To summarize, our novel contributions
    in this paper are three-fold as shown below: • We propose a multi-perspectives
    classification to evaluate common data fusion techniques in smart city applications.
    • We provide an overview of smart city application domains and discuss the common
    trend of data fusion techniques in each domain utilizing proposed multi-perspectives
    classification. • We list down the future challenges and the ideal scenario for
    deploying data fusion techniques in a smart city application. Overall, we believe
    that with these contributions, the readers would have a quick grasp on the current
    data fusion trends in smart city research without extensively going through all
    the details. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we define
    the data fusion classification using multi-perspectives to evaluate a smart city
    application. This lays a foundation for evaluating the smart city applications
    leveraging data fusion techniques. In Section 3, different application domains
    of smart city based on data fusion techniques are evaluated using the proposed
    multi-perspectives classification of data fusion. In addition, a brief overall
    view of the current research trend of respective domain is presented. Subsequently
    in Section 4, we discuss the ideal data fusion scenario along with potential research
    directions/opportunities based on speculations of smart city applications from
    previous section. Lastly, we conclude our works in Section 5. 2. Data fusion classification
    using multi-perspectives In this section, we identify multiple generic perspectives
    with the ability to cover the entire depth and breadth of data fusion literature
    in smart city applications. We use smart city single perspective data fusion review
    papers [19], [26] and non-smart city data fusion classification papers [18], [39],
    [40], [41] as references. In non-smart city literature, there are four well-known
    data fusion classification techniques, which are Dasarathy’s Classification [39],
    Whyte’s Classification [40], Fusion Architecture’s Classification [18], and US
    Joint Directories of Laboratories (JDL) data fusion classification [41]. Dasarathy’s
    Classification is based on the data input and output types between data, where
    Whyte’s Classification focuses on the relationship between the data. JDL focuses
    on classifying the fusion process according to five processing levels. Meanwhile,
    the architecture-based classification only captures the system design level and
    does not consider data relationships and types. Most of the aforementioned classification
    of the data fusion techniques are not suitable for evaluating the applications
    of a smart city. Our proposed data fusion classification approach for smart city
    comprises of six different perspectives (also called categories): i) data fusion
    objectives (O), ii) data fusion techniques (T), iii) data input and output types
    (D), iv) data source types (S), v) system scales (L), and vi) platform architectures
    (P). Within each category, we further identify various sub-categories (also called
    classes). Overall, there are 30 different classes. The complete list of the adopted
    classification indicating all the categories and their classes is shown in Table
    2. Short reference codes (O, T, D, S, L, P) for each class are also included in
    the table for further use in the paper. For example, O1 refers to the data fusion
    objective category and problematic data fusion class. Similarly, S3 refers to
    data source types category and participatory class. Table 2. Data fusion classifications

    could be potentially more than one perspectives (other than data sources, fusion
    scales, and platform architecture) for smart city application depending on the
    complexity and fusion objective itself. Below, we provide further details of all
    the perspectives and classes adopted in this paper. 2.1. Data fusion objectives
    (O) The data fusion techniques deployed in a smart city project is influenced
    by the objective of applications. In this paper, we have summarized the four objectives
    as follows: • O1: Fixing Problematic Data ‘Problematic Data’ class refers to the
    case when the data source is having quality issues such as, inconsistency, imperfection,
    disparateness, etc. Data fusion could be used as an easy approach to overcome
    such problems. Examples of O1 can be found in [27], [42], [43], [44]. • O2: Improving
    Data Reliability Data may suffer from reliability issues when it is collected
    in a less ideal (less controlled) environment with high presence of noise. In
    such situation, additional data sources are required to add redundancy for increasing
    data quality to enhance data reliability. Such situations are identified as ‘Data
    Reliability’ class and [45], [46], [47], [48] exhibits such pattern. In addition,
    security enhancement through the data fusion also belongs to this category and
    examples of such objectives can be found in [49], [50], [51]. • O3: Extracting
    Higher Level Information Data mining advancement has contributed to many different
    architectures of data fusion in order to obtain knowledge from multiple data sources.
    For instance, the occupancy of a building can be detected using a combination
    of few ambient sensors with data fusion, where occupancy information cannot be
    directly inferred from the raw data sources. We classify these approaches as ‘Higher
    Level Information Extraction’ class and examples can be found in [52], [53], [54].
    • O4: Increasing Data Completeness In a situation of coverage limitations, an
    individual data source is insufficient to provide complete details of the desired
    output. Therefore, in ‘Data Completeness’ class, data fusion is performed across
    multiple data sources to obtain a complete picture of the overall system such
    as [55], [56], [57]. 2.2. Data fusion techniques (T) In this category, we present
    the data fusion techniques in two different information enrichment obtained after
    data fusion. The T1 until T3 are the common data fusion techniques and the further
    details can be found in [19], [39], where it describes the lower level information
    being fused to generate identical level of information. The techniques are associated
    with data mining [38], [58], where simple input data from multiple sources is
    fused to generate higher level information enrichment. Brief description of these
    classes is given below: • T1: Data Association Data association refers to data
    fusion technique that fuse data based on similarity between at least two or more
    data sources. Common techniques for data association include Nearest Neighbors
    [59], Probabilistic Data Association [60], and Multiple Hypothesis Test [61].
    • T2: State Estimation State estimation indicates the usage of multiple data sources
    to achieve higher sate estimation accuracy. Common techniques under this category
    are Maximum Likelihood [62], Kalman Filter [63], Particle Filter [64], and Covariance
    Consistency Model [65]. • T3: Decision Fusion Decision fusion is a technique that
    is used to fuse the decisions made by various sub-components of a system to achieve
    a certain overall objective. For instance, a robot can fuse different decisions
    from the modules to perform an actuation (direction, events, or actions). General
    techniques include Bayesian inference [66], Dempster–Shafer Inference [67], and
    semantic approaches [68]. • T4: Classification Classification technique denotes
    methodology of grouping objects into different classes based on their unique characteristics.
    In-depth details of generic classification techniques can be found in [38], [58].
    • T5: Prediction Prediction techniques are used to forecast output based on single
    or multiple different data sources. Note that, this covers simple methods such
    as regression and as well as complicated methods such as forecast modeling. Examples
    of such can be found in [69], [70], [71] • T6: Unsupervised Machine Learning Unsupervised
    machine learning tries to automate the knowledge discovery without relying on
    the data labels. Examples of such methods involves clustering [72], anomaly detection
    [73] and others [38]. Note that, semi-supervised machine learning approach [74]
    is also categorized under this class. • T7: Dimension Reduction Dimension reduction
    refers to the method of reducing data sources’ dimensions for features extraction
    or visualization purposes. Examples of dimension reduction techniques are Principal
    Component Analysis (PCA) [75], and others [38]. The aim is to preserve the characteristic
    of the data sources while reducing the complexity of processing high dimensional
    data. • T8: Statistical Inference and Analysis Statistical inference and analysis
    is used for outlining certain information along with some common knowledge / hypothesis
    from the input data sources. Examples of papers using such approaches can be found
    in [76], [77] • T9: Visualization Visualization is a technique used for the presentation
    of output to the end users via some platform. The end result often requires human
    intervention. Examples of such techniques can be referred to the following papers
    [78], [79], [80]. 2.3. Data input and output types (D) Dasarathy’s classification
    [39] is based on input and output of fusion technique to determine the relation
    between input and output data. There are five classes in data input and output
    perspective. Brief details are given below: • D1: Data In Data Out (DAI-DAO) Data
    In Data Out (DAI-DAO) refers to the situation when multiple raw data sources are
    fused to increase data reliability and the output after fusion is still a raw
    data. • D2: Data In Feature Out (DAI-FEO) Data In Feature Out (DAI-FEO) refers
    to the situation when multiple raw data sources are fused to extract some unique
    feature of the observed system. The output feature describes certain aspect of
    the system and it could be further used for more feature extraction or to make
    certain decisions. • D3: Feature In Feature Out (FEI-FEO) Feature In Feature Out
    (FEI-FEO) refers to the situation when multiple unique features from different
    sensors are combined to generate new features. This class is commonly known as
    feature fusion. • D4: Feature In Decision Out (FEI-DEO) Feature In Decision Out
    (FEI-DEO) refers to the situation when certain features of the system are fused
    to make certain decisions, e.g. actuation of various system components. • D5:
    Decision In Decision Out (DEI-DEO) Decision In Decision Out (DEI-DEO) refers to
    the situation when different decision sources (maintenance status, events, etc.)
    are combined to obtain a final output decision. 2.4. Data source types (S) There
    are four types of generic data sources in smart city applications and we categorize
    them based on the data sources regardless of the communication medium. Details
    of each category can be found as follows: • S1: Physical Data Sources The physical
    data sources are collected from sensors that are being deployed to capture information
    of a particular space, area, or even city wide. Examples of the physical sensors
    include temperature [81], air quality [82], camera [83], ultrasonic [84], LiDAR
    [85], and etc. Note that, we categorize smart city application based on the data
    sources rather than the method they are acquired. For instance, a temperature
    probe in a sensor nodes of a wireless sensor network (WSN) transmits data through
    gateway to cloud database is considered as physical data source, S1. • S2: Cyber
    Data Sources Cyber data sources denote datasets which are commonly obtained from
    the Internet domain such as social media information [76], [86], web access data
    [87], [88], and opinion based datasets [89]. Social media information involves
    major social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Weibo, and others.
    Note that, usually the data is acquired through data mining techniques. Meanwhile,
    the web access data can be obtained from web applications programming interface
    (API), such as transportation tickets information and online customer records.
    Apart from that, open datasets refer to data from third party vendors such as
    telecom operator or a company with readily available data. • S3: Participatory
    Data Sources Participatory data sources include crowdsensing [90], [91] and crowdsourcing
    [92], [93] data contributed by the personal devices, e.g. mobile phones, wearable
    devices, tablets, etc. of the users in smart city. Users provide the data voluntarily
    or through some incentive mechanisms. • S4: Hybrid Data Sources The hybrid data
    sources include data obtained from mixed data sources [94], [95], e.g. by combining
    the participatory and physical sensor data. As pointed in [21], hybrid data sources
    can achieve more insights as compared to single data sources. 2.5. Data fusion
    scales (L) The scale of data fusion is also an important classification perspective.
    Please note that data fusion scale is based on sensor coverage rather than sensor
    deployment. There are four different classes, which are described below: • L1:
    Sensor Level Fusion At the sensor scale, data from various physical sensors is
    fused to form an output such as [53], [96]. For instance, fusion of data collected
    by various smartphone sensors is an example of data fusion at sensor level. •
    L2: Building Wide Fusion At the building wide scale, data sources collected within
    a premise or building is fused to form an output. For instance, fusion of building
    energy and building security data to develop a building management system [97],
    [98], [99] is an example of data fusion at building level. • L3: Inter-Building
    Fusion In the inter-building scale, the data sources collected over several buildings
    are fused to form an output, where the scale of deployment normally includes small
    area. For example, data sources of several buildings within a university are used
    to generate a particular output is considered as inter-building scale. Other examples
    of this data fusion scale also can be found in [100], [101]. • L4: City Wide Fusion
    In the case of city wide fusion, data sources that involve whole city’s area as
    input for the data fusion architecture fall under this class such as [102], [103],
    [104]. For instance, the study of citizen behavior involves fusion of data gathered
    in different areas of the city is considered city wide data. • L5: Inter-City
    Fusion (or larger) At the inter-city fusion (or larger) scale, data from large
    areas involving one or more cities or terrains (mountains, sea, forests, etc.)
    is fused to form an output. Examples of this scale involve comparing one smart
    city to another city or data of a city outskirts and its surrounding areas. More
    examples of inter-city fusion (or larger) can be referred to [43], [105], [106].
    2.6. Platform architectures (P) The architecture of computational platform involved
    in data fusion is another important classification perspective. In this category,
    we identify four generic classes: • P1: Edge Computation Platform In edge computation
    platform, data sources are processed and fused at the edge (i.e. very close to
    the physical location, where data is actually collected). Edge computation devices
    include micro-controller, computing devices (Raspberry pi), computers, etc. Such
    architecture can be found in works such as [96], [99], [101]. With this architecture,
    communication overheads and latency can be significantly reduced. • P2: Fog Computation
    Platform In fog computation platform, data sources are processed and fused at
    the middle layer, i.e. between the edge and the cloud. In this architecture, data
    is periodically or continuously sampled at the edge (without processing) and is
    then forwarded to a gateway (that acts as a fog device). At the gateway, computing
    resources are provided for data processing. Both fog computing and edge computing
    platforms provide similar benefits of offloading computation as shown in [102],
    [107], [108]. However, fog computing architecture should be preferred when it
    is difficult to find stable power sources at the edge. • P3: Cloud Computation
    Platform In cloud computation platform, data sources are processed and fused in
    the cloud. This is the most common technique practiced by industry and research
    institutes for processing big data. Examples of this architecture being used are
    [56], [87], [109]. The advantages of cloud computing architecture includes ready
    access to the data and both online and offline for further processing or fusing.
    The disadvantages include increased communication overheads and costs. • P4: Hybrid
    Computation Platform In hybrid computation platform, processing is distributed
    among two or more layers (edge, fog and cloud) as shown in [105], [110], [111].
    In this architecture, depending on the available resources or application objectives,
    some low level data fusion and processing is done at the edge or fog, while high
    level information is extracted in the cloud. 3. Smart city applications overview
    Smart city applications tend to have extremely diverse requirements, which contribute
    to a large variety of different techniques and requirements as stated previously
    in Section 2 for different domains. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate the smart
    city applications from a more generic perspectives rather than one specific perspective.
    In this section, we select smart city applications with data fusion techniques
    from different domains listed in Fig. 1, and evaluate them based on multi-perspectives
    from the Section 2. Note that, there exist some literatures that are cross-disciplinary,
    which may involve more than one domain. In order to address the cross-disciplinary
    smart city applications, we have grouped them into their closest relevant domain.
    In each application domain, we outline sub-domains and present works related to
    data fusion techniques. Using the proposed data fusion classification based on
    multi-perspectives, we discuss the common data sources and fusion techniques,
    along with the current research trends in each domain. 3.1. Smart living Smart
    living concerns with the life of the urban citizens and revolves around the concept
    of improving live-ability in urban area. In the literature, the general objectives
    of utilizing the smart living domain involve data being used to extract higher
    level information or increasing the data completeness. In addition, smart city
    applications in this domain often leverage the cloud or hybrid platform architecture.
    In this domains, we have studied three different aspects of smart living, namely,
    (1) Smart Health, (2) Smart Home, and (3) Smart Community (Table 3). Table 3.

    is a crucial component in everyday life concerning medical and public practices
    using devices as defined by Lee and Co-authors [144], [145]. The rapid development
    of technology (e.g. smartphones and their in-built sensing devices such as heart
    rate sensors) provides more opportunities to adopt technology in healthcare applications
    pervasively. For telehealth application in smart city, Hossain et al. [112] have
    used electroencephalographic (EGG) signals and voice to monitor a specific user’s
    health with the support of cloud technology and doctor’s advices. In [113], work
    has shown to monitor elderly at home based on fuzzy fusion model using behavioral
    and acoustical environment data. Similarly, Noury [146] also monitors the activities
    and fall detection of elderly through fuzzy logic by fusing accelerometer, vibration,
    and orientation sensor. In [91], Marakkalage et al. have used crowd-sensing data
    from a smartphone application (location, noise, light, etc.) and introduced sensor
    fusion based environment classification (SFEC) to profile elderly people for understanding
    their daily lifestyle. In addition, Dawar and Kehtarnavaz [52] have implemented
    a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to combine both depth camera and wearable devices
    to detect the transition of movements to fall. Apart from that, Hondori et al.
    [111] have proposed using sensor fusion between depth images and inertia to perform
    tele-rehab in the home. The main challenge occurs in pervasive smart healthcare
    data fusion is discussed in [147] as the need of a higher accuracy to improve
    sensing robustness against uncertainty and unreliable integration. 3.1.2. Smart
    home The concept of Smart Homes plays an important role nowadays in contemporary
    urban areas. According to Jiang et al. [148], the definition of a smart home provides
    the capability of controlling, monitoring, and accessed appliances & services
    through implementation of ICT. There are currently many big players in developing
    the smart home appliances such as Amazon, Google, Apple, IBM, Intel, Microsoft,
    Xiaomi, and others. The challenge faced by manufacturers are related with service
    integration and formulating software ontology platform. These are necessary for
    implementing the services through different vendors and allow for a better integration.
    Meanwhile in [114], physical sensors (soil moisture) and cyber (weather, traffic)
    have been fused to control home appliances such as alarm clock and water sprinkle.
    The study of user daily activity is yet another important aspect to understand
    urban citizen well-being. In [45], Hong et al. have combined series of life activities
    to understand the lifestyle pattern depends on the equally weighted sum operation
    and Dempster-Shafer theory. Also, similar study on the user daily activity patterns
    can be found in [110]. Combination of house environmental sensor (infrared, door
    contact, temperature, hygrometry sensor, microphone) and wearable devices (kinematic
    sensors) using support vector machine (SVM) can be used to identify the user activity
    patterns. In addition, the modeling of human behavior in a smart home [149] in
    order to generate learning situation models have proven the efficiency of context-aware
    services. In addition, smart home security is yet another study field for many
    researchers [150], [151], [152] due to increased usage of IoT devices in normal
    household. The research challenges is to develop the applications for the smart
    houses while retaining the privacy and security of the end user. 3.1.3. Smart
    community According to Smart Communities Guidebook [153], a smart community is
    described as “a geographical area ranging in size from neighborhood to a multi-county
    region whose residents, organizations, and governing institutions are using information
    technology to transform their region in significant ways”. There is only a handful
    of cities focus on this aspect as majority are still in the stage of transforming
    from facility to community welfare. First world countries such as USA, Canada,
    Australia, European Union, and Singapore shown in [154] have started up initiatives
    to create smart communities. Information fusion for smart community video surveillance
    system is performed in [79] to aid neighborhood in terms of security. The combination
    of the different modal surveillance camera provides a vast amount of visual information
    extraction such as video summarization for highlighting certain events. A distance
    learning framework is proposed in [115], which enables personalized learning to
    cater what is best for each individual user. It uses data fusion to understand
    user environment and their activities by means of hybrid data sources. Real-time
    community monitoring also helps to prevent emergency situations and it ensures
    the safety of community citizens. A good example for a smart community application
    in large-scale is the Social Credit System in China [155]. It is a state-owned
    system to collect data from both public (traffic cameras, transit data etc.) and
    private (online shopping, fitness trackers etc.) data sources to monitor and analyze
    user behaviour to generate a single ”credit score” for each person, which helps
    in community well-being. The techniques fuse these data sources and remains a
    back box to the general public. However, the effect on user privacy with the rise
    of “data state” remains a debate for some [156]. A mature citizen should be on
    alert and always responds to any potential threat, while spreading the awareness
    to build a safer community in the urban city. 3.2. Smart urban area management
    Smart urban area management denotes the managing of urban area using ICT. Sub-domains
    in this regime composed of urban planning, governance, and smart buildings. For
    an application to fit into this definition, the minimum scale would be at the
    building level (e.g. a building management system). The main trend of data fusion
    techniques being applied in this domain mostly consists of objectives of extracting
    higher level information or increasing the data completeness. The end product
    of data fusion include visualization of information for respective authorities.
    3.2.1. Smart governance In smart governance, managing a city is considered as
    a complex task as the integration of different domains and services is proven
    to be challenging. Transparent services integration is an example of why many
    governance authorities are having difficulties to sort it out. It is hard to strike
    a balance in developing a transparent governance policy with consideration of
    sensitive information. Therefore, there is only limited study materials available
    to the best of our knowledge. Janssen and Estevez [118] have proposed a centralized
    platform for cutting down government staff by shifting existing organization to
    rely on integration of platforms. The disaster response management is also considered
    as another vital element for a smart city to carry out any potential counter measurements
    towards disaster as shown in [157]. Apart from that, urban reporting system [56]
    has collected report from the city wide region on the faulty infrastructure so
    that immediate actions can be taken to remedy the situation. It uses cloud technology
    and focuses on the display of fused data report, which it also describes the location
    and types of infrastructure. Example of research challenges is to remove any potential
    fake report to prevent misuse of the reporting platform. Another example of smart
    governance that involves city safety can be found in [158], where it can act as
    an emergency aid application (light pulse on emergency through mesh network) while
    providing energy efficient lighting to urban area. Moreover, there are cities
    also working on governance platform such as New York [7], Singapore [10], Tokyo
    [11], Oslo [159], and others. The potential research opportunity is to propose
    consensus protocols within the city for better integration of services. 3.2.2.
    Smart urban planning Urban planning plays an important role in developing the
    city economy by taking account of well-being of the urban residents. Traditionally
    in urban planning, aerial photography and statistical data sources (building size,
    population number, public amenities, etc.) are combined to understand the current
    development state of the city. The downside of such method is data sources frequently
    lacks of fine details, which resulting the output result is not representative.
    To address such issue, Cheng and Toutin [43] have combined various satellite and
    aerial images to generate details for the exiting urban structures. Alternately,
    low power sensors are capable to provide a larger coverage with lower deployment
    cost, which give researchers the opportunity to study different points of interest
    in the urban area. In [81], [95], [119], a bottom up urban planning method is
    implemented, where sensors are installed in a designated region to capture space
    utilization. From the collected data, urban planners can study public space utilization
    pattern using an integrated portal. Here, a hybrid processing method is proposed,
    where the data processing and fusion occur in different stages of data pipeline.
    In addition, a large variety of data sources can be used for urban planning such
    as physical sensors [160], photography [76], [161], or hybrid data sources [85].
    Despite wide variety of data sources, human interpretation is required when it
    comes to make decision on a proposed urban design. The need of full automated
    planning system would further benefit the urban planners to combine different
    data sources in order to achieve a more ideal city planning. 3.2.3. Smart building
    Urban building management provides building owner a platform to understand building’s
    energy consumption rate while automating building resources management. It has
    been extensively studied in [25], [162], [163], [164] and the current trend is
    to optimize the building resources such as hot water systems, electrical consumption,
    and heating ventilation & air conditioning (HVAC). In [94], Aftab et al. have
    combined four different parameters to predict building occupancy to control HVAC
    using low-cost embedded systems. Some other works such as [97], [165], [166] also
    have the same objectives but using different types of data sources. The potential
    solution for better building management system is to rely on fusing weather, human
    feedback, and electricity price to fine tune the building resources in order to
    maximize human comfort, while minimizing the energy consumption. Apart from that,
    fire alarm system is considered another important features of the smart building
    management system. Luo and Su [117] have fused three different data sources (flame,
    smoke, and temperature sensor) to detect any potential fire outbreak and reduce
    false alarms. In addition, a notification-based system is implemented to notify
    the property owner and manager in case of emergency. In future, potential building
    safety features may include a group of robots to deal with fire hazards and double
    duty as building security patrols. 3.3. Smart environment Smart environment studies
    the surrounding of a given area of interest, which covers the internal and external
    surrounding of a city. From the literature, we observed that majority of the data
    sources consist of physical and hybrid data sources, while the data scale often
    represent a large spatial coverage. Nowadays, the most common surrounding effects
    studied in the smart city include urban heat island (UHI), green house effect,
    and global warming. In addition, we have grouped urban waste management under
    this domain because it also has an environmental impact. 3.3.1. Landscape monitoring
    The main challenge of landscape monitoring in smart city is the sensing coverage
    of the data sources. To address such issue, two different sensing approaches have
    been used such as relying on mobile sensing or satellite-based data. Mobile sensing
    [106], [167] offers greater sensing capability by leveraging the mobility of moving
    objects (vehicles or humans). The mobile sensing technique provides a large spatial
    coverage, but it is not suitable for real-time applications unless there are multiple
    data sources to compensate the lack of spatial resolution concurrently. The output
    type of this mobile sensing includes combination of different spatial data in
    order to complete the data sources before proceed to data processing stage. Mobile
    sensing works such as [82], [168] utilized different data sources to complete
    spatial resolution and visualized the ambient changes across the city. The common
    characteristic of aforementioned works is feature extraction, which they visualize
    the processed features from the raw data sources. Majority of data input and output
    types in this domain are DAI-DAO and DAI-FEO since physical sensors are the common
    data sources. Using the satellite-based data sources, Shen et al. [46] have studied
    the UHI effect in a city using data sources collected over 26 years. The UHI index
    changes are measured through the combination of Landsat and MODIS images data.
    Mobile sensing offers a lower deployment cost, where it sacrifice the spatial
    resolution given there is limited number of sensors. Also, it has a lower coverage
    compared to satellite data sources. In contrast, satellite data has a wider coverage
    of spatial resolution but it frequently needs data enhancement and lacks of finer
    details. 3.3.2. Urban city modeling The surrounding natural resources of an urban
    city such as mountains and forests are considered as important assets of a city.
    The most common data sources in modeling the city area are satellite images, which
    as stated before, it requires data enhancement such as [169], [170] before using
    it. Therefore, prior work of data fusion [171] was focused on improving the satellite
    images quality. Only until recently, the emergence of machine learning algorithms
    and faster computers have created new ways to extract large variety of satellite
    image features. For instance in [120] and [121], forest types classification have
    been conducted in order to understand the variety of tree species in a specific
    region of interest. Both methods involve region-wide data sources and classification
    techniques, which are used to identify the tree species based on the forest types.
    With a lower deployment cost, small satellite (smallsat) and nano satellite (nanosat)
    could improve spatial coverage to generate a better data sources. Smart city applications
    leveraging satellite data will also beneficial from these deployment. 3.3.3. Waste
    management With astonishing rate of garbage being generated daily, waste management
    for an urban city can be rather challenging. Thus, it is essential to handle the
    waste efficiently to improve on sustainability of a city. An example of such effort
    could be found in [23], where they have proposed three new aspects of a smart
    waste management system such as: (1) infrastructure to overlook the overall life
    cycle of the product, (2) new business models revolving the product life cycle
    for preventing any waste generation, and (3) intelligent sensor networks for waste
    management facilities. In [102], Catania and Ventura have combined the proximity
    reading and weight sensor from garbage bin to estimate the garbage capacity of
    a typical household. Afterwards, rubbish categories collected from user mobile
    devices and garbage trucks are combined to keep track of residential participation
    in recycling scheme. On the other hand, waste water treatment helps to manage
    liquid waste of urban city before discharging to river or reuse. Chang et al.
    [122] have combined landsat and MODIS dataset in order to trace the water pollution
    level of a lake. On top of that, a web portal has been deployed to visualize and
    monitor the water pollution region over the time. Currently, many researchers
    are working together to develop an efficient waste management system since there
    is only limited resources available on earth. The goal is to adopt the 3R (Reduce,
    Reuse, and Recycle) concept with the help of ICT to improve city resource sustainability.
    3.4. Smart industry With the upcoming Industry 4.0 standards [172] touted as the
    gold standard of the future, various industries have been experiencing transformation
    with automation and data driven approaches. The majority of smart industry applications
    often leverage data collected from physical sensors while data fusion techniques
    are often performed at sensor or building level. Here, smart industry can be divided
    into three sub-domains, which are Smart Manufacturing, Smart Maintenance, and
    Smart Agriculture. 3.4.1. Smart manufacturing Smart manufacturing denotes the
    factory that depends on ICT to optimize the manufacturing process by increasing
    the production throughput. In [98], De Vin et al. have proposed a simulation tool
    to test out the management decision support by fusing undisclosed data entries
    and manufacturing process events. Similar to the aforementioned approach, decision
    based fusion can also be seen in [173], [174], which combines different machinery
    sensors data and data warehouse entries. The data fusion integration also considers
    supply chain demand in order to further optimize the manufacturing process. The
    challenge in this domain is to develop a self-optimizing manufacturing process
    while delivering the products to meet the demand of supply chain. Therefore, smart
    manufacturing frequently has a high correlation with the supply chain and attempts
    to deliver the market needs. In addition, the robotics usage in the smart manufacturing
    domain is nothing new. Guo et al. [51] have proposed an anomaly detection to combat
    potential security aspects in the robots using sensor fusion technique such as
    state estimation. 3.4.2. Smart maintenance The reliability and stability of the
    equipment and machinery is vital to all the industries to ensure smooth operation
    in production. Without the guarantee of smooth operation, any downtime can cost
    damages to reputation and also loses profit. Thus, preventive maintenance has
    been studied in [124], [125], [175], [176] and attempts to predict the remaining
    useful life (RUL) of a machine accurately. By accurately predicting the RUL, maintenance
    can be carried out on time to save cost only when needed. The common data fusion
    techniques for predicting RUL are neural network (NN) based model such as CNN
    and Deep NN (DNN). Please note that, common data source in this sub-domain is
    physical data source such as machine states, sensors readings, and related parameters.
    Nonetheless on the fault detection domain, machine fault detection can be found
    in [96], [123], where they describe the problem of fault diagnosis and apply data
    fusion techniques to overcome. State estimation and classification have been used
    to detect the current state of the machinery. The data sources share some similarity
    with the preventive maintenance, where lower level of data information is preferred.
    This yields a faster fault detection when compared to a complex data pipeline.
    The research challenge here is to develop a generic and a flexible maintenance
    system for different scale of applications adhering to the goal of accurate fault
    detection. 3.4.3. Smart agriculture In order to produce sustainable food resources
    in smart city, smart farming [177], [178] has become a trend to meet the food
    supply demand in a smart city. There are two different sub-domains in smart farming
    such as land and sea agriculture. In the land agriculture aspect, planting crops
    using controlled environment has shed some light in fulfilling the city needs
    of fresh supplies. However, plant disease remains a potential threat to a highly-dense
    plantation crop framing. In [127], Moshou et al. have classified the plant disease
    infection through Self Organizing Map (SOM) by fusing the spectral reflection
    and fluorescence imaging data. This helps to isolate infected crops while it focuses
    on the production of healthy plants. Apart from that, electromagnetic induction
    sensors, vegetarian index, water stress level, and radiance data are combined
    in [179] to better determine the partition of the crop field. Similar work also
    can be found in [128], where Khanum et al. propose an ontology-based fuzzy logic
    to classify plant disease. The research gaps in this domain involve improving
    live stock management as well as optimizing smart farm. On the other hand, sea
    agriculture is responsible for supplying the seafood supplies in a city. Obtaining
    fresh seafood supplies in an urban city sometimes can be rather difficult due
    to various factors such as delivery, city location, weather, seasonal pricing,
    etc. Therefore, a fresh seafood supply in a city is often not guaranteed. In order
    to address such issue, Huang et al. [126] have provided a solution by integrating
    two types of cameras for seafood freshness inspection. Camera and near infrared
    spectroscopy are fused through PCA and use NN to classify the freshness index.
    The research gaps in this domain involve developing large scale fish breeding
    and also wide varieties of seafood product such as calm, mussels, abalone, etc.
    A potential solution such as smart fish breeding with IoT has been proposed in
    [180], where it suggests using a moving pod to breed fishes while transporting
    them to destination in a particular destination simultaneously. 3.5. Smart economics
    Smart economics can be defined as the generic commercial activities in an urban
    city ranging from supply chain, logistic, finance center, to tourism. All these
    activities yield potential commercial value to a city, which it depends on the
    unilateral or bilateral trading relationship. In this subsection, we discuss smart
    economics in three major sub-domains, namely, (1) Smart Commerce, (2) Smart Supply
    Chain, and (3) Smart Tourism. 3.5.1. Smart commerce Today, modern e-commerce platforms
    use multi modal data sources to reach and better understand their customers. This
    helps e-commerce vendors to give better product recommendations for their customers
    and it helps customers to make their decisions easily. Fusing customer data such
    as mobility, credit card purchases, and social media interactions is commonly
    used in modern recommender systems. In [87], Breur introduced the fusion of customer
    behavior data and market research data to obtain a holistic picture of the customer.
    Investors can leverage financial data to make investment decisions, as Hassan
    et al. [181] have introduced a fusion model of Hidden Markov Model (HMM), NN,
    and Genetic Algorithm (GA) for stock market prediction. Improving the consumer
    awareness is conducted in [129], by fusing real world (weather, geographical)
    and cyber world (Twitter, Facebook) data. The proposed system has two levels of
    fusion, which relies on hierarchical-based processing architecture. The data combined
    bottom level input and fed it into upper level for further processing to achieve
    its objectives. 3.5.2. Smart supply chain In a smart supply chain, it often involves
    sources and destination tracking in order to understand the flow / processing
    of the objects. As discussed in [182], supply chain management and logistic are
    the fundamental of modern supplies on fulfilling the needs of an urban city. For
    instance in food supply chain, three tiers information fusion framework is proposed
    in [130] such as: (1) to accelerate data processing, (2) shelf life prediction,
    and (3) real-time supply chain planning. The proposed hierarchical information
    fusion architecture (HIFA) includes a process that is intelligently transforming
    the sensor’s data sources into usable decision-making information. Recently, combination
    of blockchain technology has paved a new way for revolutionizing the existing
    supply chain. In [107], Tian has shown the integration of blockchain and supply
    chain in the agri-food supply application. It aids consumers to trace the origin
    of food using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) along with database or WSN.
    The information also includes food origin to help consumers to identify the brand
    authenticity and avoids consuming counterfeit products. The research gap in this
    sub domain concerns with the implementation of smart supply and it needs the involvement
    from various commercial organizations. The consensus and national regulations
    are also parts of the critical factors of smart supply implementation. 3.5.3.
    Smart tourism The advancement of transportation technology has granted accessibility
    for the humans to move around the globe with ease. This phenomenon has caused
    rapid expansion of the tourism commercial values contributed to a city side income.
    Since then, Internet resources such as travel blogs and recommendation systems
    have influenced public to venture different locations. For instance, recommendation
    system [57] has been developed to recommend the place to travel based on user’s
    information such as socioeconomic (e.g. age, education, and income) and psychological
    and cognitive (experience, personality, involvement, and so forth) groups. User
    choices are used as feedback to further fine-tune the recommendation system using
    Rocchio’s method. Apart from that, Miah et al. [77] have combined social media-generated
    big data (geo-tagged photos of tourist attraction places) to predict tourist behavioral
    patterns. Alternately, Viswanath et al. [131] used a smartphone based mobile application
    to passively track tourist location data and obtain user ratings for tourist attraction
    places to better understand the preferences of tourists when they visit tourist
    attractions. The potential research development for smart travel is to focus on
    using a smartphone application for improving travel experience by relying on real-time
    translation and augmented reality (AR) navigation. 3.6. Smart human mobility Human
    mobility has been an important research area as commuting and traveling play big
    roles in modern life. With the help of advanced ICT, plentiful data sources related
    to human mobility have been collected and accessible to researchers, which yields
    deeper insights into the nature of human mobility as well as better improvement
    strategies for transportation systems. Smart human mobility, therefore, means
    collecting, managing, and analyzing (fusing) various data sources related to different
    aspects of residents’ movement in order to better understand and improve the way
    people move. Depending on the purpose of different applications, smart human mobility
    domain can be further divided into three sub-domains:(1) Smart Location-Based
    Services, (2) Human Mobility Understanding, and (3) Smart Transportation Systems.
    3.6.1. Smart location-based services This sub-domain aims to get the accurate
    position of individuals and further to provide services, such as route planning
    and navigation, to help them travel efficiently and comfortably, in both outdoor
    and indoor environments. For outdoor positioning, Global Positioning System (GPS)
    has been the most accurate, reliable and dominant technology since it was allowed
    for civilian use in 1980s [183], [184]. Less-accurate non-GPS positioning approaches,
    such as wifi-based localization and cell-tower triangulation, are sometimes used
    instead of (or together with) GPS, because they consume less energy [132], [133].
    For indoor positioning, since GPS does not work well indoors, other positioning
    approaches have been proposed. The data collection technologies used for these
    approaches mainly include Wi-Fi (WLAN), inertial measurement unit (IMU), RFID
    tags, Bluetooth, global system for mobile communications (GSM), frequency modulation
    (FM), and ultra-wide band (UWB) [185], [186]. Meanwhile, multiple data sources
    are often fused to achieve more accurate localization results [134], [135]. Once
    accurate locations are obtained, either indoors or outdoors, location-based services
    (e.g. route planning and navigation) can be provided to end users by fusing the
    location sequences with other information sources such as geographic information
    system (GIS) data, real-time traffic data, and user preference data [136], [137],
    [187], [188], [189], [190]. Since the outdoor positioning and location-based services
    have been well developed and commercialized, the current research trend in this
    field is mainly focused on improving the performance (accuracy, deployment cost,
    and energy cost) of indoor systems and services. 3.6.2. Human mobility understanding
    Positioning systems not only enable the location-based services for individuals
    but also provide data sources for further monitoring and understanding human mobility
    in a larger and more comprehensive scale. By aggregating and analyzing (fusing)
    the location data of residents along with GIS data of the environment, various
    aspects of human mobility can be monitored and the hidden patterns can be obtained.
    As summarized in [100], the most common subjects of monitoring and understanding
    human mobility include distance and duration distributions [191], origin-destination
    matrices [103], individual activity-based mobility patterns [192], transportation
    mode identification [54], and densities and flows within a building (or a cluster
    of buildings) [138], [193]. Results obtained from these subjects provide clues
    for improving transportation system [194], urban planning [195], and communication
    network [196]. Typical studies in this sub-domain usually fuse one data source
    of people’s movement trajectories with the environment information, such as GIS
    data of the city or floor plan of a building. Although this type of approach has
    produced much deeper insights compared with traditional approach relied on survey
    data, there is a trend to fuse multiple data sources related to people’s movement
    and obtain a more comprehensive picture of human mobility [197], [198]. Moreover,
    social media data sources. such as Tweets, also bring in more information regarding
    the mobility status in cities due to the combination of spatio-temporal data and
    descriptive text [86], [199]. 3.6.3. Smart transportation systems Another large
    part of smart mobility is the improvement of transportation systems, which mainly
    comes from three aspects: relieving traffic congestion, improving public transportation,
    and introducing new transport systems. To relieve traffic congestion, effective
    light control plays an important role. While existing light control systems are
    usually based on hand-crafted rules and do not adjust to the rapid dynamics of
    traffic flows, intelligent light control approaches have been proposed using different
    data sources, data fusion techniques, and decision making (optimization and control)
    algorithms [109], [200]. Challenges in this aspect mainly come from the implementation
    of such intelligent light control approaches. Improvement of the public transportation
    system is mainly conducted through the network and schedule optimization [201].
    Although these two topics have been thoroughly discussed in the literature, new
    insights related to the public transit system (e.g. origin-destination matrices
    and service level obtained from big data) [139], [202] and more advanced transport
    modeling tools enabled by big data [203] have brought new opportunities. Even
    if the existing transportation manner has been optimized, there are still problems
    that cannot be solved, such as last mile issue and driving accidents. Therefore,
    new transport systems, such as bike sharing systems and autonomous vehicle systems,
    are introduced. Advanced ICT and data fusion techniques are the core of the realization
    of these systems. For a bike sharing system, data fusion and analysis helps to
    understand how the system works and evaluate different operational strategies
    [204], [205]. As for the autonomous vehicle system, the control of an autonomous
    vehicle itself is a complex data fusion process, fusing various data sources about
    the vehicle and the road by advanced machine learning and control algorithms [140],
    [206]. Security plays an important role in the autonomous vehicles deployment
    to ensure reliability of the autonomous driving. Examples of such techniques can
    be found in [50], [207]. 3.7. Smart infrastructure In a smart city, infrastructure
    aims to provide convenience for the public by supplying resources (electricity,
    gas, and water) or providing services (public facility or communication systems).
    Here, we outline four different sub-domains for discussion, which are (1) Smart
    Grid, (2) Smart Energy, (3) Smart Facility, and (4) Smart Communication. 3.7.1.
    Smart grid The electrical grid provides an intermediate platform for relaying
    the electricity from the power plant to residential and industrial area. The common
    goal in this sub-domain is to provide reliable and stable electricity supply with
    the integration of ICT, which is commonly known as smart grid. Smart grid has
    been extensively studied in [55], [208], [209], [210] and the goal is to address
    on load and demand balancing of electricity in a particular area, building, or
    even household. Common technique applied in this sub-domain is forecasting, and
    example of such application can be found in [55], which it combines the information
    received from residential meters and predicts the electricity consumption load.
    Wang et al. [88] have proposed a different approach, where the concept of multi
    agent systems (MAS) is used to predict building energy consumption by denoting
    each meter as an agent. The common goal is to use a higher information extraction
    technique such as prediction, where it allows grid operators to forecast the grid
    demand to ensure sufficient electricity load. Test bed currently is the common
    method for testing out the smart grid use case and has been studied in [211].
    Another common research topic is security and reliability of the smart grid system.
    Li et al. [49] have proposed a secure state estimation, which it can be used to
    address single sensor or multi-sensor scenarios. Similar works addressing smart
    grid security also can be found in [212], [213]. On the other hand, advanced metering
    infrastructure (AMI) has been studied along with the smart grid to ensure the
    electrical metering is tamper-proof while able to accurately measure energy consumption.
    For instance, work in [214] uses the clustering algorithm to identify energy theft
    accurately while reducing potential false positives. Meanwhile, work in [105]
    has presented a real-time price estimation by fusing local power and global power
    consumption to understand real-time electric load of the grid. In future, prosumers
    (producer and consumer) will emerge in the smart grid market and sole distributor
    paradigm will be no longer valid. This scenario greatly increase the difficulty
    of the energy demand and load when accounting the energy as a live market 3.7.2.
    Smart energy The search for clean energy resources has been an ongoing effort
    for many researchers in order to cut down the dependency on the fossil fuels.
    Therefore, the clean energy research direction mostly focuses on renewable energy,
    which propose to go for a green and less carbon footprint energy producing approach.
    Nowadays, the most common renewable energy sources emerged in the market are solar
    farm [101], [141] and wind power [215], [216]. Solar energy is generated based
    on the conversion of the sunlight into electricity, but the energy harvesting
    technique suffers from limited energy harvesting time. Thus, solar irradiance
    prediction is crucial to ensure maximum energy throughput in the solar farm within
    the limited time. Huang et al. [141] have proposed to use data driven algorithms
    such as ABB, SVM, BRT, and Lasso, in which the information from neighboring solar
    plants are combined to accurately predict the solar irradiance. Meanwhile in [217],
    Jung and Broadwater have implemented a statistical model to fuse wind speed, direction,
    temperature from forecast station and online measurement to determine the total
    power output of the wind farm. Most of the aforementioned methods focus on improving
    efficiency of the existing energy harvesting methodology. Future research on the
    clean energy relies on various data and energy sources in order to construct a
    high efficiency energy harvesting model. 3.7.3. Smart facility Smart facility
    denotes access of physical facility that provides services to the public such
    as parking facility, water supply, etc. The most vital facility in a smart city
    would be water treatment center as clean water is an important necessity for the
    urban citizens. Any potential leakage or downtime of water supply in a city would
    be proven troublesome. Mounce et al. [104] propose a water leakage detection using
    classification technique, which combines all the district water meter data. Similar
    concept can be applied on other resources such as gas pipe leakage detection or
    electricity theft in smart grid. In the public facility, the wear and tear of
    structures can be a major issue due to the frequent rate of public usage. Hence
    in [99], Park et al. have combined multi-metric sensors to estimate the bridge
    displacement. Through this, a rough estimation of the structural health can be
    determined. Alternately, Khoa et al. [218] have proposed a tensor decomposition
    approach using the facility data sources in order to understand the facility usage
    details. In addition, the emergence of data centers providing various functionalities
    to the smart city applications such as [219], [220], [221] also one of the focuses
    for the ongoing efforts of smart city. There is also a few domains that is highly
    correlated with smart facility such as Smart Maintenance and Governance [56],
    where integration of a web portal is used to report potential damages. 3.7.4.
    Smart communication Communication in an urban city remains an essential infrastructure
    for various application platforms to communicate with each other. Not all communication
    platforms and standards are designed equally as each of them serve different purposes.
    Therefore, different standards and protocols to meet varying requirements have
    been established. Currently, the upcoming 5G technology [28], [222] has promised
    to bring integration of 5G interface with support for older generation spectrum
    such as LTE and Wi-Fi in order to provide seamless user experience. The common
    data source in 5G standards is raw signal, and that is the reason why data fusion
    only happens at the edge level. For example, Huang et al. [27] and Rappaport et
    al. [222] have fused raw signals that are divided through multiple antenna during
    transmission. The receivers will receive multiple signal sources and reconstruct
    the original information being transferred. Further discussion of the energy efficient
    trade-off in wireless communication technology can be found in [223], [224]. In
    the IoT domain, wireless sensor network (WSN) is considered a common communication
    platform because of its wide coverage and low power consumption. WSN is built
    on top of nodes’ network, which is smaller than a wireless ad hoc network. Hence,
    multiple nodes can be combined for encoding and decoding the packets received.
    Kreibich and Co-authors Kreibich et al. [47] and Luo et al. [48] have proposed
    approaches to improve communication between WSN focusing on the communication
    mechanism between nodes. The main objective is to focus on the reliability of
    communication channel while maintaining the coverage (from relay to sink nodes)
    and also low power consumption. The research significance of communication is
    undoubtedly a necessity in smart city as it benefits all domains leveraging communication
    technology. The main goal is to design efficient and reliable communication protocols
    to meet different requirements of applications. Alternately, low power communication
    is yet another goal for IoT in order to achieve long sensing operation. 4. Challenges
    and open research directions After outlining the applications of the smart city
    that use data fusion, we discuss the potential aspects to improve the data fusion
    in the smart city applications observed from previous section. These aspects include
    potential categories or perspectives that are not discussed in Sections 2 and
    3. As shown in Fig. 2, we identify four major research directions, which are (1)
    data quality, (2) data representation, (3) data privacy and security, and (4)
    data fusion technique. Download : Download high-res image (137KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Open Research Directions for Data Fusion in Smart City
    Applications. 4.1. Data quality Quality of the data sources directly determine
    the quality of output results since processing module follows the “garbage in
    and garbage out” theorem in fusing data sources. Thus, we discuss two aspects
    to improve the data sources in the smart city applications, which are sensing
    coverage and sensing longevity. 4.1.1. Sensing coverage Sensing coverage is one
    of the important factors to determine the quality of data sources. Insufficient
    data coverage will generate a result that is not representative, and often it
    implies more sensors need to be installed to increase the sensing coverage. This
    indirectly affects the deployment cost since more physical hardware is required
    to compensate the sensing coverage. Apart from that, it also affects the design
    of communication architecture because more physical sensors are required to transmit
    data, and thus potentially congests the communication platform. These factors
    are common obstacles for a large-scale deployment in smart city applications and
    getting worse when increasing the deployment scale. There are two commonly used
    approaches to address the aforementioned issues, which are crowdsensing and mobile
    sensing platform. As shown in [225], crowdsensing is one of the most cost-efficient
    method as personal mobile devices such as smartphones. Smartphones offer wide
    variety of sensors such as vibration, magnetic field, IMU, GPS, and others. The
    problems with crowdsensing are related to user privacy intrusion and high battery
    consumption when actively collecting data. User privacy is a challenge in collecting
    data as regulations in many countries have been facilitated to prevent applications
    to collect any sensitive information. This issue will be further discussed in
    user privacy and security sub-section. Another problems with crowdsensing are
    the unavailability of geolocations information or random distribution of geographical
    located data. These scenarios lead to inconsistent data quality. Potential way
    to resolve this limitation is to collect data at a fixed time and location only
    when needed, where incentive is provided for valid participants. Also, the trade-off
    problem of the mobile sensing can be further found in [226]. Through this method,
    only qualified data will be included as data sources, while invalid information
    will be automatically filtered. Using similar concept as crowdsensing, mobile
    sensing has offered the same data sensing approach but only follows designated
    route to collect data. The idea is to leverage the mobility of the transportation
    (normally public transports, cabs, and garbage trucks) to conduct data collection,
    where the vehicles are traveling across the city. Example of mobile sensing platform
    can be found in [106], where garbage trucks on duty will collect the ambient data
    across different parts of the city weekly. An identical concept can also be implemented
    with the public transport systems, since majority of them follow fixed schedules.
    The challenge with the mobile sensing is that spatial resolution of the data may
    not have a finer detail when compared to crowdsensing due to fixed data collection
    schedule. The main cause is due to the limited accessibility of the vehicles in
    certain areas (pedestrian path and residential area). Potential workaround of
    this limitation would be combining the mobile sensing and crowdsensing data sources
    to generate data that covers large area within the urban city. Services integration
    also plays an important role in supplying platforms alternate data sources to
    perform data enrichment. By simulating the different IoT services in smart city
    as shown in [227], potential limitation or bottlenecks of smart services can be
    avoided in order to design a better smart city application. 4.1.2. Data sensing
    longevity Long term data collection offers different aspects of knowledge discovery
    as data is able to cover more detail in a larger temporal resolution. The advancement
    of miniaturization has greatly reduced the power consumption of the sensors and
    IoT devices while maintaining the same sensing performance. As a result, combining
    both energy harvesting techniques and low energy devices are able to create a
    long self-sustaining sensing approach. This breakthrough allows physical sensors
    to run independently without the need of external power sources. In order to preserve
    the longevity of physical sensors’ sensing capability, energy harvesting is one
    of the common approach in large area networks. It allows sensors to draw energy
    from solar energy, vibration, or temperature difference. The most widely available
    energy harvesting technique is solar panels and it can be easily obtained. Solar
    panel is affected by the presence of solar irradiance, where the energy harvested
    varies throughout the different time of the day. Contrast to solar farm, the goal
    here is to conserve as much energy, while maintaining the sensing capability of
    the physical sensors. The most notable influence would be the energy management
    architecture as well as the battery capacity and the solar panel efficiency. Apart
    from that, although temperature difference and sensor vibration are capable of
    harvesting energy but it is limited to certain use case and not suitable for general
    usage. Alternately, potential replacement of the traditional energy harvesting
    technique is wireless power transfer. As shown in [228], [229], this method offers
    power to be transferred wirelessly without battery and energy harvesting module.
    Currently, there are different types of wireless power transfer technologies such
    as inductive coupling, capacitive coupling, magnetodynamics coupling, microwaves,
    and light-waves. Each of them has their limitation such as inductive coupling
    only has limited range of transferring energy. That being said, this technology
    is still relatively new, and it requires further investigation in order to guarantee
    its minimum working efficiency for smart city applications. Other than using external
    power sources, low power sensing for carrying out the sensing tasks. In order
    to drive different smart city applications, various standards have been proposed
    for LPWAN, such as LoRaWAN by LoRa Alliance and NB-IoT Release 13 by 3GPP. LoRaWAN
    focuses on the long range IoT connectivity for industrial applications while the
    NB-IoT focuses on the indoor coverage, low cost, long battery life, and stable
    communication in high density communication channel. The main reason to use low
    power sensing approach is due to the high compatibility with large scale deployment
    relying on the low bit rate communication channel usage. However, standardization
    of these protocols remains a challenge in LPWAN due to the possibly of using unlicensed
    spectrum, where organizations may choose not to follow the agreed spectrum. In
    future, low power communication will ensure the long term sensing capability of
    physical sensors in the smart city applications and therefore will improve data
    sources quality. 4.2. Data representation A high speed Internet connection provides
    easy access to many genres of data sources and creates opportunity to study wide
    variety of different data sources. However, large variety of data sources frequently
    indicate the incompatibility of data formats. The problem becomes more obvious
    when there is no standardization on the data format. To tackle such problem, data
    ontology is the building block to represent the data sources to connect different
    sources of data for seamless services integration. If the format of the data source
    cannot be interpreted, it will be marked as useless for the platform integrator.
    Therefore, semantic web has been proposed as an extension to WWW web services
    utilizing Resource Description Framework (RDF) to provide standard data exchange
    formats. It opens the path to create different solutions for the IoT applications
    and it supports the Open Government Data (OGD) principles [230]. To date, there
    are few common ontology languages have been developed such as Delivery Context
    (DCN) [231], Web Ontology Language (OWL) [232], Resource Description Framework
    Schema (RDFS) [233], Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) [234], and others. Majority
    of the ontology languages only focus on one application domain because they are
    not suitable for representing the metadata from other domains. This causes data
    segmentation in the smart city applications, where further increases the gap between
    different smart city domains. Thus, DBpedia [235] is designed to address the aforementioned
    issue using public and private stocks of semantic web. DBpedia has provided solutions
    for the ontology software as it offers different classes and types that are available
    on the Wikipedia. That being said, not all applications adopt the idea of DBpedia
    and there is a fraction of applications remain conservative using proprietary
    data representation. Apart from that, Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)
    [236] v3.1 protocol has been introduced as one of the protocols to address ontology
    problems between brokers. It offers machine to machine (M2M) communication by
    providing lightweight publish and subscribe messaging services, where network
    bandwidth limitation is one of the main constraint. It is possible to combine
    the aforementioned technologies in order to generate a better data integration
    for data fusion purposes across different domains. Therefore, the future agenda
    for the ontology language is to encourage integration of different levels of data
    sources using different system architecture such as edge, fog, and cloud computing.
    4.3. Privacy and security 4.3.1. Privacy Collecting urban residents’ data in a
    smart city application can be challenging due the nature of sensitive data that
    can be misused if poorly managed. As privacy issue has been discussed extensively
    by the authors in [116], [237], [238], misuse of private information may lead
    to catastrophic events such as information theft, or identity fraud. Currently
    in Europe, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as discussed in [239], [240]
    has been proposed to better address the data privacy concern of the Internet.
    In other countries, there are also similar efforts to enforce data privacy protection
    such as Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act
    (PIPEDA), China’s China Data Protection Regulations (CDPR), Singapore’s Personal
    Data Protection Act (PDPA), Japan’s Personal Information Protection Commission
    (PIPC), etc. Meanwhile in USA, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA),
    and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACTA) have been introduced
    to improve with the information flow efficiency across agencies. This is also
    a part of the efforts to prevent sensitive information being available for unauthorized
    parties. Majority of the policies and regulations emphasize on the users’ consent
    for collecting personal data and this can be problematic as not all platforms
    provide ample security for data storage. With insufficient security measurements,
    the data collected may be compromised, which may lead to tainted reputation and
    loss of public faith. For instance, Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal [241]
    has shown potential misuse of user data collected. With that in mind, potential
    right of accessing data sources could be revoked if the data source is not handled
    properly by the right person. Hence, privacy and security should be the responsibility
    for both platforms and users. A thorough review has been conducted in [242], which
    works on the IoT requirements to address privacy issues. Potential solution for
    the aforementioned problem is to use hybrid data fusion technique in a smart city
    application. The idea here is to locally fuse the sensitive information (user
    identity, phone number, bank account number) into generic information, before
    uploading to the cloud for further processing. The benefits of such approach are
    two-folds, which are the ability to offload computational cost and to preserve
    sensitive information at the physical sensor only. In addition, we can leverage
    machine learning approaches such as [243], [244] to generate synthetic datasets
    with identical data characteristic for study purpose. This eliminates the chances
    of private data been leaked out and encourage the openness of datasets to be studied
    by different researchers and data scientists. To draw a clear line between generic
    and sensitive data remains a debate among researchers. In future, the data fusion
    can be applied at the lower level to remove any potential sensitive data. 4.3.2.
    Security According to Kitchin [245], there are two general security concerns in
    the smart city applications, which are security of technology/infrastructure (data
    center, services, and system architecture) and data security (data generation,
    storage, and communication). The security of the technology and infrastructure
    highly relies on the design architecture of the system being deployed. Depending
    on the application requirements, it varies from traditional client server architecture
    to decentralized architecture. The main objective is to deploy a hack-proof/exploit-less
    system architecture. Alternately, there are also ways of improving security of
    system architecture such as incentive/bounty for reporting flaws, simulating injection
    attacks, security assessment from third party, etc. Nowadays, the security enhancement
    focuses towards continuous effort as the technology has been changing rapidly.
    For instance, different security strategies [246], [247], [248] try to enhance
    security of the smart city application''s architecture by focusing on the common
    security standards/practices/protocols. This shows that as the number of smart
    city applications increase rapidly, system architectures implemented with the
    security design in mind become apparent with good practices and standard architecture
    design. Subsequently, regular security assessment and auditing also pave way for
    a safer smart city applications deployment. Meanwhile, data security also contributes
    to the significant part of smart city applications ecosystem from generation,
    storage, and communication. The common method to combat such issue is leveraging
    encryption techniques, where it encodes the data so that only the authorized parties
    have access to it. For instance in [249], Wang et al. have introduced an attribute
    based encryption scheme, which it allows fine-grained access control, scalable
    key management, and flexible data distribution. In addition, encryption also can
    be used in the communication platform between IoT devices in smart city application
    as shown in [250], [251] to prevent information hijacking. Despite constant effort
    of cyber security researchers developing new security schemes, the numbers of
    data breaches and cyber threats increase every year according to David et al.
    [252]. The main culprit of such occurrence is due to negligence of data security
    practices/implementation. Security often appears to be an afterthought in deployment
    of a smart city application. Thus, in order to combat such threat, the smart city
    application should comply with security standards as shown in [253] to mitigate
    the chances of becoming a victim. 4.4. Data fusion techniques Extracting knowledge
    from a smart city application frequently involves data mining techniques in order
    to fuse different data sources. Lower tier data fusion techniques have been well
    explored in [39] and the current research trend focuses more on the machine learning
    approach. The main reason why machine learning approach has gained so much attention
    is due to its capability of handling high dimensional data. The problem of high
    dimensional data is also known as curse of dimensionality as described by Bellman
    [254]. In this context, we discuss two research trends on applying machine learning
    techniques in data fusion as follows: 4.4.1. Explainable deep neural network Lately,
    supervised machine learning techniques focus on the DNN, where the in-depth reviews
    of the recent development can be found in [255], [256], [257]. Major research
    efforts aim to increase the explainability of the model such as NN, CNN, and DNN
    rather than using them as black box models. To this end, explainable AI (XAI)
    [258] is the new motivation for data scientists to explore the interpretable learning
    paradigm of the modeling in order to provide a semantic meaning behind modeling
    logic. This new learning process has driven three big fields in the deep learning
    domains, which are (1) Deep Explanation, (2) Interpretable Model, and (3) Model
    Induction. To develop a deep explanation on the model interpretation, the cognitive
    layers will act as an intermediate layer between learning and explanation layer
    in order to cast the learned abstractions, policies, and clusters information
    into an explainable format. Subsequently, the interpretable model such as Bayesian
    learning [259] can be built to explain the uncertainties required when developing
    the deep learning models to learn the choices of a learning process. Alternate
    approach has proposed to use subspace approximation with an adjusted bias technique
    [260] to build interpretable CNN, which uses feed forward design to better explain
    the model’s choice in allocating certain hyper-parameters. Meanwhile, model induction
    refers to the technique used for inferring the model’s decision and learning progress.
    Through a thorough understanding of the model, parameters can be fine-tuned to
    increase the learning optimization rate in a long-term application deployment.
    Hence, the search of XAI is an important milestone for the data scientists, which
    can be used to explain the learning process and the decision machine learning
    made. An example of potential use case would be trying to understand the reason
    behind (also known as reasoning in some literatures) the predictive maintenance
    decision machine learning rather than performing maintenance due to the result
    of predictive algorithm. 4.4.2. Unsupervised data fusion In the smart city applications,
    collecting the ground truth could be proven challenging due to the uncertainties
    and errors in the collected data sources. Hence, obtaining labels or data annotation
    are another problems with certain data sources. Despite the rapid development
    of advanced modeling tools like DNN, it still requires labels and data annotation
    in order to achieve objectives of extracting higher information. There are a few
    approaches that address the lack of labels such as manual annotation, crowd labeling,
    software annotation, and pattern labeling. However, manual annotation only works
    well with a small dataset while other approaches do not guarantee the correctness
    of end result. This shows a big research gap to seek a better way to label data
    sources accurately. Research works such as Zhou et al. [261], [262] have attempted
    to fix unlabeled data by transforming them into useful features to achieve certain
    objectives. Traditionally, raw data is required to be preprocessed into something
    meaningful, but it still suffers from the need of data cleansing and amputation.
    The simplest method would be to solely depend on the filtering technique. However,
    aggressive filtering may remove large amount of raw data resulting potential loss
    of knowledge. Another simple solution is to increase the number of reliable data
    sources to be fused to create potential annotation. Increasing data sources often
    indicates an increment of the overall deployment cost. Alternative solution to
    the increased deployment cost is to use transfer learning [263], where the knowledge
    from existing domain can be transferred to other domain to learn from it. 4.4.3.
    Emergence of hybrid model The emergence of the hybrid models has become common
    due to wide variety of data sources available. It allows different levels of data
    sources (high, low, or both) to combine in order to create potential insights
    in a particular domain. It also helps to solve the data privacy problem along
    with machine learning technique, which has opened up many opportunities for researchers
    and data scientist to study on these big data collected. One example of the hybrid
    model is shown as follows: an urban planning system has different data sources
    as input such as human comfort factor index (environmental ambient sensors), positive
    urban city factor (feedback data on urban area such as greenery, surrounding amenities,
    recreational parks, and others), and cyber data (social media input) to design
    a fully automated urban planning system by fulfilling predefined criteria. The
    result from the data fusion needs to be explainable as discussed in the previous
    XAI for understanding choices made by the automation software. In this example,
    different tiers of data sources are fused using data sources types (D1, D2) and
    the result is some features. Eventually, these features will be combined to generate
    a potential plan for city through computation modeling (D3, D4). By joining different
    data sources, simulation can be used concurrently to verify the performance of
    urban planning system before deploying to the city. In future, implementation
    of the hybrid model will become a general trend due to wide availability of the
    data sources and processing platforms. As mentioned in the discussion, data ontology
    is another key factor to allow data sources to be connected from different platforms
    to provide knowledge for the smart city applications. 5. Conclusion This paper
    presents an overall view of the data fusion techniques found in the smart city
    applications. Easy accessibility of the data sources has paved way for data fusion
    in different smart city applications in various forms. The increasing trends of
    data fusion in the smart city applications create the need for a new evaluation
    method. Therefore, we propose a multi-perspectives classification for the smart
    city applications that involve data fusion techniques. The data fusion classification
    based on multi-perspectives introduced in this paper are: (1) Fusion Objectives,
    (2) Fusion Techniques, (3) Data Input and Output Types, (4) Data Source Types,
    (5) Data Fusion Scales, and (6) System Architecture. Using the proposed multi-perspectives,
    we evaluated some selected works in the smart city applications and we also discussed
    the research trend for each domain respectively. Next, we also discuss four open
    research directions of data fusion in a smart city application such as data quality,
    data representation, data privacy & security, and data fusion technique. Overall,
    we are certain that generic nature of the multi-perspectives classification is
    able to perform well with various smart city applications for different domains
    that leverage the data fusion techniques. In addition, an in-depth analysis can
    be further extended onto individual domain to study the common requirements and
    techniques applied, which we do not include in this paper due to limited paper
    length. A successful smart city application is built on top of the data (also
    known as data-driven architecture) and data fusion has provided a wide variety
    of techniques to improve the input data for an application. Therefore, data fusion
    has opened the path for various applications to gain insights about the city.
    This also holds the key for a smart city to further understand and improve the
    domains that it is lacking. Acknowledgement The research work was supported in

    in industrial plants for critical operations. Stator faults, bearing faults, or
    rotor faults can lead to unplanned downtime with associated cost and safety implications.
    Different sensors may be used to monitor the health state of induction motors
    with each sensor typically being better suited for diagnosing different faults.
    Condition monitoring approaches that fuse data from multiple sensors have the
    potential to diagnose a greater number of faults. In this paper, a sensor fusion
    approach based on the combination of a two-stage Bayesian method and principal
    component analysis (PCA) is proposed for diagnosing both electrical and mechanical
    faults in induction motors. Acoustic, electric, and vibration signals are gathered
    from motors operating under different loading conditions and health states. The
    inclusion of the PCA step ensures robustness to varying loading conditions. The
    obtained results highlight that the proposed method performs better than the equivalent
    single-stage or feature-based Bayesian methods. Published in: IEEE Transactions

    I. Introduction Induction motors are widely used in industrial plants for critical
    operations, where a failure could result in a partial or complete shutdown of
    the production process. Unplanned maintenance, downtime, or replacements can result
    in high costs and, furthermore, critical failures can have serious safety implications.
    Induction motor faults may be categorized as electrical related, mechanical related,
    or environmental related [1]. The range of possible faults is numerous, with stator,
    bearing, and rotor faults being the most prevalent [2]–[4]. These faults will
    impact the mechanical, magnetic, and electrical characteristics of the induction
    motor in different ways. As a result, the optimal sensor type for diagnosing one
    type of fault mode may not be the same as the optimal sensor to diagnose another
    fault mode. It has previously been shown that specific induction motor faults
    can be diagnosed using different sensors [5]–[8]. Vibration, acoustic, and electric
    signals are among the most commonly used sensor types for rotor and stator faults
    detection, however some sensors are more suitable for detecting specific faults
    than others [7], [8]. Nandi [5] observed that acoustic and vibration signals are
    the most sensitive for bearing fault detection, whereas electric signals are more
    sensitive to broken rotor bar faults. It has recently been shown that acoustic
    signals are suitable for bearing, stator, and rotor fault diagnostics of single-phase
    and three-phase induction motors [9], [10]. Additionally, sensors that are responsive
    to a specific fault can also provide information about other faults [6]. Hence,
    a condition-monitoring system that fuses information obtained from multiple sensor
    types can ensure that a comprehensive range of fault modes may potentially be
    detected quickly and accurately. Various condition-monitoring methods that aim
    to increase the accuracy and robustness of fault detection via sensor fusion have
    been reported. In [11], neural networks were used to fuse vibration and current
    signals in order to diagnose mechanical and electrical faults. It was shown that
    these signal types are complementary to one another and that their fusion using
    the Dempster–Shafer theory at the decision level increases the accuracy of the
    classification. A K-nearest neighbor classifier was applied in [12] using an accelerometer
    and load signals in order to diagnose bearing faults, showing that, whereas load
    signals are more useful in distinguishing healthy bearings from faulty ones and
    accelerometer signals are better at detecting the location of the fault, the best
    performance was achieved when the two signals were fused together. In [13], vibration
    and acoustic signals were fused using the Dempster–Shafer theory at the decision
    level to diagnose faults in planetary gearboxes, with the fusion resulting in
    more precise diagnostics along with reduced false and missed alarm rates. In [14],
    vibration, acoustic, and oil debris signals were fused at the feature level to
    diagnose faults in gears with principal component analysis (PCA) and independent
    component analysis. In each aforementioned case, the sensor fusion proved to increase
    the accuracy, robustness, and missed or false alarm rate of the system. Sensor
    fusion can be implemented at the data level, the feature level, and at the decision
    level. The decision on the abstraction level depends on the information carried
    by the different signals. If the signal types are significantly different and
    carry complementary information, it is advised to use decision-level fusion [11],
    [15]. A typical challenge encountered when creating decision-level fusion algorithms
    is that there are often a large number of features relative to the number of observations.
    These features can be highly correlated, which ultimately can bias the results
    of the fault detection algorithm. A common method to reduce the correlation and
    the dimensionality of the features is PCA [16], [17]. For example, in [18], the
    dimensionality of features extracted from vibration and current signals was reduced
    by PCA before applying genetic algorithms and an artificial neural network for
    classifying faults in an induction motor. It was found that the performance of
    the fault classifier was improved by adding PCA as a feature preprocessing step.
    In [19], several feature reduction and transformation methods including neighborhood
    component analysis, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), locally linear coordination,
    and PCA were compared with maximally collapsing metric learning for multiple bearing
    fault diagnosis in induction motors with particular focus given to the dimensionality
    reduction aspect. Feature reduction is also found in multistage frameworks for
    the induction motor diagnosis, for example, a recent work [20] applied PCA, LDA,
    a genetic algorithm, and the Fisher score in a hybrid strategy to obtain a reduced
    and optimized feature set from vibration signals. Another regularly observed fault
    detection problem is the varying operating conditions of the machines, which can
    originate from a change in the load or environmental conditions. In [21], it was
    concluded that the prediction performance of a support vector machine (SVM) based
    fault detection algorithm for mechanical and electrical fault detections in induction
    motors is load dependent. Different severities of stator faults were monitored
    in induction motors under changing load torque and supply voltage unbalances in
    [22], finding that the performance of a multiagent system and neural estimator
    depends on the severity of the fault. Diagnostics and prognostics methods of rotating
    machinery were reviewed in [23], highlighting the operating condition dependence
    of algorithms as an existing but an understudied area. Bayesian inference has
    been described as a suitable method for fault detection and fault classification
    in condition-monitoring systems [23], [24]. Recently, Jaramillo et al. [25] proposed
    a two-stage Bayesian inference approach to monitor the condition of a system composed
    of several subsystems. The first stage of the sensor fusion takes place at the
    subsystem level, whereas the second stage fuses the result of the first stage
    at the decision level in order to determine the health state of the whole system.
    The method was efficient in diagnosing faults in complex systems composed of interacting
    components. Existing two-stage Bayesian sensor fusion frameworks described in
    the literature [25], [26] typically set alarm thresholds according to the probability
    distributions of features and control limits. Properly tuning alarm thresholds
    can be challenging, particularly when there are a large number of features in
    the data set, or when the thresholds themselves might optimally be described as
    a function of other parameters (e.g., operating conditions). This paper is an
    extension of the previous work in which a two-stage Bayesian sensor fusion method
    was applied to the diagnosis of mechanical faults in induction motors [26]. It
    was shown that, by fusing independent diagnoses of different sensor types at the
    decision level, the false and missed alarm rates of a fault classification algorithm
    could be significantly reduced. In [26], simple linear models of expected feature
    values relative to load values were applied to account for the load dependence
    of features. Such an approach limits the generality of the solution as the loading
    of the system is also required as an input to the algorithm during training and
    testing. It was also observed that the features used for training the Naïve Bayes
    classifier were highly correlated. As previously noted, such correlations between
    features can potentially bias the fault detection algorithm toward certain diagnoses.
    In this paper, a two-stage (local and global) Bayesian method combined with PCA
    is proposed as a method for diagnosing not only mechanical but also electrical
    faults in induction motors operating under varying load and environmental conditions.
    Stator, rotor, and bearing faults are all considered. Features are extracted from
    acoustic, electric, and vibration signals recorded from an experimental system.
    PCA is used to remove the correlations that are present in the extracted features
    and reduce the influence of load conditions. At the local Bayesian stage, principal
    components of the features are fused with a Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB) classifier.
    At the global Bayesian stage, the results of the local stages are fused in order
    to create a final diagnosis. The generality of the algorithm is investigated by
    omitting data recorded at selected operating and environmental conditions from
    the training set and subsequently testing the trained model using the omitted
    data. The novelties of this paper are as follows. A two-stage Bayesian sensor
    fusion approach is extended by integrating PCA and GNB classifiers into the framework.
    It is known that many fault indicators are dependent on loading conditions. By
    incorporating a multivariate statistical approach into the analysis, the correlations
    between operating conditions and feature level are accounted for. It is shown
    that the resulting method is able to accurately diagnose faults even for loading
    conditions not present in the training set. In this paper, additional data addressing
    stator faults with varying severity are included into the analysis. This data
    is used to illustrate how, by fusing the different signals, it is possible to
    achieve a holistic monitoring solution that both provide greater coverage and
    greater monitoring accuracy compared to considering each sensor independently.
    Through the addition of PCA and the GNB classifier, the approach introduced in
    this paper does not require monitoring thresholds to be defined, as the posterior
    fault class probabilities are directly calculated. This paper is organized as
    follows. In Section II, the methods are introduced. In Section III, the experimental
    data are described, which were used for the validation of the methods. Section
    IV describes the implementation of the methods using the experimental data. The
    results of the proposed fault diagnosis method are presented in Section V with
    a discussion in Section VI. Finally, in Section VII, conclusions are drawn, pointing
    out the advantages, limitations of the method, and possible future work. SECTION
    II. Methods A. Principal Component Analysis PCA is a well-established method for
    feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, data compression, and data visualization
    [27]. It is a common problem in data analysis that the features or attributes
    of the observation data are highly correlated. PCA transforms the correlated features
    to a linear space where the transformed features are uncorrelated and are ordered
    in a way that the first features retain most of the variation in the data. Singular
    value decomposition or eigenvalue decomposition (EIG) are popular algorithms for
    performing PCA. Here, SVD is considered, as it is numerically more robust when
    matrices are either singular or numerically very close to singular. Furthermore,
    SVD directly provides the required scores and loadings. If X is an n × m matrix
    with rank r, with n observations and m features, SVD is defined as follows: X=UL
    A T (1) View Source where U is an n × r orthonormal matrix, L is an r × r diagonal
    matrix, and A is an m × r orthonormal matrix. UL is an n × r matrix, containing
    the transformed uncorrelated features in the principal component space, usually
    referenced as scores. A contains the principal components, sometimes called loadings.
    For further information on PCA and SVD, readers are guided to [27]. B. GNB Classifiers
    A GNB classifier is a probabilistic classifier, which assumes conditional independence
    between data that are distributed according to a Gaussian distribution. The classifier
    uses the Bayes theorem to calculate the posterior probabilities that an observation
    x t ={ x 1 , x 2 ,…, x m } belongs to class c i out of classes C={ c 1 , c 2 ,…,
    c p } in the following way: P( c i | x t )= P( c i )⋅ ∏ m j=1 P( x j | c i ) ∑
    n k=1 P( c k )⋅ ∏ m j=1 P( x j | c k ) (2) View Source where P( c i ) is the prior
    probability of an observation belonging to class c i . The classifier learns the
    P( x j | c i ) conditional probabilities that a given feature value x j belongs
    to class c i from a training dataset. By assuming a Gaussian distribution of the
    features, the conditional probabilities may be obtained using the values of mean
    and standard deviation of the labeled training data for each class as follows:
    P( x j | c i ( μ i,j , σ i,j ))= 1 σ i,j 2π − − √ ⋅ e − ( x j − μ i,j ) 2 2 σ
    i,j 2 . (3) View Source Once the posterior probabilities are calculated for all
    of the classes, the observation x t will be classified into the class that has
    the highest posterior probability. Equation (2) can be simplified by omitting
    the normalization factor in the denominator, as only the index of the maximum
    a posteriori (MAP) class is important for the classification P( c i | x t )∝ c
    predicted = P( c i )⋅ ∏ j=1 m P( x j | c i ) argmax{P( C ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ | x t ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯
    ¯ )}. (4) (5) View Source For further reference regarding GNB classifiers, readers
    are guided to, for example, [28]–[30]. C. PCA and Two-Stage Bayesian Sensor Fusion
    The proposed two-stage Bayesian sensor fusion method combined with PCA is an extension
    of a previous work [26]. In this paper, the algorithm is updated to include a
    preprocessing PCA step. PCA was selected as it is able to mitigate feature correlation
    that can bias the likelihood calculations. It is a linear method that yields a
    reduced and uncorrelated feature set. Instead of the original features, uncorrelated
    principal components are fused using a GNB classifier. The number of principal
    components considered for each signal type is calculated using the validation
    set in a way that the performance of the algorithm is maximized while the false
    and missed alarm rates are reduced, using the detection accuracy as an optimization
    parameter. The method retains the structure of the global fusion stage on the
    decision level, as described in [26]. The advantage of applying the GNB classifier
    at the local stage is that there is no need to determine alarm thresholds and
    confidence intervals, as the GNB classifier calculates the fault class probabilities
    directly. D. Description of the Local Stage The proposed algorithm is suited for
    condition-monitoring problems where N different sensors provide measurement data
    for the determination of the health state of the system. For training, the algorithm
    requires data that has been labeled with M fault conditions. If there is a test
    set available, the data has to be split into two separate datasets for training:
    the training set and the validation set. The training set will be used for the
    training of the GNB classifiers at the local stage, whereas the validation set
    will produce the confusion matrices for the different sensor types at the global
    fusion stage. Once the data are cleaned and selected features are extracted, the
    features are split by sensor type. At this stage, the training set takes the form
    of an n × m matrix, where n is the number of observations and m is the number
    of features. The μ Ai,Sj means and σ Ai,Sj standard deviations are calculated
    for each A i feature and S j sensor type. A normalization step transforms the
    features such that the means are 0 and the standard deviations are 1. PCA calculates
    the S C Sj scores and L O Sj loadings for each sensor type. The scores, which
    might also be considered as the new “features,” are uncorrelated. The L O Sj loadings
    are calculated using the whole training set containing both healthy and faulty
    data. To calculate the conditional probabilities of the GNB according to (3),
    the μ Ai,Sj,Ck means and σ Ai,Sj,Ck standard deviations of the principal components
    are calculated for each C k fault type in the labeled data. Next, the validation
    set is used in both to find the optimal number of principal components and to
    calculate the confusion matrices using μ Ai,Sj , σ Ai,Sj , μ Ai,Sj,Ck , σ Ai,Sj,Ck
    , and L O Sj from the training data. The features in the validation set are normalized
    using μ Ai,Sj and σ Ai,Sj . The normalized features are transformed to the principal
    components space using the L O Sj loadings. To find the number of principal components
    for each S j sensor type, an iterative step is considered as follows. The first
    i principal components are used as features, calculating the posterior probabilities
    and class predictions for each observation in the validation set using (3)–(5).
    Count the correct predictions and save it for i. Once the iteration has finished,
    the value of i resulting in the highest number of correct predictions is chosen
    for the number of principal components used to calculate the predictions for each
    observation in the validation set. E. Description of the Global Stage The prediction
    counts for each fault type are organized in an M × M global confusion matrix G
    Si for each sensor type S i where the rows represent the actual condition, the
    columns represent the diagnosed condition, and the prediction counts by rows are
    divided by the total number of actual conditions for the fault type. The matrix
    elements can be interpreted as P( F i | F j ) conditional probabilities; given
    that the algorithm predicted F j , what is the probability that the actual fault
    condition is F i ? The P( F i | F i ) probabilities, located along the diagonal
    of the confusion matrix for each sensor type, represent the probability that the
    sensor diagnosed the corresponding fault correctly G S i = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ P( F 1 | F 1
    ) … P( F M | F 1 ) … P( F i | F i ) … P( F 1 | F M ) … P( F M | F M ) ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ .
    (6) View Source The test set is separate from the training set and is divided
    by sensor type into N sets, with observations in rows and features in columns.
    The test set is normalized and the GNB classifier is calculated with the optimized
    number of principal components. The fault class predictions of the GNB classifier
    for an observation are fused by (7) and (8) using the appropriate columns from
    the global confusion matrices for each sensor type. P( c i ) represents a priori
    knowledge; if no prior distribution is available, a uniform distribution is supposed.
    If the fault class predicted by S1 is F i and fault class predicted by S M is
    F j , then columns have to be selected in the following way from the corresponding
    confusion matrices: G S 1, F i = c predicted = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ P( F 1 | F i ) … P( F M |
    F i ) ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ,…, G S M , F j = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ P( F 1 | F j ) … P( F M | F j ) ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ argmax{P(
    c i )⋅ ∏ i=1,j=1 M,N G S i, F j }. (7) (8) View Source For each fault class, the
    output of the global fusion step is a posterior probability giving the likelihood
    of that fault class being present in the system. For the purposes of evaluating
    the performance of the algorithm, we consider the final prediction as being the
    fault class that has the highest posterior probability after the global fusion
    step (8). F. Testing an Observation The overall flow diagram of the proposed two-stage
    Bayesian sensor fusion method for testing an observation is shown in Fig. 1. At
    the local stage, each type of sensor is handled separately. For a given sensor
    type, features are fused in order to obtain a prediction of the most likely health
    state of the system, given the data recorded by that sensor type. At the global
    stage, the predictions of the most likely health state for each sensor type are
    fused using the global confusion matrix to create the global diagnosis result.

    III. Experimental Data The measurement set up for the experiment is shown in Fig.
    2. Experimental data were collected from three identical induction motors, differing
    only in terms of health state: one motor was healthy, one had two broken rotor
    bars, and one had an outer raceway fault in a bearing. It was also possible to
    seed stator faults into the nominally healthy motor, as described in [31]. The
    test motors were 0.8 kW, four-pole SZJKe 14a induction motors manufactured by
    TAMEL with a nominal rotor speed of 1400 r/min. The nominal values of voltage,
    current, rated torque, and power factor for these motors were 380 V, 2.2 A, 5.45
    N·m, and 0.74, respectively. The motor had a Y winding configuration with 4 coils
    per phase, 22 rotor bars, and 24 stator slots. The rotor inertia was 0.0025 kg·m2
    and the motor bearings were SKF type 6304 ZZ CXSQ. An eddy current brake was used
    to load the motor. The measurements were conducted at steady-state operation under
    different loading conditions. For each fault case between three and five loading
    conditions were tested, resulting in stator currents of 68%, 81%, 90%, 100%, and
    113% of nominal values. Measurements were recorded both with and without background
    noise generated by a separate shaker. Datasets for eight different health conditions
    were recorded, denoted as F0–F7, as follows: F0—Healthy motor; F1—Stator fault:
    Phase one bypassed in the first phase; F2—Stator fault: Phase one bypassed in
    half of the first phase; F3—Stator fault: Phase–phase short circuit; F4—Stator
    fault: Phase–phase short circuit with an offset point; F5—Stator fault: Break
    of half of the phase one; F6—Rotor fault: Two broken rotor bars; F7—Bearing fault:
    Outer raceway defect. Fig. 2. Schematic of the experimental system. Show All The
    tested motor was rewound in such a way that instead of coils for a given phase
    being directly connected to one another, the individual coils were connected to
    a switchboard allowing the winding configuration to be quickly changed. Furthermore,
    in six coils, special taps were created in order to allow different short circuits
    to be seeded. Such a configuration allows various stator faults to be seeded,
    as was investigated in [29] for the same SZJKe 14a induction motor. For F1 and
    F2, the first phase was bypassed by a 15 Ω resistance causing a short circuit
    in the first phase winding. For F3 and F4, a short circuit of two stator phases
    in the taps connected in the middle of the first coils was seeded by adding a
    115 Ω resistance. In the case of F5, part of the coil was not connected causing
    asymmetry in the winding, so that the current did not flow through a part of the
    winding. The two broken rotor bars (F6) were located next to one another. The
    bearing fault (F7) was caused by an incision through the outer ring of the bearing.
    Acoustic, electric, and vibration signals were collected using five different
    sensor types. Three G.R.A.S. 46AE microphones were used to measure the sound pressure
    levels. A Model USP regular three-dimensional Sound Intensity Microflown probe
    was also used to collect acoustic signals from the motors. The probe provided
    four measurement signals, three particle velocity signals in three orthogonal
    directions and a sound pressure signal. The vibration signals were measured by
    a three-axis PCB ICP accelerometer Model No. 356B18 and a one-axis PCB ICP accelerometer
    Model No. 353B32, providing four signals in total in unit g. The three phase voltages
    were measured by LV 25-P voltage transducers providing signals directly for analysis
    of voltage characteristics. The motor currents were measured by LTS-6NP and LEM
    HY 5-P current transducers. The following signals were collected using a 16-channel
    LMS Scada Mobile System: 4 microflown signals, 3 microphone signals, 2 current
    signals, 4 vibration signals, and 3 voltage signals. Data were collected with
    a 51.2-kHz sampling rate to capture all frequencies of interest with 30 s of data
    being recorded for each configuration to capture a sufficiently long steady-state
    periods for analysis. 58 datasets were obtained: one for each tested loading condition,
    both with and without additional background noise. The same background noise was
    applied over the tests. The microflown axis X probe has measured an average 47.26
    m/s particle velocity with no noise, whereas it has measured an average 88.69
    m/s particle velocity with noise for the healthy motor under nominal load. SECTION
    IV. Implementation of the Method The 58 datasets were split into 0.5-s observations
    resulting in 60 observations for 1 dataset and 3480 observations in total. For
    each signal, and for each 0.5-s observation, the following time-domain features
    were extracted: root mean square (rms), skewness, kurtosis, maximum peak, peak-to-peak,
    and crest factor. Features were also extracted from both the amplitude spectrum
    and the envelope spectrum of the signal: the frequency center, spectrum area,
    the amplitude of the components at the first two harmonics of the supply frequency
    (50, 100), the first three harmonics of the rotation speed (1×, 2×, 3×), the amplitude
    ratios (2×/1×, 3×/1×), and the amplitude at the sidebands of the supply frequency
    (50 Hz ± 2 × slip, 50 Hz ± rotation speed). The 0.5-s window length provided a
    2-Hz spectral resolution. While no windowing functions were applied in the calculation
    of the spectra, edge effects were found to be minimal. In total, 30 features were
    extracted for the 16 signals, resulting in 480 features in total. These time-
    and frequency-domain features are standard metrics, commonly used for the condition
    monitoring of induction motors [11], [21], [32]. It should be noted that for all
    signal types, all of the above-mentioned feature types were extracted. No additional
    feature selection approaches were applied. Fig. 3 shows the relative rms values
    of five different signal types extracted from 0.5-s measurement windows, for all
    observations through the 58 datasets. It may be observed that the sensors reacted
    to the fault modes and loading conditions in different ways. For example, the
    rms current is increased for stator fault modes F3 and F4, whereas the rms vibration
    did not significantly react. Conversely, in the case of the rotor fault F6, the
    vibration signal exhibited increased rms values, whereas the rms current did not
    show significant increases. This further illustrates that different faults are
    more easily diagnosed by different sensors. The 480 features of the 3480 observations
    were grouped by signal types into five groups, namely vibration features, current
    features, microflown features, microphone features, and voltage features. The
    data were then split into a training set, a validation set, and a test set, in
    the same way for the five signal types. The division is described in Section V.
    The training sets were used to train the local stage, the validation sets were
    used to calculate the global confusion matrices for the global fusion stage, and
    finally, the test sets were used to test the performance of the algorithm. All
    analyses were conducted in MATLAB. Fig. 3. Relative rms values of 5 different
    signal types extracted from 0.5-s measurement windows, for all observations through
    the 58 datasets. Show All SECTION V. Results In order to illustrate the performance
    of the described algorithm with respect to different loading and environmental
    noise conditions, the experimental data were divided into different training,
    validation, and test sets. In Test Case A, a random split was applied. In Test
    Cases B and C, eight entire datasets (one from each fault case) were included
    in the test set with no datasets from experiments conducted at this loading condition
    being considered in the training or validation sets. In Test Case B, the lowest
    load datasets with no background noise are the test set. In Test Case D, the highest
    load datasets with background noise are the test set. The aim of testing different
    divisions for testing, validation, and training is to observe the performance
    of the algorithm under different operating conditions, particularly under loading
    conditions that were not considered during model training. A. Test Case A: Random
    Split Test Case A was used to evaluate the overall performance of the algorithm.
    The total 3480 observations were randomly split into training set, validation
    set, and test set with a respective ratio of 60-20-20%. The random split was applied
    100 times and the averaged results are shown in Table I. The columns represent
    the conditions diagnosed by the algorithm, whereas the rows represent the actual
    fault conditions of the motors. The healthy motor was correctly diagnosed in 94%
    of the cases with a 6% false alarm rate in case of F2 stator fault. Missed alarms
    are present for F2, however it is only 2%. F2 is the least severe fault among
    the seven seeded faults, which explains this behavior. The successful detection
    rate is above 98% for all fault cases, with 100% success rate for F1, F5, F6,
    and F7. Among the stator faults, the following scenario can be observed: F3 and
    F4 are sometimes misdiagnosed as each other, as they are the variations of the
    same fault: F3 is the phase–phase short-circuit, whereas F4 is the phase–phase
    short circuit with an offset point. To give an overall measure of the test accuracy,
    the F1 score is calculated to be 99.32%. TABLE I Test Case A: Random Split B.
    Test Case B: Lowest Load and No Noise In Test Case B, the test set was formed
    of data taken from the lowest loading conditions, with no datasets from experiments
    conducted at this loading condition being considered in the training or validation
    sets. The aim was to test the performance of the algorithm under load conditions
    that are lower than those contained within the training and validation sets. The
    results are shown in Table II. The accuracy of the algorithm was 100% when diagnosing
    the healthy condition (F0); there were no false alarms. When diagnosing broken
    rotor bars and bearing faults (F6 and F7), the algorithm performed with 100% accuracy.
    However, the performance for the stator faults needs further analysis: while faults
    F1 and F3 are diagnosed with the success rates of 97% and 100%, faults F2, F4,
    and F5 were identified less reliably. The algorithm was able to diagnose the F2
    stator fault in only 57% of the cases. In 43% of the cases, the algorithm misdiagnosed
    F2, either as healthy or as the other similar stator faults F1 and F5. This was
    because F2, as the least severe fault, was the most difficult to diagnose. The
    algorithm was also unable to distinguish between fault modes F4 and F5, in 20%
    and 13% of the cases, respectively. F5 was also mistakenly diagnosed as other
    stator faults phase one bypassed in 10% of the cases. This result indicates that
    in the case of loading conditions lower than those seen in the training datasets,
    the algorithm can accurately determine the type of fault, however it is unable
    to accurately ascertain the severity of the fault. TABLE II Test Case B: Lowest
    Load and No Noise C. Test Case C: Highest Load With Noise Test Case C used datasets
    recorded for the highest loading conditions with background noise as the test
    set, with no data from this loading condition being considered in the training.
    This test case investigates the performance of the algorithm for loading conditions
    exceeding those considered in the training set and for unique environmental conditions,
    specifically when the background noise is at increased levels. The results are
    shown in Table III. The correct diagnosis of the healthy motor was 100%, as well
    as the diagnosis for F1, F4, F5, F6, and F7. In case of stator fault F2, there
    is a 2% missed alarm rate. In case of stator fault F3, the algorithm misdiagnoses
    F3 as F4 in 8% of the cases. These phenomena are similar to those observed in
    Test Case A: the stator faults are less severe and less easy to diagnose. Due
    to fault similarities, the algorithm can sometimes misdiagnose stator fault severities
    or confuse them with the healthy motor. The F1 score is 99.88%, which is even
    higher than the random split test case. TABLE III Test Case C: Highest Load With
    Noise D. Principal Components The number of principal components is shown in Table
    IV for each signal type together with the variance explained to complement the
    results in the above-presented test cases. In case of the random split in Test
    Case A, the variance explained by the chosen principal components is always above
    90%. In case of Test Case B and C, the number of chosen principal components is
    less than for Test Case A. This is due to the specific loading and noise conditions
    chosen for the test sets. TABLE IV Number of Principal Components and Variance
    Explained The first few principal components have been analyzed for all signal
    types to determine if there is any feature that dominates the principal component
    coefficients in the loading matrix. It was found that there was no single feature
    that would stand out for any signal type, therefore the importance of PCA for
    correlation reduction is further confirmed. Fig. 4 shows the first principal components
    of the five signal types, for all observations through the 58 datasets. The principal
    component values were obtained from the normalized feature values as described
    in Section II-D. In comparison to Fig. 3, where the rms of the five signal types
    are shown, it may be observed that the load dependence of the signals is less
    evident in the principal components. This further justifies the application of
    PCA for problems where the analyzed problem contains data from several loading
    conditions. Fig. 4. First principal components of the 5 different signal types,
    for all observations through the 58 datasets, the rms of the current is given
    as reference for the loading conditions. Show All Fig. 5 presents the histograms
    and underlying Gaussian distributions of the first principal component of the
    vibration signal by fault conditions. The distributions for each fault types have
    distinct mean and variance values and are not significantly different from Gaussian
    distributions. It can be observed that F6 and F7 are the most distinguishable
    from F0, whereas the other stator faults have overlaps with F0. It should be noted
    that F0 shows the evidence of multimodal behavior. This is due to the additional
    background noise incorporated to investigate the influence of different environmental
    conditions on the accuracy of diagnosis. However, as shown in Sections V-A–V-C,
    this noise did not significantly influence the resulting likelihood calculations.

    component of the vibration signal by fault conditions. Show All E. Single-Stage
    Data Fusion A comparison of the performance of the two-stage approach relative
    to a more standard single-stage approach, where sensors are not separated according
    to type, but instead all fused in a single stage, was performed. The total 3480
    observations were randomly split according to the conventional 70–30% partition
    to training set and test set. The random split was applied 100 times to a single-stage
    approach and the averaged results are shown in Table V. The results show that
    the performance of the single-stage algorithm significantly drops compared to
    the results of the two-stage method shown in Table I. The most significant difference
    appears in the reduced successful detection of the healthy motor, with the single-stage
    approach yielding false alarms in 91% of test cases. The F1 score is 92%. TABLE
    V Single-Stage Data Fusion F. Comparison of Results With SVM To provide a quantitative
    comparison with another classifier, the proposed PCA and two-stage Bayesian method
    is compared with the well-known SVM. Test Case A, B, and C are repeated using
    the default fitcecoc MATLAB implementation of the SVM for multiclass problems
    with one against one classification strategy and a linear kernel function. The
    F1 scores are compared. Similarly to the investigation described in Section V-F,
    the SVM was applied in a single stage. A 70-30% data split was applied and repeated
    100 times resulting in a 99.96% F1 score for Test Case A. This result is 0.64%
    better than that of the proposed method. For Test Case B, the F1 score for the
    SVM was 96.15%, which is 1.84% below than what was achieved with the newly proposed
    method. For Test Case C, the F1 score for the SVM was 97.8%, which is 2.08% below
    than what was achieved with the newly proposed method. While the performance of
    the two approaches is comparable, an advantage of PCA and two-stage Bayesian method
    lies in its transparency and modularity. Furthermore, the method also provided
    a marginally improved performance in the case of environmental and loading conditions
    not contained in the training set, as shown in Test Cases B and C. G. Signal Types
    Separately Versus Two-Stage Fusion Table VI shows the performance of only considering
    a single-stage fusion of features from a single-signal type, for the random split
    Test Case A. For comparison, the equivalent performance from the two-stage approach,
    which fuses the data from all sensors types in the global fusion stage, is also
    given. Results are given in terms of proportion of correct diagnoses, which are
    equivalent to the values on the diagonal of the previously presented results (see
    Tables I–III). It is evident that the two-stage data fusion of multiple signal
    types outperforms the equivalent results when only considering a single-signal
    type. This is due to the fact that the different sensor types have different strengths
    and weaknesses. For example, it may be observed that the analysis based only on
    vibration signals accurately diagnosed the mechanical bearing fault F7 in 100%
    of test cases, but was only able to diagnose an electrical stator fault, such
    as F1, in 92% of cases. In contrast, when only current signals were considered,
    stator fault F1 was diagnosed correctly in 98% of cases, but bearing fault F7
    was only diagnosed correctly in 96% of cases. When the two signals are fused,
    the conditional probabilities in the global confusion matrix effectively gives
    greater weight to vibration signals and less weight to current signals when diagnosing
    mechanical faults and vice versa in the case of diagnosing electrical faults.
    This leverages the strengths of each sensor type for fault monitoring and minimizes
    the impact of the weaknesses. TABLE VI Proportion of Correct Diagnoses for Each
    Fault Type When Considering Each Signal Individually and After Two-Stage Fusion
    SECTION VI. Discussion In this section, the results and the structure of the algorithm
    are discussed further, highlighting the observed strengths and weaknesses of the
    algorithm. A. Implementation and Constraints The training of the method takes
    place offline using historical datasets containing healthy and faulty data. Once
    the model is trained, diagnosis can be performed either online or offline. By
    applying a sliding window of the same size as used for training, the new sensor
    measurements can be fed into the two-stage Bayesian classifier online after the
    feature extraction and PCA steps have been performed. The width of the window
    could be different based on the nature of the monitored system, the extracted
    features, and the data available. The computational complexity of the classifier
    is proportional to the number of principal components retained and the number
    of fault modes monitored. The computational complexity of the feature extraction
    and PCA step depends on the number of features extracted and the size of the sliding
    window. For a better representation of the original feature space, nonlinear multivariate
    methods, such as kernel PCA [33], could be explored in the future instead of the
    currently used linear PCA. While it falls out of the scope of this paper, it should
    also be noted that the features used as inputs to the method may also be refined
    according to state of the art signal processing and feature extraction methods
    so that they may better discriminate between different health states. Thus, the
    accuracy and reliability of the approach would likely be improved further. In
    (4) and (8), the likelihoods might result in very small values if the number of
    features m, the number of sensors N, or the number of fault cases M is large.
    To avoid numerical problems, a logarithmic formulation might be considered. B.
    Algorithm Validation In Section V, three different algorithm validation test cases
    were presented by splitting the data into different training sets, test sets,
    and validation sets. It has been shown that for small datasets, the simple split-sample
    estimates can be biased and cross validation is more suitable for the prediction
    assessment of the classifiers [34]. In the case of a two-stage method, cross validation
    is unfeasible due to the increase in the number of computational steps associated
    with the addition of the global fusion stage and the use of a validation set.
    Specifically, relative to a simple single-stage fusion, when implementing cross
    validation on a two-stage approach, the method becomes n2 more computationally
    expensive, where n is the number of the observations, as both the local and the
    global stages have to be trained using separate training sets. In this paper,
    a pragmatic split-sample method was considered. It is also foreseen that such
    an approach would be applicable for applications of the method with larger volumes
    of datasets available. In the future, increases in computing power might also
    allow the cross-validation approach to be feasibly applied. C. Naïve Bayes Classifier
    Using Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) The GNB classifier is a parametric method
    that assumes a normal distribution of the observation variables. The more the
    distribution of the observation variables differs from the normal distribution,
    the less accurate the method is. One possible way to eliminate this Gaussian assumption
    is to use a naïve Bayes classifier with KDE, where the probability density function
    of the features are estimated using a nonparametric kernel distribution. Such
    an approach can be used when there is no prior knowledge regarding the distribution
    of the data, no assumptions are made, or a parametric distribution cannot describe
    the data. Tests conducted using such a naïve Bayes classifier with KDE, with the
    same random split as described in Test Case A, yielded comparable results to the
    GNB classifier. The naïve Bayes classifier with KDE resulted in correct classification
    rates in the ±2% range compared to the results in Table I, whereas the F1 score
    is 99.64%, which is 0.32% better compared to the results in Table I. However,
    when applying KDE, the computation time was two magnitudes greater for the local
    stage than for the case of the GNB classifier. It took 4.277 s for the original
    method to train the local stage and obtain the confusion matrixes for the vibration
    signals, whereas the same computation took 351.78 s with KDE. The processing hardware
    was an Intel Core i5-4300U, 1.9 GHz. D. Two-Stage Data Fusion Without PCA While
    not the primary focus of this paper, it is worth noting that an investigation
    into the importance of incorporating the PCA step into the algorithm was also
    performed. It was observed that when the PCA step was omitted from the algorithm,
    all test cases, including fault cases, were subsequently diagnosed as being healthy
    (F0). This was due to the load dependence of the features. This observation indicates
    that a PCA step, or similar, ensures that the algorithm is robust against changing
    loading and environmental conditions. E. Advantages of the Method The preceding
    sections provide quantifiable comparisons of the performance of the algorithm
    when including the novel steps of applying a GNB classifier and splitting the
    approach into two stages, relative to the cases when the steps are omitted. Due
    to the multitude of ways of properly designing and tuning various algorithms,
    it is unfeasible to perform similarly rigorous quantitative comparisons to benchmark
    the method relative to other data-driven fault detection methods. However, qualitative
    comparisons, which can guide design decisions at an early stage of the analytics
    development process, can be made. The main advantages of the proposed method are
    its transparency and modularity. In contrast to many other data-driven fault diagnosis
    methods, such as SVMs or neural networks, the decision-making process of the algorithm
    is easily back traceable from the global predictions to the inputs of the local
    stage to identify how the different sensors reacted to a fault. Such transparency
    is important for cases where the algorithm will be used to support maintenance
    decisions. While in this paper, only MAP probabilities were considered, in practice,
    the Bayesian sensor fusion approach allows the results to be presented in the
    form of likelihoods, showing the probability of each fault condition being present.
    Again, this additional insight can support maintenance decisions. The modularity
    of the approach, achieved by splitting the data fusion into two stages, also offers
    further advantages when considering practical implementation. In the case of a
    sensor being removed from a system, there is no need to retrain the whole model,
    as the removed sensor type can easily be omitted from the decision-level fusion.
    This is not possible for other fault diagnosis methods that only consider feature-level
    data fusion. Similarly, additional sensor types may be readily incorporated into
    the analysis with limited requirements for retraining. Recently, a trend of monitoring
    the health of components via signals recorded from connected elements, for example,
    monitoring gearboxes and bearings via electrical signals recorded from connected
    electrical motors, has emerged [35], [36]. Such emerging methods could also easily
    be incorporated into the algorithm, serving as an additional source of information
    for further improving the accuracy of diagnosis. SECTION VII. Conclusion In this
    paper, the performance of a newly proposed PCA and two-stage Bayesian sensor fusion
    method was evaluated under various test scenarios. The algorithm was shown to
    be able to diagnose stator faults, broken rotor bar faults, and bearing faults
    in induction motors, with low false and missed alarm rates. The algorithm also
    proved its ability to diagnose faults under different loading and environmental
    conditions. In addition to discussing the several advantages of the presented
    method, the limitations of the method were also highlighted. For example, it was
    shown that the method is capable of correctly distinguishing different types of
    fault, however, to consistently distinguish between different fault severities,
    adequate training sets are required at comparable loading conditions. In the future,
    the algorithm can potentially be extended so that it may be used not only with
    steady-state signals. Additionally, the performance of the method may be refined
    by further tailoring the extracted features to the monitored system. It was shown
    that by fusing data recorded from different sensor types, the proposed method
    is capable of diagnosing both mechanical and electrical faults. In the future,
    the algorithm should also be tested for other fault detection and condition-monitoring
    scenarios, for example, in process-monitoring applications. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The

    Metrics Abstract: The aim of this paper is to show that Dempster-Shafer evidence
    theory may be successfully applied to unsupervised classification in multisource
    remote sensing. Dempster-Shafer formulation allows for consideration of unions
    of classes, and to represent both imprecision and uncertainty, through the definition
    of belief and plausibility functions. These two functions, derived from mass function,
    are generally chosen in a supervised way. In this paper, the authors describe
    an unsupervised method, based on the comparison of monosource classification results,
    to select the classes necessary for Dempster-Shafer evidence combination and to
    define their mass functions. Data fusion is then performed, discarding invalid
    clusters (e.g. corresponding to conflicting information) thank to an iterative
    process. Unsupervised multisource classification algorithm is applied to MAC-Europe''91
    multisensor airborne campaign data collected over the Orgeval French site. Classification
    results using different combinations of sensors (TMS and AirSAR) or wavelengths
    (L- and C-bands) are compared. Performance of data fusion is evaluated in terms
    of identification of land cover types. The best results are obtained when all
    three data sets are used. Furthermore, some other combinations of data are tried,
    and their ability to discriminate between the different land cover types is quantified.

    of the major problems in sensor fusion is that sensors frequently provide spurious
    observations which are difficult to predict and model. The spurious measurements
    from sensors must be identified and eliminated since their incorporation in the
    fusion pool might lead to inaccurate estimation. This paper presents a unified
    sensor fusion strategy based on a modified Bayesian approach that can automatically
    identify the inconsistency in sensor measurements so that the spurious measurements
    can be eliminated from the data fusion process. The proposed method adds a term
    to the commonly used Bayesian formulation. This term is an estimate of the probability
    that the data is not spurious, based upon the measured data and the unknown value
    of the true state. In fusing two measurements, it has the effect of increasing
    the variance of the posterior distribution when measurement from one of the sensors
    is inconsistent with respect to the other. The increase or decrease in variance
    can be estimated using the information theoretic measure "entropy." The proposed
    strategy was verified with the help of extensive computations performed on simulated
    data from three sensors. A comparison was made between two different fusion schemes:
    centralized fusion in which data obtained from all sensors were fused simultaneously,
    and a decentralized or sequential Bayesian scheme that proved useful for identifying
    and eliminating spurious data from the fusion process. The simulations verified
    that the proposed strategy was able to identify spurious sensor measurements and
    eliminate them from the fusion process, thus leading to a better overall estimate
    of the true state. The proposed strategy was also validated with the help of experiments
    performed using stereo vision cameras, one infrared proximity sensor, and one
    laser proximity sensor. The information from these three sensing sources was fused
    to obtain an occupancy profile of the robotic workspace Published in: IEEE Sensors

    SECTION I. Introduction The principal objective of a multisensor system [1]–[3]
    is to combine information from a variety of sources in a coherent and synergistic
    manner to yield a robust, accurate, and consistent description of quantities of
    interest in the environment. There are several issues that arise when fusing information
    from multiple sources, some of which include data association, sensor uncertainty,
    and data management. The most fundamental of these issues arise from the inherent
    uncertainty in sensor measurement. The uncertainties in sensor measurement are
    not only caused by device impreciseness and noise, but also manifest themselves
    from the ambiguities and inconsistencies present within the environment, and from
    an inability to distinguish between them. The strategies used to fuse data from
    multiple sensors should be capable of handling these uncertainties, and combining
    different types of information to obtain a consistent description of the environment.
    Some of the more popular techniques for sensor fusion that are explored extensively
    in literature include Dempster–Shafer theory for evidential reasoning [4], [5],
    fuzzy logic [6], [7], neural network [8], [9], genetic algorithm [10], [11], Bayesian
    approach [12], and statistical techniques [13] such as Kalman filter [14]–[16].
    Another possible uncertainty that arises in the sensor measurement process occurs
    when the measurements become corrupted and appear spurious in nature. Such corrupted
    measurements are difficult to model because they are not directly attributable
    to the inherent noise or other sources of uncertainty mentioned above. The cause
    of the corruption may be due to events such as permanent sensor failures, short
    duration spike faults, or nascent (slowly developing) failures. Previous attempts
    at developing experimental models usually preclude the use of spurious measurements,
    and represent uncertainties attributable only to sensor noise and inherent limitations.
    Fusion techniques based on these incomplete models provide inaccurate estimation
    that can eventually result in potentially damaging action by the control system.
    Hence, a sensor validation scheme is necessary to identify spurious measurements
    so they can be eliminated before the fusion process. There are several techniques
    reported in the literature for sensor validation and identification of inconsistent
    data. Many of them are limiting because they are based on specific failure models;
    these techniques can work well for events that occur due to known failure modes,
    however, they do not capture all possible failure events and often perform poorly
    when unmodeled failures occur. As a means to detect inconsistency, there should
    be either redundancy in the data, or some availability of a priori information.
    For example, in the case where a priori information is available, researchers
    have used the Nadaraya–Watson Estimator [17] and a priori observations to validate
    sensor measurements. Other researchers have used a model based Kalman filter approach
    [18], while others have used covariance [19], [20], probability [21], [22], fuzzy
    logic [23], and neural network [24] based approaches. Some of these methods are
    explicit model-based, whereas others require tuning and training. In the general
    case where a priori information is often not available, these approaches are typically
    deficient and can often lead to undesirable results. Most of the fusion strategies
    based on Bayesian approaches reported in the literature handle inconsistency in
    data rather poorly. In practical real-world scenarios, where data generated by
    sensors might be incomplete, incoherent or inconsistent, this approach might lead
    to erroneous results. Consequently, the inconsistency in data needs to be dealt
    with accordingly when Bayesian approaches are used. This paper makes use of a
    modified Bayesian approach for fusion that takes into account measurement inconsistency
    and entropy to identify spurious data. Based on the entropy of the posterior distribution
    of a desired quantity, the approach presented in this paper detects whether the
    data from the sensors are spurious or inconsistent. Entropy-based analysis aids
    in determining if the fusion of data from a particular sensor actually improves
    the information content of the fusion. This paper is organized as follows: First,
    it describes a simplified version of the Bayesian approach. Next, it presents
    the analytical formulation of the proposed approach. Finally, the proposed approach
    is applied using two different fusion schemes: 1) centralized Bayesian fusion
    where data from all sensors are fused simultaneously and 2) decentralized Bayesian
    fusion in which data from sensors are fused sequentially so as to provide an opportunity
    to identify and eliminate spurious data. A simulated application is presented
    that makes use of data from three sensors, all with varying probability of providing
    spurious measurements. Finally, the paper demonstrates the proposed technique
    with a real-world application; obtaining the occupancy profile of a robotic workspace
    using three sensory sources: stereo vision, an infrared proximity sensor, and
    a laser proximity sensor. SECTION II. Bayesian Approach for Sensor Fusion Bayesian
    inference [12], [25], [26] is a statistical data fusion algorithm based on Bayes''
    theorem [27] of conditional or a posteriori probability to estimate an n -dimensional
    state vector X , after the observation or measurement denoted by Z has been made.
    The probabilistic information contained in Z about X is described by a probability
    density function (pdf) p(Z|X) , known as likelihood function, or the sensor model,
    which is a sensor dependent objective function based on observation. The likelihood
    function relates the extent to which the a posteriori probability is subject to
    change, and is evaluated either via offline experiments or by utilizing the available
    information about the system. If the information about the state X is made available
    independently before any observation is made, then the likelihood function can
    be improved to provide more accurate results. Such a priori information about
    X can be encapsulated as the prior probability P(X=x) and is regarded as subjective
    because it is not based on observed data. Bayes'' theorem provides the posterior
    conditional distribution of X=x , given Z=z , as p(X=x|Z=z) = p(Z=z|X=x)P(X=x)
    ∫p(Z=z|X=x)P(X=x)dx = p(Z=z|X=x)P(X=x) P(Z=z) . (1) View Source Since the denominator
    depends only on the measurement (the summation is carried out over all possible
    values of state), an intuitive estimation can be made by maximizing this posterior
    distribution, i.e., by maximizing the numerator of (1). This is called maximum
    a posteriori (or MAP) estimate, and is given by x ^ MAP =argmaxp(X=x|Z=z) ∝argmaxp(Z=z|X=x)P(X=x).

    errors, i.e., it minimizes the Euclidean distance between the true state x and
    the estimate x ^ after the observation z has been made. This estimator, called

    part of sensor fusion and it deals with developing an understanding of the nature
    of measurements provided by the sensor, the limitations of the sensor, and probabilistic
    understanding of the sensor performance in terms of the uncertainties. The information
    supplied by a sensor is usually modeled as a mean about a true value, with uncertainty
    due to noise represented by a variance that depends on both the measured quantities
    themselves and the operational parameters of the sensor. A probabilistic sensor
    model is particularly useful because it facilitates a determination of the statistical
    characteristics of the data obtained. This probabilistic model is usually expressed
    in the form of pdf p(Z=z|X=x) that captures the probability distribution of measurement
    by the sensor ( z ) when the state of the measured quantity ( x ) is known. This
    distribution is extremely sensor specific and can be experimentally determined.
    The likelihood function relates the extent to which the a posteriori probability
    is subject to change, and is evaluated either via offline experiments or by utilizing
    the information available about the problem. Since the likelihood function is
    obtained from the experimental observations, it is said to be objective. Bayesian
    approaches make use of a priori information about X and fuse that information
    with measurement information from sensors to provide an improved estimate of the
    state. The data from multiple sensors can be fused simultaneously (centralized
    fusion scheme) as shown in Fig. 1, or sequentially (decentralized fusion) as shown
    in Fig. 2. Fusing data from n independent sensors in the centralized scheme using
    the Bayesian approach can be achieved via equation (4) shown at the bottom of
    the page, where z i represents the measurement obtained from sensor i . Similarly,
    the sequential Bayesian approach can be easily implemented in a distributed sensing
    environment and in an online manner where the posterior distribution obtained
    from old measurements becomes the prior distribution. Hence, the addition of new
    sensor measurement z n to the belief obtained from n−1 sensors ( Z ¯ 1…n−1 = z
    1 , z 2 ,… z n−1 ) can be achieved in an incremental manner via (5) shown at the
    bottom of the page. p(X=x| Z ¯ 1…n = z 1 , z 2 ,… z n )= p(Z= z n |X=x)p(X=x|
    Z ¯ 1…n−1 = z 1 , z 2 ,… z n−1 ) P( Z ¯ 1…n = z 1 , z 2 ,… z n ) (5) View Source
    It may be noted that (4) and (5) are valid only when measurements from different
    sensors are independent. This paper assumes the independence of sensors in its
    analysis. However, the analytical approach used in this paper is equally applicable
    when the sensors are not independent with some modifications in its formulation
    that can account for the interdependence of the measurements from different sensors.

    2. Decentralized sensor fusion scheme using Bayesian approach. Show All This type
    of decentralized fusion scheme is more robust in terms of individual component
    failure, is more efficient in using communication resources as compared with the
    conventional schemes, and is also scalable. This fusion scheme, based on sequential
    Bayesian estimation, provides a mechanism to identify sensor failure or the presence
    of spurious sensor data, and provides a means to eliminate those measurements.
    One of the major advantages of the Bayesian approach is that it provides an excellent
    mechanism to combine prior information with information obtained from current
    experiments. Since the estimation takes into account available data from all previous
    as well as current experiments, the approach leads to a theoretically optimal
    solution. However, for most practical applications, a lack of priors or use of
    noninformative priors presents difficulties for Bayesian-based sensor fusion approaches.
    Assumptions regarding informative priors creates the possibility of unreasonable
    fusion between priors and likelihood functions. Another major drawback of the
    Bayesian approach is its inability to fuse estimates from various sources that
    are either noncoherent or inconsistent. Thus, inconsistencies in data need to
    be dealt with separately when Bayesian approaches are used. SECTION III. Multisensor
    Fusion with Spurious Data Sensors often provide spurious data due to sensor failure;
    this can be due to some inherent limitation of the sensor and/or some ambiguity
    in the environment. The Bayesian approach described in the previous section is
    inadequate in handling this type of spurious data. The approach does not have
    a mechanism to identify when data from sensors is incorrect. The following paragraphs
    describe the use of a Bayesian-based approach for fusion of data from multiple
    sensors that takes into account measurement inconsistency. While building a stochastic
    sensor model, generally spurious data are identified and eliminated. Hence, these
    experimentally developed sensor models represent uncertainties arising only from
    sensor noise. If the event s=0 represents that the data obtained from a sensor
    is not spurious, then the sensor model developed in this manner actually represents
    the distribution p(Z=z|X=x,s=0) . From Bayes'' theorem, the probability that the
    data z i measured by sensor i is not spurious conditioned upon the actual state
    x , is given by [p(s=0|X=x,Z= z i ) ] i = [P(s=0) ] i [p(Z= z i |X=x,s=0)] ∑ s
    [P(s) ] i [p(Z= z i |X=x,s) ] i (6) View Source [P(s=0) ] i is the sensor specific
    prior probability that the data provided by sensor i is not spurious. The denominator
    of the right-hand side of the above equation is a summation carried over all possible
    values of s which are 0 and 1. The above equation can be rewritten as or [p(s=0|X=x,Z=
    z i ) ] i = [P(s=0) ] i [p(Z= z i |X=x,s=0)] [p(Z= z i |X=x) ] i [p(Z= z i |X=x)
    ] i = [P(s=0) ] i [p(Z= z i |X=x,s=0) ] i [p(s=0|X=x,Z= z i ) ] i . (7) (8) View
    Source Then, from (4), in a centralized fusion scheme, data from n sensors can
    be fused via the following equation: p(X=x|Z= z 1 , z 2 ,… z n ) = [P(s=0) ] 1
    [p(Z= z 1 |X=x,s=0) ] 1 [p(s=0|X=x,Z= z 1 ) ] 1 ×… [P(s=0) ] n [p(Z= z n |X=x,s=0)
    ] n [p(s=0|X=x,Z= z n ) ] n × P(X=x) P(Z= z 1 , z 2 ,… z n ) . (9) View Source
    Note the effect of the additional terms [p(s=0|X=x,Z= z 1 ) ] 1 …[p(s=0|X=x,Z=
    z n ) ] n in the denominator of (9). It will be demonstrated in the next section
    that the term [p(s=0|X=x,Z= z i ) ] i in the denominator results in an increase
    in the variance based on the belief that measurements from sensor i have a greater
    probability of being spurious. This results in less weight applied to the measurement
    from sensor i when fused with measurements from other sensors. Similarly, to combine
    the sensor measurement from sensor n sequentially with the current belief obtained
    from sensors 1,2…n−1 , (5) can be rewritten as (10) shown at the bottom of the
    page. p(X=x| Z ¯ = z 1 , z 2 ,… z n )= [P(s=0) ] n [p(Z= z n |X=x,s=0)]p(X=x|
    Z ¯ 1…n−1 = z 1 , z 2 ,… z z−1 ) P( Z ¯ 1…n = z 1 , z 2 ,… z n )[p(s=0|X=x,Z=
    z n ) ] n (10) View Source Hence, the addition of term [p(s=0|X=x,Z= z n ) ] n
    in the denominator has the effect of increasing the spread (variance) of the posterior
    if the new measurement has a greater probability of being spurious, and decreasing
    the spread of the posterior if the new measurement has a lower probability of
    being spurious. The increase or decrease in the spread of the posterior distribution
    can be easily ascertained by determining the information content given by the
    entropy of distribution obtained from the following equation: H(X)=∫−p(X=x|Z=
    z 1 , z 2 ,… z n ) ×log(p(X=x|Z= z 1 , z 2 ,… z n ))dx.(11) View Source Entropy
    of a variable represents the uncertainty in that variable. A larger value of entropy
    implies more uncertainty and, hence, less information content. The fusion of a
    new measurement should always lead to a decrease in entropy, and fusion should
    always be done in order to reduce entropy. Based on increasing or decreasing the
    entropy of the posterior, this method can identify and eliminate spurious data
    from a sensor. It is noted that the prior probability [P(s=0) ] i has a constant
    value and simply acts as a constant weighting factor in (9) and (10). This value
    does not influence the posterior distribution nor the MAP estimate of the state.
    SECTION IV. Fusion of Three Sensors A. Bayesian Fusion Without Consideration of
    Spuriousness in Data (Method 1) If the spurious nature of the sensor data is not
    considered, and the models of three sensors are given by the following Gaussian
    likelihood function: p(Z= z k |X=x)= 1 σ k 2π − − √ e { −(x− z k ) 2 2 σ 2 k }
    k=1,2,3 (12) View Source where k=1 represents the first sensor, k=2 represents
    the second sensor, and k=3 represents the third sensor. From Bayes'' Theorem,
    the fused MAP estimate is given by x ^ MAP =argmax[p(Z= z 1 |X=x) ×p(Z= z 2 |X=x)p(Z=
    z 3 |X=x)].(13) View Source If three Gaussian distributions (each given by the
    one of three sensors'' model pdfs) are fused, then the posterior distribution
    is jointly Gaussian, and the standard deviation is given by ( σ ′ ) 2 =[( σ 1
    ) −2 +( σ 2 ) −2 +( σ 3 ) −2 ] −1 (14) View Source and the mean (and the MAP estimate)
    are given by x ^ MAP =( σ ′ ) 2 [ z 1 ( σ 1 ) 2 + z 2 ( σ 2 ) 2 + z 3 ( σ 3 )
    2 ]. (15) View Source Hence, if there is no prior information available about
    the quantity to be estimated, the Bayesian approach for fusion of the three sensor
    estimates results in a weighted average dictated by the ratio of standard deviations.
    From (14) we note that the standard deviation of the fused distribution is smaller
    than any of the three individual distributions, representing less uncertainty
    in the fused estimates. B. Bayesian Fusion with Consideration of Spuriousness
    in Data If the spurious nature of the sensor data is considered, then the Gaussian
    sensor model represented by distribution p(Z=z|X=x,s=0) is given by [p(Z=z|X=x,s=0)
    ] k = 1 σ k 2π − − √ e { −(x− z k ) 2 2 σ 2 k } k=1,2,3.(16) View Source The probability
    that the measurement from sensor k is not spurious given the true state x and
    measurement z k , is assumed to be represented by the following equation: [p(s=0|X=x,Z=
    z k ) ] k = e { −(x− z k ) 2 a 2 k } . (17) View Source An advantage of choosing
    the above formulation for representing the probability is that the probability
    is 1 when measurement z k is equal to the true state x , and decreases when the
    measured value moves away from the true state. The rate at which the probability
    decreases when the measured value moves away from the true estimate depends upon
    the parameter a k . The value of the parameter is dependent on the variances of
    the sensor models and the distance between the output of sensor k with respect
    to other sensors. 1. Centralized Fusion Scheme (Method 2) The posterior distribution
    p(X=x|Z= z 1 , z 2 , z 3 ) in the centralized fusion scheme obtained from (9)
    is given by p(X=x|Z= z 1 , z 2 , z 3 ) = P(X=x) P(Z= z 1 , z 2 , z 3 ) × ∏ k=1
    3 [P(s=0) ] k [p(Z= z k |X=x,s=0) ] k [p(s=0|X=x,Z= z k ) ] k . (18) View Source

    l≠k,l=1 ( z k − z l ) 2 . (19) View Source Incorporating this in (18) yields p(X=x|Z=
    z 1 , z 2 , z 3 ) = P(X=x) P(Z= z 1 , z 2 , z 3 ) × ∏ k=1 3 [P(s=0) ] k 1 σ k
    2π − − √ × e −(x− z k ) 2 { 1 2 σ 2 k − ∏ 3 l≠k,l=1 ( z k − z l ) 2 b 2 k } .
    (20) View Source The value of parameter b k is chosen to satisfy the following
    inequality: b 2 k ⩾2 σ 2 k ∏ l≠k,l=1 3 ( z k − z l ) 2 . (21) View Source Satisfaction
    of this inequality ensures that the posterior distribution in (20) remains Gaussian
    and hence has a single peak. The entire process has the effect of increasing the
    variance of the individual distribution (representing belief from one particular
    measurement) if that particular measurement is at a larger distance to other measurements.
    Thus, if two measurements lie close to one another, then weights associated with
    those measurements become larger when compared to those measurements that lie
    farther away. This process yields a mathematical basis to provide more weighting
    to beliefs when they corroborate one another rather than when they contradict
    one another. 2. Decentralized Fusion Scheme (Method 3) In the decentralized or
    sequential fusion scheme, measurements from only two sources are fused at once.
    The belief resulting from the fusion of two sensors is then fused with the next
    sensor, and the process continues henceforth. Fusion of two sensors k and k+1
    using (10) yields p(X=x|Z= z k , z k+1 ) = [P(s=0) ] k [p(Z= z k |X=x,s=0) ] k
    [p(s=0|X=x,Z= z k ) ] k × [P(s=0) ] k+1 [p(Z= z k+1 |X=x,s=0) ] k+1 [p(s=0|X=x,Z=

    following inequality: b 2 k ≥2 σ 2 k ( z k − z k+1 ) 2 . (25) View Source Satisfaction
    of this inequality ensures that the posterior distribution in (24) remains Gaussian,
    and hence has a single peak. The parameter value should be chosen based on maximum
    expected difference (represented by m ) between the sensor readings so that inequality
    (25) is always satisfied. Hence b 2 k =2 σ 2 k m 2 . (26) View Source Substituting
    (26) in (24) gives p(X=x|Z= z k , z k+1 ) = P(X=x) P(Z= z k , z k+1 ) ×[P(s=0)
    ] k 1 σ k 2π − − √ e − (x− z k ) 2 2 σ 2 k { m 2 m 2 −( z k − z k+1 ) 2 } ×[P(s=0)
    ] k+1 1 σ k+1 2π − − √ e − (x− z k+1 ) 2 2 σ 2 k+1 { m 2 m 2 −( z k − z k+1 )
    2 } . (27) View Source It is apparent that the entire process has the effect of
    increasing the value of the variance of individual distribution by a factor of
    {( m 2 / m 2 −( z 1 − z 2 ) 2 )} . Larger differences in sensor measurement imply
    that the variance increases by a bigger factor. Depending on the squared difference
    in measurements from the two sensors, the variance of the posterior distribution
    may increase or decrease as compared with the variance of individual Gaussian
    distributions representing the sensor models. Therefore, the strategy is capable
    of determining if fusion of the two measurements would lead to an increase or
    decrease of the variance of the posterior distribution. In information theoretic
    terms, the strategy is capable of determining if the fusion leads to an increase
    in information content [or entropy given by (11)] or not. Based on increasing
    or decreasing of entropy in the posterior, a decision can be made whether to fuse
    those two sensors or not. This approach provides an opportunity to eliminate sensor
    measurements that are spurious and fuse measurements from only those sensors that
    are consistent, ensuring an increase in information content after fusion. Fig.

    Simulation Results A simulation study was carried out to validate the effectiveness
    of the proposed strategy in identifying spurious data. A comparative analysis
    was performed to study the efficiency with which the three methods (described
    in previous section) were able to handle inconsistency in data. The following
    parameters were assumed in the simulation. Sensor 1: [P(s=0) ] 1 =0.90 and σ 1
    =3 . Sensor 2: [P(s=0) ] 2 =0.98 and σ 2 =2 . Sensor 3: [P(s=0) ] 3 =0.94 and
    σ 3 =2.5 . True value of state: x=20 . Simulation data was generated so that Sensor
    1 provided 90% of the time normally distributed random data with a mean value
    of 20 and variance 9. It provided incorrect data 10% of the time which was uniformly
    distributed outside the Gaussian distribution. Sensor 2 provided 98% of the time
    normally distributed random data with a mean value of 20 and variance 4, and 2%
    of the time it provided incorrect data. Similarly, Sensor 3 provided 94% of the
    time normally distributed random data with a mean value of 20 and variance 6.25,
    and 6% of the time it provided incorrect data. It may be noted here that the values
    for [P(s=0) ] k have been assumed simply for the purpose of generating simulated
    data. These are not used in the fusion algorithm. Since these values are constants,
    they do not have any effect on the posterior distribution or the MAP estimate.
    Fig. 4. Sample data and fusion from multiple sensors with spurious data. (a) Fusion
    of a sample of 100 data points. (b) A case when two sensors provide spurious measurements.
    Show All Fig. 3(a) illustrates a case when all of the three sensors are in agreement,
    and measurement from none of the sensors is inconsistent with the rest. It can
    be seen that posterior distributions obtained from all three methods coincide
    resulting in the same value of MAP estimate. In Fig. 3(b), measurement from Sensor
    1 is in disagreement from the other two sensors. Method 1, which is a simple Bayesian
    fusion and does not take into account inconsistency of data, results in the weighted
    average of the three measurements given by (15). Method 2, which takes into account
    the inconsistency and weights those sensors more whose measurements are consistent
    (Sensors 2 and 3 in this case) with each other, results in an estimate which is
    closer to the sensors (Sensors 2 and 3) in agreement. Method 3 identifies the
    sensor which provides spurious measurements and eliminates that from the fusion
    process. Hence, it simply considers measurements from Sensors 2 and 3, and fuses
    them appropriately using (27). In a similar manner, Fig. 3(c) and (d), respectively,
    show that measurements from Sensors 2 and 3 are spurious. The figure shows the
    efficiency with which Method 3 identifies and eliminates spurious measurements,
    and results in better estimates (closer to the true value) of the variable. The
    figure also shows that Method 2 is able to appropriately and autonomously weight
    sensors to achieve an estimate which is better as compared to Method 1 which does
    not take inconsistency into consideration at all. A set of 10 000 data points
    were generated in the manner described above and fusion was carried out using
    all three methods. The mean value of the sum of squared error (MSE) between the
    fused value and true value for all 10 000 data points was computed. The values
    of MSE were found as 6.94 for Method 1, 6.03 for Method 2, and 5.50 for Method
    3. Hence, Method 3 was able to reduce the MSE by approximately 21% when compared
    with Method 1, and Method 2 was able to reduce the mean square error by approximately
    13% when compared with Method 1. Fig. 4(a) shows a sample of 100 data points taken
    from the above set of ten thousand data points. Data points represented by asterisks
    (∗) are the fused values obtained via Method 3. The figure shows that the asterisks,
    on an average, lie closer to the dashed line (—) which represents the true value
    of the variable. Method 3 has the built-in mechanism to identify and eliminate
    spurious data. As explained in the previous sections, it does so by comparing
    data from one sensor with those from the other two sensors. This method fails
    when two sensors simultaneously provide spurious data which are close to one another.
    The method wrongfully identifies the measurement from the third sensor as spurious.
    This rarely happens since the probability of two sensors providing spurious data
    at the same time is very low. In Fig. 4(a), for example, it happened for the encircled
    data. Fig. 4(b) shows the details of fusion results for this data point. Sensors
    1 and 2 have both provided spurious data. However, since they are close to each
    other, Method 3 identifies data from Sensor 3 as spurious, and eliminates that
    data from fusion process. This leads to inaccurate estimation. Similarly, Method
    2 provides more weights to data from Sensors 1 and 2, and also results in inaccurate
    estimation. However, since occurrence of such a case is rare, both Method 2 and
    Method 3 generally provide improved accuracy over Method 1. SECTION VI. Experimental
    Validation The theories developed in the previous sections were validated with
    the help of experiments performed in the Robotics and Manufacturing Automation
    (RAMA) Laboratory at Duke University. The objective of the experiment was to obtain
    a three-dimensional occupancy profile of the robotic workspace using three independent
    sensory sources: stereo vision, an infrared proximity sensor, and a laser proximity
    sensor. The occupancy profile was obtained using an occupancy grid framework.
    The occupancy grid [29]–[33] is a multidimensional field (usually of dimension
    two or three) where each cell (or unit of the grid) stores or represents the probabilistic
    estimate of the state of spatial occupancy. Occupancy grids are one of the most
    common low-level models of an environment, which provide an excellent framework
    for robust fusion of uncertain and noisy data. If the state variable (occupancy,
    in this case) associated with a cell, C i , is denoted by s( C i ) , then the
    occupancy probability P[s( C i )] represents the probabilistic estimate of occupancy
    of that particular cell. Fig. 5. Sensor models. (a) Stereo Vision. (b) Infrared
    proximity sensor. (c) Laser proximity sensor. Show All Fig. 6. Images of the worktable
    obtained from left and the right camera. Show All If P[s( C i )=occ]≈0 , then
    the cell is assumed to be empty, while if P[s( C i )=occ]≈1 , then the cell is
    assumed to be occupied. If a single sensor is used to obtain the occupancy grid,
    Bayes'' Theorem can be used in the following manner to determine the state of
    the cell: P[s( C i ) =occ|z]= p[z|s( C i )=occ]P[s( C i )=occ] ∑ s( C i ) p[z|s(
    C i )]P[s( C i )] (28) View Source where z is the sensor measurement. The pdf
    p[z|s( C i )=occ] is dependent on the sensor characteristics and is called the
    sensor model. The probability P[s( C i )=occ] is called prior probability mass
    function and specifies the information made available prior to any observation.
    At first, models of the three sensory sources using Gaussian distributions were
    obtained. These models were obtained using a neural network-based technique that
    established the relationship between the variance of the sensor model with respect
    to certain environmental or algorithmic conditions. The details of the sensor
    modeling process are explained in [28], and the results are shown in the Fig.
    5. Fig. 5(a) shows the graph of standard deviation of Gaussian sensor model plotted
    against the correlation score of stereo-matched templates for stereo vision sensor.
    Similarly, for infrared and laser proximity sensors, the variance of the sensor
    model was found to be dependent on the distance to the detected object, and the
    relationship between the variance and the sensor outputs (which are indicative
    of the distance to the detected object) are shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c), respectively,
    for infrared and laser proximity sensor. Occupancy grids were obtained individually
    for stereo vision, infrared, and laser proximity sensors, and then the individual
    grids were fused using two techniques: 1) Simple Bayesian Fusion and 2) Sequential
    Bayesian Fusion with Proposed Inconsistency Detection and Elimination Strategy.
    The details of the process for obtaining occupancy grids and sensor fusion are
    explained in [29]. In the experiment, a cylindrical object was placed on the robot''s
    worktable. Fig. 6 shows the images of the worktable obtained from the stereo cameras.
    Fig. 7(a) shows the actual occupancy grid of the workspace. This was obtained
    based on the geometric dimensions of the object and its location in the workspace.
    For the occupancy grid developed in this research, each grid is of size 5 mm ×
    5 mm × 5 mm. Fig. 7(b)–(d) shows the occupancy grids independently obtained from
    stereo vision, IR proximity sensor, and laser proximity sensor, respectively.
    Fig. 7(e) shows the occupancy grid obtained from simple Bayesian approach, and
    Fig. 7(f) shows the occupancy grid obtained from the Bayesian approach that utilizes
    the inconsistency detection and elimination technique proposed earlier. To facilitate
    a comparison of the performance of the fusion process via different algorithms,
    a measure of error was formulated which is given by the following equation: Error=

    Occupancy Grids Obtained from Fusion Process where |s( C i ) | actual is the actual
    state of the cell, and |s( C i ) | sensor is the state of the cell obtained from
    the sensor and/or fusion process. The state of the cell is either 1 (for occupied)
    or 0 (for empty). Table I provides the error value associated with the occupancy
    grid obtained from the fusion process described above. The table compares the
    error value obtained via the two approaches. The first approach is based on the
    simple Bayesian fusion scheme, and the second approach is based on the proposed
    Bayesian fusion scheme embedded with the mechanism for inconsistency detection
    and elimination. From the figures as well as from the table of results, it is
    evident that the proposed fusion scheme based on Bayesian approach with an built-in
    mechanism to identify and eliminate spurious/inconsistent measurement presented
    in this paper has been able to reduce the uncertainty inherent in individual sensors.
    The proposed method has been able to reduce the error by approximately 70% as
    compared with stereo vision, 64% as compared with IR proximity sensor, and 4%
    as compared with laser proximity sensor. On the other hand, simple Bayesian technique
    was able to reduce the error by approximately 64% as compared with stereo vision
    and by 56% as compared with IR proximity sensor. The technique based on simple
    Bayesian approach led to an increase in error by approximately 15% as compared
    with laser proximity sensor. The increase in error demonstrates the fact that
    it is not necessary that incorporation of additional sensor data will lead to
    improved accuracy of estimation. This is particularly more evident in cases when
    the accuracy of measurements from sensors differs by a large amount. In this case,
    the measurements from laser proximity are far more accurate (see Fig. 5) than
    measurements from the stereo vision or IR proximity sensor, and fusion of measurements
    from the laser with stereo vision and IR proximity leads to an increase in error.
    However, the proposed technique has a built-in mechanism to determine if the fusion
    process leads to an increase in the information content, and, in this way was
    able to eliminate inconsistent data and improve the overall accuracy of the fusion
    process. Of the 24 000 points (or cells) where the fusion of data from three sensors
    occurred (fusion occurred at 30 × 40 × 20 cells of the occupancy grid), the proposed
    technique detected 393 points where data from IR sensor were inconsistent and
    1028 points where data from stereo vision were inconsistent. None of the data
    from the laser sensor were detected to be inconsistent. This observation is consistent
    with the fact that the laser sensor was far more accurate than the other two sensors.
    One of the limitations of the proposed technique is that when there is a large
    number of sensors supporting an inconsistent measurement, then, based on the beliefs
    of the individual measurements, the technique may consider inconsistent measurements
    to be the correct one, and might disregard the correct measurements obtained by
    fewer numbers of sensors. In psychology, this kind of problem is termed as group
    conformity. For example, when an individual''s opinion differs significantly from
    that of others in a group, the individual is likely to feel extensive pressure
    to align his or her opinion with others. In the case of sensor systems, this kind
    of condition is more likely to occur in adversarial situations, such as the battlefield,
    where events are prone to be camouflaged to escape detection. Hence, a formal
    criterion to establish the difference between spuriousness and opinion difference
    must be developed for the sensor fusion process to be accurately carried out in
    such adversarial situations. For example, in these situations, the technique proposed
    in this paper could be applied if sensor models could be developed that represent
    the possibility/likelihood of events being camouflaged. Real-time implementation
    and scalability aspects of the proposed sequential scheme have to be considered.
    Since the method is based on the information content of the fused belief, novel
    fusion architectures can be designed to introduce parallelism in the process,
    and at the same time minimize the possibility of fused result falling into local
    attractor basins. On the other hand, the technique based on centralized fusion
    scheme is completely scalable and can be easily implemented in real time. SECTION
    VII. Conclusion Sensors often provide spurious measurements. Identification of
    such spurious measurements and their elimination is essential for carrying out
    accurate estimation. This paper proposes a unified and formalized approach to
    fuse data from multiple sources which can automatically identify inconsistency
    in sensor data. The proposed strategy adds a term to the popular Bayesian approach
    corresponding to a belief that the sensor data is not spurious conditioned upon
    the data and true state. An information theoretic measure is utilized to observe
    the information content of the posterior distribution to identify spurious data.
    Three approaches were comparatively studied in this paper. The first approach
    was based on simple Bayesian methods. The second approach adds the new term described
    above fuses all data in a centralized manner. The third method sequentially fuses
    data and eliminates those data which it identifies as spurious. An extensive simulation
    study was performed where data from three sensors was fused. It was observed that
    the third method was very effective in identifying spurious data, and elimination
    of spurious data ensured more accurate results. The second method performed better
    than the first method since it had a built-in mechanism for increasing the weighting
    of consistent measurements, while at the same time decreasing the weighting applied
    to spurious measurements. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed technique
    to identify and eliminate inconsistent sensor data in sequential Bayesian fusion
    was demonstrated with the help of an experiment performed in a robotic workcell,
    where measurements from stereo vision, infrared proximity, and laser proximity
    senor were fused to obtain three-dimensional occupancy profile of robotic workspace.

    and content Abstract Interpreting water quality data routinely generated for control
    and monitoring purposes in water distribution systems is a complicated task for
    utility managers. In fact, data for diverse water quality indicators (physico-chemical
    and microbiological) are generated at different times and at different locations
    in the distribution system. To simplify and improve the understanding and the
    interpretation of water quality, methodologies for aggregation and fusion of data
    must be developed. In this paper, the Dempster–Shafer theory also called theory
    of evidence is introduced as a potential methodology for interpreting water quality
    data. The conceptual basis of this methodology and the process for its implementation
    are presented by two applications. The first application deals with the interpretation
    of spatial water quality data fusion, while the second application deals with
    the development of water quality index based on key monitored indicators. Based
    on the obtained results, the authors discuss the potential contribution of theory
    of evidence as a decision-making tool for water quality management. Previous article

    operatorsWater distribution system 1. Introduction Monitoring and inspection of
    a system or a process may use more than one type of measurements and/or observations
    to describe the overall Condition State. The credibility of measurements to assess
    overall Condition State is important to be quantified for reliable decision-making.
    The data fusion is useful for an objective aggregation that can be reproducible
    and interpretable. Many infrastructure engineering problems, e.g., condition assessment
    of assets, production process quality control, and water quality monitoring require
    more than one performance indicator to define the Condition State. In addition,
    the aggregation of spatial or temporal observations of one (or more) performance
    indicator(s) is generally performed for reliable predictions. The data fusion
    refers to the scientific aggregation of the observations and measurements. In
    some cases, different data sets (e.g., measured by different types of sensors
    and probes, various water quality indicators) give information on various aspects
    of the system or a process by complementing each other. Therefore, the motivation
    is to collect more information for accurate prediction of Condition State. It
    is also possible that the information collected by various data sets can also
    be redundant if it deals with the same aspect of the problem, but it improves
    the reliability as one measurement/observation is confirmed by the other. Complementing
    information and redundancy of data sets are the basis of data fusion applications
    in condition assessment of assets and water quality monitoring. Regular monitoring
    of raw water quality, treatment processes and water quality in the distribution
    systems are integral parts of total drinking water quality management for the
    implementation of a multi-barrier approach for maintaining high-quality tap water
    for consumers. Water distribution systems are subjected to adverse reactions and
    events that can change the high-quality water to unpalatable and unsafe for human
    consumption by the time it arrives at the tap of the consumer (LeChevallier et
    al., 1996). As water quality can change significantly in the distribution system,
    regular monitoring is even more essential to ensure that high-quality drinking
    water reaches the consumer. To monitor the quality of water in the distribution
    system, physical, chemical, and biological indicators are recorded from routine
    grab sampling, followed by an analysis in the laboratory or using portable kits
    in the field (APHA, AWWA, WPCF, 1995). Sensor technology exists that enables capturing
    some indicators through online monitoring rather than grab samples. This technology
    is continually evolving to encompass more types of water quality indicators. Some
    common water quality indicators used for water distribution are turbidity, residual
    disinfectant, pH, nitrates, phosphates, organic compounds, total/fecal coliforms,
    and heterotrophic bacteria (HPC) (Clark, 1994, Hunsinger and Zioglio, 2002, Coulibaly
    and Rodriguez, 2003). Water uses generate a large amount of water quality data
    by routine sampling to control and maintain the acceptable Condition State of
    water quality in the system. Information is gathered on diverse water quality
    indicators using different techniques (manual sampling or auto-samplers and subsequent
    laboratory analysis, or online monitoring with automatic analyzer equipment).
    To better understand and interpret the water quality data, the use of novel techniques
    that favour the fusion and the aggregation of data is required to be explored.
    In this paper, the application of Dempster–Shafer (D–S) theory or theory of evidence
    for interpretation of water quality in the distribution system is demonstrated
    with the help of two examples. The first example discusses the application of
    theory of evidence for water quality data fusion for the case of water samples
    collected at different locations in the distribution system at a given time (interpreting
    spatial information), which is equally valid for fusion of temporal data or combining
    both. The second example briefly discusses the application of D–S theory for developing
    water quality index (WQI) that helps in aggregating and interpreting water quality
    linguistically, but in a rational manner. 2. Dempster–Shafer theory for interpreting
    water quality monitoring data There are numerous techniques available for conducting
    data and knowledge and information fusion, and most common among them are Bayesian
    inference, Dempster–Shafer rule of combination, fuzzy rule-based inference, and
    neural networks (Roemer et al., 2001). The idea of evidence integration and accumulation
    of beliefs are commonly used in Bayesian inference, which implies that p(A) +
    p(¬A) = 1, i.e., the belief in a hypothesis A can be used to derive the belief
    in its complement (Alim, 1988). But “NOT A” is the missing evidence (lack of knowledge)
    that is dealt as equal noninformative priors (Principle of Insufficient Reason)
    in Bayesian inference instead of ignorance. Alim (1988) argued that “No evidence”
    is different from having the same degree of confidence in all hypotheses, which
    is the basic motivation behind D–S theory. Dempster–Shafer theory is a theory
    of evidence, which is based on classic work by Dempster (1968) and Shafer (1976).
    The D–S theory can be interpreted as a generalization of probability theory where
    probabilities are assigned to subsets as opposed to mutually exclusive singletons.
    The probability theory can associate evidence to only one possible event, whereas
    D–S theory determines the evidence to sets of events, i.e., if the evidence is
    sufficient enough to permit the assignment of probabilities to single event (singleton),
    the D–S theory inference reduces to the probabilistic formulation (Sentz and Ferson,
    2002). The D–S theory applications in civil and environmental engineering vary
    from slope stability (Binaghi et al., 1998), environmental decision-making (Chang
    and Wright, 1996, Attoh-Okine and Gibbons, 2001), seismic analysis (Alim, 1988),
    failure detection (Tanaka and Klir, 1999), biological surveillance of river water
    quality (Boyd et al., 1993), and remote sensing (Wang and Civco, 1994) to climate
    change (Luo and Caselton, 1997). Many more applications of D–S theory can be seen
    in detailed bibliography reported by Sentz and Ferson (2002). However, the potential
    for application of D–S theory in the drinking water industry, in particular for
    fusion and aggregation of water quality monitoring data in the distribution system,
    has not been investigated until now. In the following section, the concepts of
    D–S theory application will be introduced by means of an example of data fusion
    of monitoring information on water quality in the distribution system. 2.1. Basic
    concepts of Dempster–Shafer theory and application The frame of discernment Θ
    (also called universe of discourse) is defined as a set of mutually exclusive
    alternatives, which has 2Θ subsets in the domain. For example, if the frame of
    discernment Θ is a set {L, M, H} it may have 8 (=23) subsets. Three important
    concepts, namely, basic probability assignment (m or bpa), belief (bel), and plausibility
    (pl) functions are used in D–S theory. Alim (1988) summarized some basic features
    of the D–S theory as follows: • Evidence in the form of belief (or disbelief)
    is attributed to subsets in Θ; • As evidence accumulates, the hypothesis set tends
    to narrow down toward precise estimation of probability; and • Ignorance does
    not assume equal priors or uniformly distributed, rather it is assigned to frame
    of discernment Θ. For example, if some evidence “a” is attributed to subset “L”
    in Θ, the ignorance “1 − a” will not be equally distributed to “M” and “H”, rather
    it is assigned to Θ = {L, M, H}. Example 1 In this example, it is assumed that
    water quality in the distribution is reported qualitatively using three risk levels––low
    (L), medium (M) and high (H) from consumption viewpoint based on compliance of
    drinking water regulations. The frame of discernment, Θ = {L, M, H} contains 8
    subsets ϕ (a null set) {L}, {M}, {H}, {L, M}, {M, H}, {L, H}, and {L, M, H}. Therefore,
    depending on the evidence, water could be rated as low, medium, high, low or medium,
    low or high, medium or high, and low or medium or high (in case of complete ignorance).
    2.2. Basic probability assignment The basic probability assignment (bpa or m)
    is different from classical definition of probability and is defined by mapping
    over the interval [0, 1], where the null set m(ϕ) is “0” and the sum of the basic
    probability assignments m(A) in a given set A is “1”. The m(A) expresses the proportion
    of all relevant and available evidence that supports the claim that a particular
    element of Θ belongs to the set A but to no particular subset of A (Klir, 1995).
    For a given basic probability assignment m, every set for which m(A) ≠ 0 is called
    focal element. Formally, this description of m can be represented with the following
    equation: (1) Example 1 (Contd.): If the water utility manager reports with 60%
    confidence that water is of low risk quality and with 30% confidence that it is
    low or medium risk, the ignorance is therefore 10%. The focal elements of hypothesis
    A can be written as The basic probability assignments for remaining subsets will
    be zero. 2.3. Belief function The lower and upper bounds of an interval can be
    determined from the basic probability assignment, which contains the probability
    set bounded by two nonadditive measures belief and plausibility. The lower bound
    belief (bl) for a set A is defined as the sum of all the basic probability assignments
    of the proper subsets (B) of the set of interest A, i.e., B ⊆ A. The general relation
    between bpa and belief can be written as (2) The belief functions also follow
    these relationships (3) Example 1 (Contd.): The belief functions can be derived
    as 2.4. Plausibility function The upper bound, plausibility, is the summation
    of basic probability assignment of the sets B that intersect with the set of interest
    A, i.e., B ∩ (A) ≠ ϕ, and therefore it can be written as (4) The plausibility
    function can be related to belief function through a function called doubt, which
    is defined as the compliment of belief (5) In addition, the following relationships
    for belief and plausibility functions hold true in all circumstances (6) pl (
    A ) ⩾ bl ( A ) pl ( ϕ ) = 0 pl ( Θ ) = 1 pl ( ¬ A ) = 1 - bel ( A ) Example 1
    (Contd.): Continuing on the example, the plausibility function can be derived
    as follows pl ( A ) L = m ( A ) L + m ( A ) L , M + m ( A ) L , H + m ( A ) Θ
    = 1.0 pl ( A ) M = m ( A ) M + m ( A ) L , M + m ( A ) M , H + m ( A ) Θ = 0.4
    pl ( A ) H = m ( A ) H + m ( A ) L , H + m ( A ) M , H + m ( A ) Θ = 0.1 pl (
    A ) L , M = m ( A ) L + m ( A ) M + m ( A ) L , M + m ( A ) L , H + m ( A ) M
    , H + m ( A ) Θ = 1.0 pl ( A ) L , H = m ( A ) L + m ( A ) H + m ( A ) L , M +
    m ( A ) L , H + m ( A ) M , H + m ( A ) Θ = 1.0 pl ( A ) M , H = m ( A ) M + m
    ( A ) H + m ( A ) L , M + m ( A ) L , H + m ( A ) M , H + m ( A ) Θ = 0.4 pl (
    A ) L , M , H = m ( A ) M + m ( A ) M + m ( A ) H + m ( A ) L , M + m ( A ) L
    , H + m ( A ) M , H + m ( A ) Θ = 1.0 2.5. Belief interval The belief interval
    (U) represents a range in which true probability may lie. It can be determined
    by subtracting belief from plausibility. The narrow uncertainty band represents
    more precise probabilities. The probability is uniquely determined if bel(A) =
    pl(A) and for classical probability theory all probabilities are unique (Yager,
    1987). If U(A) has an interval [0, 1], it means that no information is available,
    but if the interval is [1, 1], then it means that A has been completely confirmed
    by m(A). Example 1 (Contd.): The uncertainty interval for the case at hand is
    U ( A ) L = [ 0.6 , 1.0 ] ; U ( A ) M = [ 0.0 , 0.4 ] ; U ( A ) H = [ 0.0 , 0.1
    ] U ( A ) L , M = [ 0.9 , 1.0 ] ; U ( A ) L , H = [ 0.6 , 1.0 ] ; U ( A ) M ,
    H = [ 0.0 , 0.4 ] ; and U ( A ) Θ = [ 1.0 , 1.0 ] 2.6. Dempster–Shafer rule of
    combination The purpose of data fusion is to summarize and simplify information
    rationally. The D–S theory assumes sources of information are independent. The
    multiple sources of information in our context could be water quality samples
    collected at various points Sis in the distribution system at a given time “tj”.
    The D–S rule of combination can help in providing an overall picture of water
    quality at a given time “tj” in the distribution system. Similarly, evidences
    about the water quality can be aggregated temporally (samples collected at various
    times tjs) at a given sampling point Si using D–S rule of combination. Alim (1988)
    described that the “combined” belief represents not only the total belief in a
    set A and all of its subsets but also takes into account the contribution of different
    sources of evidence that focus on A. The D–S inference uses trade-off type combination
    operators and less information is assumed than that of Bayesian inference by compromising
    on precision, but Bayesian theory does not express any uncertainty associated
    with it and uses Principle of Insufficient Reason for inference (Sentz and Ferson,
    2002). The D–S rule of combination strictly emphasizes on the agreement between
    multiple sources and ignores all the conflicting evidence through normalization.
    A strict conjunctive logic through AND operator (estimated by a product of two
    probabilities) is employed in combination of evidence. The D–S combination rule
    determines the joint m1–2 from the aggregation of two basic probability assignments
    m1 and m2 by following equation: (7) m 1 – 2 ( A ) = ∑ B ∩ C = A m 1 ( B ) m 2
    ( C ) 1 - K when A ≠ ϕ ; and m 1 – 2 ( ϕ ) = 0 where (8) K = ∑ B ∩ C = ϕ m 1 (
    B ) m 2 ( C ) where K is the degree of conflict in two sources of evidences. The
    denominator (1 − K) in Eq. (7) is a normalization factor, which helps aggregation
    by completely ignoring the conflicting evidence. The above equations can also
    written as (9) m 1 – 2 ( A ) = ∑ B ∩ C = A m 1 ( B ) m 2 ( C ) ∑ B ∩ C ≠ ϕ m 1
    ( B ) m 2 ( C ) Example 1 (Contd.): Water quality is monitored at two locations
    Si (i = 1, 2) in the distribution system at a given time tj. The utility manager
    is interested in overall water quality in the distribution system at tj based
    on these two observations S1 and S2 m1(B)L = 0.6 m2(C)M = 0.4 m1(B)L,M = 0.3 and
    m2(C)M,H = 0.2 m1(B)Θ = 0.1 m2(C)Θ = 0.4 By applying D–S rule of combination on
    sources of information B and C, the following data is generated: Degree of conflict
    = K = 0.24 + 0.12 = 0.36, therefore normalization factor = 1 − K = 0.64 m 1 –
    2 ( A ) L = 0.24 / 0.64 = 0.38 ; m 1 – 2 ( A ) M = ( 0.12 + 0.06 + 0.04 ) / 0.64
    = 0.34 ; m 1 – 2 ( A ) H = 0.0 ; m 1 – 2 ( A ) L , M = 0.12 / 0.64 = 0.19 ; m
    1 – 2 ( A ) L , H = 0.0 ; m 1 – 2 ( A ) M , H = 0.02 / 0.64 = 0.03 ; m 1 – 2 (
    A ) Θ = 0.04 / 0.64 = 0.06 Similarly, belief and plausibility functions and belief
    interval can be determined by using corresponding equation described earlier.

    be noticed that based on evidence from two samples, the water quality can be rated
    as low or medium. 2.7. Modified combination rules Serious drawbacks have been
    identified in D–S rule of combination. Zadeh (1984) presented an intriguing example
    of a patient who is diagnosed by two physicians A and B. The physician A diagnosed
    that the patient has a disease x with the 99% probability (confidence) and has
    only 1% probability of disease y. The physician B diagnosed that the patient has
    a disease z with the 99% probability and has only 1% probability of disease y.
    The frame of discernment for the diseases is Θ = {x, y, z}. Using D–S rule of
    combination, following results will be obtained: Degree of conflict = K = 0.9999
    ∴ Normalization factor = 1 - K = 0.0001 m x ( disease ) = 0.0 ; m y ( disease
    ) = 1.0 ; and m z ( disease ) = 0.0 These results are counterintuitive, as 99.99%
    evidence was neglected due to conflict. Sentz and Ferson (2002) have provided
    an excellent review of various methods and techniques to resolve this discrepancy.
    Most common methods are Yager’s modified Dempster’s rule (1987), Inagaki’s Unified
    Combination rule (1991), and Zhang’s Center Combination rule (Zhang, 1994). 2.8.
    Aggregation operators The triangular norms (t-norms) are a class of operators
    introduced for the development of a probabilistic generalization of the theory
    of metric spaces (Ramik and Vlach, 2001). The t-norms are used extensively in
    fuzzy set theory. They provide a tool for defining various types of intersection
    of fuzzy sets and expressing conjunctive logic. The t-norms, satisfy the axioms
    of commutativity, associativity, monotonicity, and boundary condition (Ramik and
    Vlach, 2001). Triangular conorms (t-conorms) provide a tool for defining various
    types of union of fuzzy sets and expressing conjunctive logic. These operators
    also satisfy all the axioms of commutativity, associativity, monotonicity, and
    boundary condition (Ramik and Vlach, 2001). The t-norms and t-conorms provide
    a range of operations for the aggregation of fuzzy sets (and probability theory).
    Aggregation or fusion is done through satisfying several or few criteria (performance
    indicators). When the requirement is such that all (or several) criteria have
    to be met, t-norms (and-type operators) are typically used; but when the requirement
    is such that only few criteria have to be met (out of many), t-conorms (or-type
    operators) are typically used. Consequently, on the scale of strictness of criteria,
    the t-norms represent the more strict criteria because being intersection-based
    they require conjunction (and-type operator) of aggregation, while the t-conorms
    represent more relaxed criteria, as being union-based they require disjunction
    (or-type operator) of aggregation (Sentz and Ferson, 2002). Fig. 1 illustrates
    the entire range of aggregation operators from very strict to very relaxed. Note
    that t-norms and t-conorms are only two classes out of an entire range of aggregation
    operations. Average-type (e.g., arithmetic mean, ordered weighted average (OWA)
    operators) or compromising/compensatory operators lie in between two extremes.

    2002). 2.9. Disjunctive operator for Dempster–Shafer rule Traditional D–S rule
    of combination does not all allow to fuse the information from completely conflicting
    sources because the normalization factor (1 − K) becomes zero in Eq. (7). Yager
    (2004) addressed this issue and proposed the use of disjunctive operators. Eq.
    (9) can be modified as (10) m 1 – 2 ( A ) = ∑ B ∩ C = A max [ m 1 ( B ) , m 2
    ( C ) ] ∑ B ∩ C ≠ ϕ max [ m 1 ( B ) , m 2 ( C ) ] Other disjunctive operators
    (see Fig. 1) than “max” can also be used in Eq. (10). In the physician–patient
    example discussed by Zadeh (1984), the new diagnosis will be mx(disease) = 0.497,
    my(disease) = 0.005, and mz(disease) = 0.497. Example 1 (Contd.): The disjunctive
    (maximum) operator (Eq. (10)) is used in modified combination rule. After estimating
    the basic probability assignments, the belief and plausibility functions are determined
    as described before in Eqs. (2), (4), respectively. Subsets m1–2(A) bel1–2(A)

    on evidence from two samples, the water quality can be rated as low or medium.
    2.10. Combining sources of varying credibility The approaches described before
    implicitly assume that all sources of information are equally credible. Sampling
    locations for monitoring water quality may be representative of a part of water
    distribution system, e.g., if one sample is collected from main distribution line
    and the other is collected from a minor line, the influence zones of both samples
    are different. Similarly, if the samples are collected at the same point when
    two different flow conditions prevail, the evidence of water quality also needs
    to be adjusted based on flow conditions. Similarly, if water utility staff with
    different levels of expertise collects water samples, the observations need to
    be adjusted based on their credibility. Yager (2004) discussed the credibility
    issue in detail and suggested a credibility transformation function. This approach
    discounts the evidence with a credibility factor (α) and distributes remaining
    evidence (1 − α) equally among elements (n) of frame of discernment. (11) m (
    A ) a = m ( A ) • α + 1 - α n where α is the Credibility factor and n is the focal
    elements in frame of discernment. Example 1 (Contd.): Assume that credibility
    adjustment factors assigned to two samples collected at different locations in
    the distribution are αB = 1.0 and αC = 0.5. These factors represent the confidence
    of the collected information. The modified evidences will be m1(B)L = 0.6 m2(C)M
    = 0.36 m1(B)L,M = 0.3 and m2(C)M,H = 0.1 m1(B)Θ = 0.1 m2(C)L = 0.17 m2(C)H = 0.17
    and m2(C)Θ = 0.2 As credibility of first evidence is 100%, therefore no adjustment
    is required for m1(B), but evidence m2(C) is only 50% credible, the evidence is
    adjusted as below: m 2 ( C ) M = 0.4 • 0.5 + ( 1 - 0.5 ) / 3 = 0.36 m 2 ( C )
    L = 0.0 • 0.5 + ( 1 - 0.5 ) / 3 = 0.17 m 2 ( C ) H = 0.0 • 0.5 + ( 1 - 0.5 ) /
    3 = 0.17 m 2 ( C ) M , H = 0.2 • 0.5 = 0.1 m 2 ( C ) Θ = 0.4 • 0.5 = 0.2 It is
    important to note that as α → 0 (i.e., confidence for given evidence), the inference
    tends to become Baysian, i.e., Principle of Insufficient Reason is applied. A
    limiting case for evidence is m2(C)Θ = 1.0, i.e., complete ignorance in D–S framework.
    If the credibility factor α = 0, the adjusted evidence will become m 2 ( C ) L
    = 0 • 0 + ( 1 - 0 ) / 3 = 0.33 , similarly m 2 ( C ) M = 0.33 and m 2 ( C ) H
    = 0.33 The adjusted evidences can be combined using modified D–S rule of combination
    as described earlier. Subsets m1–2(A)a bel1–2(A)a pl1–2(A)a U1–2(A)a ϕ 0.0 0.0

    1.0] As noticed from the above analysis that belief of water quality being low
    is the highest among other Condition States (medium and high), therefore based
    on the available information the utility manager (or decision-maker) may conclude
    that water quality in the distribution is acceptable. But if the utility manager
    wants to be more confident about his judgement, he (she) will conclude that water
    quality is low or medium because the belief of subset {L, M} is 76%. In the above
    example, we allowed a subset {L, H}, that does not contain two contiguous states.
    But in reality, generally only two contiguous states are possible, i.e., in our
    case {L, M} or {M, H}. If the decision-maker wants to increase the confidence
    for his (her) judgement concerning water quality Condition State he (she) will
    collect more sample (evidence). In this way he (she) can narrow down the uncertainty
    and increase the confidence in his (her) judgment. 3. Dempster–Shafer theory application
    for developing water quality index Water quality is generally defined by a collection
    of upper and lower limits on selected possible contaminants (Maier, 1999). Water
    quality indicators can be classified into three broad categories: physical, chemical,
    and microbiological contaminants. Within each class, a number of quality indicators
    are considered. The acceptability of water quality for its intended use depends
    on the magnitude of these indicators (Swamee and Tyagi, 2000) and is often governed
    by regulations (US EPA, 2001). The physical, chemical, and microbiological processes
    occurring in drinking water distribution pipes are numerous and complex. A wealth
    of literature is available on water quality represented by an aggregate index
    using various statistical and mathematical techniques. Swamee and Tyagi (2000)
    have discussed in detail the pros and cons of different techniques and approaches
    available for evaluating the overall water quality index (WQI). Sinha et al. (1994)
    combined pH, chloride concentration, turbidity, residual chlorine, conductivity,
    and MPN (most probable number––a bacterial counting technique) into a single water
    quality index through a weighting technique to represent an overall water quality
    at various nodes in the distribution system. Sadiq et al. (2004) have suggested
    a fuzzy-based framework for aggregative risk analysis of water quality failure
    in the distribution system. Recently, Sadiq and Rodriguez (2004a) proposed a risk-based
    fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique for aggregating effects of disinfection byproducts
    found in drinking water. The WQI is a systematic way of interpreting measurements
    and (or) observations of water quality, which helps managers to describe a Condition
    State or to share and communicate with the public in a consistent manner. The
    WQI provides a general means of comparing and ranking water quality. Traditionally,
    WQI encompasses factors like number of indicators not meeting the regulation,
    frequency of a particular indicator by which it is not meeting the requirement
    in a given sampling protocol, and amount by which indicators are violating the
    regulatory requirements. These three factors are combined to form the WQI, which
    can be interpreted by predefined qualitative ranking system. For overall water
    quality based on various indicators, credibility adjustment is required for each
    indicator for its contribution. For example, if the water quality is defined by
    turbidity, total coliforms, residual chlorine, and aesthetic indicators (taste,
    odour, colour), the violation of turbidity from its threshold value has lesser
    consequences and impacts with respect to microbial violations. Different credibility
    weights need to be defined for each indicator representing its body of evidence
    in defining overall water quality. Another useful application of D–S rule of combination
    is to develop a WQI that integrates various water quality indicators (of noncommensurate
    units) as a single entity. Example 2 will illustrate such application for the
    case of aggregation of three important physico-chemical and microbiological indicators
    of water quality in the distribution system. Example 2 The application of disinfection
    agents in drinking water reduces the microbial risk but poses chemical risk in
    the form of their byproducts. A risk–risk trade-off is required to optimize the
    dose and type of disinfection practices. Three water quality indicators––trihalomethanes
    (THMs), residual chlorine (RC), and heterotrophic plate counts (HPCs) (indicator
    for microbial presence)––are identified for evaluating the overall water quality
    in the distribution system. The water quality is defined by five risk classes––very
    low (VL), low (L), medium (M), high (H), and very high (VH). Therefore, the frame
    of discernment is Θ = {VL, L, M, H, VH}. These water quality indicators are defined
    by these five classes of risk (Fig. 2). The thresholds shown in Fig. 2 for Example
    2 were established based on water quality standards and based on authors’ experience
    with the water quality in Canadian distribution systems. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Basic probability assignments for water quality indicators.  • The
    bpa for a given water quality indicator is determined by mapping on corresponding
    triangular functions as shown in Fig. 2. The qualitative scale is defined in such
    a way that bpa for only two risk classes are obtained. Therefore, for any value
    of water quality indicator, maximum two focal elements are possible. In this setting,
    subsets with two or more elements are not allowed. For a water quality indicator,
    bpa is represented by a 5-tuple set {VL, L, M, H, VH}. • For a given water sample,
    the bpa for three indicators are represented as follow: m(RC)VL m(HPC)VL m(THM)VL
    m(RC)L m(HPC)L m(THM)L m(RC)M m(HPC)M m(THM)M m(RC)H m(HPC)H m(THM)H m(RC)VH m(HPC)VH
    m(THM)VH • The credibility factors α are assigned to these indicators based on
    expert judgement α RC = 0.9 α HPC = 0.5 α THM = 0.8 • The bpa for each water quality
    indicator is adjusted by credibility factors α using Eq. (11). The adjusted bpa
    for water quality indicators are aggregated using modified disjunctive operator
    D–S rule of combination. • The belief and plausibility functions and belief interval
    are determined.  Example 2 (Contd.): A water sample was collected from distribution
    system and tested for residual chlorine, THMs, and HPCs. RC = 0.09 mg / l ; HPC
    = 62 / 100 ml ; and THM = 118 ppb The bpa for each water quality indicator is
    derived from Fig. 2 m(RC)VL = 0.0 m(HPC)VL = 0.0 m(THM)VL = 0.0 m(RC)L = 0.0 m(HPC)L
    = 0.48 m(THM)L = 0.0 m(RC)M = 0.0 m(HPC)M = 0.52 m(THM)M = 0.0 m(RC)H = 0.87 m(HPC)H
    = 0.0 m(THM)H = 0.0 m(RC)VH = 0.13 m(HPC)VH = 0.0 m(THM)VH = 1.0 The bpa is adjusted
    with respect to their credibility factors. The evidence is modified to m(RC)VL
    = 0.02 m(HPC)VL = 0.10 m(THM)VL = 0.04 m(RC)L = 0.02 m(HPC)L = 0.34 m(THM)L =

    m(THM)H = 0.04 m(RC)VH = 0.14 m(HPC)VH = 0.10 m(THM)VH = 0.84 The adjusted bpa
    for water quality indicators can be aggregated using disjunctive operator D–S
    rule of combination. bpa Belief Plausibility m(WQ)VL = 0.04 bl(WQ)VL = 0.04 pl(WQ)VL

    = 0.34 pl(WQ)VH = 0.34 The probability mass function of risk can be plotted using
    belief function. The universe of discourse of risk scale is soft in nature (Fig.
    3). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Probability mass function of risk.
    Utility values can be assigned to soft items to determine the water quality index
    as a crisp output. Yang and Xu (2002) discussed a probabilistic method to determine
    the utility values for soft items in a heuristic way. These values can also be
    determined through linear optimization based on expert judgement. Here, an arbitrary
    linear function is proposed to estimate the crisp WQI (a surrogate for representing
    risk) and all five classes of risk are assigned utility values as follow: (12)
    WQI = u 2 0 [ bl ( WQ ) VH ] + u 2 1 [ bl ( WQ ) H ] + u 2 2 [ bl ( WQ ) M ] +
    u 2 3 [ bl ( WQ ) L ] + u 2 4 [ bl ( WQ ) VL ] where utility coefficient u is
    assumed ≈1.3. New regulations for the allowable concentrations of disinfection
    byproducts are being developed in the US and elsewhere for drinking water supplies.
    Disinfection reduces the risk from microbial infections, but may pose cancer and
    other risks from the DBPs (THMs are the most commonly identified DBPs). Many other
    DBPs, however, remain to be identified and the public health significance of these
    is unknown. Society is facing a difficult trade-off between established (known)
    microbial risks due to pathogens and more uncertain (unknown) risks from DBPs.
    In the case of evaluating the risk–risk trade-offs in drinking water, the competing
    risks must be assessed within a common framework. Example 2 (Contd.): The risk–risk
    trade-off for HPCs (a microbial indicator) and THMs (representative DBP) is established
    at different levels of residual chlorine concentration in Fig. 4a–d. The WQI is
    used as a surrogate for risk, estimated using Eq. (12). Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Water quality index (WQI) representing risk profiles at various
    residual chlorine levels. The analysis is performed for 0, 0.2, 0.5, and 4 mg/l
    residual chlorine concentrations. When levels of residual chlorine are not detectable,
    the WQI varied approximately from 0.6 to 1.0. Higher risks were observed for even
    very low HPC and THM concentrations (Fig. 4a), because the minimal levels of residual
    chlorine are necessary to provide safeguard against microbial contamination. But
    when the residual concentration is increased to 0.2, 0.5, and 4.0 mg/l, the WQI
    varied from 0.2 to approximately 0.8 (Fig. 4b–d), which is comparatively lower
    than the first case. The three-dimensional characteristic risk curves (e.g. Fig.
    4) can be established for various water quality indicators, which are able to
    predict levels of any particular indicator (e.g., HPCs) that are required to achieve
    acceptable risk under given conditions. For example, for an acceptable risk (WQI)
    of 0.25, the residual chlorine in the distribution system is reported to be in
    the range of 0.2–0.5 mg/l and THM potential is estimated (using regression or
    kinetic models, see Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004b) to be in the range of 25–50 ppb,
    and the HPC levels should not exceed 200/100 ml. This concept can be extended
    to more water quality indicators. 4. Summary and conclusions In this paper, the
    evidence theory was introduced as an innovative methodology that can be used for
    simplifying and improving the understanding of data generated through routine
    water quality monitoring in distribution systems. Two examples were presented
    that support the potential application of theory of evidence for data fusion,
    namely, interpretation of overall water quality in the distribution system based
    on spatial data collected at different sampling locations and development of WQI.
    For the first example, additional aspects should be investigated in the future,
    such as the impact of the uncertainty on the confidence of the decision-maker’s
    judgement (according to the amount of information available, in this case the
    number and the frequency of spatial distribution of samples collected). For the
    second example, additional information should be considered in the future to develop
    more robust indices, i.e., additional water quality indicators (e.g., pathogenic
    indicators such as coliforms and other disinfection byproducts like haloacetic
    acids), operational parameters (e.g., pressures, flow rates, reservoir level control,
    etc.), and data on the distribution system infrastructure (e.g., pipe breakage
    rate and replacement, pipe flushing etc.). Theory of evidence can efficiently
    deal with the difficulties related to host of indicators describing water quality,
    with spatial and temporal dimensions of distribution system, where redundancy
    of information is routinely observed as well as the credibility of available data
    is varied. Future research must focus on the implementation of decision-making
    tools using theory of evidence that can be adapted to specific water utility conditions
    and manager’s needs. The potential combination of theory of evidence with modeling
    techniques, such as linear and nonlinear time-series analysis, neural networks,
    and genetic algorithms, to predict the condition state of water quality must also
    be evaluated through future research efforts to implement more powerful decision-making
    tools. References Alim, 1988 S. Alim Application of Dempster–Shafer theory for

    \ This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution\
    \ License,\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in\
    \ any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nThe integration of\
    \ data and knowledge from several sources is known as data fusion. This paper\
    \ summarizes the state of the data\nfusion field and describes the most relevant\
    \ studies. We first enumerate and explain different classification schemes for\
    \ data fusion.\nThen, the most common algorithms are reviewed. These methods and\
    \ algorithms are presented using three different categories: (i)\ndata association,\
    \ (ii) state estimation, and (iii) decision fusion.\n1. Introduction\nIn general,\
    \ all tasks that demand any type of parameter\nestimation from multiple sources\
    \ can benefit from the use\nof data/information fusion methods. The terms information\n\
    fusion and data fusion are typically employed as synonyms;\nbut in some scenarios,\
    \ the term data fusion is used for\nraw data (obtained directly from the sensors)\
    \ and the term\ninformation fusion is employed to define already processed\ndata.\
    \ In this sense, the term information fusion implies a\nhigher semantic level\
    \ than data fusion. Other terms associ-\nated with data fusion that typically\
    \ appear in the literature\ninclude decision fusion, data combination, data aggregation,\n\
    multisensor data fusion, and sensor fusion.\nResearchers in this field agree that\
    \ the most accepted\ndefinition of data fusion was provided by the Joint Directors\n\
    of Laboratories (JDL) workshop [1]: “A multi-level process\ndealing with the association,\
    \ correlation, combination of data\nand information from single and multiple sources\
    \ to achieve\nrefined position, identify estimates and complete and timely\nassessments\
    \ of situations, threats and their significance.”\nHall and Llinas [2] provided\
    \ the following well-known\ndefinition of data fusion: “data fusion techniques\
    \ combine data\nfrom multiple sensors and related information from associated\n\
    databases to achieve improved accuracy and more specific\ninferences than could\
    \ be achieved by the use of a single sensor\nalone.”\nBriefly, we can define data\
    \ fusion as a combination of\nmultiple sources to obtain improved information;\
    \ in this\ncontext, improved information means less expensive, higher\nquality,\
    \ or more relevant information.\nData fusion techniques have been extensively\
    \ employed\non multisensor environments with the aim of fusing and\naggregating\
    \ data from different sensors; however, these tech-\nniques can also be applied\
    \ to other domains, such as text\nprocessing. The goal of using data fusion in\
    \ multisensor envi-\nronments is to obtain a lower detection error probability\
    \ and\na higher reliability by using data from multiple distributed\nsources.\n\
    The available data fusion techniques can be classified into\nthree nonexclusive\
    \ categories: (i) data association, (ii) state\nestimation, and (iii) decision\
    \ fusion. Because of the large\nnumber of published papers on data fusion, this\
    \ paper does\nnot aim to provide an exhaustive review of all of the studies;\n\
    instead, the objective is to highlight the main steps that are\ninvolved in the\
    \ data fusion framework and to review the most\ncommon techniques for each step.\n\
    The remainder of this paper continues as follows. The\nnext section provides various\
    \ classification categories for data\nfusion techniques. Then, Section 3 describes\
    \ the most com-\nmon methods for data association tasks. Section 4 provides\n\
    a review of techniques under the state estimation category.\nNext, the most common\
    \ techniques for decision fusion are\nenumerated in Section 5. Finally, the conclusions\
    \ obtained\n2\nThe Scientific World Journal\nfrom reviewing the different methods\
    \ are highlighted in\nSection 6.\n2. Classification of Data Fusion Techniques\n\
    Data fusion is a multidisciplinary area that involves several\nfields, and it\
    \ is difficult to establish a clear and strict classifi-\ncation. The employed\
    \ methods and techniques can be divided\naccording to the following criteria:\n\
    (1) attending to the relations between the input data\nsources, as proposed by\
    \ Durrant-Whyte [3]. These\nrelations can be defined as (a) complementary, (b)\n\
    redundant, or (3) cooperative data;\n(2) according to the input/output data types\
    \ and their\nnature, as proposed by Dasarathy [4];\n(3) following an abstraction\
    \ level of the employed data:\n(a) raw measurement, (b) signals, and (c) characteris-\n\
    tics or decisions;\n(4) based on the different data fusion levels defined by the\n\
    JDL;\n(5) Depending on the architecture type: (a) centralized,\n(b) decentralized,\
    \ or (c) distributed.\n2.1. Classification Based on the Relations between the\
    \ Data\nSources. Based on the relations of the sources (see Figure 1),\nDurrant-Whyte\
    \ [3] proposed the following classification\ncriteria:\n(1) complementary: when\
    \ the information provided by\nthe input sources represents different parts of\
    \ the\nscene and could thus be used to obtain more complete\nglobal information.\
    \ For example, in the case of visual\nsensor networks, the information on the\
    \ same target\nprovided by two cameras with different fields of view\nis considered\
    \ complementary;\n(2) redundant: when two or more input sources provide\ninformation\
    \ about the same target and could thus be\nfused to increment the confidence.\
    \ For example, the\ndata coming from overlapped areas in visual sensor\nnetworks\
    \ are considered redundant;\n(3) cooperative: when the provided information is\
    \ com-\nbined into new information that is typically more\ncomplex than the original\
    \ information. For example,\nmulti-modal (audio and video) data fusion is consid-\n\
    ered cooperative.\n2.2. Dasarathy’s Classification. One of the most well-known\n\
    data fusion classification systems was provided by Dasarathy\n[4] and is composed\
    \ of the following five categories (see\nFigure 2):\n(1) data in-data out (DAI-DAO):\
    \ this type is the most\nbasic or elementary data fusion method that is con-\n\
    sidered in classification. This type of data fusion\nprocess inputs and outputs\
    \ raw data; the results\nare typically more reliable or accurate. Data fusion\
    \ at\nthis level is conducted immediately after the data are\ngathered from the\
    \ sensors. The algorithms employed\nat this level are based on signal and image\
    \ processing\nalgorithms;\n(2) data in-feature out (DAI-FEO): at this level, the\
    \ data\nfusion process employs raw data from the sources\nto extract features\
    \ or characteristics that describe an\nentity in the environment;\n(3) feature\
    \ in-feature out (FEI-FEO): at this level, both\nthe input and output of the data\
    \ fusion process are\nfeatures. Thus, the data fusion process addresses a\nset\
    \ of features with to improve, refine or obtain new\nfeatures. This process is\
    \ also known as feature fusion,\nsymbolic fusion, information fusion or intermediate-\n\
    level fusion;\n(4) feature in-decision out (FEI-DEO): this level obtains a\nset\
    \ of features as input and provides a set of decisions\nas output. Most of the\
    \ classification systems that\nperform a decision based on a sensor’s inputs fall\
    \ into\nthis category of classification;\n(5) Decision In-Decision Out (DEI-DEO):\
    \ This type of\nclassification is also known as decision fusion. It fuses\ninput\
    \ decisions to obtain better or new decisions.\nThe main contribution of Dasarathy’s\
    \ classification is the\nspecification of the abstraction level either as an input\
    \ or an\noutput, providing a framework to classify different methods\nor techniques.\n\
    2.3. Classification Based on the Abstraction Levels. Luo et al.\n[5] provided\
    \ the following four abstraction levels:\n(1) signal level: directly addresses\
    \ the signals that are\nacquired from the sensors;\n(2) pixel level: operates\
    \ at the image level and could be\nused to improve image processing tasks;\n(3)\
    \ characteristic: employs features that are extracted\nfrom the images or signals\
    \ (i.e., shape or velocity),\n(4) symbol: at this level, information is represented\
    \ as\nsymbols; this level is also known as the decision level.\nInformation fusion\
    \ typically addresses three levels of\nabstraction: (1) measurements, (2) characteristics,\
    \ and (3)\ndecisions. Other possible classifications of data fusion based\non\
    \ the abstraction levels are as follows:\n(1) low level fusion: the raw data are\
    \ directly provided\nas an input to the data fusion process, which provide\nmore\
    \ accurate data (a lower signal-to-noise ratio)\nthan the individual sources;\n\
    (2) medium level fusion: characteristics or features\n(shape, texture, and position)\
    \ are fused to obtain\nfeatures that could be employed for other tasks. This\n\
    level is also known as the feature or characteristic\nlevel;\nThe Scientific World\
    \ Journal\n3\nS1\nS2\nS3\nS4\nS5\nComplementary\nfusion\nRedundant\nfusion\nCooperative\n\

    (DEI-DEO)\nFeature in-feature out\n(FEI-FEO)\nFigure 2: Dasarathy’s classification.\n\
    (3) high level fusion: this level, which is also known\nas decision fusion, takes\
    \ symbolic representations as\nsources and combines them to obtain a more accurate\n\
    decision. Bayesian’s methods are typically employed at\nthis level;\n(4) multiple\
    \ level fusion: this level addresses data pro-\nvided from different levels of\
    \ abstraction (i.e., when\na measurement is combined with a feature to obtain\
    \ a\ndecision).\n2.4. JDL Data Fusion Classification. This classification is the\n\
    most popular conceptual model in the data fusion commu-\nnity. It was originally\
    \ proposed by JDL and the American\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) [1]. These organizations\
    \ clas-\nsified the data fusion process into five processing levels, an\nassociated\
    \ database, and an information bus that connects\nthe five components (see Figure\
    \ 3). The five levels could be\ngrouped into two groups, low-level fusion and\
    \ high-level\nfusion, which comprise the following components:\n(i) sources: the\
    \ sources are in charge of providing\nthe input data. Different types of sources\
    \ can be\nemployed, such as sensors, a priori information (ref-\nerences or geographic\
    \ data), databases, and human\ninputs;\n(ii) human-computer interaction (HCI):\
    \ HCI is an inter-\nface that allows inputs to the system from the oper-\nators\

    \ system: the database manage-\nment system stores the provided information and\n\
    the fused results. This system is a critical component\nbecause of the large amount\
    \ of highly diverse infor-\nmation that is stored.\nIn contrast, the five levels\
    \ of data processing are defined as\nfollows:\n(1) level 0—source preprocessing:\

    it includes fusion at the signal and pixel levels. In\nthe case of text sources,\
    \ this level also includes the\ninformation extraction process. This level reduces\
    \ the\namount of data and maintains useful information for\nthe high-level processes;\n\
    (2) level 1—object refinement: object refinement employs\nthe processed data from\
    \ the previous level. Com-\nmon procedures of this level include spatio-temporal\n\
    alignment, association, correlation, clustering or\ngrouping techniques, state\
    \ estimation, the removal of\nfalse positives, identity fusion, and the combining\
    \ of\nfeatures that were extracted from images. The output\n4\nThe Scientific\

    \ and object track-\ning (state of the object and orientation). This stage\ntransforms\
    \ the input information into consistent data\nstructures;\n(3) level 2—situation\
    \ assessment: this level focuses on\na higher level of inference than level 1.\
    \ Situation\nassessment aims to identify the likely situations given\nthe observed\
    \ events and obtained data. It establishes\nrelationships between the objects.\
    \ Relations (i.e.,\nproximity, communication) are valued to determine\nthe significance\
    \ of the entities or objects in a specific\nenvironment. The aim of this level\
    \ includes perform-\ning high-level inferences and identifying significant\nactivities\
    \ and events (patterns in general). The output\nis a set of high-level inferences;\n\
    (4) level 3—impact assessment: this level evaluates the\nimpact of the detected\
    \ activities in level 2 to obtain a\nproper perspective. The current situation\
    \ is evaluated,\nand a future projection is performed to identify\npossible risks,\
    \ vulnerabilities, and operational oppor-\ntunities. This level includes (1) an\
    \ evaluation of the\nrisk or threat and (2) a prediction of the logical\noutcome;\n\
    (5) level 4—process refinement: this level improves the\nprocess from level 0\
    \ to level 3 and provides resource\nand sensor management. The aim is to achieve\
    \ effi-\ncient resource management while accounting for task\npriorities, scheduling,\
    \ and the control of available\nresources.\nHigh-level fusion typically starts\
    \ at level 2 because the\ntype, localization, movement, and quantity of the objects\n\
    are known at that level. One of the limitations of the JDL\nmethod is how the\
    \ uncertainty about previous or subsequent\nresults could be employed to enhance\
    \ the fusion process\n(feedback loop). Llinas et al. [6] propose several refinements\n\
    and extensions to the JDL model. Blasch and Plano [7]\nproposed to add a new level\
    \ (user refinement) to support a\nhuman user in the data fusion loop. The JDL\
    \ model represents\nthe first effort to provide a detailed model and a common\n\
    terminology for the data fusion domain. However, because\ntheir roots originate\
    \ in the military domain, the employed\nterms are oriented to the risks that commonly\
    \ occur in\nthese scenarios. The Dasarathy model differs from the JDL\nmodel with\
    \ regard to the adopted terminology and employed\napproach. The former is oriented\
    \ toward the differences\namong the input and output results, independent of the\n\
    employed fusion method. In summary, the Dasarathy model\nprovides a method for\
    \ understanding the relations between\nthe fusion tasks and employed data, whereas\
    \ the JDL model\npresents an appropriate fusion perspective to design data\nfusion\
    \ systems.\n2.5. Classification Based on the Type of Architecture. One of\nthe\
    \ main questions that arise when designing a data fusion\nsystem is where the\
    \ data fusion process will be performed.\nBased on this criterion, the following\
    \ types of architectures\ncould be identified:\n(1) centralized architecture:\
    \ in a centralized architecture,\nthe fusion node resides in the central processor\
    \ that\nreceives the information from all of the input sources.\nTherefore, all\
    \ of the fusion processes are executed\nin a central processor that uses the provided\
    \ raw\nmeasurements from the sources. In this schema, the\nsources obtain only\
    \ the observationas measurements\nand transmit them to a central processor, where\
    \ the\ndata fusion process is performed. If we assume that\ndata alignment and\
    \ data association are performed\ncorrectly and that the required time to transfer\
    \ the\ndata is not significant, then the centralized scheme is\ntheoretically\
    \ optimal. However, the previous assump-\ntions typically do not hold for real\
    \ systems. Moreover,\nthe large amount of bandwidth that is required to send\n\
    raw data through the network is another disadvantage\nfor the centralized approach.\
    \ This issue becomes a\nbottleneck when this type of architecture is employed\n\
    for fusing data in visual sensor networks. Finally,\nthe time delays when transferring\
    \ the information\nbetween the different sources are variable and affect\nThe\
    \ Scientific World Journal\n5\nthe results in the centralized scheme to a greater\n\
    degree than in other schemes;\n(2) decentralized architecture: a decentralized\
    \ architec-\nture is composed of a network of nodes in which each\nnode has its\
    \ own processing capabilities and there is\nno single point of data fusion. Therefore,\
    \ each node\nfuses its local information with the information that\nis received\
    \ from its peers. Data fusion is performed\nautonomously, with each node accounting\
    \ for its local\ninformation and the information received from its\npeers. Decentralized\
    \ data fusion algorithms typically\ncommunicate information using the Fisher and\
    \ Shan-\nnon measurements instead of the object’s state [8];\nThe main disadvantage\
    \ of this architecture is the\ncommunication cost, which is \U0001D442(\U0001D45B\
    2) at each com-\nmunication step, where \U0001D45B is the number of nodes;\nadditionally,\
    \ the extreme case is considered, in which\neach node communicates with all of\
    \ its peers. Thus,\nthis type of architecture could suffer from scalability\n\
    problems when the number of nodes is increased;\n(3) distributed architecture:\
    \ in a distributed architecture,\nmeasurements from each source node are processed\n\
    independently before the information is sent to the\nfusion node; the fusion node\
    \ accounts for the infor-\nmation that is received from the other nodes. In other\n\
    words, the data association and state estimation are\nperformed in the source\
    \ node before the information\nis communicated to the fusion node. Therefore,\
    \ each\nnode provides an estimation of the object state based\non only their local\
    \ views, and this information is\nthe input to the fusion process, which provides\
    \ a\nfused global view. This type of architecture provides\ndifferent options\
    \ and variations that range from only\none fusion node to several intermediate\
    \ fusion nodes;\n(4) hierarchical architecture: other architectures com-\nprise\
    \ a combination of decentralized and distributed\nnodes, generating hierarchical\
    \ schemes in which the\ndata fusion process is performed at different levels in\n\
    the hierarchy.\nIn principle, a decentralized data fusion system is more\ndifficult\
    \ to implement because of the computation and\ncommunication requirements. However,\
    \ in practice, there is\nno single best architecture, and the selection of the\
    \ most\nappropriate architecture should be made depending on the\nrequirements,\
    \ demand, existing networks, data availability,\nnode processing capabilities,\
    \ and organization of the data\nfusion system.\nThe reader might think that the\
    \ decentralized and\ndistributed architectures are similar; however, they have\n\
    meaningful differences (see Figure 4). First, in a distributed\narchitecture,\
    \ a preprocessing of the obtained measurements is\nperformed, which provides a\
    \ vector of features as a result (the\nfeatures are fused thereafter). In contrast,\
    \ in the decentralized\narchitecture, the complete data fusion process is conducted\n\
    in each node, and each of the nodes provides a globally\nfused result. Second,\
    \ the decentralized fusion algorithms\ntypically communicate information, employing\
    \ the Fisher\nand Shannon measurements. In contrast, distributed algo-\nrithms\
    \ typically share a common notion of state (position,\nvelocity, and identity)\
    \ with their associated probabilities,\nwhich are used to perform the fusion process\
    \ [9]. Third,\nbecause the decentralized data fusion algorithms exchange\ninformation\
    \ instead of states and probabilities, they have\nthe advantage of easily separating\
    \ old knowledge from new\nknowledge. Thus, the process is additive, and the associative\n\
    meaning is not relevant when the information is received\nand fused. However,\
    \ in the distributed data fusion algorithms\n(i.e., distributed by Kalman Filter),\
    \ the state that is going\nto be fused is not associative, and when and how the\
    \ fused\nestimates are computed is relevant. Nevertheless, in contrast\nto the\
    \ centralized architectures, the distributed algorithms\nreduce the necessary\
    \ communication and computational\ncosts because some tasks are computed in the\
    \ distributed\nnodes before data fusion is performed in the fusion node.\n3. Data\
    \ Association Techniques\nThe data association problem must determine the set\
    \ of\nmeasurements that correspond to each target (see Figure 5).\nLet us suppose\
    \ that there are \U0001D442 targets that are being tracked\nby only one sensor\
    \ in a cluttered environment (by a cluttered\nenvironment, we refer to an environment\
    \ that has several\ntargets that are to close each other). Then, the data association\n\
    problem can be defined as follows:\n(i) each sensor’s observation is received\
    \ in the fusion\nnode at discrete time intervals;\n(ii) the sensor might not provide\
    \ observations at a specific\ninterval;\n(iii) some observations are noise, and\
    \ other observations\noriginate from the detected target;\n(iv) for any specific\
    \ target and in every time interval, we\ndo not know (a priori) the observations\
    \ that will be\ngenerated by that target.\nTherefore, the goal of data association\
    \ is to establish the\nset of observations or measurements that are generated\
    \ by\nthe same target over time. Hall and Llinas [2] provided the\nfollowing definition\
    \ of data association: “The process of assign\nand compute the weights that relates\
    \ the observations or tracks\n(A track can be defined as an ordered set of points\
    \ that follow\na path and are generated by the same target.) from one set to\n\
    the observation of tracks of another set.”\nAs an example of the complexity of\
    \ the data association\nproblem, if we take a frame-to-frame association and assume\n\
    that \U0001D440 possible points could be detected in all \U0001D45B frames, then\n\
    the number of possible sets is (\U0001D440!)\U0001D45B−1. Note that from all\n\
    of these possible solutions, only one set establishes the true\nmovement of the\
    \ \U0001D440 points.\nData association is often performed before the state\nestimation\
    \ of the detected targets. Moreover, it is a key\nstep because the estimation\
    \ or classification will behave\nincorrectly if the data association phase does\
    \ not work\ncoherently. The data association process could also appear in\nall\
    \ of the fusion levels, but the granularity varies depending\non the objective\
    \ of each level.\n6\nThe Scientific World Journal\nPreprocessing\nPreprocessing\n\

    \ based on the type of architecture.\nIn general, an exhaustive search of all\
    \ possible combina-\ntions grows exponentially with the number of targets; thus,\n\
    the data association problem becomes NP complete. The\nmost common techniques\
    \ that are employed to solve the data\nassociation problem are presented in the\
    \ following sections\n(from Sections 3.1 to 3.7).\n3.1. Nearest Neighbors and\
    \ K-Means. Nearest neighbor\n(NN) is the simplest data association technique.\
    \ NN is\na well-known clustering algorithm that selects or groups\nthe most similar\
    \ values. How close the one measurement is\nto another depends on the employed\
    \ distance metric and\ntypically depends on the threshold that is established\
    \ by the\ndesigner. In general, the employed criteria could be based on\n(1) an\
    \ absolute distance, (2) the Euclidean distance, or (3) a\nstatistical function\
    \ of the distance.\nNN is a simple algorithm that can find a feasible (approx-\n\
    imate) solution in a small amount of time. However, in a\ncluttered environment,\
    \ it could provide many pairs that have\nthe same probability and could thus produce\

    \ propagation [10]. Moreover, this algorithm has poor\nperformance in environments\
    \ in which false measurements\nare frequent, which are in highly noisy environments.\n\
    All neighbors use a similar technique, in which all of the\nmeasurements inside\
    \ a region are included in the tracks.\n\U0001D43E-Means [11] method is a well-known\
    \ modification of\nthe NN algorithm. \U0001D43E-Means divides the dataset values\
    \ into\n\U0001D43E different clusters. \U0001D43E-Means algorithm finds the best\
    \ local-\nization of the cluster centroids, where best means a centroid\nthat\
    \ is in the center of the data cluster. \U0001D43E-Means is an iterative\nalgorithm\
    \ that can be divided into the following steps:\n(1) obtain the input data and\
    \ the number of desired\nclusters (\U0001D43E);\n(2) randomly assign the centroid\
    \ of each cluster;\n(3) match each data point with the centroid of each\ncluster;\n\
    (4) move the cluster centers to the centroid of the cluster;\n(5) if the algorithm\
    \ does not converge, return to step (3).\n\U0001D43E-Means is a popular algorithm\
    \ that has been widely\nemployed; however, it has the following disadvantages:\n\
    (i) the algorithm does not always find the optimal solu-\ntion for the cluster\
    \ centers;\n(ii) the number of clusters must be known a priori and\none must assume\
    \ that this number is the optimum;\n(iii) the algorithm assumes that the covariance\
    \ of the\ndataset is irrelevant or that it has been normalized\nalready.\nThere\
    \ are several options for overcoming these limita-\ntions. For the first one,\
    \ it is possible to execute the algorithm\nseveral times and obtain the solution\
    \ that has less variance.\nFor the second one, it is possible to start with a\
    \ low value\nof \U0001D43E and increment the values of \U0001D43E until an adequate\
    \ result\nis obtained. The third limitation can be easily overcome by\nmultiplying\
    \ the data with the inverse of the covariance matrix.\nMany variations have been\
    \ proposed to Lloyd’s basic\n\U0001D43E-Means algorithm [11], which has a computational\
    \ upper\nbound cost of \U0001D442(\U0001D43E\U0001D45B), where \U0001D45B is the\
    \ number of input points\nand \U0001D43E is the number of desired clusters. Some\
    \ algorithms\nmodify the initial cluster assignments to improve the separa-\n\
    tions and reduce the number of iterations. Others introduce\nsoft or multinomial\
    \ clustering assignments using fuzzy logic,\nprobabilistic, or the Bayesian techniques.\
    \ However, most of\nthe previous variations still must perform several iterations\n\
    through the data space to converge to a reasonable solution.\nThis issue becomes\
    \ a major disadvantage in several real-\ntime applications. A new approach that\
    \ is based on having\na large (but still affordable) number of cluster candidates\n\
    compared to the desired \U0001D43E clusters is currently gaining\nattention. The\
    \ idea behind this computational model is that\nthe algorithm builds a good sketch\
    \ of the original data while\nreducing the dimensionality of the input space significantly.\n\
    In this manner, a weighted \U0001D43E-Means can be applied to the\nlarge candidate\
    \ clusters to derive a good clustering of the\noriginal data. Using this idea,\
    \ [12] presented an efficient\nand scalable \U0001D43E-Means algorithm that is\
    \ based on random\nprojections. This algorithm requires only one pass through\n\
    the input data to build the clusters. More specifically, if the\ninput data distribution\
    \ holds some separability requirements,\nthen the number of required candidate\
    \ clusters grows only\naccording to \U0001D442(log \U0001D45B), where \U0001D45B\
    \ is the number of observations\nin the original data. This salient feature makes\
    \ the algorithm\nscalable in terms of both the memory and computational\nrequirements.\n\
    3.2. Probabilistic Data Association. The probabilistic data\nassociation (PDA)\
    \ algorithm was proposed by Bar-Shalom\nand Tse [13] and is also known as the\
    \ modified filter of all\nneighbors. This algorithm assigns an association probability\n\
    to each hypothesis from a valid measurement of a target.\nA valid measurement\
    \ refers to the observation that falls in\nthe validation gate of the target at\
    \ that time instant. The\nvalidation gate, \U0001D6FE, which is the center around\
    \ the predicted\nmeasurements of the target, is used to select the set of basic\n\
    measurements and is defined as\n\U0001D6FE ≥ (\U0001D44D (\U0001D458) − ̂\U0001D467\

    \ and \U0001D443\U0001D454 is the validation\nprobability of a detected value.\n\
    In the PDA algorithm, the state estimation of the target is\ncomputed as a weighted\
    \ sum of the estimated state under all\nof the hypotheses. The algorithm can associate\
    \ different mea-\nsurements to one specific target. Thus, the association of the\n\
    different measurements to a specific target helps PDA to\nestimate the target\
    \ state, and the association probabilities\nare used as weights. The main disadvantages\
    \ of the PDA\nalgorithm are the following:\n(i) loss of tracks: because PDA ignores\
    \ the interference\nwith other targets, it sometimes could wrongly clas-\nsify\
    \ the closest tracks. Therefore, it provides a poor\nperformance when the targets\
    \ are close to each other\nor crossed;\n(ii) the suboptimal Bayesian approximation:\
    \ when the\nsource of information is uncertain, PDA is the sub-\noptimal Bayesian\
    \ approximation to the association\nproblem;\n(iii) one target: PDA was initially\
    \ designed for the asso-\nciation of one target in a low-cluttered environment.\n\
    The number of false alarms is typically modeled with\nthe Poisson distribution,\
    \ and they are assumed to be\ndistributed uniformly in space. PDA behaves incor-\n\
    rectly when there are multiple targets because the false\nalarm model does not\
    \ work well;\n(iv) track management: because PDA assumes that the\ntrack is already\
    \ established, algorithms must be pro-\nvided for track initialization and track\
    \ deletion.\nPDA is mainly good for tracking targets that do not\nmake abrupt\
    \ changes in their movement patterns. PDA will\nmost likely lose the target if\
    \ it makes abrupt changes in its\nmovement patterns.\n3.3. Joint Probabilistic\
    \ Data Association. Joint probabilistic\ndata association (JPDA) is a suboptimal\
    \ approach for tracking\nmultiple targets in cluttered environments [14]. JPDA\
    \ is\nsimilar to PDA, with the difference that the association\nprobabilities\
    \ are computed using all of the observations\nand all of the targets. Thus, in\
    \ contrast to PDA, JPDA\nconsiders various hypotheses together and combines them.\n\
    JPDA determines the probability \U0001D6FD\U0001D461\n\U0001D456(\U0001D458) that\
    \ measurement \U0001D456 is\noriginated from target \U0001D461, accounting for\
    \ the fact that under\nthis hypothesis, the measurement cannot be generated by\n\
    other targets. Therefore, for a known number of targets, it\nevaluates the different\
    \ options of the measurement-target\nassociation (for the most recent set of measurements)\
    \ and\ncombines them into the corresponding state estimation. If\nthe association\
    \ probability is known, then the Kalman filter\nupdating equation of the track\
    \ \U0001D461 can be written as\n̂\U0001D465\U0001D461 (\U0001D458 | \U0001D458\
    ) = ̂\U0001D465\U0001D461 (\U0001D458 | \U0001D458 − 1) + \U0001D43E (\U0001D458\
    ) V\U0001D461 (\U0001D458) ,\n(13)\nwhere ̂\U0001D465\U0001D461(\U0001D458 | \U0001D458\
    ) and ̂\U0001D465\U0001D461(\U0001D458 | \U0001D458 − 1) are the estimation and\n\
    prediction of target \U0001D461, and \U0001D43E(\U0001D458) is the filter gain.\
    \ The weighted\nThe Scientific World Journal\n9\nsum of the residuals associated\
    \ with the observation \U0001D45A(\U0001D458) of\ntarget \U0001D461 is as follows:\n\
    V\U0001D461 (\U0001D458) =\n\U0001D45A(\U0001D458)\n∑\n\U0001D456=1\n\U0001D6FD\

    where V\U0001D461\n\U0001D456 = \U0001D467\U0001D456(\U0001D458) − \U0001D43B\U0001D465\
    \U0001D461(\U0001D458 | \U0001D458 − 1). Therefore, this method\nincorporates\
    \ all of the observations (inside the neighborhood\nof the target’s predicted\
    \ position) to update the estimated\nposition by using a posterior probability\
    \ that is a weighted\nsum of residuals.\nThe main restrictions of JPDA are the\
    \ following:\n(i) a measurement cannot come from more than one\ntarget;\n(ii)\
    \ two measurements cannot be originated by the same\ntarget (at one time instant);\n\
    (iii) the sum of all of the measurements’ probabilities that\nare assigned to\
    \ one target must be 1: ∑\U0001D45A(\U0001D458)\n\U0001D456=0 \U0001D6FD\U0001D461\
    \n\U0001D456(\U0001D458) = 1.\nThe main disadvantages of JPDA are the following:\n\
    (i) it requires an explicit mechanism for track initial-\nization. Similar to\
    \ PDA, JPDA cannot initialize new\ntracks or remove tracks that are out of the\
    \ observation\narea;\n(ii) JPDA is a computationally expensive algorithm when\n\
    it is applied in environments that have multiple targets\nbecause the number of\
    \ hypotheses is incremented\nexponentially with the number of targets.\nIn general,\
    \ JPDA is more appropriate than MHT in\nsituations in which the density of false\
    \ measurements is high\n(i.e., sonar applications).\n3.4. Multiple Hypothesis\
    \ Test. The underlying idea of the\nmultiple hypothesis test (MHT) is based on\
    \ using more than\ntwo consecutive observations to make an association with\n\
    better results. Other algorithms that use only two consecutive\nobservations have\
    \ a higher probability of generating an error.\nIn contrast to PDA and JPDA, MHT\
    \ estimates all of the\npossible hypotheses and maintains new hypotheses in each\n\
    iteration.\nMHT was developed to track multiple targets in cluttered\nenvironments;\
    \ as a result, it combines the data association\nproblem and tracking into a unified\
    \ framework, becoming\nan estimation technique as well. The Bayes rule or the\n\
    Bayesian networks are commonly employed to calculate the\nMHT hypothesis. In general,\
    \ researchers have claimed that\nMHT outperforms JPDA for the lower densities\
    \ of false\npositives. However, the main disadvantage of MHT is the\ncomputational\
    \ cost when the number of tracks or false\npositives is incremented. Pruning the\
    \ hypothesis tree using\na window could solve this limitation.\nThe Reid [15]\
    \ tracking algorithm is considered the stan-\ndard MHT algorithm, but the initial\
    \ integer programming\nformulation of the problem is due to Morefield [16]. MHT\
    \ is\nan iterative algorithm in which each iteration starts with a set\nof correspondence\
    \ hypotheses. Each hypothesis is a collec-\ntion of disjoint tracks, and the prediction\
    \ of the target in the\nnext time instant is computed for each hypothesis. Next,\
    \ the\npredictions are compared with the new observations by using\na distance\
    \ metric. The set of associations established in each\nhypothesis (based on a\
    \ distance) introduces new hypotheses\nin the next iteration. Each new hypothesis\
    \ represents a new\nset of tracks that is based on the current observations.\n\
    Note that each new measurement could come from (i) a\nnew target in the visual\
    \ field of view, (ii) a target being tracked,\nor (iii) noise in the measurement\
    \ process. It is also possible\nthat a measurement is not assigned to a target\
    \ because the\ntarget disappears, or because it is not possible to obtain a\n\
    target measurement at that time instant.\nMHT maintains several correspondence\
    \ hypotheses for\neach target in each frame. If the hypothesis in the instant\n\
    \U0001D458 is represented by \U0001D43B(\U0001D458)\n=\n[ℎ\U0001D459(\U0001D458\

    \ (ℎ\U0001D454 (\U0001D458 − 1)) ,\n(15)\nwhere ℎ\U0001D454(\U0001D458 − 1) is\
    \ the hypothesis \U0001D454 of the complete set until\nthe time instant \U0001D458\
    −1; \U0001D44E\U0001D456(\U0001D458) is the \U0001D456th possible association\
    \ of the\ntrack to the object; \U0001D44D(\U0001D458) is the set of detections\
    \ of the current\nframe, and \U0001D450 is a normal constant.\nThe first term\
    \ on the right side of the previous equation\nis the likelihood function of the\

    \ the\ncurrent hypothesis is calculated.\nThe MHT algorithm has the ability to\
    \ detect a new\ntrack while maintaining the hypothesis tree structure. The\nprobability\

    , \U0001D443∘(\U0001D706) is the a priori probability of\nthe source signal, and\
    \ \U0001D443(\U0001D44D) is the probability of obtaining the\nset of detections\
    \ \U0001D44D.\nMHT considers all of the possibilities, including both\nthe track\
    \ maintenance and the initialization and removal\nof tracks in an integrated framework.\
    \ MHT calculates the\npossibility of having an object after the generation of\
    \ a set\nof measurements using an exhaustive approach, and the\nalgorithm does\
    \ not assume a fixed number of targets. The key\nchallenge of MHT is the effective\
    \ hypothesis management.\nThe baseline MHT algorithm can be extended as follows:\n\
    (i) use the hypothesis aggregation for missed targets births,\n10\nThe Scientific\
    \ World Journal\ncardinality tracking, and closely spaced objects; (ii) apply\n\
    a multistage MHT for improving the performance and\nrobustness in challenging\
    \ settings; and (iii) use a feature-\naided MHT for extended object surveillance.\n\
    The main disadvantage of this algorithm is the compu-\ntational cost, which grows\
    \ exponentially with the number of\ntracks and measurements. Therefore, the practical\
    \ implemen-\ntation of this algorithm is limited because it is exponential in\n\
    both time and memory.\nWith the aim of reducing the computational cost, [17]\n\
    presented a probabilistic MHT algorithm in which the\nassociations are considered\
    \ to be random variables that\nare statistically independent and in which performing\
    \ an\nexhaustive search enumeration is avoided. This algorithm is\nknown as PMHT.\
    \ The PMHT algorithm assumes that the\nnumber of targets and measurements is known.\
    \ With the\nsame goal of reducing the computational cost, [18] presented\nan efficient\
    \ implementation of the MHT algorithm. This\nimplementation was the first version\
    \ to be applied to perform\ntracking in visual environments. They employed the\
    \ Murty\n[19] algorithm to determine the best set of \U0001D458 hypotheses\nin\
    \ polynomial time, with the goal of tracking the points of\ninterest.\nMHT typically\
    \ performs the tracking process by employ-\ning only one characteristic, commonly\
    \ the position. The\nBayesian combination to use multiple characteristics was\n\
    proposed by Liggins II et al. [20].\nA linear-programming-based relaxation approach\
    \ to the\noptimization problem in MHT tracking was proposed inde-\npendently by\
    \ Coraluppi et al. [21] and Storms and Spieksma\n[22]. Joo and Chellappa [23]\
    \ proposed an association algo-\nrithm for tracking multiple targets in visual\
    \ environments.\nTheir algorithm is based on in MHT modification in which\na measurement\
    \ can be associated with more than one target,\nand several targets can be associated\
    \ with one measurement.\nThey also proposed a combinatorial optimization algorithm\n\
    to generate the best set of association hypotheses. Their\nalgorithm always finds\
    \ the best hypothesis, in contrast to\nother models, which are approximate. Coraluppi\
    \ and Carthel\n[24] presented a generalization of the MHT algorithm using\na recursion\
    \ over hypothesis classes rather than over a single\nhypothesis. This work has\
    \ been applied in a special case of\nthe multi-target tracking problem, called\
    \ cardinality tracking,\nin which they observed the number of sensor measurements\n\
    instead of the target states.\n3.5. Distributed Joint Probabilistic Data Association.\
    \ The dis-\ntributed version of the joint probabilistic data association\n(JPDA-D)\

    individual hypothesis and reflects the localization influence\nof the current\
    \ measurements in the joint hypotheses.\nThese equations are obtained assuming\
    \ that commu-\nnication exists after every observation, and there are only\napproximations\
    \ in the case in which communication is\nsporadic and when a substantial amount\

    \ some\nlimitations in practical applications.\n3.6. Distributed Multiple Hypothesis\

    \ \U0001D44D\U0001D456, \U0001D70F\U0001D456\n\U0001D457); then, the\nmaximum\
    \ available information in the fusion node is \U0001D44D =\n\U0001D44D1 ∪ \U0001D44D\
    2. The data fusion objective of the MHT-D is to\nobtain the set of hypotheses\

    ) is the\nlikelihood of each hypothesis pair.\nThe main disadvantage of the MHT-D\
    \ is the high com-\nputational cost that is in the order of \U0001D442(\U0001D45B\
    \U0001D440), where \U0001D45B is the\nnumber of possible associations and \U0001D440\
    \ is the number of\nvariables to be estimated.\n3.7. Graphical Models. Graphical\
    \ models are a formalism for\nrepresenting and reasoning with probabilities and\
    \ indepen-\ndence. A graphical model represents a conditional decom-\nposition\
    \ of the joint probability. A graphical model can be\nrepresented as a graph in\
    \ which the nodes denote random\nvariables; the edges denote the possible dependence\
    \ between\nthe random variables, and the plates denote the replication of\na substructure,\
    \ with the appropriate indexing of the relevant\nvariables. The graph captures\
    \ the joint distribution over the\nrandom variables, which can be decomposed into\
    \ a product\nof factors that each depend on only a subset of variables. There\n\
    are two major classes of graphical models: (i) the Bayesian\nnetworks [28], which\
    \ are also known as the directed graphical\nmodels, and (ii) the Markov random\
    \ fields, which are also\nknown as undirected graphical models. The directed graph-\n\
    ical models are useful for expressing causal relationships\nbetween random variables,\
    \ whereas undirected models are\nbetter suited for expressing soft constraints\
    \ between random\nvariables. We refer the reader to the book of Koller and\nFriedman\
    \ [29] for more information on graphical models.\nA framework based on graphical\
    \ models can solve the\nproblem of distributed data association in synchronized\n\
    sensor networks with overlapped areas and where each sensor\nreceives noisy measurements;\
    \ this solution was proposed\nby Chen et al. [30, 31]. Their work is based on\
    \ graphical\nmodels that are used to represent the statistical dependence\nbetween\
    \ random variables. The data association problem is\ntreated as an inference problem\
    \ and solved by using the\nmax-product algorithm [32]. Graphical models represent\n\
    statistical dependencies between variables as graphs, and\nthe max-product algorithm\
    \ converges when the graph is\na tree structure. Moreover, the employed algorithm\
    \ could\nbe implemented in a distributed manner by exchanging\nmessages between\
    \ the source nodes in parallel. With this\nalgorithm, if each sensor has \U0001D45B\
    \ possible combinations of\nassociations and there are \U0001D440 variables to\
    \ be estimated, it has\na complexity of \U0001D442(\U0001D45B2\U0001D440), which\
    \ is reasonable and less than\nthe \U0001D442(\U0001D45B\U0001D440) complexity\
    \ of the MHT-D algorithm. However,\naspecial attention must be given to the correlated\
    \ variables\nwhen building the graphical model.\n4. State Estimation Methods\n\
    State estimation techniques aim to determine the state of\nthe target under movement\
    \ (typically the position) given\nthe observation or measurements. State estimation\
    \ tech-\nniques are also known as tracking techniques. In their general\nform,\
    \ it is not guaranteed that the target observations are\nrelevant, which means\
    \ that some of the observations could\nactually come from the target and others\
    \ could be only noise.\nThe state estimation phase is a common stage in data fusion\n\
    algorithms because the target’s observation could come from\ndifferent sensors\
    \ or sources, and the final goal is to obtain a\nglobal target state from the\
    \ observations.\nThe estimation problem involves finding the values of the\nvector\
    \ state (e.g., position, velocity, and size) that fits as much\nas possible with\
    \ the observed data. From a mathematical\nperspective, we have a set of redundant\
    \ observations, and\nthe goal is to find the set of parameters that provides the\n\
    best fit to the observed data. In general, these observations\nare corrupted by\
    \ errors and the propagation of noise in the\nmeasurement process. State estimation\
    \ methods fall under\nlevel 1 of the JDL classification and could be divided into\
    \ two\nbroader groups:\n(1) linear dynamics and measurements: here, the esti-\n\
    mation problem has a standard solution. Specifically,\nwhen the equations of the\
    \ object state and the mea-\nsurements are linear, the noise follows the Gaussian\n\
    distribution, and we do not refer to it as a clutter\nenvironment; in this case,\
    \ the optimal theoretical\nsolution is based on the Kalman filter;\n(2) nonlinear\
    \ dynamics: the state estimation problem\nbecomes difficult, and there is not\
    \ an analytical solu-\ntion to solve the problem in a general manner. In prin-\n\
    ciple, there are no practical algorithms available to\nsolve this problem satisfactorily.\n\
    Most of the state estimation methods are based on control\ntheory and employ the\
    \ laws of probability to compute a\nvector state from a vector measurement or\
    \ a stream of vector\nmeasurements. Next, the most common estimation methods\n\
    are presented, including maximum likelihood and maxi-\nmum posterior (Section\
    \ 4.1), the Kalman filter (Section 4.2),\nparticle filter (Section 4.3), the distributed\
    \ Kalman filter\n(Section 4.4), distributed particle filter (Section 4.5) and,\n\
    covariance consistency methods (Section 4.6).\n4.1. Maximum Likelihood and Maximum\
    \ Posterior. The max-\nimum likelihood (ML) technique is an estimation method\n\
    that is based on probabilistic theory. Probabilistic estimation\nmethods are appropriate\
    \ when the state variable follows an\nunknown probability distribution [33]. In\
    \ the context of\ndata fusion, \U0001D465 is the state that is being estimated,\
    \ and \U0001D467 =\n(\U0001D467(1), . . . , \U0001D467(\U0001D458)) is a sequence\
    \ of \U0001D458 previous observations of\n\U0001D465. The likelihood function\
    \ \U0001D706(\U0001D465) is defined as a probability\ndensity function of the\
    \ sequence of \U0001D467 observations given the\ntrue value of the state \U0001D465\
    . Consider\n\U0001D706 (\U0001D465) = \U0001D45D (\U0001D467 | \U0001D465) .\n\
    (20)\nThe ML estimator finds the value of \U0001D465 that maximizes the\nlikelihood\
    \ function:\n̂\U0001D465 (\U0001D458) = arg max\n\U0001D465\n\U0001D45D (\U0001D467\
    \ | \U0001D465) ,\n(21)\n12\nThe Scientific World Journal\nwhich can be obtained\
    \ from the analytical or empirical\nmodels of the sensors. This function expresses\
    \ the probability\nof the observed data. The main disadvantage of this method\n\
    in practice is that it requires the analytical or empirical model\nof the sensor\
    \ to be known to provide the prior distribution\nand compute the likelihood function.\
    \ This method can also\nsystematically underestimate the variance of the distribution,\n\
    which leads to a bias problem. However, the bias of the ML\nsolution becomes less\
    \ significant as the number \U0001D441 of data\npoints increases and is equal\
    \ to the true variance of the\ndistribution that generated the data at the limit\
    \ \U0001D441 → ∞.\nThe maximum posterior (MAP) method is based on the\nBayesian\
    \ theory. It is employed when the parameter \U0001D465 to\nbe estimated is the\
    \ output of a random variable that has a\nknown probability density function \U0001D45D\
    (\U0001D465). In the context of\ndata fusion, \U0001D465 is the state that is\
    \ being estimated and \U0001D467 =\n(\U0001D467(1), . . . , \U0001D467(\U0001D458\
    )) is a sequence of \U0001D458 previous observations of \U0001D465.\nThe MAP estimator\
    \ finds the value of \U0001D465 that maximizes the\nposterior probability distribution\
    \ as follows:\n̂\U0001D465 (\U0001D458) = arg max\n\U0001D465\n\U0001D45D (\U0001D465\
    \ | \U0001D467) .\n(22)\nBoth methods (ML and MAP) aim to find the most likely\n\
    value for the state \U0001D465. However, ML assumes that \U0001D465 is a fixed\n\
    but an unknown point from the parameter space, whereas\nMAP considers \U0001D465\
    \ to be the output of a random variable with\na known a priori probability density\
    \ function. Both of these\nmethods are equivalent when there is no a priori information\n\
    about \U0001D465, that is, when there are only observations.\n4.2. The Kalman\
    \ Filter. The Kalman filter is the most popular\nestimation technique. It was\
    \ originally proposed by Kalman\n[34] and has been widely studied and applied\
    \ since then. The\nKalman filter estimates the state \U0001D465 of a discrete\
    \ time process\ngoverned by the following space-time model:\n\U0001D465 (\U0001D458\
    \ + 1) = Φ (\U0001D458) \U0001D465 (\U0001D458) + \U0001D43A (\U0001D458) \U0001D462\
    \ (\U0001D458) + \U0001D464 (\U0001D458)\n(23)\nwith the observations or measurements\
    \ \U0001D467 at time \U0001D458 of the state\n\U0001D465 represented by\n\U0001D467\
    \ (\U0001D458) = \U0001D43B (\U0001D458) \U0001D465 (\U0001D458) + V (\U0001D458\
    ) ,\n(24)\nwhere Φ(\U0001D458) is the state transition matrix, \U0001D43A(\U0001D458\
    ) is the input\nmatrix transition, \U0001D462(\U0001D458) is the input vector,\
    \ \U0001D43B(\U0001D458) is the\nmeasurement matrix, and \U0001D464 and V are\
    \ the random Gaussian\nvariables with zero mean and covariance matrices of \U0001D444\
    (\U0001D458)\nand \U0001D445(\U0001D458), respectively. Based on the measurements\
    \ and on\nthe system parameters, the estimation of \U0001D465(\U0001D458), which\
    \ is\nrepresented by ̂\U0001D465(\U0001D458), and the prediction of \U0001D465\
    (\U0001D458 + 1), which\nis represented by ̂\U0001D465(\U0001D458 + 1 | \U0001D458\
    ), are given by the following:\n̂\U0001D465 (\U0001D458) = ̂\U0001D465 (\U0001D458\
    \ | \U0001D458 + 1) + \U0001D43E (\U0001D458) [\U0001D467 (\U0001D458) − \U0001D43B\

    \ (\U0001D458 + 1 | \U0001D458) = Φ (\U0001D458) \U0001D443 (\U0001D458) Φ\U0001D447\
    \ (\U0001D458) + \U0001D444 (\U0001D458)\n(27)\nwith\n\U0001D443 (\U0001D458)\

    \ (\U0001D458) \U0001D443 (\U0001D458 | \U0001D458 − 1) .\n(28)\nThe Kalman filter\
    \ is mainly employed to fuse low-level\ndata. If the system could be described\
    \ as a linear model and\nthe error could be modeled as the Gaussian noise, then\
    \ the\nrecursive Kalman filter obtains optimal statistical estimations\n[35].\
    \ However, other methods are required to address nonlin-\near dynamic models and\
    \ nonlinear measurements. The modi-\nfied Kalman filter known as the extended\
    \ Kalman filter (EKF)\nis an optimal approach for implementing nonlinear recursive\n\
    filters [36]. The EKF is one of the most often employed\nmethods for fusing data\
    \ in robotic applications. However,\nit has some disadvantages because the computations\
    \ of the\nJacobians are extremely expensive. Some attempts have been\nmade to\
    \ reduce the computational cost, such as linearization,\nbut these attempts introduce\
    \ errors in the filter and make it\nunstable.\nThe unscented Kalman filter (UKF)\
    \ [37] has gained\npopularity, because it does not have the linearization step\
    \ and\nthe associated errors of the EKF [38]. The UKF employs a\ndeterministic\
    \ sampling strategy to establish the minimum set\nof points around the mean. This\
    \ set of points captures the\ntrue mean and covariance completely. Then, these\
    \ points are\npropagated through nonlinear functions, and the covariance\nof the\
    \ estimations can be recuperated. Another advantage of\nthe UKF is its ability\
    \ to be employed in parallel implementa-\ntions.\n4.3. Particle Filter. Particle\
    \ filters are recursive implemen-\ntations of the sequential Monte Carlo methods\
    \ [39]. This\nmethod builds the posterior density function using several\nrandom\
    \ samples called particles. Particles are propagated\nover time with a combination\
    \ of sampling and resampling\nsteps. At each iteration, the sampling step is employed\
    \ to\ndiscard some particles, increasing the relevance of regions\nwith a higher\
    \ posterior probability. In the filtering process,\nseveral particles of the same\
    \ state variable are employed,\nand each particle has an associated weight that\
    \ indicates\nthe quality of the particle. Therefore, the estimation is the\nresult\
    \ of a weighted sum of all of the particles. The standard\nparticle filter algorithm\
    \ has two phases: (1) the predicting\nphase and (2) the updating phase. In the\
    \ predicting phase,\neach particle is modified according to the existing model\n\
    and accounts for the sum of the random noise to simulate\nthe noise effect. Then,\
    \ in the updating phase, the weight of\neach particle is reevaluated using the\
    \ last available sensor\nobservation, and particles with lower weights are removed.\n\
    Specifically, a generic particle filter comprises the following\nsteps.\nThe Scientific\

    Particle filters are more flexible than the Kalman filters\nand can cope with\
    \ nonlinear dependencies and non-Gaussian\ndensities in the dynamic model and\
    \ in the noise error.\nHowever, they have some disadvantages. A large number\n\
    of particles are required to obtain a small variance in the\nestimator. It is\
    \ also difficult to establish the optimal number of\nparticles in advance, and\
    \ the number of particles affects the\ncomputational cost significantly. Earlier\
    \ versions of particle\nfilters employed a fixed number of particles, but recent\
    \ studies\nhave started to use a dynamic number of particles [40].\n4.4. The Distributed\
    \ Kalman Filter. The distributed Kalman\nfilter requires a correct clock synchronization\
    \ between each\nsource, as demonstrated in [41]. In other words, to correctly\n\
    use the distributed Kalman filter, the clocks from all of\nthe sources must be\
    \ synchronized. This synchronization is\ntypically achieved through using protocols\
    \ that employ a\nshared global clock, such as the network time protocol (NTP).\n\
    Synchronization problems between clocks have been shown\nto have an effect on\
    \ the accuracy of the Kalman filter,\nproducing inaccurate estimations [42].\n\
    If the estimations are consistent and the cross covariance\nis known (or the estimations\
    \ are uncorrelated), then it is\npossible to use the distributed Kalman filters\
    \ [43]. However,\nthe cross covariance must be determined exactly, or the\nobservations\
    \ must be consistent.\nWe refer the reader to Liggins II et al. [20] for more\
    \ details\nabout the Kalman filter in a distributed and hierarchical\narchitecture.\n\
    4.5. Distributed Particle Filter. Distributed particle filters\nhave gained attention\
    \ recently [44–46]. Coates [45] used a\ndistributed particle filter to monitor\
    \ an environment that\ncould be captured by the Markovian state-space model,\n\
    involving nonlinear dynamics and observations and non-\nGaussian noise.\nIn contrast,\
    \ earlier attempts to solve out-of-sequence\nmeasurements using particle filters\
    \ are based on regenerating\nthe probability density function to the time instant\
    \ of the\nout-of-sequence measurement [47]. In a particle filter, this\nstep requires\
    \ a large computational cost, in addition to the\nnecessary space to store the\
    \ previous particles. To avoid\nthis problem, Orton and Marrs [48] proposed to\
    \ store the\ninformation on the particles at each time instant, saving the\ncost\
    \ of recalculating this information. This technique is close\n14\nThe Scientific\
    \ World Journal\nto optimal, and when the delay increases, the result is only\n\
    slightly affected [49]. However, it requires a very large amount\nof space to\
    \ store the state of the particles at each time instant.\n4.6. Covariance Consistency\
    \ Methods: Covariance Intersec-\ntion/Union. Covariance consistency methods (intersection\n\
    and union) were proposed by Uhlmann [43] and are general\nand fault-tolerant frameworks\
    \ for maintaining covariance\nmeans and estimations in a distributed network.\
    \ These meth-\nods do not comprise estimation techniques; instead, they are\n\
    similar to an estimation fusion technique. The distributed\nKalman filter requirement\
    \ of independent measurements or\nknown cross-covariances is not a constraint\
    \ with this method.\n4.6.1. Covariance Intersection. If the Kalman filter is employ-\n\
    ed to combine two estimations, (\U0001D44E1, \U0001D4341) and (\U0001D44E2, \U0001D434\
    2), then it\nis assumed that the joint covariance is in the following form:\n\
    [\n[\n\U0001D4341\n\U0001D44B\n\U0001D44B\U0001D447 \U0001D4342\n]\n]\n,\n(36)\n\
    where the cross-covariance \U0001D44B should be known exactly so\nthat the Kalman\
    \ filter can be applied without difficulty.\nBecause the computation of the cross-covariances\
    \ is compu-\ntationally intensive, Uhlmann [43] proposed the covariance\nintersection\
    \ (CI) algorithm.\nLet us assume that a joint covariance \U0001D440 can be defined\n\
    with the diagonal blocks \U0001D440\U0001D4341 > \U0001D4341 and \U0001D440\U0001D434\
    2 > \U0001D4342. Consider\n\U0001D440 ⩾ [\n[\n\U0001D4341\n\U0001D44B\n\U0001D44B\
    \U0001D447 \U0001D4342\n]\n]\n(37)\nfor every possible instance of the unknown\
    \ cross-covariance\n\U0001D44B; then, the components of the matrix \U0001D440\
    \ could be employed\nin the Kalman filter equations to provide a fused estimation\n\
    (\U0001D450, \U0001D436) that is considered consistent. The key point of this\n\
    method relies on generating a joint covariance matrix \U0001D440 that\ncan represent\
    \ a useful fused estimation (in this context, useful\nrefers to something with\
    \ a lower associated uncertainty). In\nsummary, the CI algorithm computes the\
    \ joint covariance\nmatrix \U0001D440, where the Kalman filter provides the best\
    \ fused\nestimation (\U0001D450, \U0001D436) with respect to a fixed measurement\
    \ of the\ncovariance matrix (i.e., the minimum determinant).\nSpecific covariance\
    \ criteria must be established because\nthere is not a specific minimum joint\
    \ covariance in the\norder of the positive semidefinite matrices. Moreover, the\n\
    joint covariance is the basis of the formal analysis of the\nCI algorithm; the\
    \ actual result is a nonlinear mixture of the\ninformation stored on the estimations\
    \ being fused, following\nthe following equation.\n\U0001D436 = (\U0001D4641\U0001D43B\

    \U0001D45B)\n−1,\n(38)\nwhere \U0001D43B\U0001D456 is the transformation of the\
    \ fused state-space\nestimation to the space of the estimated state \U0001D456\
    . The values\nof \U0001D464 can be calculated to minimize the covariance determi-\n\
    nant using convex optimization packages and semipositive\nmatrix programming.\
    \ The result of the CI algorithm has\ndifferent characteristics compared to the\
    \ Kalman filter. For\nexample, if two estimations are provided (\U0001D44E, \U0001D434\
    ) and (\U0001D44F, \U0001D435)\nand their covariances are equal \U0001D434 = \U0001D435\
    , since the Kalman\nfilter is based on the statistical independence assumption,\
    \ it\nproduces a fused estimation with covariance \U0001D436 = (1/2)\U0001D434\
    .\nIn contrast, the CI method does not assume independence\nand, thus, must be\
    \ consistent even in the case in which\nthe estimations are completely correlated,\
    \ with the estimated\nfused covariance \U0001D436 = \U0001D434. In the case of\
    \ estimations where\n\U0001D434 < \U0001D435, the CI algorithm does not provide\
    \ information about\nthe estimation (\U0001D44F, \U0001D435); thus, the fused\
    \ result is (\U0001D44E, \U0001D434).\nEvery joint-consistent covariance is sufficient\
    \ to produce\na fused estimation, which guarantees consistency. However,\nit is\
    \ also necessary to guarantee a lack of divergence. Diver-\ngence is avoided in\
    \ the CI algorithm by choosing a specific\nmeasurement (i.e., the determinant),\
    \ which is minimized in\neach fusion operation. This measurement represents a\
    \ non-\ndivergence criterion, because the size of the estimated covari-\nance\
    \ according to this criterion would not be incremented.\nThe application of the\
    \ CI method guarantees consis-\ntency and nondivergence for every sequence of\
    \ mean and\ncovariance-consistent estimations. However, this method\ndoes not\
    \ work well when the measurements to be fused are\ninconsistent.\n4.6.2. Covariance\
    \ Union. CI solves the problem of correlated\ninputs but not the problem of inconsistent\
    \ inputs (inconsistent\ninputs refer to different estimations, each of which has\
    \ a\nhigh accuracy (small variance) but also a large difference\nfrom the states\
    \ of the others); thus, the covariance union\n(CU) algorithm was proposed to solve\
    \ the latter [43]. CU\naddresses the following problem: two estimations (\U0001D44E\
    1, \U0001D4341)\nand (\U0001D44E2, \U0001D4342) relate to the state of an object\
    \ and are mutually\ninconsistent from one another. This issue arises when the\n\
    difference between the average estimations is larger than\nthe provided covariance.\
    \ Inconsistent inputs can be detected\nusing the Mahalanobis distance [50] between\
    \ them, which is\ndefined as\n\U0001D440\U0001D451 = (\U0001D44E1 − \U0001D44E\
    2)\U0001D447(\U0001D4341 + \U0001D4342)−1 (\U0001D44E1 − \U0001D44E2) ,\n(39)\n\
    and detecting whether this distance is larger than a given\nthreshold.\nThe Mahalanobis\
    \ distance accounts for the covariance\ninformation to obtain the distance. If\
    \ the difference between\nthe estimations is high but their covariance is also\
    \ high,\nthe Mahalanobis distance yields a small value. In contrast,\nif the difference\
    \ between the estimations is small and the\ncovariances are small, it could produce\
    \ a larger distance\nvalue. A high Mahalanobis distance could indicate that the\n\
    estimations are inconsistent; however, it is necessary to\nhave a specific threshold\
    \ established by the user or learned\nautomatically.\nThe CU algorithm aims to\
    \ solve the following prob-\nlem: let us suppose that a filtering algorithm provides\
    \ two\nobservations with mean and covariance (\U0001D44E1, \U0001D4341) and (\U0001D44E\
    2, \U0001D4342),\nThe Scientific World Journal\n15\nrespectively. It is known\
    \ that one of the observations is correct\nand the other is erroneous. However,\
    \ the identity of the\ncorrect estimation is unknown and cannot be determined.\n\
    In this situation, if both estimations are employed as an\ninput to the Kalman\
    \ filter, there will be a problem, because\nthe Kalman filter only guarantees\
    \ a consistent output if the\nobservation is updated with a measurement consistent\
    \ with\nboth of them. In the specific case, in which the measurements\ncorrespond\
    \ to the same object but are acquired from two\ndifferent sensors, the Kalman\
    \ filter can only guarantee that\nthe output is consistent if it is consistent\
    \ with both separately.\nBecause it is not possible to know which estimation is\
    \ correct,\nthe only way to combine the two estimations rigorously is\nto provide\
    \ an estimation (\U0001D462, \U0001D448) that is consistent with both\nestimations\
    \ and to obey the following properties:\n\U0001D448 ⪖ \U0001D4341 + (\U0001D462\
    \ − \U0001D44E1) (\U0001D462 − \U0001D4341)\n\U0001D447,\n\U0001D448 ⪖ \U0001D434\
    2 + (\U0001D462 − \U0001D44E2) (\U0001D462 − \U0001D4342)\U0001D447,\n(40)\nwhere\
    \ some measurement of the matrix size \U0001D448 (i.e., the deter-\nminant) is\
    \ minimized.\nIn other words, the previous equations indicate that if the\nestimation\
    \ (\U0001D44E1, \U0001D4341) is consistent, then the translation of the\nvector\
    \ \U0001D44E1 to \U0001D462 requires to increase the covariance by the sum\nof\
    \ a matrix at least as big as the product of (\U0001D462 − \U0001D44E1) in order\
    \ to\nbe consistent. The same situation applies to the measurement\n(\U0001D44E\
    2, \U0001D4342) in order to be consistent.\nA simple strategy is to choose the\
    \ mean of the estimation\nas the input value of one of the measurements (\U0001D462\
    \ = \U0001D44E1). In this\ncase, the value of \U0001D448 must be chosen, such\
    \ that the estimation\nis consistent with the worst case (the correct measurement\
    \ is\n\U0001D44E2). However, it is possible to assign \U0001D462 an intermediate\
    \ value\nbetween \U0001D44E1 and \U0001D44E2 to decrease the value of \U0001D448\
    . Therefore, the\nCU algorithm establishes the mean fused value \U0001D462 that\
    \ has\nthe least covariance \U0001D448 but is sufficiently large for the two\n\
    measurements (\U0001D44E1 and \U0001D44E2) for consistency.\nBecause the matrix\
    \ inequalities presented in previous\nequations are convex, convex optimization\
    \ algorithms must\nbe employed to solve them. The value of \U0001D448 can be computed\n\
    with the iterative method described by Julier et al. [51].\nThe obtained covariance\
    \ could be significantly larger than\nany of the initial covariances and is an\
    \ indicator of the\nexisting uncertainty between the initial estimations. One\
    \ of\nthe advantages of the CU method arises from the fact that\nthe same process\
    \ could be easily extended to \U0001D441 inputs.\n5. Decision Fusion Methods\n\
    A decision is typically taken based on the knowledge of the\nperceived situation,\
    \ which is provided by many sources in\nthe data fusion domain. These techniques\
    \ aim to make a\nhigh-level inference about the events and activities that are\n\
    produced from the detected targets. These techniques often\nuse symbolic information,\
    \ and the fusion process requires to\nreason while accounting for the uncertainties\
    \ and constraints.\nThese methods fall under level 2 (situation assessment) and\n\
    level 4 (impact assessment) of the JDL data fusion model.\n5.1. The Bayesian Methods.\
    \ Information fusion based on the\nBayesian inference provides a formalism for\
    \ combining evi-\ndence according to the probability theory rules. Uncertainty\n\
    is represented using the conditional probability terms that\ndescribe beliefs\
    \ and take on values in the interval [0, 1], where\nzero indicates a complete\
    \ lack of belief and one indicates an\nabsolute belief. The Bayesian inference\
    \ is based on the Bayes\nrule as follows:\n\U0001D443 (\U0001D44C | \U0001D44B\
    ) = \U0001D443 (\U0001D44B | \U0001D44C) \U0001D443 (\U0001D44C)\n\U0001D443 (\U0001D44B\
    )\n,\n(41)\nwhere the posterior probability, \U0001D443(\U0001D44C | \U0001D44B\
    ), represents the\nbelief in the hypothesis \U0001D44C given the information \U0001D44B\
    . This\nprobability is obtained by multiplying the a priori probability\nof the\
    \ hypothesis \U0001D443(\U0001D44C) by the probability of having \U0001D44B given\n\
    that \U0001D44C is true, \U0001D443(\U0001D44B\n|\n\U0001D44C). The value \U0001D443\
    (\U0001D44B) is used as a\nnormalizing constant. The main disadvantage of the\
    \ Bayesian\ninference is that the probabilities \U0001D443(\U0001D44B) and \U0001D443\
    (\U0001D44B | \U0001D44C) must\nbe known. To estimate the conditional probabilities,\
    \ Pan\net al. [52] proposed the use of NNs, whereas Cou´e et al. [53]\nproposed\
    \ the Bayesian programming.\nHall and Llinas [54] described the following problems\n\
    associated with Bayesian inference.\n(i) Difficulty in establishing the value\
    \ of a priori proba-\nbilities.\n(ii) Complexity when there are multiple potential\
    \ hypo-\ntheses and a substantial number of events that depend\non the conditions.\n\
    (iii) The hypothesis should be mutually exclusive.\n(iv) Difficulty in describing\
    \ the uncertainty of the deci-\nsions.\n5.2. The Dempster-Shafer Inference. The\
    \ Dempster-Shafer\ninference is based on the mathematical theory introduced\n\
    by Dempster [55] and Shafer [56], which generalizes the\nBayesian theory. The\
    \ Dempster-Shafer theory provides a\nformalism that could be used to represent\
    \ incomplete knowl-\nedge, updating beliefs, and a combination of evidence and\n\
    allows us to represent the uncertainty explicitly [57].\nA fundamental concept\
    \ in the Dempster-Shafer reason-\ning is the frame of discernment, which is defined\
    \ as follows.\nLet Θ\n=\n{\U0001D7031, \U0001D7032, . . . , \U0001D703\U0001D441\
    } be the set of all possible states\nthat define the system, and let Θ be exhaustive\
    \ and mutually\nexclusive due to the system being only in one state \U0001D703\
    \U0001D456 ∈ Θ,\nwhere 1 ⪕ \U0001D456 ⪕ \U0001D441. The set Θ is called a frame\
    \ of discernment,\nbecause its elements are employed to discern the current state\n\
    of the system.\nThe elements of the set 2Θ are called hypotheses. In\nthe Dempster-Shafer\
    \ theory, based on the evidence \U0001D438, a\nprobability is assigned to each\
    \ hypothesis \U0001D43B ∈ 2Θ according\nto the basic assignment of probabilities\
    \ or the mass function\n\U0001D45A : 2Θ → [0.1], which satisfies\n\U0001D45A (0)\
    \ = 0.\n(42)\n16\nThe Scientific World Journal\nThus, the mass function of the\
    \ empty set is zero. Furthermore,\nthe mass function of a hypothesis is larger\
    \ than or equal to\nzero for all of the hypotheses. Consider\n\U0001D45A (\U0001D43B\
    ) ≥ 0,\n∀\U0001D43B ∈ 2Θ.\n(43)\nThe sum of the mass function of all the hypotheses\
    \ is one.\nConsider\n∑\n\U0001D43B∈2Θ\n\U0001D45A (\U0001D43B) = 1.\n(44)\nTo\
    \ express incomplete beliefs in a hypothesis \U0001D43B, the Demp-\nster-Shafer\
    \ theory defines the belief function bel : 2Θ\n→\n[0, 1] over Θ as\nbel (\U0001D43B\
    ) = ∑\n\U0001D434⊆\U0001D43B\n\U0001D45A (\U0001D434) ,\n(45)\nwhere bel(0) =\
    \ 0, and bel(Θ) = 1. The doubt level in \U0001D43B can be\nexpressed in terms\
    \ of the belief function by\ndou (\U0001D43B) = bel (¬\U0001D43B) = ∑\n\U0001D434\
    ⊆¬\U0001D43B\n\U0001D45A (\U0001D434) .\n(46)\nTo express the plausibility of\
    \ each hypothesis, the function\npl : 2Θ → [0, 1] over Θ is defined as\npl (\U0001D43B\
    ) = 1 − dou (\U0001D43B) =\n∑\n\U0001D434∩\U0001D43B=0\n\U0001D45A (\U0001D434\
    ) .\n(47)\nIntuitive plausibility indicates that there is less uncer-\ntainty\
    \ in hypothesis \U0001D43B if it is more plausible. The confidence\ninterval [bel(\U0001D43B\
    ), pl(\U0001D43B)] defines the true belief in hypothesis\n\U0001D43B. To combine\
    \ the effects of the two mass functions \U0001D45A1 and\n\U0001D45A2, the Dempster-Shafer\
    \ theory defines a rule \U0001D45A1 ⊕ \U0001D45A2 as\n\U0001D45A1 ⊕ \U0001D45A\
    2 (0) = 0,\n\U0001D45A1 ⊕ \U0001D45A2 (\U0001D43B) =\n∑\U0001D44B∩\U0001D44C=\U0001D43B\
    \ \U0001D45A1 (\U0001D44B) \U0001D45A2 (\U0001D44C)\n1 − ∑\U0001D44B∩\U0001D44C\
    =0 \U0001D45A1 (\U0001D44B) \U0001D45A2 (\U0001D44C).\n(48)\nIn contrast to the\
    \ Bayesian inference, a priori probabilities\nare not required in the Dempster-Shafer\
    \ inference, because\nthey are assigned at the instant that the information is\
    \ pro-\nvided. Several studies in the literature have compared the use\nof the\
    \ Bayesian inference and the Dempster-Shafer inference,\nsuch as [58–60]. Wu et\
    \ al. [61] used the Dempster-Shafer\ntheory to fuse information in context-aware\
    \ environments.\nThis work was extended in [62] to dynamically modify the\nassociated\
    \ weights to the sensor measurements. Therefore,\nthe fusion mechanism is calibrated\
    \ according to the recent\nmeasurements of the sensors (in cases in which the\
    \ ground-\ntruth is available). In the military domain [63], the Dempster-\nShafer\
    \ reasoning is used with the a priori information stored\nin a database for classifying\
    \ military ships. Morbee et al. [64]\ndescribed the use of the Dempster-Shafer\
    \ theory to build 2D\noccupancy maps from several cameras and to evaluate the\n\
    contribution of subsets of cameras to a specific task. Each task\nis the observation\
    \ of an event of interest, and the goal is to\nassess the validity of a set of\
    \ hypotheses that are fused using\nthe Dempster-Shafer theory.\n5.3. Abductive\
    \ Reasoning. Abductive reasoning, or inferring\nthe best explanation, is a reasoning\
    \ method in which a\nhypothesis is chosen under the assumption that in case it\n\
    is true, it explains the observed event most accurately [65].\nIn other words,\
    \ when an event is observed, the abduction\nmethod attempts to find the best explanation.\n\
    In the context of probabilistic reasoning, abductive infer-\nence finds the posterior\
    \ ML of the system variables given\nsome observed variables. Abductive reasoning\
    \ is more a\nreasoning pattern than a data fusion technique. Therefore,\ndifferent\
    \ inference methods, such as NNs [66] or fuzzy logic\n[67], can be employed.\n\
    5.4. Semantic Methods. Decision fusion techniques that\nemploy semantic data from\
    \ different sources as an input could\nprovide more accurate results than those\
    \ that rely on only\nsingle sources. There is a growing interest in techniques\
    \ that\nautomatically determine the presence of semantic features in\nvideos to\
    \ solve the semantic gap [68].\nSemantic information fusion is essentially a scheme\
    \ in\nwhich raw sensor data are processed such that the nodes\nexchange only the\
    \ resultant semantic information. Semantic\ninformation fusion typically covers\
    \ two phases: (i) build-\ning the knowledge and (ii) pattern matching (inference).\n\
    The first phase (typically offline) incorporates the most\nappropriate knowledge\
    \ into semantic information. Then, the\nsecond phase (typically online or in real-time)\
    \ fuses relevant\nattributes and provides a semantic interpretation of the\nsensor\
    \ data [69–71].\nSemantic fusion could be viewed as an idea for integrating\n\
    and translating sensor data into formal languages. Therefore,\nthe obtained resulting\
    \ language from the observations of\nthe environment is compared with similar\
    \ languages that\nare stored in the database. The key of this strategy is that\n\
    similar behaviors represented by formal languages are also\nsemantically similar.\
    \ This type of method provides savings\nin the cost of transmission, because the\
    \ nodes need only\ntransmit the formal language structure instead of the raw\n\
    data. However, a known set of behaviors must be stored\nin a database in advance,\
    \ which might be difficult in some\nscenarios.\n6. Conclusions\nThis paper reviews\
    \ the most popular methods and tech-\nniques for performing data/information fusion.\
    \ To determine\nwhether the application of data/information fusion methods\nis\
    \ feasible, we must evaluate the computational cost of the\nprocess and the delay\
    \ introduced in the communication.\nA centralized data fusion approach is theoretically\
    \ optimal\nwhen there is no cost of transmission and there are sufficient\ncomputational\
    \ resources. However, this situation typically\ndoes not hold in practical applications.\n\
    The selection of the most appropriate technique depends\non the type of the problem\
    \ and the established assumptions\nof each technique. Statistical data fusion\
    \ methods (e.g., PDA,\nJPDA, MHT, and Kalman) are optimal under specific condi-\n\
    tions [72]. First, the assumption that the targets are moving\nThe Scientific\
    \ World Journal\n17\nindependently and the measurements are normally dis-\ntributed\
    \ around the predicted position typically does not\nhold. Second, because the\
    \ statistical techniques model all\nof the events as probabilities, they typically\
    \ have several\nparameters and a priori probabilities for false measurements\n\
    and detection errors that are often difficult to obtain (at\nleast in an optimal\
    \ sense). For example, in the case of the\nMHT algorithm, specific parameters\
    \ must be established that\nare nontrivial to determine and are very sensitive\
    \ [73]. In\ncontrast, statistical methods that optimize over several frames\n\
    are computationally intensive, and their complexity typically\ngrows exponentially\
    \ with the number of targets. For example,\nin the case of particle filters, tracking\
    \ several targets can be\naccomplished jointly as a group or individually. If\
    \ several\ntargets are tracked jointly, the necessary number of particles\ngrows\
    \ exponentially. Therefore, in practice, it is better to\nperform tracking on\
    \ them individually, with the assumption\nthat targets do not interact between\
    \ the particles.\nIn contrast to centralized systems, the distributed data\nfusion\
    \ methods introduce some challenges in the data fusion\nprocess, such as (i) spatial\
    \ and temporal alignments of the\ninformation, (ii) out-of-sequence measurements,\
    \ and (iii)\ndata correlation reported by Castanedo et al. [74, 75]. The\ninherent\
    \ redundancy of the distributed systems could be\nexploited with distributed reasoning\
    \ techniques and cooper-\native algorithms to improve the individual node estimations\n\
    reported by Castanedo et al. [76]. In addition to the previous\nstudies, a new\
    \ trend based on the geometric notion of a low-\ndimensional manifold is gaining\
    \ attention in the data fusion\ncommunity. An example is the work of Davenport\
    \ et al. [77],\nwhich proposes a simple model that captures the correlation\n\
    between the sensor observations by matching the parameter\nvalues for the different\
    \ obtained manifolds.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author would like to thank Jes´us\

    Abstract: In this contribution, an end to end system to enable user interaction
    with a distributed botanical university campus garden is designed, implemented
    and tested. The proposed system employs different wireless links to collect data
    related to different bio physiological parameters of both the vegetation mass
    and the surrounding environment. Detailed analysis of these multilevel communication
    links is performed by using deterministic volumetric wireless channel estimation
    and considering underground, near ground and over ground radio propagation conditions.
    An in-house developed technique enables accurate wireless channel characterization
    for complete campus scenario considering the multiple link types and all its composing
    elements. Node definition and network topology is thus obtained by wireless channel
    analysis of over ground, near ground and underground communication for both 868
    MHz and 2.4 GHz Wireless Sensor Networks in an inhomogeneous vegetation environment.
    Connectivity to enable user interaction as well as for telemetry and tele-control
    purposes within the campus is achieved by combining ZigBee and LoRaWAN transceivers
    with the corresponding sensor/actuator platforms. Coverage studies have been performed
    in order to assess communication capabilities in the set of multiple underground/near
    ground/over ground links, by means of deterministic channel analysis for the complete
    university campus location. Measurement results in lab environment as well as
    full system deployment are presented, showing good agreement with deterministic
    simulations. Moreover, system level tests have been performed over a physical
    campus cloud, providing adequate quality of experience metrics. The proposed solution
    is a scalable system that provides real time trees status monitoring by a cloud-based
    platform, enabling user interaction within a distributed botanical garden environment

    I. Introduction Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are being actively adopted as enablers
    for context monitoring within multiple applications and scenarios, such as environmental
    pollution [1], power grids [2], public safety [3] and agriculture [4]. However,
    the deployment of WSNs in applications focused in vegetation monitoring is challenging,
    considering inherent restrictions in terms of energy source availability, form
    factor and limited computational capacity [5]. In this sense, one of the main
    difficulties is to insure a reliable connection between nodes, especially in dense
    vegetation environments. The presence of foliage in the communication path has
    a direct impact in wireless communication system Quality of Service (QoS) values.
    This generally leads to node densification to increase coverage levels, especially
    in large areas, resulting in additional costs. Discrete scatters such as randomly
    distributed leaves, twigs, branches and tree trunks can cause attenuation, scattering,
    diffraction and absorption of the radiated waves. This severely constrains the
    design of wireless communication systems in inhomogeneous vegetation environments,
    given by the effect of foliage or multipath dispersion, among others [5]–[9].
    In order to provide communication capabilities within large coverage areas, wireless
    sensor networks provide moderate cost, flexible topology and constrained energy
    consumption. Among WSNs, LoRaWAN (Long-Range Wide-Area Network) is a long range,
    low power wireless platform that has become one of the main technologies for Internet
    of Things (IoT) networks worldwide [10], [11]. The works in [12]–[14] present
    the use of LoRaWAN technology in precision agriculture, especially in automate
    irrigation systems, climate and soil parameters monitoring. Moreover, in [15],
    [16] present LoRaWAN based smart sensing systems for environmental monitoring.
    In parallel, universities have been more aware with global warming and climate
    change issues, making more efforts to promote sustainability. The first step universities
    take toward sustainability is campus greening. Thus, campus landscape management
    is important for a green and sustainable campus [17], [18]. Campus Sustainability
    Assessments as Green Metric provide the result of online survey regarding the
    current condition and policies related to Green Campus and Sustainability in Universities
    all over the world [19]. Greenery has been even identified for stress reduction
    and emotional state balance in students [20]. In this context, the use of WSNs
    can provide more information about the state the green zones of the campus, not
    only for monitoring, but also for on-campus botanic tours in a more amenable fashion
    [21]. Considering the characteristics of a university campus in terms of size
    and the existence of multiple distributed sites/buildings, long range, low power
    platforms such as LoRaWAN enable telemetry, tele-control and interactive communication
    systems. The performance of systems that rely on WSNs depends on radio channel
    characterization and on whether vegetation is present or specific requirements
    in terms of underground or near to ground communications are required. In the
    literature, a ray-based model for scattering by tree branches has been developed
    in a pre-existent ray-tracing tool, validated with measurements results in campus
    scenario [22]. LoRa LPWAN measurements have been performed in IIUM campus to study
    the contribution to the path loss of five tree types for propagation channel modelling
    [23], and an IoT based system for water quality monitoring using WSN and RFID
    is deployed in the campus area of the University Sains Malaysia [24]. However,
    no references have been found which explore the complete set of underground, near
    ground and over ground communication links. Since trees monitoring requires measurements
    of various eco-physiological/biological parameters (e.g., stem water content,
    quality/quantity of foliage, soil parameters), sensors should be placed in specific
    locations as a function of vegetation type in order to obtain accurate readings.
    Different approaches have been described, such as a system for measuring the vegetation
    Leaf Area Index with ZigBee based WSN technology [25], a tree health condition
    monitoring system via LoRaWAN [26] or a NB-IoT based tree health monitoring system
    [27]. System deployment within this complex scenario requires accurate propagation
    modeling capabilities for underground, near ground and over-ground links, for
    both Line of Sight (LoS) and Non-Line of Sight (NLoS) cases. Therefore, it is
    compulsory to perform radio propagation analysis when deploying a WSN. The works
    in [28]–[30] analyse the effect of soil and present link quality characterization
    for underground to underground and underground to above ground communication.
    The possibility of using magnetic induction communication for wireless underground
    sensor network designed for irrigation control is addressed in [31]. The works
    in [32]–[34] present near-ground radio channel propagation in the presence of
    vegetation. Furthermore, path loss models for wireless sensor nodes deployed in
    short and tall grass environments are presented in [35], [36]. The works in [37]–[41]
    present wireless propagation measurements and path loss models for WSN in forest
    environments. Table 1 summarizes the research works related to the use of wireless
    communications in vegetation environments. TABLE 1 Related Work In this work,
    a distributed system implemented to enable user interaction with the distributed
    botanical garden at the university campus of the Public University of Navarre
    (UPNA) is presented. Node design and network deployment are optimized by means
    of detailed wireless propagation analysis considering complex operation conditions
    in underground, near ground and over ground communications. To this aim, specific
    characterization and simulation models have been implemented in the framework
    of an in-house implemented deterministic volumetric ray launching simulation tool,
    previously tested in different scenarios, including vegetation [42], [43]. In
    this way, coverage relations are obtained for each communication link type. To
    our knowledge, it is the first time to propose and test the characterization of
    all the communication link types (underground, near ground and over ground) by
    means of deterministic techniques. Experimental and system level validations with
    the implemented testbed have been carried out at the UPNA campus, located in the
    city of Pamplona, Spain. As a final stage, a monitoring distributed wireless system
    has been implemented for the UPNA campus botanical park in addition to the multilevel
    underground, near-ground and over-ground wireless link assessment. Thus the system
    is divided into multiple/seven ZigBee-based zonal collection networks which gather
    the information provided by the sensors deployed on trees, and a LoRaWAN campus-wide
    communication network which sends the information of each ZigBee network to a
    central gateway. The system is completed with the implementation of a real-time
    tree monitoring application, a cloud-based architecture, and a physical cloud
    infrastructure, all of the set allows performing in depth tests and analysis on
    campus premises. In Fig. 1, it is shown a schematic overview of the different
    tasks developed, as well as the results obtained in this work Fig. 1. FIGURE 1.
    Schematic overview of the tasks developed in relation with the design, implementation
    and analysis of the proposed UPNA Smart Campus system. Show All The paper is organized
    as follows. Section II describes wireless channel characterization for near ground,
    over ground and underground links. Section III presents the link analysis applied
    to provide wireless system planning, for LoRaWAN and ZigBee network nodes. System
    validation and end to end data transmission are discussed in Section IV. Concluding
    remarks are offered in Section V. SECTION II. Underground, Near-Ground and Over-Ground
    Wireless Channel Assessment in Campus Environment With the aim of optimizing both
    the design and deployment of the proposed distributed system, wireless channel
    analysis for the complete UPNA campus must be performed to determine coverage
    distributions thus providing the initial wireless system planning. In this section,
    once presented the campus scenario, the multiple level wireless link types are
    studied: underground, near-ground and over-ground links. Link types are defined
    based on the wireless node transmitter antenna height. A. Campus Environment Under
    Analysis The UPNA campus covers approximately a surface of 170000 m2 and a volume
    of over 5.1 million m3. It has one central building, one library building, seven
    department buildings and elements such as sitting benches and hundreds of trees.
    In fact, it contains 99 different species, a variety of different trees and a
    dozen relevant shrub species [44]. This vegetation mass harmonically surrounds
    the campus buildings and is distributed in various landscaped areas, with the
    aim of conforming a distributed botanical garden. As shown in Fig. 2, the campus
    is divided into five main parks: the Park of Navarre, the English Park, the Asian
    and European Park, the American, African and Oceanic Park and finally the Rectorate
    Park. FIGURE 2. Location of the five parks that conform the distributed botanical
    garden at the Public University of Navarre. Show All In this work, the seven main
    types of trees distributed in five of the total parks within the campus are considered:
    Yew trees, pine trees, olive trees, holly trees, arbutus trees, magnolias trees
    and holm oak trees. The tree types can be easily recognized because each one grows
    next to a university department building that bears its name. This setting constitutes
    a distributed botanical garden aimed to promote dissemination of agroforestry
    knowledge [44]. B. 3D Ray Launching Simulation Tool With the aim of providing
    in depth understanding of the behavior of the multilevel wireless links present
    in this complex environment, a 3D-RL algorithm has been employed. The 3D-RL algorithm
    has been implemented in-house, based on Geometrical Optics (GO) and Geometrical
    Theory of Diffraction (GTD), optimized with hybrid simulation techniques in order
    to reduce computational cost. As an example, the garden surrounding the Los Tejos
    building has been analyzed and the simulation scenario implemented. The scenario
    has 110 m in length, 31 m width and 15m height. Fig. 3a shows a real picture of
    the scenario, and Fig. 3b shows the 3D-RL simulation scenario. FIGURE 3. Garden
    scenario for simulation in the 3D Ray Launching Simulator (a) real view and (b)
    schematic view. Show All All the existing elements at the garden such as trunk
    trees, foliage, streetlights and grass have been taken into account in order to
    obtain accurate radio propagation estimations. To this extent, the frequency dispersive
    characteristics of the dielectric constant and conductivity of the materials for
    the specific operation frequency have been taken in consideration. Table 2 presents
    the material properties (dielectric constant and conductivity) of all the elements
    considered. TABLE 2 Material Properties for the 3D Ray Launching Simulation The
    dielectric constant ε r and conductivity σ of tree foliage varies with humidity
    h as per (1) and (2): ε rfoliage = σ foliage = 137 h 3 −69.688 h 2 +23.385h+1.4984
    1.1541 h 3 −0.5489 h 2 +0.1669h−0.0004 (1) (2) View Source For this study, 20%
    humidity level has been considered. Simulation results have been obtained for
    the complete scenario volume. As an example, RF power distribution planes for
    different receiver heights are presented in Fig. 4, for both 2.4 GHz (ZigBee)
    and 868 MHz (LoRaWAN) bands. In order to simulate near ground and over ground
    conditions, two different transmitter antenna heights were conf: 0.1m and 1.1m.
    Simulation parameters have been chosen to agree with the measurement equipment
    setup, which will be analyzed in the following subsection. FIGURE 4. Estimated
    RF power level distributions for 868 MHz for (a) Tx = 0.1m; (b) Tx = 1.1m; and
    for 2.4 GHz for (c) Tx = 0.1m; (d) Tx = 1.1m. Show All C. Near-Ground and Over-Ground
    Wireless Link Assessment As a first step to perform the analysis of the multiple
    communication link types, over-ground and near-ground propagation conditions were
    considered, since accurate measurements of tree’s eco-physiological/biological
    parameters requires sensors placed at different height on the tree. Therefore,
    the multiple positions of the nodes leading to the different link types have been
    included in the wireless channel analysis. Received power and Received Signal
    Strength Indicator (RSSI) values have been measured while transmitter nodes were
    placed at different heights T x of 0.1m and 1.1m from the ground, corresponding
    to usual operating conditions of devices in near to ground and over the ground
    locations, respectively. Both transmitters were communicating with both receiver
    nodes placed at the same heights resulting in a near-ground to near-ground communication,
    near-ground to over-ground communication, over-ground to near-ground communication
    and over-ground to over-ground communication schemes. Measurements have been performed
    along both LoS and NLoS link paths, as it is schematically shown in Fig. 5a. Thus,
    these experiments will determine communication QoS parameters between nodes attached
    to trees in Los Tejos garden (see Fig. 5b). The distance between two trees in
    the same row is approximately 6.5m, and the distance between two rows is 9.5m.
    Los Tejos was chosen owing to the complexity of the scenario in terms of vegetation
    density and location. Nodes were placed over, near and under the ground. FIGURE
    5. (a) Details of the measurement setup for the near ground and over the ground
    communication links. (b) 3D-RL view of over-ground, near-ground and underground
    communication links considered in the scenario under analysis. Show All Wireless
    channel measurements have been performed using Libelium 868 MHz nodes, 2.4 GHz
    ZigBee nodes and a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) tuned at 2.4 GHz. Transmitted
    power of the ZigBee nodes was 25 dBm at 868 MHz and 17 dBm at 2.4 GHz. Received
    power measurements have been performed with an Agilent N9912 Field Fox portable
    spectrum analyzer. For the received power measurements at 2.4 GHz, an omnidirectional
    antenna has been connected to the VCO with a transmit power of 8.38 dBm. The RSSI
    has been measured using Libelium ZigBee nodes operating at 868 MHz and 2.4 GHz.
    Receiver sensitivity of the ZigBee nodes was −112 dBm at 868 MHz and −102 dBm
    at 2.4 GHz. Fig. 6 shows the received power and RSSI results for both transmitter
    and receiver placed at 0.1m and 1.1m from the ground, for LoS and NLoS path cases.
    It can be seen that over ground to over ground links exhibit the highest received
    power level, given by lower obstruction in such links. Measurements have been
    performed at a maximum distance of 65m in the case of 2.4GHz (Fig. 6c), to avoid
    unwanted effects of detected interferences in the 2.4GHz ISM band. FIGURE 6. (a)
    Received power and (b) RSSI (dBm) at different Tx and Rx heights for 868 MHz;
    (c) and (d) the same for 2.4 GHz. Show All Once the measurements were carried
    out, simulations were performed, in order to validate the presented 3D-RL tool.
    For that purpose, simulation and measurements results at 868 MHz are compared
    in Fig. 7. Both heights of T x =0.1 m and T x =1.1 are included. FIGURE 7. Comparison
    between the measured and the simulated results for 868 MHz radio frequency; (a)
    for Tx = 0.1m, and (b) Tx = 1.1m. Show All Table 3 summarizes the measurements
    vs. simulations results, with the obtained mean error and standard deviation.
    TABLE 3 Measurements vs. Simulations Comparison for Near-Ground and Overground
    Communication at 868 MHz Mean error values for received power estimations are
    given by using equation (3): x= ∑ n i=1 | P mi [dBm]− P si [dBm]| n (3) View Source
    with P m the measured received power, P s the simulated received power and n the
    number of the measurement points. As it can be observed in Table 3, higher errors
    occur when the transmitter (Tx) is placed on the ground (i.e. 0.1m) while lower
    errors appear when the transmitter is placed over-ground (i.e. at 1.1m height).
    These errors are further reduced in the case of over-ground to over-ground communication
    links (Tx and Rx at height of 1.1m. Large deviations in the estimation of received
    power levels mainly at closer distances to the transmitter as well as in the case
    of transmitter locations in near-ground configuration. This is given by the fact
    that near ground communications are influenced by phenomena such as surface wave
    coupling, which are not intrinsically considered following deterministic physical
    optics approach. Moreover, the implemented ground model considers a macroscopic
    homogeneous soil layer with dispersive material properties considered for a specific
    humidity level. Finally, a thin homogeneous grass layer has been implemented.
    Effects such as non-homogeneous soil/humidity distributions and small-scale diffraction
    and scattering effects from individual grass filaments increase average error
    values and will be considered in future models. D. Underground Wireless Link Assessment
    The use of underground nodes is required for soil parameters measurement (e.g.,
    moisture levels, scatterer density such as roots, rocks, etc.), which have a direct
    influence on tree health assessment. Radio propagation measurements have been
    performed to characterize communication links between a node placed underground
    and a node placed on the ground surface. In order to obtain accurate results,
    a container of 50/50/50 cm full of soil has been used, as depicted in Fig. 8.
    FIGURE 8. Schematic view of the measurement setup implemented for the underground
    link. Show All Received power, Delta RSSI (the difference between the received
    power and the RSSI), path loss and received packets in terms of the difference
    between the RSSI for propagation in both soil and air have been measured. Measurements
    were obtained for increments of 10 cm under the soil up to 50 cm of distance between
    the underground transmitter node and the receiver which is placed on the soil,
    as shown in Fig. 8. Measurement results are depicted in Fig. 9 plots. FIGURE 9.
    (a) Received power and Delta RSSI at 868 MHz and 2.4 GHz, (b) path loss at the
    same frequencies, (c) difference between the received packets RSSI for propagation
    in both soil and air at 868 MHz and (d) 2.4 GHz. Show All The results show that
    high losses are present at short distances, mainly given by the power extinction
    rate and the impedance mismatch between the node antenna and the surrounding soil
    medium. Impedance mismatching depends on the frequency dispersive dielectric constant
    values but also on the location conditions of the antenna/soil interfaces, which,
    in turn, also impact on both matching conditions (similar to the case of radome
    location with respect to an antenna radiating surface, owing to the existence
    of a stationary wave condition) and on the inter symbol interference [45], [46].
    Path losses are within the range of 55 dB to 72 dB at 868 MHz and in the range
    of 68 dB to 76 dB at 2.4GHz (see Table 4). Differences in losses can also be due
    to other factors, such as the surface wave coupling, which in the case of near
    ground communication are more relevant as operational frequency decreases, usually
    below the UHF/microwave range, out of the scope of the transceivers employed in
    this work. Another critical factor of influence is the transmitted waveform which
    should be specifically designed to counteract the effects of frequency dispersion
    to provide larger links [46]. Finally, although the measured losses for the underground
    links are high, it is important to note that the received RF power levels at 50cm
    distance/depth are greater than the sensitivity thresholds of the nodes, and therefore,
    adequate to enable a communication link between the underground and near-ground
    nodes, where all the transmitted packets are received. TABLE 4 Path Loss Range
    for Underground Communication SECTION III. Implementation of the Distributed Wireless
    System for the Monitoring of The Botanical Park Once the different wireless link
    types involved in the presented environment have been assessed, this section describes
    the radio planning tasks that validate the deployment of the LoRaWAN devices for
    the monitoring system of the botanical park of the UPNA campus. Due to the large
    size of the scenario to be covered, and the high number of wireless nodes that
    are necessary to monitor all the trees and shrub species, two differentiated wireless
    networks are proposed. On the one hand, since the area covered by the flora is
    extensive, instead of a unique network, several sub-networks have been proposed,
    based on ZigBee technology (see Fig. 10). ZigBee technology provides the possibility
    of having a large number of nodes within the same network (up to 65,000), therefore,
    the high number of present flora elements can be monitored in each sub-network,
    while at the same time allows scalability. ZigBee also allows mesh topology, which
    makes the network more robust against wireless link falls. Therefore, this study
    has focused on the LoRaWAN network, since its star topology needs point-to-point
    evaluation (beside the presence of obstacles such as buildings), while ZigBee’s
    mesh topology and the distances between ZigBee devices within a single sub-network
    are short and do not require extra radio planning tasks. FIGURE 10. Schematic
    view of the simulation scenario implemented to analyze the campus botanical monitoring
    system, in which each one of the LoRaWAN/ZigBee sub-networks is presented. Show
    All While ZigBee can be considered as a medium range wireless technology (which
    if low power consumption is wanted, the range becomes much shorter), a long range
    wireless technology has been proposed in order to send/transport the collected
    information of all the ZigBee sub-networks to a centralized gateway. For that
    purpose, three different technologies were assessed: NB-IoT, SigFox and LoRaWAN.
    All of them provided good coverage on campus, but even if LoRaWAN is the only
    one that needs the deployment of gateways (see Fig. 10), we opted for LoRaWAN
    because it does not require extra costs for the provided service after the deployment
    of the network, while SigFox and NB-IoT solutions require fee payments. The proposed
    LoRaWAN wireless network has been evaluated as follows. The 3D-RL simulation tool
    has been employed to obtain an optimized deployment for the LoRaWAN gateway. Once
    a placement for the LoRaWAN gateway is obtained based on simulations, LoRaWAN
    communication measurements between each garden with a specific tree type (where
    the ZigBee sub-networks are deployed) and the LoRaWAN gateway within the campus
    (the central node in Fig. 10) have been performed. As in the ZigBee case, different
    node heights have been considered. Received packets, RSSI and SNR were measured.
    A. 3D Ray Launching for LoRaWAN In order to provide full campus connectivity,
    the local sub-networks operate in conjunction with campus wide networks. Therefore,
    an additional deterministic radio planning study has been performed to obtain
    information about the feasibility of the proposed WSN for the whole campus. A
    view of the complete schematic campus model developed for the simulations is illustrated
    in Fig. 11. The campus of the Public University of Navarre scenario dimensions
    are 590 m long, 290 m width and 30 m height. FIGURE 11. Campus scenario for simulation
    in the 3D Ray Launching Simulator (a) real view and (b) schematic view and (c)
    a zoomed part of the scenario. Show All All the existing elements at the campus,
    such as trunk tree, foliage, streetlights, grass, benches, vehicles, and metallic
    elements, have been considered, making a simulation volume of 5.1 million m3.
    Table 5 presents the frequency dispersive material properties of the elements
    within the campus scenario. TABLE 5 3D RL Material Properties for the Campus Scenario
    Fig. 12 illustrates the coverage maps for receivers placed at different heights
    H 1 =2 m, H 2 =4 m and H 3 =6 m from the ground, and transmitters placed at Los
    Tejos building in Fig. 12 (a) and Las Encinas in Fig. 12 (b), at a height of 1.1
    m from the ground. It is worth noting that results have been obtained for the
    complete simulation volume, although they are represented in bi-dimensional constant
    height cut-plane for the sake of clarity. Los Tejos and Las Encinas buildings
    simulations results were chosen because of their locations within the campus context.
    FIGURE 12. Estimated RF power distribution planes obtained by 3D RL at different
    heights for a transmitter placed at (a) Los Tejos building, and (b) Las Encinas
    building. Show All Results show that coverage distributions at the height of 4m
    are better than the two other heights for both transmitters. Thus, placing the
    gateway at 4m from the ground provides higher received power levels and hence,
    communication link quality metrics with the nodes. Fig. 13 shows the coverage
    intersection of both transmitters. The results from transmitters placed at other
    buildings are compatible with this conclusion. FIGURE 13. Coverage intersection
    for transmitters placed at Los tejos and Las Encinas buildings. Show All B. LoRaWan
    Measurements In order to analyze and validate LoRaWan system deployment, The Thing
    Network (TTN) nodes have been attached to trees from all the seven types within
    the campus. Measurements have been conducted with the TTN nodes placed on the
    ground and at a height of 1.1m from the ground. The transmitted power and the
    sensitivity of the TTN nodes are 14 dBm and −148 dBm respectively. Following the
    simulations results and Fig. 13, the TTN gateway has been placed at the library,
    which is located at the center of the campus for an optimal communication link
    with all the deployed nodes. Fig. 2 illustrates the locations of the TTN nodes
    and gateway and Fig. 14 shows the deployed devices for the measurement campaigns.
    FIGURE 14. LoRaWAN system campaign: location of the different nodes within the
    campus, as well as the TTN gateway. Show All Received packets, RSSI and Signal-to-Noise
    Ratio (SNR) results have been obtained from direct communication between the TTN
    nodes in order to perform physical layer as well as preliminary system level validation.
    Fig. 15 depicts the results achieved for different node locations, placed at both
    0.1m and 1.1m from the ground, and the gateway placed at 4m from the ground. FIGURE
    15. Near ground and over ground TTN nodes to gateway results: (a) RSSI, (b) SNR,
    (c) received packets/RSSI and (d) received packets/SNR. Show All The results show
    that received power level are in general higher in over ground conditions, with
    an RSSI average difference in the order of 5-8dB between near ground and over
    ground links, consistent with losses given to ground/signal interaction. These
    results lead to improved performance in quality of experience metrics, such as
    those given by SNR and percentage of successful received packets. Hence, transceiver
    location within near ground leads to increased losses, which must be considered
    in the deployment phase to perform adequate coverage analysis and hence, optimal
    node location. SECTION IV. System Validation and Application Development Once
    a complete model for the different communication links within the distributed
    campus garden has been developed, a real scenario in terms of end users for trees
    monitoring within the campus has been tested for system validation. System validation
    is given by wireless communication between the sensor nodes and the Cayenne platform.
    The sensor nodes are communicating with the coordinator via ZigBee. Then, the
    coordinator sends data to the TTN gateway via LoRaWAN technology. The collected
    data is sent to the Cayenne platform for storage and display. A schema of all
    the communication steps for system validation is illustrated in Fig. 16. FIGURE
    16. (a) Functional diagram of the measurements system; (b) Developed application
    blocks and features. Show All Users can check the real time data of the tree parameters
    or revise the history of the last hour, day, week, month or year using cayenne’s
    webpage or application, which is available on both Apple and Android. Fig. 17
    illustrates some of the platform features. FIGURE 17. (a) End user platform for
    trees monitoring; (b) Temperature history plot for the mobile application. Show
    All After successful communication tests, a purpose specific application has been
    implemented. The developed application is divided into two main services, monitor
    and guide, as shown in Fig. 18. The monitor part is dedicated in the first place
    to gardeners and campus staff for data analysis and decision making. To contribute
    directly to sustainability in green campuses and water saving. By selecting the
    desired tree type, user can select the exact tree number for sensors information
    display. For each tree, user can read the following sensor data: Air temperature
    and humidity, sun light, leaf wetness, soil temperature and moisture. FIGURE 18.
    The developed UPNA Botanical Garden application, compatible with desktop, Tablet
    and mobile platforms. Bottom right, a picture of real time tree data monitoring
    within the UPNA campus. Show All Moreover, the application guides new students
    and visitors through the gardens of the campus through the guide section. By selecting
    the desired park, visitors can see a schema of the park, containing the names
    of all the existing trees and species with its location at the park. Also, a walking
    path for assuring a valuable experience for visitors. For an easy use, the application
    is compatible with mobile, Tablet and desktop, as it is shown in Fig. 18. In addition
    to the Cayenne environment, a specific platform called InGaM (Interactive Garden
    Monitor) has been developed for monitoring the campus garden of the Public University
    of Navarre. This platform, whose architecture is depicted in Fig. 19, is based
    on Apache and Elasticsearch’s components. Data collected by the WSN network can
    be injected directly into the platform, or it can be imported as often as desired
    from the Cayenne platform. In addition, the platform allows importing meteorological
    information from the national and regional meteorological networks [48], [49],
    in addition to municipal [50] and regional geographical open-data [51]. FIGURE
    19. Platform architecture and network hardware employed for the UPNA Botanical
    Garden application integration. Show All Data harvesting may be heterogeneous
    in terms of data model, so Apache Nifi allows data transformation and provides
    ETL functionalities (extract, transform and load) to ensure the arrival of quality,
    consistent and standardized data in the NGSI-LD data format to the platform. According
    to the data source, the data is distributed into message queues managed by the
    Apache Kafka component, which allows the use of the publish/subscribe paradigm.
    Data recovery, previously structured by Nifi and arranged by Kafka, is stored
    by means of the Elasticsearch component. Finally, visualization is provided by
    the Kibana component. All the components (Nifi, Kafka, Kibana and elasticsearch)
    are well-known and widely used software components. As a parallel learning mechanism,
    there is a data analysis module based on Python, Keras and TensorFlow, which enables
    fast experimentation with deep neural networks. Currently, InGaM has just accomplished
    its implementation and validation phase, and as enough data is harvested, data
    analysis will begin. SECTION V. Conclusion In this work, an interactive and distributed
    botanical university campus garden end to end system is proposed. Deterministic
    wireless channel analysis has been performed, considering a full set of communication
    links that includes underground, near ground and over ground communications. Precise
    coverage estimations for the complete volume of a very large and complex scenario,
    such as UPNA campus have been obtained, for communication links at 868MHz and
    2.4GHz frequency bands. The results have allowed the deployment of the sensor
    nodes, employing ZigBee protocol and data communication links, based in LoRaWAN.
    Simulation along with measurement results indicate the differences and limitations
    within the different communication links under analysis, establishing the maximum
    link distance for each one of underground, near ground and over ground link types.
    System level validation has been performed, initially on a Cayenne platform and
    afterwards a purpose specific dual application and in-house implemented cloud-based
    architecture. Measurement results show the viability of the system in terms of
    communication link availability as well on the successful reception of both telemonitoring
    data (for asset management) as well as those related with visitor interaction.
    Future work is foreseen in higher levels of sensor integration, as well as in
    interoperability of the data management system at operational level with the Pamplona
    Smart City platform. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More

    sophistication. Join us as we witness the Italian renaissance of smart homes,
    an enthralling journey that

    epitomizes the symbiotic relationship between tradition and technology in contemporary
    living.

    1. Introduction

    In an age characterized by relentless technological advancement, the concept of
    smart homes has

    emerged as a transformative paradigm that is reshaping the way people live, interact,
    and think about

    their living spaces [1]. Smart homes refer to residential environments that incorporate
    intelligent systems,

    automated controls, and advanced communication technologies, all designed to enhance
    comfort,

    e¨ciency, and sustainability [2]. Unlike traditional houses, smart homes are imbued
    with interconnected

    devices that can be controlled remotely, allowing residents to manage everything
    from lighting and

    heating to security and entertainment through simple commands or even autonomously.

    The integration of these technologies represents a profound shift from conventional
    housing models,

    merging the realms of digital innovation with everyday domestic life. The implications
    of this

    transformation are far-reaching, touching various aspects of society, economy,
    and culture [3].

    Particularly in countries with rich architectural traditions, such as Italy, the
    integration of smart

    technologies within the housing landscape presents unique challenges and opportunities.
    This

    juxtaposition of the time-honored principles of design with cutting-edge technological
    solutions offers a

    fascinating exploration of how tradition can be reinterpreted and revitalized
    through modern innovation.

    The emergence of smart homes is not just a technological phenomenon; it represents
    a societal shift that

    re§ects changing attitudes towards energy consumption, personal convenience, security,
    and even the

    broader philosophy of living. With global trends leaning towards sustainability
    and technological

    responsiveness, the evolution of smart homes becomes a critical subject of study
    that links technology,

    design, functionality, and human behavior.

    Page 3/19

    In this paper, we will delve into the multifaceted concept of smart homes with
    a particular focus on Italy''s

    housing landscape. We will explore how this nation, with its rich architectural
    heritage, is navigating the

    path from tradition to transformation, weaving smart home technologies into the
    very fabric of its cultural

    identity. The study will examine the economic, social, and architectural implications
    of this integration,

    providing insights that are not only relevant to Italy but also contribute to
    a broader understanding of how

    smart homes are rede¦ning our contemporary living experience.

    2. Methodology

    This research employs a mixed-methods approach to comprehensively investigate
    the integration of

    smart home technologies within Italy''s housing landscape [4]. Initially, a systematic
    literature review was

    conducted to gather existing knowledge from primary research articles, books,
    conference papers, and

    industry reports. This review enabled the identi¦cation of key technological trends,
    challenges, and

    opportunities related to smart home adoption [5]. Following the literature review,
    quantitative data were

    collected through a nationwide survey targeting homeowners, architects, and technology
    providers. This

    survey was designed to assess attitudes, perceptions, and practical applications
    of smart home

    technologies in various Italian regions [6]. Additionally, qualitative data were
    gathered through in-depth

    interviews with experts and stakeholders, aiming to provide nuanced insights into
    the economic, social,

    and architectural implications of technology integration. The collected data were
    analyzed using

    statistical tools for quantitative information and thematic analysis for qualitative
    insights. A triangulation

    of ¦ndings from different sources ensured a holistic understanding, and Geographic
    Information System

    (GIS) mapping was utilized to spatially represent the distribution of smart home
    technologies across Italy

    [4]. This multi-faceted methodology allowed for a rich exploration of the subject,
    linking technological

    considerations with cultural, historical, and economic contexts within the Italian
    housing landscape.

    3. History and Development of Smart Homes in Italy

    The impact of smart homes on Italian society has been profound, extending beyond
    the realm of mere

    technological advancements [7]. As homes evolved into immersive environments tailored
    to individual

    preferences, people found themselves more deeply connected to their living spaces.
    The integration of

    innovative sensors and intelligent devices brought a new level of convenience
    and ease, transforming

    everyday tasks into seamless experiences. No longer were homes just shelters;
    they became nurturing

    hubs that anticipated and met the needs of their inhabitants [8].

    Moreover, the smart home revolution fostered a culture of sustainability and environmental

    consciousness [9]. The ability to optimize energy consumption and reduce waste
    became a central tenet

    of smart home design. This conscientious approach not only contributed to more
    eco-friendly living but

    also aligned with Italy''s commitment to protecting the natural beauty and heritage
    of the country.

    The journey of smart homes in Italy has been a collaborative effort between visionary
    individuals,

    academia, and industry leaders [10]. The convergence of multidisciplinary expertise
    has driven this ¦eld

    Page 4/19

    forward, paving the way for even more groundbreaking innovations. From engineers
    and computer

    scientists to architects and urban planners, diverse minds have come together
    to create a harmonious

    fusion of technology and human-centric design.

    As the world continues to embrace the boundless possibilities of smart homes,
    Italy stands at the

    forefront of this transformation. With a rich history of cultural heritage and
    artistic legacy, the Italian

    approach to smart homes has been imbued with a unique blend of aesthetics and
    functionality. The

    seamless integration of technology into the fabric of daily life has made smart
    homes an integral part of

    modern living, not just in Italy but across the globe [8].

    Looking ahead, the future of smart homes in Italy is ¦lled with promise and potential
    [9]. Advancements

    in arti¦cial intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), and sustainable practices
    will undoubtedly propel the

    industry to new heights. As we peer into the horizon of possibilities, it becomes
    evident that smart homes

    will continue to evolve, adapting to the changing needs and aspirations of the
    people they serve [10].

    The emergence of smart home technologies brought forth new challenges and complexities
    that required

    thoughtful and comprehensive regulation [11]. As Italy embraced the potential
    of these innovative

    solutions, policymakers recognized the necessity of creating a conducive environment
    that encouraged

    responsible innovation while safeguarding the interests of consumers.

    One of the primary objectives of smart home regulations was to ensure the safety
    and security of users

    [12]. Early experiments and advancements in smart homes raised concerns about
    potential vulnerabilities

    that could be exploited by malicious actors. In response, Italy developed stringent
    safety standards to

    mitigate risks and protect users'' personal data. Manufacturers and developers
    were required to adhere to

    strict security protocols, fostering consumer trust and con¦dence in these cutting-edge
    technologies.

    Furthermore, the interoperability of various smart devices was a key aspect addressed
    by legislation [13].

    The seamless integration of different components within smart homes enhances the
    user experience and

    optimizes the functionality of the ecosystem. To facilitate this, Italy introduced
    regulations that

    encouraged industry players to adopt standardized communication protocols, enabling
    smart devices

    from different manufacturers to work together harmoniously.

    Recognizing the potential of smart homes to contribute to energy conservation
    and sustainability, Italian

    regulators integrated environmental objectives into the legal framework [14].
    Incentives were provided to

    homeowners who embraced energy-e¨cient technologies, such as smart thermostats
    and energy

    monitoring systems. By promoting eco-friendly practices within smart homes, Italy
    not only contributed to

    its broader environmental goals but also empowered citizens to become more conscious
    of their energy

    consumption habits.

    As the smart home industry continued to evolve rapidly, Italy demonstrated remarkable
    adaptability in its

    regulatory approach. Policymakers remained abreast of technological advancements
    and industry trends,

    regularly revisiting and updating regulations to stay aligned with the dynamic
    landscape. This §exibility

    Page 5/19

    allowed the country to embrace innovation while ensuring that ethical and legal
    considerations were

    upheld.

    Moreover, the collaborative nature of Italy''s regulatory process involved multiple
    stakeholders, including

    government bodies, research institutions, industry associations, and consumer
    advocacy groups. This

    inclusive approach allowed for diverse perspectives to be considered, resulting
    in regulations that were

    well-rounded and bene¦cial for all parties involved.

    The impact of smart home regulations on Italy''s residential landscape has been
    substantial. The

    presence of well-de¦ned guidelines has nurtured an environment where smart home
    technology is readily

    adopted by both homeowners and businesses. This proactive regulatory stance has
    also attracted

    investments and fostered growth in the smart home industry, positioning Italy
    as a leader in this

  explanation: 'The proposed system gathers information from a variety of sources,
    including sensors, satellites, and the internet, and uses this information to
    provide farmers with tailored recommendations for managing their crops and livestock.
    These recommendations are based on a variety of factors, including soil conditions,
    weather patterns, and market prices.


    A key component of the proposed system is its use of remote sensing technologies.
    These technologies allow farmers to collect data about their crops and livestock
    without having to be physically present on their land. This data can then be used
    to create detailed maps of the farm, which can help farmers to identify areas
    that need attention.


    The proposed system also uses a variety of machine learning algorithms to analyze
    the data that it collects. These algorithms can be used to identify patterns and
    trends in the data, which can help farmers to make better decisions about how
    to manage their crops and livestock.


    The proposed system is still in its early stages of development, but it has the
    potential to revolutionize the way that farmers manage their crops and livestock.
    By providing farmers with tailored recommendations based on real-time data, the
    system can help farmers to increase their yields and reduce their costs.


    Here are some specific examples of how the proposed system can be used to improve
    agricultural productivity:


    * Farmers can use the system to monitor the soil conditions on their land. This
    information can be used to identify areas that need to be fertilized or irrigated.

    * Farmers can use the system to track the growth of their crops. This information
    can be used to identify plants that are not growing properly and need additional
    attention.

    * Farmers can use the system to monitor the health of their livestock. This information
    can be used to identify animals that are sick or injured and need to be treated.

    * Farmers can use the system to track the market prices for their crops and livestock.
    This information can be used to identify the best time to sell their products.'

    Get rights and content Highlights • Increasing demand for food urges for the modernization
    of agricultural process. • Agricultural process involves crop production as well
    as food supply chain. • Optimizing crop production requires real time monitoring
    of agricultural fields and yields. • Reducing intermediaries in the food supply
    chain increases farmers profit. • User-centric Internet of Things is a key enabler
    for realizing Smart Agriculture. Abstract Recent advancement in the technology
    has paved the way for the optimization of traditional industrial practices. Agriculture
    sector continues to serve as the backbone of the global economy. Moreover, it
    is required to cater the ever increasing demand for the food products arising
    due to rapid growth of global population. This urges for the modernization of
    traditional agricultural methodologies. Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential
    to become the key enabler for realizing the vision of Smart Agriculture. This

    faced in the agricultural domain. The proposed system allows the farmers to monitor
    their agricultural fields in real time and receive recommendations for producing
    good quality crops. The proposed architecture also optimizes the food supply chain

    1. Introduction Agriculture is one of the most important sector round the globe.
    In developing nations like India, agriculture contributes to about 15% of the
    GDP and is a vital source of the Indian Economy [1]. Few other countries that
    depends highly on agriculture for their GDP are Sierra Leone (60%), Chad (49.1%),
    Central African Republic (39.6%), etc. [52]. The World Bank data clearly depicts
    that more than one-fourth of the total employment at the global level relies on
    the agriculture sector [53]. The significance of the agriculture sector in terms
    of employment is more in the developing countries like India where approximately
    two-third of the population rely on agriculture for their income source. It is
    responsible for creating more than 50% of employment either directly or indirectly
    [1]. As per the prediction of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United
    Nation (FAO), the population of the world is expected to reach 8 billion by 2025
    and 9.6 billion by 2050 [2]. This is a clear indicator of the increase in the
    requirement of food production by 2050 at the global level. It is also required
    that the food products should be of high quality. This urges for the industrialization
    of the agricultural sector and employment of advanced technology for modernizing
    the agricultural process. The agricultural process comprises of multiple sub processes
    ranging from the production of crops to the delivery of the end products to the
    consumers. Several works in the existing literature have addressed the issues
    prevalent in the current agricultural practices. For instance, one of the key
    requirements for producing healthy crops is that of apt and timely supply of nutritional
    and water content in the agricultural fields [109]. This has been made possible
    through the real-time monitoring ability of the solutions equipped with sensors
    and actuators. The sensors are deployed in the agricultural fields where they
    continuously sense the environmental and soil conditions and transmit this information
    to the intelligent softwares residing either on the cloud or at the local level.
    These softwares are responsible for taking suitable decisions and controlling
    actuators like sprinklers, etc. so that the field conditions can be maintained
    in an automated fashion. Table 1 highlights the technology adoption scenario in
    the agriculture sector by some of the countries. Table 1. Technology Adoption

    23% of cotton producers used GPS guidance as in 2013 survey, about 31% adopted
    auto section control and 59% auto guidance systems. • Until 2000s, adoption of
    different PA technologies varied up to 22% across major field crops. Tractor guidance
    grew faster than variable-rate application for all major field crops over the
    last 10 years. [[76], [77], [78]] Another key process in the agricultural domain
    is the selling off the grown products in the market. This is widely known as the
    food supply chain and involves a number of entities that act as intermediaries
    between the farmer and the final consumer. These intermediaries are responsible
    for about 75% of the total net margin accruing to the entire supply chain [1].
    Fig. 1 depicts a general food supply chain scenario. The complete process can
    be subdivided into a number of transactions. Farmers receive seeds and fertilizers
    from the suppliers required for the production of crops. The agro products produced
    by the farmers need to be sold in the market. The farmers have the choice of selling
    the food products either directly in the market designated as distribution centres
    or they can dispose of their produce to a local trader. The local traders act
    as the aggregators of the fresh food products acquired from different farmers.
    They arrange for all the necessary transportation vehicles and sell the aggregated
    food products at the distribution centres. The retailers procure these food products
    from the distribution centres and sell them to the end consumers. A study performed
    by Sidhu et al. in [35] deduced that farmers sell more than 90% of the grown crops
    to the local traders or the distribution centres while a small portion is sold
    to the retailers and consumers directly. Download : Download high-res image (291KB)

    supply chain has a number of shortcomings from the farmers’ point of view. As
    most of the farmers do not have sufficient resources for the storage and transportation
    of the produced crops, they tend to sell them to the local traders at a very low
    margin. Moreover, the farmers usually do not sell their crops directly in the
    market at the distribution centres. This can also be attributed to the fact that
    the rates at the distribution centres are not standardized and these farmers can
    be cheated and may be forced to sell their products at low cost. However, if the
    products are sold as per the favorable marketing condition, the farmers are expected
    to get a high return for their products. The work done in this paper is an attempt
    to minimize the various difficulties faced by the farmers in the agricultural
    sectors. This work proposes a user-centric Internet of Things (IoT) based architecture
    for facilitating the farmers to make use of the advanced technology for improving
    their crop production and increasing their profits in selling the products. IoT
    refers to a network of interconnected heterogeneous smart devices for delivering
    value added services to the society. The term “Internet of Things” was initially
    coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in the context of supply chain management. IoT
    ecosystem encompasses a wide variety of uniquely identifiable devices communicating
    using standard protocols and delivering value added services to the users [3].
    The contemporary applications of these IoT networks include a variety of domains,
    ranging from personalized applications like smart home, smart meeting room, etc.
    at one end to services such as smart healthcare, intelligent transportation, precision
    agriculture, etc., at the other end [4,5]. This rapid growth and adoption of the
    IoT technology is clearly visible in the Gartner estimates, which states that
    there will be nearly 26 billion devices on the IoT by 2020 [6]. IoT has been proved
    to be a vital component for implementing dynamic workflow adaptions [7,8]. The
    dynamic nature of the agricultural sector makes IoT the most suitable enabling
    technology for addressing various challenges prevalent in the current agricultural
    practices [[110], [111], [112],114,116]. The use of sensors in conjunction with
    the intelligent algorithms can provide smart recommendations to the farmers regarding
    the maintenance of the field quality in order to have high quality crops [9,108,113].
    Moreover, apart from the data generated by the IoT devices, user generated data
    can be a key player in transforming the traditional food supply chain to be more
    farmer friendly [115,117]. This can be realized from the fact, that if market
    rates along with the demand are made available to the farmer in real-time, he
    can make apt decision regarding the selling of the food products. This will save
    the time and effort of the farmer which would otherwise be invested in visiting
    different markets in person. This will also benefit the farmers in terms of profit
    by recommending the most favorable market for his products. The work proposed
    in this paper provides a base architecture for facilitating the incorporation
    of social dimension to the IoT based solutions for agriculture. The proposed work
    further proposes a conceptual framework for smart devices that can be used for
    leveraging the social aspects of the humans. The focal point of most of the existing
    works in the literature is limited to only certain aspects of the agricultural
    process. They either focus upon the real-time monitoring of the fields and crops
    along with the provision of providing quality control methods or they attempt
    to optimize the food supply chain component of the agricultural process. The work
    proposed in this paper, however, considers the agricultural process as a conglomerate
    of field and crop monitoring, food supply chain, transportations and logistics
    as well as optimized service recommendations. This research also in line with
    the previous works that suggest for a comprehensive conceptualization of spanning
    sustainability, perceived value and knowledge creation [79] in contrast to conceptualization
    of the perceived value as an indicator of only overall products benefits and value
    for money [80,81]. The proposed work also provides a conceptual framework for
    smart devices that can be utilized by the application developers for building
    socially aware IoT based solutions. Multiple use-case descriptions have been provided
    for demonstrating the applicability and efficiency of the proposed work. The employment
    of intelligent methodologies for optimized service recommendations in the proposed
    architecture shall, further, guide to researchers to develop more smart algorithms
    relevant to the agricultural domain. The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
    Section 2 provides the highlights of the related works present in the existing
    literature; Section 3 discusses the proposed work in detail outlining the analogy
    between the proposed architecture and the IoT ecosystem and providing a detailed
    description of the proposed system; Section 4 presents few uses cases encompassing
    the different aspects of the agricultural process; and finally, Section 5; concludes
    the paper and provides research directions to further improve the work proposed
    in this paper. 2. Related works The employment of technologies in the agriculture
    practices has been attributed to the Green Revolution in Mexico in the 1940s that
    catalyzed the increased use of high-yielding crop cultivars and inputs such as
    fertilizer and irrigation for meeting the rising demands of food [82]. There exists
    multitude of works in the literature that attempt to identify the potential factors
    of affecting the technology adoption in agriculture [[83], [84], [85], [86], [87],
    [88], [89]]. The identified factors can be summarized as: farm size, land tenure
    arrangements, access to credit and extension services, land and labour availability,
    human capital (education, gender, demographics), and farmer attitude towards risks
    and uncertainty. Results of few empirical studies [90,91] underscore the potential
    of improved agricultural technologies in enhancing productivity, income, and overall
    economic growth. The advancement in the sensing technology coupled with the reduction
    in the size of the devices as well as their cost can be considered as the most
    significant enablers of precision and micro-precision agriculture [10]. Several
    researchers have proposed different types of IoT based solutions to address the
    issues in the existing agricultural practice [11]. The ability to sense and analyze
    the production environment is critical for making precise decisions in order to
    optimize the agricultural practices so as to enhance the cultivars’ quality [12,108].
    The application of WSN techniques in the farming domain is proposed in [92]. The
    authors present a comprehensive study regarding the applicability of WSN in agriculture
    along with the various associated challenges. The authors in [13] proposed a fault
    tolerant and energy efficient WSN architecture for real time monitoring of the
    agricultural field conditions and for enhancing the crop quality and yield. The
    authors in [93] propose the employment of Photosynthetically Active Radiation
    (PAR) sensors fo non-destructive in-situ Leaf Area Index (LAI) assessment. Multiple
    researchers have proposed intelligent systems for greenhouse environment monitoring
    to reduce farming cost and energy consumptions [[14], [15], [16]]. Their proposed
    architectures encompassed wireless based remote intelligence for greenhouse control
    as an alternative to the traditional wired infrastructure. The authors in [15,17]
    proposed WSN based automated irrigation systems. The crux of their works is to
    determine the apt frequency and time of watering the fields depending upon the
    soil moisture conditions. This ensures efficient use of water and high quality
    crops. In order to address the energy consumption issue in the deployed systems,
    the low power Zigbee protocol is employed for communication. The applicability
    of the IoT concepts for controlled environment agriculture has also been explored
    in several works such as [[18], [19], [20], [21], [22]]. The authors in [94] proposed
    a framework for remotely monitoring the crops using wireless and internet communication.
    The main aim of their work is to emphasize upon the advantages of cultivating
    plants in a greenhouse instead of open fields. Several IoT based commercial platforms
    have been developed with the vision of modernizing and enhancing the effectiveness
    of farming process. These platforms have been summarized in Table 2. Table 2.

    activities and crops health status The IoT based solutions rely upon the data
    obtained from the end nodes (sensors/actuators) which needs to be analyzed in
    real-time. Storing such data locally and then transmitting it to the remote servers
    for analysis involves appreciable amount of time and the analysis and actuations
    may be delayed. To overcome such issues the authors in [[23], [24], [25]] proposed
    the use of cloud based infrastructure for real-time analysis of the collected
    data in a reliable, faster and efficient manner. The use of cloud infrastructure
    also reduces the storage cost at the local level. The benefits of using cloud
    computing techniques in conjunction with IoT for agriculture process is presented
    in [95]. The authors in [96,97] highlights the significance of precision farming
    systems. The study of authors in [97] attempts to identify the adoption aspects
    of precision farming constrained to various factors and farmers demographics.
    The obtained results clearly indicate the potential of the identified factors
    in increasing the rate of precision agriculture adoption by the farmers. A system
    for online precise irrigation scheduling (OpIRIS) for greenhouses is proposed
    in [26]. The proposed system includes a web-based application that communicates
    with the sensors installed in the greenhouses. The web application embeds intelligence
    for predicting the water requirements of the crops and providing information to
    the farmers regarding the irrigation and further nutritional requirements. The
    author in [27] used RFID devices in conjunction with the IoT and cloud infrastructure
    for load balancing and distributing the resources dynamically. The obtained results
    demonstrates significant improvement in the efficient use of resources. Balducci
    et al. in [98] focused upon the management of heterogeneous data obtained from
    multiple sensory sources. Their study also presented the potential profitability
    aspects of logging and exploiting the continuously generated dataset for achieving
    subjective goals. The authors specify the use of Regression Models and Neural
    Networks for data handling and decision making. The use of smartphones for obtaining
    various types of agricultural information is proposed in [99]. The authors also
    proposed the demonstration of advanced agricultural techniques through videos
    in order to create awareness with respect to the adoption of Precision Agriculture.
    IoT technology has the potential to become a key player in realizing the food
    supply chain traceability systems. Various issues pertaining to the food supply
    chain and their resolution using IoT has been discussed extensively in existing
    literature [28,29]. The most commonly used IoT device in food supply chain is
    the RFID which are enhanced barcodes and can be used for tracing the tracking
    the agricultural logistics. The contemporary researches have employed multiple
    sensors to augment the product status information recorded through the RFID [30,31].
    Owing to the heterogeneity and distributed architecture of the IoT, naming has
    been considered as an important aspect for real-time tracking of the food supply
    logistics [32]. The authors in [100] presented a framework for highlighting the
    technological drivers of IoT. They further proposed a methodology that employs
    IoT for facilitating the farmers to deliver the crops directly to the nearby customers.
    Virtualizing the food supply chains using the IoT concepts eradicates the need
    of physical proximity [11]. The amalgamation of advanced hardware technology and
    intelligent software agents has contributed a lot in the development of automated
    food supply chain management systems [[33], [34], [35], [36], [37]]. 3. Proposed
    methodolgy This section presents a detailed description of the proposed solution.
    The complete solution has been discussed in two parts: (i) First, an analogy of
    the solution with respect to the IoT topology has been provided, and (ii) Second,
    a detailed description of the proposed framework for achieving the required functionality
    has been discussed. A summarized view of the involved entities and the communication
    between them is provided in the latter part of this section. 3.1. Analogy of the
    proposed solution with the IoT ecosystem The complete IoT ecosystem has been divided
    into three main components viz. (i) Perception Layer, (ii) Communication Layer,
    and (iii) Intelligence or Control Layer [38]. Fig. 2 shows an overview of the
    IoT ecosystem with respect to these layers. The components of the proposed solution
    comprising each of these layers have been discussed in detail in following sub-sections.

    Fig. 2. IoT Ecosystem – Layered Representation. 3.1.1. Perception layer The Perception
    Layer is mainly responsible for acquiring data from the environment with the help
    of sensors. However, information gathering in the IoT ecosystem cannot be restricted
    to only sensory data. Users are an indispensable entity of the IoT ecosystem and
    are a rich source of data generation. Such data may correspond to either textual
    or graphical posts on the social media or even sharing of information such as
    user’s location in an explicit or implicit manner. The concept of the perception
    layer, hence, can be further extended to the data acquisition from the users through
    their smart devices, such as smartphones, smartwatches, etc. This work classifies
    the data gathering mechanisms into two broad categories depending upon the data
    source: (i) sensory data; (ii) user data. This section discusses the various types
    of information that can be obtained through various entities of the IoT Ecosystem.
    3.1.1.1. Sensory data Data obtained using sensors is termed as sensory data. Sensors
    are tiny electro-mechanical devices and can be used for obtaining information
    regarding: • Field and Weather Conditions: The quality of the crops depends mainly
    upon the soil and the atmospheric conditions in which they are being cultivated.
    The knowledge about the soil nutrients, moisture content, density of weeds and
    other factors responsible for the production of crops can help in reducing the
    use of chemical products such as herbicides, pesticides and other pollutants thereby
    reducing the environmental impact and increasing the productivity. Such type of
    information can be obtained using appropriate sensors such as meteorological sensors,
    photometric sensors, water sensors, dendrometers, biological sensors, weed seekers,
    Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), optical cameras, photosynthesis sensors,
    soil respiration or moisture sensors, hygrometers, Leaf Area index (LAI) sensors,
    etc. [39]. Sensors are resource constrained and low power devices that collect
    data from the surroundings. Data collected by these sensors is transmitted to
    a local gateway or coordinator which in turn would forward the data to cloud or
    other data centers for analysis and other services that need to be provided. •
    Logistics tracing and tracking: Another important aspect that can be addressed
    using sensors is that of logistics tracing and tracking. Logistics refer to the
    commercial activity of transporting goods to the customer and is a vital component
    of the food supply chain. The traceability of logistics is classified into three
    main categories: viz. linear, centralized and distributed [40,41]. The linear
    approach involves the sharing of the traceability data among the partners involved
    in the logistics transportation process. Every user involved in the supply chain
    captures the traceability information of the immediate buyer and supplier for
    each product. European General Food Law identifies this process as the “one step
    forward and one step back” principle [42]. The centralized approach for logistics
    tracing involves the use of shared databases for storing the traceability data.
    The national bovine animal registration systems in Europe [42] follows this centralized
    approach. The distributed approach requires the involved users to exchange the
    traceability data throughout the network of interconnected individual traceability
    systems. Information regarding the transport of raw materials from suppliers to
    the farmers, crops and pre-processed food items from farming fields to distribution
    centres and to the customer can be made available using the technology offered
    by the IoT paradigm. The “Electronic Product Code Information Services” (EPCIS)
    standard is used extensively in the food supply chain for implementing the distributed
    traceability systems [40,41,[43], [44], [45]]. The tracking systems based on EPCIS
    record the events of supply chain network and store them in either single or multiple
    repositories. These events can be retrieved upon requirement based on appropriate
    security policy [41,46]. The contents of these events comprise of product identity,
    the reason and the location of occurrence along with the timestamp. Such events
    are usually generated using AutoID technologies, such as RFID, bar codes, Optical
    Character Recognition (OCR), smart cards, etc. [47]. The architecture of the proposed
    solution employs a distributed approach for tracing and tracking mechanism. Vehicles
    used for transportation or the transported goods themselves may carry RFID and
    other devices for providing real-time information regarding the logistics. Tracing
    the logistics through user shared information is another aspect of the proposed
    system. 3.1.1.2. User data Users are an important component of the IoT ecosystem.
    Apart from the sensors, users themselves are an important source of information
    that can be utilized to enhance the quality of service being provided by the IoT
    based solution. These users have their social circles (professional and personal)
    that can be leveraged for efficient delivery of services. The addition of this
    social dimension to the IoT ecosystem allows for collaborative sharing of user
    data. The proposed system comprises of five major entities namely: (i) Supplier,
    (ii) Farmer, (iii) Transporter, (iv) Distribution Centres, and (v) Consumers.
    Information shared by each of these entities can be utilized to provide them with
    value added services using the proposed solution. • Information sharing by suppliers:
    The food supply chain initiates with the suppliers providing the necessary materials
    (fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, etc.) required by the farmers for growing crops.
    The suppliers can, as such, share information regarding the type of the products
    they are selling along with their estimated costs. This would help the farmers
    in identifying the suitable supplier for their requirements in less time. Moreover,
    even if the suppliers do not wish share the quotes publicly for the materials
    being sold, they may share their contact details which would help the farmers
    to connect with them for their enquiries in minimum time. • Information sharing
    by farmers: The type and quantity of the produced crop can be shared by the farmers
    so that intelligent recommendations may be shown to the consumers as per their
    requirements (discussed in Section 3.1.3). The availability of data such as field
    size along with the other sensory data corresponding to the field quality can
    be utilized for providing predictions regarding the types of the crops that can
    be sown and other measures required for ensuring the quality of the crops being
    produced. • Information sharing by consumers/distribution centres: Distribution
    centres and consumers may share their demands in terms of required quantity of
    the products, location of delivery, delivery deadlines, etc. Real-time availability
    of such information would benefit the farmers in deciding the distribution centre
    and consumer to whom they may sell their products. The consumers can share their
    contact details so that in case the farmer is capable of supplying the required
    goods may contact directly to the consumer, thereby eliminating the need of the
    intermediaries and getting apt prices for their products. • Information sharing
    by transporters: Transporters are indispensable part of the food supply chain
    as they are responsible for carrying the required products to the destination.
    Transportation incurs significant cost and as a result, adds to the final cost
    of the product being sold. Further, the availability of the transporters offering
    logistic services is in abundance and the rates charged by them vary among different
    transporters. Hence, it is required that the farmers or the shipment consignee
    must survey multiple transporter before selecting any. Manual survey in such cases
    becomes infeasible as it requires a lot of time and effort. As an alternative,
    the transporters can share the information regarding the services they are offering
    along with the rates being charged through electronic means so as to facilitate
    the farmers in selecting the best choice. • Location information: The information
    shared by all the user entities must be augmented with the location information
    for uninterrupted services. For instance: data shared by the farmers should include
    the location of the site/field from where the goods need to be picked. Similarly,
    consumer should provide the location of the site where the goods need to be delivered.
    Moreover, the locations of different distribution centres can help the farmers
    to decide where to sell their goods considering the distance of the distribution
    centre, cost incurred in transportation, demand quantity of goods and the rates
    being provided. Such location information can be manually shared by the concerned
    entities or can be obtained using GPS of their smart phones. Table 3 summarizes
    the various types of information obtained by the perception layer along with their
    source. Table 3. Information obtained in Perception Layer. Information Type Source

    service 3.1.2. Communication layer This layer is mainly responsible for transmitting
    the data in the IoT network and mainly deals with the protocols that need to be
    employed for local as well as global communication. The proposed solution classifies
    the communication layer into (i) Physical Communication layer, and (ii) Virtual
    Communication sub-layer. The role and responsibilities of these sublayers are
    discussed further in this section. 3.1.2.1. Physical communication sub-layer This
    sub-layer is concerned with the underlying protocols required to transmit the
    data from various sources across the IoT network. As discussed in Section 3.1.1,
    data obtained in perception layer comprises of sensory data and user data. User
    data can be shared using smartphones that are rich in computational power and
    energy and hence legacy protocols for the wireless networks can be employed for
    transmitting such type of data. The application layer data can be shared using
    suitable protocols such as REST, HTTP, etc. Sensors, in contrast, are resource
    constrained and low power devices. Protocols such as Zigbee, Bluetooth Low Energy,
    etc. that have been designed for such devices operating in a Personal Area Network
    (PAN) can be used for sharing data generated by these devices. Table 4 presents
    a highlight of the protocols for IoT based communication. Table 4. Protocols for

    devices; (i) Reduced Functional Device (RFD), and (ii) Fully Functional Device

    can play the role of Coordinator that is responsible for starting and managing
    the personal area network. FFDs may also be used as routers to extend the range
    of the personal area networks. Data collected by the end devices are sent to the
    coordinator via a router. The coordinator further transmits the data to a gateway
    device that is responsible for computation, analysis and further transmission
    of the data to the cloud. Computation and data analysis can be performed at a
    local level (Coordinator/Gateway) or at remote site or cloud. Fig. 3 represents
    the communication topology of the proposed solution. Download : Download high-res

    for the Proposed Architecture. 3.1.2.2. Virtual communication sub-layer The virtual
    communication sub-layer acts as an overlay network superimposed over the physical
    network. This implies that even though the users may think that they are directly
    connected to a remote user (virtual connection), however, in practice the communication
    between these two users may involve multiple routers, switches and other network
    components. The virtual connection between the different entities involved in
    the proposed system is shown in Fig. 4. For simplicity, the figure omits the networking
    details and focusses mainly upon the communicating entities. Download : Download

    between the IoT entities. Data from the sensors can be processed locally at the
    gateway or remotely at the cloud or remote data centres. This data is required
    to provide intelligent services and notifications to the users. Information shared
    by the suppliers is stored on the cloud and is used for recommending the most
    suitable supplier to farmers depending upon their requirements. Similarly, depending
    upon the customer demands or distribution centres requirements and quotes, intelligent
    notifications and recommendation services can be provided to the farmers. The
    location information of the customers and distribution centres can be used to
    provide suggestions regarding the shortest route available to them. These services
    have been discussed in detail in Section 4. 3.1.3. Intelligence layer This is
    the most vital layer and is responsible for providing intelligent services to
    the users based upon the data acquired in the Perception Layer and transmitted
    in the Communication Layer. Intelligence capability can be embedded at local or
    global level. The proposed solution is capable of delivering a number of intelligent
    services to the users in the context of agriculture and food supply chain. The
    services provided by the proposed architecture has been discussed below: • Crop
    Prediction: Data regarding the quality of the farming fields such assoil nutrients,
    moisture content, density of weeds, etc. along with the weather conditions is
    used for predicting the type of the crops that can be sown. Prediction can be
    further enhanced by incorporating the details of the requirements of the market.
    For instance, if the demand for a particular type of food product is high and
    if the agricultural fields has the potential to grow good quality of the required
    product, the predictions can recommend that particular product to the farmer with
    high priority. Further, real-time data regarding the status of crops can be utilized
    to develop predictions regarding the time of harvesting as well. • Real-time monitoring
    of agricultural fields: Sensors fixed at predefined locations at the fields, unmanned
    arial vehicles UAVs such drones mounted with sensors or even sensor mounted vehicles
    are capable of providing the real time information about the field conditions.
    For instance, flame sensors can be placed to issue warning message to the farmers
    if fire is detected. An accompanying mounted camera can also click a picture of
    the situation when fire was detected. The warning messages should be sent to the
    smartphones of the farmers so that the necessary measures can be taken to avoid
    the impact of the adverse conditions. Farmers can also receive the real-time data
    about the conditions of their crops and agricultural fields so as to prevent unwanted
    pests hampering the quality of the crops. • Intelligent Recommendation Services:
    These services refer to the intelligent recommendations as per the requirements
    of the user. For instance, data shared by the suppliers can be used to recommend
    the most apt choice to the farmer as per their requirements. Similarly, manually
    visiting the distribution centres is not feasible for the farmers due to a number
    of reasons. One of the prominent being non-standardized rates of the goods offered
    by the distribution centres. Farmers are usually unware of the rates fixed for
    each type of the crops and as such there is a chance that the farmer gets cheated
    by the people at distribution centre. Moreover, different distribution centres
    provide different rates for the same product. Another important factor that prevents
    the farmers from visiting different distribution centres is their distance. Farmers,
    usually, reside in rural areas while the distribution centres are in the cities.
    Manually visiting each distribution centres would require considerable amount
    of time, effort and money. Hence, online availability of such information would
    facilitate the farmers to select the most appropriate distribution centre for
    selling their good. The use of intelligent algorithms that consider factors such
    as demand, cost, distance, etc., to suggest the most suitable choice to the users
    further helps in saving the decision-making efforts of the farmers. The end consumers
    can also be provided with appropriate recommendations for procuring the goods
    directly from the farmers. Depending upon the required quantity and type of the
    products by the consumer, algorithms can be employed to mine and filter suitable
    farmers that are willing to sell their goods. This is made possible due to the
    information shared by the farmers about their crops and locations. Upon selecting
    a suitable choice the consumer can directly contact the farmer using the contact
    details provided by them. • Shortest Route Prediction: Considering that the location
    of the destination is available different mechanisms can be employed to suggest
    the shortest route to users for delivering the goods. Such mechanism may include
    use of web APIs such as Google Maps [49], Distance Calculator [50], GeoDataSource
    [51] and others. • Logistics Tracing and Tracking: Tracing and tracking services
    for the transported goods is an essential mechanism. Vehicles and goods equipped
    with RFID sensors can provide real time location information. This information
    is made available to the dispatcher and other stakeholders on demand. The proposed
    solution also provides the mechanism for implicit sharing of location using smartphones
    or other GPS embedded devices mounted on the goods or vehicles. 3.2. Proposed
    system model This section discusses the proposed framework for smart devices to
    realize the intelligent services for the agriculture practice. Fig. 5 provides
    a detailed overview of the proposed framework. The proposed framework can be utilized
    by the application developers for designing applications pertaining to specific
    use cases. The proposed framework allows the developers to leverage the functionalities
    required for achieving the concept of smart architecture. The different components
    of the framework have been discussed below: • User Profile Manager: This module
    is responsible for maintaining the user profile information, such as name, contact
    details, user location, and so on. The information is stored in the User profile
    database and is retrieved during recommendation services. • Contact List Manager:
    Contact list management refers to the addition of new contacts and updation or
    deletion of the existing contacts. The module offers the functionality similar
    to the contact management in smart mobile phones. Data entered through this module
    is stored in Phonebook database. • Contact Group Manager: This module is responsible
    for grouping the contacts as per the user preference. For instance, all the contacts
    of different logistic operators may be clubbed into one group. This would facilitate
    the information dissemination to the required group as per the user’s requirement.
    For instance, if the farmer wishes to hire a transport vehicle for the delivery
    of food product, he can upload his requirements on the mobile application which
    would in turn send this data as notifications to all the logistic operators existing
    in the group. • User Data Requirements Module: This serves as an interface to
    add the user requirements which would eventually be either uploaded on cloud portal
    or sent to specific users or groups. Adding a requirement may include the group
    name to which the user wants to send the information. The user can also specify
    the requirements as public indicating that the requirements will be published
    on the cloud portal from where every user can view the published information.
    This data is also saved in the User Requirements database for a specified period
    of time. • Notifications Module: This is unified module for displaying the notifications
    received on the mobile application. Notifications can be classified into different
    categories, such as (i) Field Conditions: Data received from sensors deployed
    in the agricultural field; (ii) Requirement Notifications: Information regarding
    the market demand or the demand of the consumers; and (iii) Recommendations: Suggestions
    obtained from the intelligent recommendation module. • Intelligent Recommendation
    Module: This serves as the intelligence core for the proposed framework. The intelligent
    services discussed in Section 3.1.3 is realized through this module. The module
    is responsible for providing intelligent recommendation so as to facilitate the
    decision making process of the users, such as the best option for selling the
    produced crops, or suggestion regarding improving the field quality in terms of
    nutrients or moisture, etc. The module interacts with the notification module
    for retrieving real time requirements received on the mobile applications and
    provides suggestions to the users as per the requirements. • Network Interface:
    This serves as an interface to the network and is responsible for the transmission
    and reception of the messages to and fro the network. • Cloud Portal: The cloud
    portal refers to a web-based application portal for storing the various types
    of data submitted by the user. Any information published on the cloud portal can
    be either for public or specific users. Users can synchronize their mobile application
    to fetch the latest requirements posted by the distribution centres in the market
    regarding the cost of the products and their demand or the customers regarding
    their requirements. Real-time rates and the product demand in the market can be
    obtained from this portal and can be used to provide intelligent recommendations
    to the user. Download : Download high-res image (406KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. Proposed Framework. 4. Use-cases description The concept of social
    network of things can benefit the stakeholders in a number of ways. This section
    discusses the various scenarios where the proposed concept can facilitate the
    users in terms of effort and time. The scenarios discussed in this section covers
    the different aspects of agriculture ranging from procurement of raw products
    from the supplier to the selling of the agriculture product to the customers.
    4.1. Use Case 1: procuring raw materials from the farmers The initial stage of
    farming starts with the decision of the type of crops that can be grown and the
    materials required for good quality crops. Decision regarding the type of crops
    to be grown depends upon a number of factors including the climatic and field
    conditions, demand of the crop in the market, etc. The sensors installed in the
    fields acquire different types of information regarding the field conditions,
    the weather conditions can be obtained by either using sensors or the third party
    services. This information is aggregated by the coordinators and transmitted through
    the gateway to both the service running on the cloud as well as to the smartphones
    of the farmers. The Notification Module is responsible for displaying the received
    information as notifications on the smartphones. The demand of various crops in
    the market is availed from the information shared the distribution centres and
    stored in the repository residing on cloud. The Intelligent Recommendation Module
    uses relevant algorithms for data aggregation and service composition for recommending
    the type of the product most suited as per the conditions. This information is
    directly made available to the farmers through the Notification Module of the
    proposed framework. The recommendation algorithms can either be executed on the
    cloud or on the users’ smartphone. Once the type of crop has been decided, the
    next stage is to procure different materials required for growing the crop. This
    includes seeds, fertilizers, etc. A farmer can upload his requirements regarding
    the material type and the quantity required on his mobile application using the
    User Data Requirements Module. This information is shared among the different
    raw material suppliers and they are presented with an option to quote their rates.
    The quoted rates are displayed on the farmer’s smartphone application through
    the Notification Module. The farmer can then select the most suitable supplier
    as per his preference and contact him using the details shared by the raw material
    supplier. This would not only save the farmer’s time and effort for procuring
    the material but would also enable them to get the best rates for the procured
    goods. 4.2. Use case 2: farmer and customer Getting directly in touch with the
    end customer can be a boon for the farmers since the cost incurred by the intermediaries
    will be avoided leading to an overall increase in the farmer as well as customer
    benefits. Fig. 6 shows the information exchange between the farmers’ and the customer’s
    smart device. Initially, consider Farmer 1 made a transaction with a Customer
    XYZ. Upon successful transaction, the information of the Customer XYZ is added
    to the contact list maintained in Farmer 1′s smartphone using the Contact List
    Manager module. Similarly, upon interacting with different farmers, the information
    of the Customer XYZ is stored in all the corresponding farmer’s smartphone device.
    All the customers whose details are stored in the farmers’ mobile application
    is grouped under the Costumer Tag using the Contact Group Manager. Similarly,
    when a customer saves the information of different famers in his mobile application
    they will be grouped under the Farmer Tag by the Contact Group Manager. In future,
    if the Customer XYZ decides to purchase agricultural goods, he may upload the
    requirements along with other details in the application installed in his smartphone
    device using the User Data Requirements Module. This information regarding the
    requirements of the customer is used by the Intelligent Recommendation Module
    for providing the list of potential farmers capable of supplying the required
    product. The module shall fetch the details of farmers stored under the Farmer
    Tag from the Contact Group Manager. The application will then mine the relevant
    farmers capable of supplying the required goods and those farmers existing in
    the contact list of the customer shall receive a notification on their mobile
    application through the Notifications Module informing them about the requirements
    of the Customer XYZ. Fig. 6 shows an instance of the scenario where Farmer 1 and
    Farmer 2 receive the notification about the Customer XYZ requirements and are
    provided with an option to quote their rates. When the farmers quote their corresponding
    rates for the required goods using the Submit Requirement Notification Response
    module, Customer XYZ can view the rates quoted by the different famers on his
    mobile application. The customer can then manually select a farmer to view his
    details, and can contact him directly for further confirmations. If the farmer
    agrees to supply the required products, he needs to confirm the deal on his mobile
    application portal after which the customer will receive a success acknowledgement
    of the transaction, as shown in Fig. 6. This would allow the farmer to sell their
    products directly to customer without going through the distribution centres.
    This would also allow the customer to get goods at cheaper price than the retailer
    rates. Download : Download high-res image (406KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Farmer-Customer interaction using the proposed framework. 4.3. Use
    case 3: farmer and logistics operator Once the farmer has finalized the deal with
    the customer, he needs to transport the goods to the customer. The transport facility
    can be arranged by the customer as well as the farmer depending upon the terms
    agreed in the deal. Fig. 7 depicts the scenario where the transportation is arranged
    by the farmers themselves. As in case with the customers, the farmers can have
    a separate group for storing the contact details of various logistic operators
    using Contact List Manager and Contact Group Manager. A farmer uploads his requirements
    regarding the quantity of the goods that need to be transported along with the
    location details and the date by which the goods should reach the designated locations.
    Different logistic operators receive the notification about the requirements of
    the farmer through Notifications Module and they are required to quote their rates
    using Submit Requirement Notification Response module of the proposed framework.
    The Notifications Module on the farmer’s mobile application displays the rates
    quoted by different logistics operators. He may then select the most suitable
    operator and can contact him using the contact details uploaded by the logistics
    operator in the User Profile Manage component of the framework. Upon successful
    confirmation of the logistics operator, the operator sends the details of the
    vehicle to be used for transportation as well as that of the driver responsible
    for transporting the goods. The contact details of the farmer and the customer
    is sent to the driver as well. The application will automatically add the driver’s
    information in the friends list of the farmer and the farmer’s information in
    the friends list of the driver. When the driver starts from the source location,
    the real time location sharing of the vehicle will be automatically turned on
    and the farmer can receive the location information the transported goods. When
    the consignment is received by the customer the real time location sharing of
    the vehicle is automatically turned off for the stakeholders involved in this
    transaction. This application of the social network of thigs concept clearly eliminates
    the requirement of having extra RFIDs or other sensors installed on the vehicles
    for location tracking. The concept of location sharing is applicable between the
    customer and the vehicle driver as well. This implies that the customer will also
    receive the real time location of the transported goods. Download : Download high-res

    interaction using the proposed framework. 4.4. Use case 4: intelligent recommendations
    The agricultural product, once harvested, is sold in the market for the consumption
    by the customers. This process, in its current state, involves multiple entities.
    For instance, the farmer sells the goods to the local broker who will arrange
    for the transportation and will sell the goods to the distribution centre. These
    distribution centers quote rates for the products as per the demand in the market.
    The standard rates of the goods are not available with the farmers. This allows
    the local brokers to purchase the goods from the farmers at a meagre expense and
    they sell the same goods at higher price to the distribution centers. It is also
    not feasible for the farmer to manually visit the different distribution centres
    to sell their goods, since these distribution centres are located in urban areas
    far from the farmer’s field. The proposed system is capable of recommending various
    services to user as per the requirement. An important application of the proposed
    solution is to facilitate the farmers to sell their goods directly at these distribution
    centres. A farmer is required to upload the product information such as crop type,
    crop quantity, etc. which he wants to sell at the distribution centre using the
    User Data Requirements Module. The Intelligent Recommendation Module of the proposed
    framework will capture the location of different distribution centres, demand
    of the agricultural goods and their quoted rates. This data can be then used to
    recommend the most suitable distribution centre to the farmer where he can sell
    his goods. The location information adds one more level of intelligence to the
    recommendation service by suggesting the most apt distribution centre in terms
    of cost as well as the distance of the distribution centre from the farmer’s location.
    Once the farmer finalizes the distribution centre, live traffic conditions can
    be utilized to suggest the shortest route to the distribution centre. Fig. 8 shows
    an instance where Farmer 1 needs to sell crop type X at the distribution centre.
    The farmer uploads the crop type and the quantity to be sold. The Intelligent
    Recommendation Module searches and suggests the list of different distribution
    centre in the order of their suitability index. Once the farmer selects a particular
    distribution centre, the module recommends the shortest route to the distribution
    centre as per the live traffic conditions. Download : Download high-res image

    the farmer selects a particular distribution centre, the module recommends the
    shortest route to the distribution centre as per the live traffic conditions.
    5. Discussion There exists a plethora of research regarding the applicability
    of IoT based systems for improving the traditional agricultural practices. However,
    the work proposed in this paper is an improvement over the existing works since
    it does not only relies upon the sensory data for providing the services to the
    user but it also incorporates the user centric data in terms of requirements and
    preferences of the user. Moreover, the proposed work also attempts to incorporate
    a certain level of social relations of the users in order to provide the right
    information at right time and at right place. The social relation refers to the
    type of relations that a humans share with other humans in the professional or
    personal domain. The conceptual architecture and framework proposed in this paper
    for incorporating social dimension to the IoT ecosystem has wide scope of application
    in the agricultural domain. This can be inferred from the various use case descriptions
    provided in Section 4. This section further presents logical justifications for
    the proposed work. Consider a farmer who has to sell his produce in the market
    say 50 kg of food product and that the invested amount by the famer is Rs. 5000.
    In the current scenario, where multiple intermediaries are involved in the food
    supply chain, the farmer is tempted to sell this product to local broker at say
    Rs. 6000. The broker will arrange for the transport facility and will sell this
    product at the distribution centre at a higher price say Rs. 10,000. These distribution
    centres will further sell this product to the retailers at a price that will be
    higher than 10,000. For simplicity, let us consider the distributers sell the
    product at Rs 15,000. This makes the Rs 5000 food product worth of Rs 15,000,
    i.e. Rs 300 per kg which was initially produced in Rs 100 per kg. Moreover, the
    farmer gained only Rs 1000 by selling 50 kg of product, i.e. Rs 10 per kg even
    when the consumer is paying Rs 300 per kg of the same product. In this context,
    the proposed architecture shall help the farmer to maximize his profit while allowing
    the consumers to purchase the product at a reasonable cost. This can be attributed
    to the fact that the proposed architecture shall allow the consumers to purchase
    the products directly from the farmer. Obviously, the required amount of product
    that needs to be purchased cannot be too small, since it would be infeasible for
    the farmer to ship a small quantity of the product to the customer place at low
    price. However, if it is feasible for the consumer, he can directly visit the
    famer for collecting the product. The proposed architecture also enables the farmer
    to select the most appropriate distribution centre for selling their products
    without investing too much effort and time in the process. Consider a famer needs
    to sell 50 kg of product at the distribution centre which can be 50 kms from his
    place. The rate at which the farmer will sell its product will vary from one distribution
    centre to another. Let us consider that distribution centre A is 50 km from the
    famer’s place and is will to purchase the product at Rs 100 per kg while distribution
    centre B is 70 km from the farmer’s place but is expected to purchase the product
    at Rs 150 per kg. This problem further elevates when the number of distribution
    centres increase with each having different price and distance. The amount of
    effort and time that the farmer has to invest for visiting each of these distribution
    centre before he makes his decision regarding the choice of distribution centre
    where he can sell the product is very high. In this context, the proposed work
    in this paper shall facilitate the farmer to obtain this information without having
    the need to visit each centre individually. Moreover, the proposed work will also
    assist the farmer in selecting the best option since the intelligent algorithms
    shall provide the farmer with a list of distribution centres ranked according
    to the farmer preferences, i.e. whether he needs to maximize the cost or minimize
    the distance. Another important contribution of the proposed work is that it will
    provide the farmers with the real time assessment of the agricultural field conditions
    that will help him in maintain the quality of the field and eventually the quality
    of the grown crops. Moreover, this information can also be analyzed for recommending
    the farmers with the type of food products that he can grow as per the conditions
    of the field. The demand of the crops in the market shall allow the farmer to
    grow the right type and quantity of product in order to minimize the wastage and
    loss which would otherwise incur if the products are in excess than the demand.
    6. Conclusions and future works The exponential rise in the global population
    has created an increased demand for the quantity as well as quality of the food
    products. This demand can be catered by modernizing the agricultural sector. IoT
    has the potential to optimize the traditional agricultural practices. The conjunction
    of smart devices with the intelligent algorithms can be a boon to the farmers.
    This paper proposes an IoT architecture for adding the smartness component to
    the agricultural sector. The proposed architecture relies upon the data obtained
    from the end devices comprising of not only sensors/actuators but also the farmers
    and other personnel involved in the agricultural process. Information regarding
    the quality of the agricultural fields is helpful for growing good quality crops.
    The architecture proposed in this paper provides real time monitoring of the agricultural
    fields so as to facilitate the farmers to supply the required nutrients to the
    crops in a timely manner. User generated data comprising of product demand and
    cost helps the farmers as well as consumers to obtain good quality products at
    optimal rates. The proposed architecture also takes care of the real-time tracing
    and tracking of the food supply logistics. The data being shared by the different
    entities involved in the proposed system can be collaborated to provided critical
    and value added recommendations for enhancing the efficiency of the agricultural
    practices. The discussed use cases clearly depicts the applicability of the proposed
    architecture in the various agricultural process scenario. However there are certain
    limitations of the work presented in this paper that needs to be addressed for
    enhancing the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. The architecture proposed
    in this paper relies upon the user generated data and as such storage of these
    large volumes of data is a key concern. Moreover, intelligent algorithms for searching
    relevant information in the IoT needs to be designed in order to minimize the
    delivery time of the services. Other aspects of the proposed architecture that
    require critical attention is that that security, privacy and trust management.
    This can be attributed to the fact that smart devices such as smart phones owned
    by the users are the storehouses of multiple types of personal and important information.
    These devices are assumed to work autonomously in the proposed architecture and
    hence are vulnerable to various types of security attacks. Further, the trust
    credentials of the shared information is also a significant concern since false
    information can misguide the users and reduce the efficiency of the recommendation
    services. Moreover, the heterogeneity of the devices in the IoT ecosystem needs
    to be addressed in order to ensure interoperability between the devices. References

  explanation: In this paper, the authors examine four capabilities of the IoT and
    their contributions to addressing the 6 Rs of the circular economy (CE) in the
    context of six CBM. They define IoT capabilities as tracking, monitoring, optimization,
    and design evolution, and propose a relationship framework connecting these capabilities
    with the 6 Rs and the ReSOLVE concept. Their analysis reveals significant contributions
    of the IoT to CE, particularly in the Loop and Optimize models, where tracking,
    monitoring, and optimization capabilities play a crucial role in enhancing resource
    utilization, recycling, and reducing waste. Moreover, they identify environmental
    drawbacks and other obstacles to the full utilization of the IoT, such as energy
    consumption, data security, and lack of standardization. Overall, the study highlights
    the potential of the IoT to support CE practices and drive improvements in resource
    efficiency and sustainability.
  extract_1: The monitoring plays a significant role, which promotes most circular
    business models by jointly facilitating all 6Rs, followed by the optimization
    capability, and for the intermediate nodes of 6 R actions, Recycle, and Redesign
    are the core CE principles linking upstream IoT capabilities and downstream circular
    strategies.
  extract_2: Most of the references discuss conceptual frameworks, models and theoretical
    evaluations, and just a few case studies. Most case studies only explore one or
    a few technical applications of IoT, these limits the value of meta-analyses as
    attempted in this paper.

    Under a Creative Commons license open access Highlights • A mapping framework
    is built connecting ReSOLVE with 4 IoT capabilities and 6Rs. • IoT-enabled tracking
    and monitoring capabilities dominates Loop model. • Optimize model is related
    to ‘Reduce’ by monitoring and optimization of IoT. • IoT provides virtual and
    dematerialized solutions, supporting ‘Redesign’ strategy. • IoT reduces the energy
    use of the Optimize and Loop business model with 20–30%. Abstract In recent years,
    circular business models (CBM) have become an inevitable requirement to foster
    improvements in environmental performance. However, the current literature rarely
    discusses the link between Internet of Things (IoT) and CBM. This paper first
    identifies four IoT capabilities including monitoring, tracking, optimization
    and design evolution for improving CBM performance based on the ReSOLVE framework.
    In a second step, a systematic literature review using the PRISMA approach analyzes
    how these capabilities contribute to 6 R and CBM through the CBM-6R and CBM-IoT
    cross-section heatmaps and relationship frameworks, followed by assessing the
    quantitative impacts of IoT on potential energy saving in CBM. Finally, challenges
    are analyzed for the realization of IoT-enabled CBM. The results show that the
    assessments of Loop and Optimize business models dominate current studies. IoT
    plays a significant role in these business models respectively through tracking,
    monitoring and optimization capabilities. While (quantitative) case studies for
    Virtualize, Exchange and Regenerate CBM are substantially needed. IoT holds the
    potential to reduce energy consumption by around 20–30% for referenced applications
    in the literature. However, the IoT hardware, software and protocol energy consumption,
    interoperability, security and financial investment might become main obstacles
    for the wider use of IoT in CBM. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    frameworkCircular business model 1. Introduction 1.1. Key concepts and a brief
    history of the IoT Since the birth of the internet in the early 1980s, attempts
    have been made to connect “Things” with the internet. In 1990, John Romkey created
    the first Internet ‘device’, a toaster that could be turned on and off via the
    Internet (Romkey, 2017). Paul Saffo gave the first brief description of sensors
    and how they could be used in connection with the internet in 1997 (Saffo, 1997).
    To describe this growing connection of sensors and similar devices providing real-time
    information via the internet, in 1999 the term “Internet of Things” was coined
    by Kevin Ashton, who was working in supply chain optimization and invented a new
    technology called Radio-frequency identification (RFID)-based item identification
    in the same year (Suresh et al., 2014). In 2003, Walmart deployed RFID in all
    its shops across the globe to measure product stocks and sales and support supply
    chain management (Harold, 2007). In 2005, International Telecommunication Union
    (ITU, 2005) regarded the IoT as a third wave of the world''s information industry
    transformation. In 2008, the Federal Communications Commission approved the usage
    of the “white space spectrum” (Suresh et al., 2014). Later, IT giants like Cisco,
    IBM and Ericsson took a lot of educational and commercial initiatives with IoT.
    Some countries, like China, listed the IoT as a strategic emerging technology
    in their long-term plans (MIIT, 2012). The IoT technology can be simply explained
    as a connection between humans - computers - things. It uses RFID, infrared sensors,
    global positioning systems, laser scanners and other information-sensing equipment
    to connect any item under internet protocol (IP) with a unique IP address for
    information exchange and communication, which can achieve intelligent positioning,
    tracking, monitoring and management of items. The systems architecture can, for
    instance, be based on the context of operations and processes in real-time scenarios.
    For instance, in a smart home, every electrical switch box could be connected
    with a smart phone so that it could be operated remotely. The HarmonyOS system
    recently created by Huawei uses full stack decoupling architecture that could
    even solve constraints issues on the boundary of software and hardware, thus making
    it possible for other collaborators to join the system (Chen and Matt, 2021).
    Altogether, the application boundary of the IoT has been expanded considerably.
    Such a scenario does not need a processor and a storage device installed in every
    switch box. It just needs a sensor to capture signals and process them (mostly
    switching ON/OFF). 1.2. Potentials by IoT technologies in CE in a finite world
    Avoiding overshooting of planetary boundaries for climate change (Rockström et
    al., 2009) and switching to more sustainable practices are among the greatest
    challenges of the 21st century. Any approach to reduce pressures requires simultaneous
    consideration of economic, social, and especially environmental aspects of industrial
    processes, as well as respective interactions along cradle-to-grave value chains
    of products and services (Ren et al., 2013). Important strategies to reduce critical
    raw material use are sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) and circular usage
    of products and materials (Manavalan and Jayakrishna, 2019). Seuring and Müller
    (2008) defined SSCM as “the management of material, information and capital flows
    as well as cooperation among companies along the supply chain, while taking goals
    from all three dimensions – environmental, economic and social into account which
    are derived from customer and stakeholder requirements.” Circularity adds a different
    perspective to SSCM as it tries to keep substances in closed loops. Unlike a linear
    economy that is based on a “take-make-dispose” model, CE promotes longevity, reparability,
    durability and recyclability of products with the aim of a full re-use of resources
    (Elisha, 2020). It therefore symbolizes a linear to loop transition for supply
    chains in sustainability (Schröder et al., 2019). In the industry 4.0 (I4.0) era,
    the IoT offers opportunities to foster CE in value chains through real-time monitoring
    of the resources inventory (Mohammadian, 2019). It can support the minimization
    of waste flows through product lifetime detection. As consequence material reuse
    and recycling processes can be optimized. In summary, IoT promotes a highly accurate,
    efficient and sound use of resources aimed at the shift from disposable to renewable
    resources paradigm, and facilitates the born and development of CBM (Ghisellini
    et al., 2016; Nižetić et al., 2020). Therefore, progress of IoT-enabled CBM has
    attracted academic researches, which have recently assessed the impact of I4.0
    technologies such as IoT on CBM with different conclusions (Rosa et al., 2019,
    2020). They discussed CBM and IoT from economic, social and environmental perspectives
    (Govindan and Hasanagic, 2018; Ding et al., 2023). Rejeb et al. (2022) reviewed
    how the IoT provides contributions and challenges in the CBM domain. They identified
    important drivers and provided a structured framework that exploring business
    and management-focused CE strategies based on IoT technologies. However, there
    is still a large gap between theory and practice (Gorissen et al., 2016). In particular,
    most small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are encountering unprecedented pressure
    to improve environmental performance. Since the adoption cost of the IoT could
    be tremendous, they might hesitate to seize IoT-enabled emission reduction opportunities
    based on their specific status (Ding et al., 2023; Awan et al., 2022a). This requires
    an in-depth understanding of the IoT capabilities and the characteristics of different
    CBMs to find their best intersection point. Besides, the circularity of IoT devices
    themselves should also be considered (Beier et al., 2018). Given these research
    gaps this paper addresses the following research questions. i) What are the (synergy)
    contributions of IoT capabilities under different CBM? ii) What are the carbon
    emission reduction potentials of the IoT in different CBM? iii) What are the obstacles
    for SMEs to adopt IoT in promoting circular strategies? The contributions of this
    paper are as follows: We used a pre-defined circular business framework (ReSOLVE)
    developed by Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF, 2015) to analyze the CBM-IoT context
    and linked it to 6 R principles to specifically map the IoT capabilities into
    each business practices. This visualizes how IoT contributes differently in each
    business model and provides information for us to describe the relationship between
    IoT capabilities, 6 R and CBM. Additionally, we quantitatively review the literature
    on how IoT can contribute to reducing environmental impacts under CBM and identify
    their obstacles. This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces the Prisma
    methodology we used as the method for the literature review, and the reasoning
    of paper selection. Section 3 reviews IoT''s role in CE, introduces the capabilities
    of IoT correlated with CBM and identifies its environmental opportunities. Section
    4 reflects on potential obstacles for IoT adjustment in CBM. Section 5 comprehensively
    summarizes our findings and concludes. Finally, section 6 outlines limitations
    and gives recommendations for future research. 2. Review approach: Prisma 2.1.
    Introduction of Prisma In June 2022, we conducted a literature search based on
    the checklist framework provided by the PRISMA-P guidelines (Moher et al., 2015).
    PRISMA was initially used in the medical field. Although other methods for conducting
    literature reviews and meta-analyses are available (Horvathova, 2012; Luederitz
    et al., 2016), PRISMA guidelines have become widely accepted as an approach to
    conduct transparent literature reviews. Recently they have been applied in the
    field of sustainability and CE research (Blanco et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2019;
    Zalk and Behrens, 2018; Aguilar-Hernandez et al., 2021). The latest PRISMA Abstract
    2020 (Page et al., 2021a, Page et al., 2021b) suggests discussing 5 main items
    in relation to 10 subcategories in a review. We refer to the checklist items listed
    in Table 1. Table 1. Major steps in Prisma Abstract 2020 (Page et al., 2021a,
    Page et al., 2021b). Section and Topic Item # Checklist item TITLE Title 1 Identify
    the report as a systematic review. BACKGROUND Objectives 2 Provide an explicit
    statement of the main objectives or questions. METHODS Eligibility criteria 3
    Specify the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the review. Information sources
    4 Specify the information sources (e.g., databases, search terms) used to identify
    studies. Risk of bias 5 Specify the methods used to assess risk of bias in the
    studies included. Synthesis of results 6 Specify the methods used to present and
    synthesize results. RESULTS Included studies 7 Give the total number of studies
    included and participants and summarize relevant characteristics of the studies.
    Synthesis of results 8 Present results for main outcomes, preferably indicating
    the number of studies included and participants for each. If a meta-analysis was
    carried out, report the summary estimate and confidence/credible interval. If
    comparing groups, indicate the direction of the effect (i.e., which group is favoured).
    DISCUSSION Limitations of evidence 9 Provide a brief summary of the limitations
    of the evidence included in the review (e.g., study risk of bias, inconsistency
    and imprecision). Interpretation 10 Provide a general interpretation of the results
    and important implications. These categories explain the search objectives and
    eligibility criteria, including the methods and reasons for including and excluding
    certain records (i.e. some papers do not contain the keywords checked for but
    have keywords with similar meanings, some papers contain the keywords but do not
    explain them in detail). Second, it describes the steps of the quantitative analysis,
    which includes collecting data from selected publications and harmonizing their
    values. Based on this framework, this literature review was conducted. 2.2. Classification
    of papers We use the 6 R concept (Joshi et al., 2006) to initially classify circularity
    strategies and related business models, as shown in Fig. 1. The 6 R concept discerns
    Reuse, Recycle, Reduce, Repair, Remanufacture and Redesign. Sihvonen and Ritola
    (2015) regarded the 6 R framework as the operational approaches and core principles
    of CE. Report of Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF, 2013) pointed out that discovering
    new paths to support CE under 6 R guidance – “an industrial system that is restorative
    or regenerative by intention and design” is becoming more and more vital against
    the background of Industrial 4.0 era. From a systems perspective, the combination
    of six operational approaches (6 R) enables new business models of CE at the macro
    level (Kirchherr et al., 2017). Download : Download high-res image (451KB) Download

    Based on these characteristics, the ReSOLVE framework further explains CE -- Preserve
    and enhance natural capital, optimize resource yields and foster system effectiveness,
    and classifies circular models based on the economic and resource impacts of major
    sectors (EMF, 2015). It offers a tool for generating circular strategies and growth
    initiatives. Jabbour et al. (2018) then connected Industry 4.0 technologies to
    six CBM proposed by the ReSOLVE framework, namely Regenerating, Share, Optimize,
    Loop, Virtualize and Exchange, to guide organizations through implementing the
    principles of the CE (EMF, 2015), as shown in Table 2. Most technologies own opportunities
    in specific areas, while the IoT can play a significant role to make such business
    models viable (Jabbour et al., 2018). Table 2. Explanation of six business models
    in ReSOLVE framework. Business models Explanation Regenerate This business model
    is based on a shift to renewable energy and materials. Biological cycles are used
    to enable the circulation of energy and materials, and to convert organic waste
    into sources of energy and raw material for other chains. Share Assets are shared
    between individuals (peer-to-peer sharing of privately owned products or public
    sharing of a pool of products). As a consequence, products should be designed
    to last longer by the producers, and maintenance should be available to allow
    the re-use and extension of product life. Optimize This business model requires
    organizations to use digital manufacturing technologies, such as IoT, automation,
    and big data to reduce waste in production systems across supply chains. As a
    result, organizations will benefit from increased performance. Loop This business
    model aims to promote the circularity of raw materials and energy. The design,
    production, and supply chain therefore have to be adjusted from the perspective
    of the entire life cycle. Virtualize This business model is service-focused which
    replaces physical with virtual and dematerialized products. Exchange It involves
    substituting old and non-renewable goods for advanced and renewable ones. While
    the exact terminology to describe IoT-related capabilities varies under different
    scenarios, we synthesized core capabilities of the technology as found in literature.
    Ingemarsdotter et al. (2019) suggests that IoT''s can support the development
    of circular business models via capabilities such as tracking, monitoring, control,
    optimization and design evolution, and stated that optimization often relies on
    the use of control capability. Therefore, we incorporated the control capability
    into optimization to reduce the list of relevant IoT capabilities to four, as
    shown in Table 3. Table 3. IoT capabilities that can support implementation of
    the ReSOLVE framework. IoT capabilities Definition of functions Tracking Available
    information for products'' identity, location, or unique composition. Monitoring
    Available information for products'' real-time condition, or environment. This
    includes alerts and notifications. Optimization Goal-based improvements of operations
    are controlled and optimized by using advanced algorithms. Design Evolution The
    design of a product can be upgraded based on data feedback from other lifecycle
    phases. This includes functional or routing upgrades. 2.2.1. Selection of papers
    On the basis of the discussion above, in order to systematically review the contribution
    of the IoT to circular economy business models, we used the following terms as
    a basis for the literature search in a Boolean operation -- Title, Abstract, Keyword
    = [“internet of things” AND (“circular economy” OR “circular business model” OR
    “sustainable supply chain”)]. In total, there were 432 papers available on Scopus
    and 142 papers available on Web of Science (WoS). We excluded duplicate records
    and papers that have no relation to any elements of the 6 R through browsing abstracts.
    Then, we further excluded papers with non-CBM descriptions discerned in the RESOLVE
    framework after browsing the full texts. In this way, 59 papers were retained
    to explore the contribution of the IoT to CBM, see Fig. 2. Download : Download
    high-res image (615KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Flowchart of
    selected publications in the review (status in June 2022). Then, a quantitative
    analysis of how the IoT reduces environmental impacts in CBM was conducted. For
    this, from the included papers we acquired 23 results that a) quantified impacts
    on energy-related indicators in circular economy (e.g., energy use or CO2 emissions)
    and b) compared these impacts before and after using IoT technology. 3. Review:
    impacts of the IoT on CBM 3.1. Descriptive results The retrieved 59 papers used
    for describing the contribution of the IoT to CBM can be categorized by journal,
    year of publication, and sector/application. Fig. 3 shows the number of articles
    published in different journals under the given search term and constraints. The
    number of papers published in the Journal of Cleaner Production, Sustainability
    and Computers in Industry appears to dominate. These journals make up 25.5% of
    the total share, which is much higher than that of other journals. The core fields
    covered by these journals include computer science, engineering and environmental
    science. The number of papers has increased significantly over time. Publications
    in the last 3 years occupy exceed 2/3 of the total share, which indicates a growing
    interest on this topic. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Numbers of IoT publications in different types of journals.
    Next, we use the framework developed by Maroli et al. (2021) to classify 59 papers
    into 4 major categories: reviews, theory studies, new designs and case studies.
    Reviews include pure review articles that classify and summarize previous studies.
    Theory studies generally analyze and discuss the proposed new framework for specific
    issues mainly based on surveying experts (Delphi) or questionnaires. New designs
    imply the development of a new mathematical model or a new protocol design for
    an IoT solution but without a real case to verify factual feasibility. Case studies
    further calculate or simulate the case and obtain reference results based on real
    or defined cases compared with the new design. A brief supplementary description
    of each article is also attached to this table to provide an overview of each
    research division. These classified papers are then categorized into six business
    models suggested by ReSOLVE framework (EMF, 2015). As shown in Fig. 4. Download

    Division of publications into the 6 ReSOLVE categories of CE business models.
    Over 60% of the papers describe the contribution of IoT to Loop and Optimize models.
    Both of these two models have higher potential impacts on manufacturing, transportation
    and storage, and IoT could thus promote significant business transformation within
    these sectors (EMF, 2015). As for Optimize, IoT helps to realize smart manufacturing
    and SSCM through improving decision-making plans to reduce the consumption of
    energy and resources. Most of the theoretical studies here explored and developed
    frameworks for low carbon footprints in different industries based on IoT capabilities
    of collecting, processing information more efficiently (Gružauskas et al., 2018;
    Chit et al., 2021; Ghoreishi and Happonen, 2022; Jagtap et al., 2021). The limited
    number of cases and new designs are usually process optimizations in enterprises,
    where IoT is used to develop intelligent production scheduling and logistics delivery
    models to promote green and sustainable development of intelligent manufacturing
    (Liao and Wang, 2019). In the Loop business model, most studies focused on waste
    management. Here, IoT is mainly used to realize waste collection optimization
    and more accuracy of decision support system for end-life products recycling (Bányai
    et al., 2019; Velvizhi et al., 2020; Al-Masri et al., 2018). Some theoretical
    studies designed CE–IoT-enabled ecosystems based on key enabling IoT technologies
    (Miaoudakis et al., 2020). Others combined it with LCA model to aid their processes
    of designing new products with low environmental impact (Zhang et al., 2020; de
    Oliveira and Soares, 2017). New designs and case studies validated IoT-enabled
    solutions based on products with different technical route characteristics, such
    as plastic waste and scrapped cars (Plakas et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2018), etc.
    Though the proportion of case studies is relatively low, only 11%. The remaining
    four business models account for only a small part of the articles. Among them,
    the sharing model generally relies on online platforms or apps supported by IoT,
    which brings the channel for products or information sharing between different
    stakeholders (Mastos et al., 2020). Virtualize and Exchange models usually demands
    extra technologies such as virtual world tools, digital twin (DT) and 3D printers
    to realize (Gustafson-Pearce and Grant, 2017; Despeisse et al., 2017; Rocca et
    al., 2020). 3.2. Connection of ReSOLVE framework with 6 R and IoT capabilities
    We further classified the papers in a number of matrices, considering the 6 R,
    IoT capabilities and Circular Business Model (CBM) categories discussed in section
    2. This results in a ‘heat map’ of the occurrences of CBM-IoT and CBM-6R cross-sections
    within the sample of 59 papers, see Fig. 5. Many papers describe multiple CBM-IoT
    and CBM-6R cross-sections. It should further be noted that while the categories
    are uniquely defined, they are not mutually exclusive. Below, we explored patterns
    for each of the CBM. 1. Loop business model Download : Download high-res image

    CBM-IoT cross-section occurrences. The findings show that IoT-enabled ‘Recycle’
    dominates, followed by ‘Remanufacture’ and ‘Repair’. Papers displaying Loop usually
    rely on tracking or monitoring capabilities, while optimization and design evolution
    are relatively unexplored. In terms of recycling, remanufacturing, and repairing,
    the adoption of novel Internet-based transactions can exploit information for
    faster and more sustainable collection of post-consumption products, they can
    be tracked using sensors, RFID tags, and barcodes (Al-Masri et al., 2018). As
    a consequence, organizations are able to remanufacture, or recycle components
    of products and packaging (Vanderroost et al., 2017; Gligoric et al., 2019). In
    line with the Redesign prospect, product designers need to incorporate environmental
    criteria into their design decisions. They can obtain data from an IoT-based product
    life cycle management system to aid their processes of sustainable design and
    development (Zhang et al., 2020; Chit et al., 2021; de Oliveira and Soares, 2017).
    Typical cases are listed in Table 4. 2. Optimize business model Table 4. Illustration
    of the use of IoT capabilities in the Loop model. IoT capabilities Representative
    examples Tracking A research project called POIROT, which exploits IoT technologies,
    aiming to realize a platform for the traceability of organic waste and transform
    it into inert, odorless and sanitized material (De Fazio et al., 2019). Monitoring
    An IoT-enabled decision support system for a CE model that addresses the uncertainty
    of a product''s residual value based on the life cycle monitored from the IoT
    sensors (Mboli et al., 2020). Optimization A system that combines intelligent
    transportation systems (RFIDs, sensors, cameras, actuators and surveillance systems)
    and an advanced decision system (incorporating data sharing between truck drivers
    in real time to perform dynamic route optimization) for efficient waste collection
    (Velvizhi et al., 2020). Most of the papers exploring Optimize models are highly
    related to IoT-enabled ‘Reduce’, which is mainly realized by monitoring and optimization
    capabilities, as shown in Appendix figure A1. Through data monitoring from processes
    and agents such as machines, the IoT increases the possibility of identifying
    potential failures, and predictive maintenance can reduce the waste of non-performing
    products (Venkatesh et al., 2020; Laskurain-Iturbe et al., 2021). Additionally,
    based on the demands of the production and consumption of resources, managers
    could monitor and Optimize production rates and the use of sensors as well as
    algorithms would enable them to automatically intervene in processes to reduce
    intermediate inventory (Ghoreishi and Happonen, 2022; Roy and Roy 2019; Awan et
    al., 2022b). The IoT with the combination of cloud computing and machine learning
    provides potential for complex and integrated data-driven process manufacturing
    models in terms of robustness and accuracy (Fisher et al., 2020). Typical cases
    are listed in Table 5. 3. Share business model Table 5. Illustration of the use
    of IoT capabilities in the Optimize model. IoT capabilities Representative examples
    Tracking RFID technology to tag and track fresh milk could reduce the amount of
    product shrinkage (Bottani et al., 2014). Monitoring Based on IoT sensors, energy
    and cost savings will be achieved as long as the state of the ideal ball mill
    is specifically analyzed and extended to the other ball mills. (Ma et al., 2020).
    Optimization Each node (including suppliers, wholesalers and retailers) could
    be involved in managing and optimizing its own performance in terms of production,
    deliveries and environmental compliance by using RFID tags and wireless sensor
    networks (Hofmann and Rüsch, 2017; Hasanova and Romanovs, 2020). Monitoring and
    tracking are main capabilities of IoT that contribute to sharing business model,
    they help in the product ‘Resign’ and ‘Recycle’ in order to achieve product lifetime
    extension, as shown in Appendix figure A2. Information on consumers'' behavior
    is collected through websites and apps, organizations can therefore both improve
    product design and provide a digital service for better utilization or replacement
    of equipment, and increase customer satisfaction (Rymaszewska et al., 2017; Ingemarsdotter
    et al., 2020). Moreover, the use of sensors in products allows performance monitoring
    - for instance, monitoring maintenance requirements - thereby allowing organizations
    to proactively provide a high quality of service to customers. As a consequence
    of monitoring products during consumer use, organizations can invest in extending
    product life spans by applying the 3Rs strategy (repair, reuse, and recycle).
    Typical cases are listed in Table 6. 4. Virtualize business model Table 6. Illustration
    of the use of IoT capabilities in the Share model. IoT capabilities Representative
    examples Tracking Cranfield University launched a shoe recycling project: it includes
    the design of an intelligent component (IoT) that tracks the condition of the
    shoes and identifies the need for replacement/upgrading. The modular design of
    the shoes allows them to be easily disassembled for refurbishing or recycling
    (Nobre and Tavares, 2017). Monitoring A cross-company IoT communication protocol
    has the potential to offer an automated negotiation ecosystem between scrap metal
    producers and waste collecting companies based on cost, demand etc. (Mastos et
    al., 2020). Optimization IoT helps to achieve a mutual visible inventory under
    business-to-business e-commerce models in real time, where average food inventory,
    amount of food waste, frequency of lateral inventory share and ordering from the
    main depot; customer service level in the network is optimized (Ekren et al.,
    2021). Since service is a core focus of Virtualize, using real-time data to monitor
    supply activities is important to enhance the customer experience. It also triggers
    the potential of IoT-enabled “Redesign” of the product or service with the help
    of design evolution capability. Through virtually designing, simulating, and optimizing
    the system and converting it on the real world, it is possible to achieve system
    reconfigurability through a change of both specific hardware (i.e., change of
    robot tools for disassembly activities), and software resources (i.e., robot program
    coding) (Sassanelli et al., 2021). The IoT enables connections between organizations,
    suppliers, and customers in order to offer services rather than physical products
    (Jabbour et al., 2018). In addition, the IoT is able to collect information on
    consumers’ behavior and features of past designs, which designers can use to improve
    service quality. Typical cases are listed in Table 7. 5. Exchange business model
    Table 7. Illustration of the use of IoT capabilities in the Virtualize model.
    IoT capabilities Representative examples Monitoring Gustafson-Pearce and Grant
    (2017) tested 3D Virtual World tools with multiple sources of ‘streamed’ data
    generated by IoT, to discover whether knowledge sharing and learning within a
    horizontal supply chain was effective and reduced greenhouse gas emissions related
    to business travel. Design evolution A platform that combines hybrid IoT and blockchain
    to provide interactive innovation in prefabricated housing construction among
    shareholders, who were involved in life-cycle value co-design via online channels
    (e.g., mobile apps) (Li et al., 2021). A platform installing IoT devices in a
    smart building to measure energy consumption and provide energy optimization consulting
    services for end-users and building managers (Sharma et al., 2021). IoT could
    provide a scenario of experience shopping from a mirror image, aiming to solve
    the distortion of consumer''s experience in traditional online shopping (Gao and
    Han, 2021). IoT integrates the manufacturing execution system (MES) to the DT
    by using a communication protocol, which is able to give commands to the MES from
    external sources and digitalize the CE practices (Rocca et al., 2020). This model
    could acquire strength by adopting additive manufacturing and IoT systems with
    monitoring capability (Despeisse et al., 2017). 3D printers are able to process
    renewable and sustainable production. Based on interaction between organizations
    and customers, some companies are able to manufacture customized products by using
    databases incorporating 3D printers, where IoT helps to save time and material
    use in additive manufacturing. These kinds of functions make IoT easier to achieve
    CE principles. Typical cases are listed in Table 8. 6. Regenerate business model
    Table 8. Illustration of the use of IoT capabilities in the Exchange model. IoT
    capabilities Representative examples Monitoring The additive manufacturing leads
    to reduced use of material, IoT-enabled 3D printers enable the recycling of small
    quantities of waste (Despeisse et al., 2017). Optimization IoTs are used for the
    identification of engineered disassemblers as well as the real-time status of
    reproducible resources to build efficient multi-target production planning in
    real-time by the seed swarm optimization algorithm (Chau et al., 2021). The model
    could benefit from IoT in the form of sensors and networks. The design, production
    and supply decisions of CE could be adjusted based on data provided by IoT (EMF,
    2016). This would make it possible to reduce unnecessary resource consumption
    to improve the productivity of harvests, and to extend the life cycle of the land
    use. Typical cases are listed in Table 9. Table 9. Illustration of the use of
    IoT capabilities in the Regenerate model. IoT capabilities Representative examples
    Monitoring To monitor, and control factors related to land management between
    crop rotation, to automate irrigation systems based on weather conditions in real
    time, and to manage the use of pesticides according to the health of plantations
    (EMF Report of Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2016). Optimization IoT allows real-time
    measurement of ceramic tile production, providing the capability to modify the
    composition of the ceramic bodies and the transport mix to maximize the use of
    local raw materials, reducing the distances between mines and the factory and
    by favoring rail transport (Garcia-Muiña et al., 2019). In all, the concept of
    6 R is gradually supported by IoT technology. It promotes the combination of 6
    R in different circular business practices (Kirchherr et al., 2017; Spaltini et
    al., 2021), and each business model represents a major circularity opportunity
    enabled by the IoT technology that is quite different from growth in the linear
    economy. Therefore, we selected main contributors of 6 R and CBM from the ‘heat
    map’ results, and then constructed a relationship framework that containing the
    conceptualization of 4 IoT capabilities, 6 R and ReSOLVE framework, as shown in
    Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res image (341KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Relationship framework for IoT enabled 6 R and CBM. As for IoT capabilities,
    the monitoring plays a significant role, which promotes most circular business
    models by jointly facilitating all 6Rs, followed by the optimization capability.
    And for the intermediate nodes of 6 R actions, Recycle and Redesign are the core
    CE principles linking upstream IoT capabilities and downstream circular strategies.
    In different ways, these actions all increase the utilization of physical assets,
    prolong their life, and shift resource use from finite to renewable sources. They
    potentially reinforce and accelerate the performance of the other actions, creating
    a compounding effect. 3.3. Quantitative analysis of how the use of IoT in CBMs
    reduces energy-related environmental impacts Within the collected papers, 20 papers
    provide quantitative data on how the use of IoT in CBMs can reduce environmental
    impacts. These papers provide 23 cases. We included them in our quantitative analysis
    for they mainly use energy savings as the primary measurement. Fig. 7 depicts
    how much energy is saved by using IoT in the six ReSOLVE business model categories
    (Virtualize is missing due to lack of data). The X-axis shows the ReSOLVE business
    model categories and their number of samples in each. The Y-axis represents the
    relative energy savings compared to a baseline scenario without IoT enhancement
    (i.e., the energy use in the baseline is set on 100%). Supplementary Table 2 contains
    a list of cases and their references. 1. Optimize business model Download : Download
    high-res image (240KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Relative energy
    saving under different IoT-enabled CBM (CI = 95%). Most results show quantitative
    data from the Optimize business model (11 results). Here, big data of related
    resource objects is collected using IoT sensors. The resource allocation framework
    is then optimized using heuristic algorithms for specific consumption habits to
    prevent any unwanted negative environmental impact in scheduling issues (Liao
    and Wang, 2019). 2. Loop business model 6 results consider the Loop business model.
    IoT solutions enable the transition to a cyber-physical1 waste management system,
    and provide real-time information on waste generation, treatment, transportation,
    and material handling capacity in big random systems. Carbon emissions from collected
    and transported waste have been significantly reduced due to enhanced recycling
    (Velvizhi et al., 2020). 3. Share business model 4 results discuss the Share business
    model, where IoT lowers energy and resource waste in corporate processes by sharing
    information, products or services (Ekren et al., 2021). For instance, IoT facilitates
    the recording of food expiration dates and facilitates communal food sharing (Phiri
    and Trevorrow, 2019). 4. Regenerate and Exchange business model The Regenerate
    and Exchange models each have a single case. In Regenerate model, IoT is utilized
    for the identification of engineered disassemblers and the real-time status of
    regenerable resources in order to construct effective multi-target production
    planning (Garcia-Muiña et al., 2019). While in Exchange model, IoT assists in
    modifying the composition of the ceramic bodies and the transport mix to maximize
    the utilization of local raw materials (Chau et al., 2021). The effects of relative
    energy savings in the Optimize and Loop business models are evident and comparable,
    with corresponding mean value of 30% and 25%. It may be attributed to the parallels
    of the two models in leveraging IoT capabilities. With the difference that Optimize
    model utilizes more on the optimization capabilities, which may provide it with
    higher energy saving potential. Some measures in the Optimize model could even
    achieve energy savings of up to 70%. But the effect of the Share business model
    is highly variable, ranging from less than 20%–80%, with the majority of results
    falling closer to the lower end. The results of the remaining three models are
    limited. Nevertheless, they present oppotunities for further investigation. 4.
    Environmental drawbacks and other obstacles to the use of IoT in CBMs While reviewing
    the literature, as described above we found many ways of how IoT could support
    the implementation of circular CBMs. However, some of these references also highlighted
    environmental risks of IoT, or other obstacles to implementing and using IoT.
    These findings including related references are discussed below, and Table 10
    summarizes them. Table 10. Environmental drawbacks and other obstacles to the
    implementation of IoT. Type Drawbacks and obstacles Environmental Use of harmful
    substances and non-degradable resources Hardware power consumption IoT node software
    energy consumption IoT protocol energy efficiency Other Lack of standardization
    and technological knowledge among partners Data availability High financial investment
    Security of virtual platform Inadequate internet connectivity 4.1. Environmental
    drawbacks One of the drawbacks of IoT-enabled business models includes the energy
    use of IoT and related carbon emissions, such as IoT hardware, node software and
    protocol energy consumption (Fraga-Lamas et al., 2021). Hardware is the basis
    for the IoT network, and both hardware and software needs to be optimized together
    to re duce environmental burdens. Such optimizations are particularly important
    for certain digital signal processing tasks, including compression, feature extraction,
    or machine learning training. The IoT is also dependent on protocols that enable
    communicating between the various nodes and routing devices involved in an IoT
    network. In terms of software implementation, these protocols must be energy-efficient
    and should minimize the use of communication interfaces. Next to this, IoT equipment
    may result in difficult to process electronic waste. An example consists of RFID
    tags that are hazardous to the environment and are difficult to recycle (Yu et
    al., 2022). Another concern is that IoT enables mass customization. Customization
    makes it more difficult for another user to reuse or recycle an item (Birkel et
    al., 2019). A key observation is that many studies do not take into account such
    environmental drawbacks of implementing IoT technology (i.e., the impact of producing
    or using IoT devices, etc.). Some preliminary analyses have been presented in
    the literature. For instance, Mataloto et al. (2019) discovered that IoT devices
    (LoRa) for energy management systems require an annual energy usage of 5.2 kWh
    if applied in small buildings (16–40 m2). Bottani et al. (2014) assessed the environmental
    performance and burdens of the use of RFID tags in a fresh milk supply chain based
    on life cycle assessment (LCA) and found that the environmental costs of 1 million
    RFID tags are 32,900 kg CO2-eq in climate change potential, 23.9 kg P-eq in freshwater
    eutrophication, and 156 molc H + -eq in acidification potential. Comparatively
    to the existing studies, there is a dearth of papers that examine the positive
    and negative contributions of IoT to CBM via case studies or simulations. This
    involves not only a full examination of its production, transportation, disposal,
    and reuse synergies, but also an evaluation of the LCA of IoT components. 4.2.
    Other obstacles Next to environmental drawbacks the literature we reviewed gave
    some more general implementation obstacles with regard to the use of IoT in CBMs.
    Firstly, there is often a lack of structured data management processes to ensure
    the acquisition of high-quality data for industrial analysis (Ingemarsdotter et
    al., 2020). Due to the limited availability and variety of industrial data, evaluating
    and validating representative models of real-world systems can be difficult, i.e.,
    determining when sufficient data has been acquired to ensure the representativeness
    of a simulation framework. (Fisher et al., 2020). Secondly, the absence of standardization
    and guidance in implementing IoT across various businesses poses a concern. There
    can be a lack of regulations addressing data ownership among stakeholders (Astill
    et al., 2019). The wide implementation of CE strategies is contingent upon solving
    such data ownership issues. Thirdly, ensuring privacy and data security poses
    a challenge (Roy and Roy, 2019). End-users as intermediate nodes in the manufacturing
    and remanufacturing cycle and vulnerable firewall nodes can be susceptible to
    botnet assaults (Tuptuk and Hailes, 2018). One typical case is the IoT botnet
    Mirai, a malware that could target consumer electronics and home routers, turning
    them into a zombie remotely controlled bots that can be used in large-scale network
    attacks (Antonakakis et al., 2017). Such challenges may be solved by IoT projects
    funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research program, it includes the
    European Cloud Initiative, the GAIA-X initiative, as well as public-private partnerships
    such as the Smart Networks and Services JU and the AI, Big Data and Robotics (Calisti,
    2020). These projects are expected to use distributed AI, address security, privacy
    and trust requirements by design and allow for new de-centralized topologies and
    governance. In addition, it is challenging to rapidly design IoT-enabled products
    for interoperability, adaptability, and upgradability (Ingemarsdotter et al.,
    2020). Currently, potential solutions tend to point at blockchain technology.
    However, integrating blockchain within the IoT framework will also pose technical,
    infrastructure, energy consumption, interoperability and social regulatory issues
    (Feng et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Venkatesh et al., 2020). The last impediment
    are the limited resources small-scale enterprises can invest systematically in
    IoT technologies throughout their entire supply chains (Tan et al., 2020). 5.
    Conclusion and outlook This review has assessed the state-of-the-art relation
    of IoT and CBM from several perspectives. Based on the Prisma approach, this article
    reviews the literature on the IoT and CBMs that has been expanding significantly
    in recent years. Through the classification of their methods and contents, this
    paper constructed a mapping framework connecting the ReSOLVE concept with four
    IoT capabilities and the 6 R framework. It depicts the current research status
    of IoT supported CBMs and explains their contribution for enterprises from the
    perspective of 6 R with representative cases. IoT by its support of joint interoperability
    for system optimization, timely monitoring and tracking, has contributed to the
    enhancement of industrial efficiency, recycling, and the reduction of unnecessary
    material and energy use. These characteristics of IoT support the implementation
    and success of CBMs, particularly the Loop and Optimize CBMs. These conclusions
    are similar to those of previously published studies. However, the dynamic feedback
    potential of the IoT also proves to be vital for the “Redesign” of product or
    service concepts, especially for Virtualize, Share and Exchange models which have
    not been fully explored before. Therefore, we revealed potential directions based
    on these preliminary studies: For instance, in the Share approach, IoT helps to
    provide a sharing platform that enables consumers to share products, essentially
    providing the same amount of final services with a smaller product pool. The IoT
    also provides virtual and dematerialized options as service solutions rather than
    physical products with similar functions to achieve design evolution capability,
    supporting the “Redesign” CE strategy through the combination of other I4.0 technologies
    such as DT. The review of quantitative assessments suggests that IoT has the potential
    to reduce the energy consumption of the Optimize and Loop business model by about
    20–30%. By redesigning and integrating IoT and IoT-based algorithms into business
    operations, the energy efficiency of the system can be greatly increased. In addition,
    IoT can help to minimize waste generation and enhance efficiency of resource use.
    However, the widespread usage of IoT and related data processing activities in
    itself can lead to higher energy use and generation of e-waste, which often is
    difficult to recycle. IoT also poses a number of obstacles for its cross-business
    applications, including the difficulties of establishing universal standards for
    data processing, cybersecurity liability issues, and relatively high investment
    costs. These assessments of strengths and challenges of IoT can provide more intuitive
    information for SMEs investors who are interested in innovative technologies and
    circular development. 6. Limitations and recommendations This research has limitations
    as well. Firstly, given the fact that the research on the interaction between
    the IoT and CE is still in its infancy, most of the references discuss conceptual
    frameworks, models and theoretical evaluations, and just a few case studies. Most
    case studies only explore one or a few technical applications of IoT, these limits
    the value of meta-analyses as attempted in this paper. Particularly for the Virtualize,
    Exchange and Regenerate CBMs the number of available cases was low. We hence recommend
    a more systematic, quantitative analysis of case studies on how IoT can contribute
    to CBMs and environmental improvements. Secondly, the literature gives just limited
    information on the environmental drawbacks of IoT. Some studies on e.g., RFID
    suggest that their production and use generate just limited environmental damage
    (Jia et al., 2012). However, to analyze the environmental benefits and drawbacks
    of IoT comprehensively, further research is needed that should consider specific
    IoT application scenarios, material choices and future improvement potentials
    that may be available due to scale and learning effects. These could become the
    focal points of the future phase of IoT research. Declaration of competing interest

    in agro-industry and environment during 2006–2016. • Clustering of IoT applications
    into four domains: monitoring, control, prediction, and logistics. • Visualization
    of key technologies used to develop the IoT applications. • Discussion of trends
    and open challenges. • Proposal of an IoT architecture for agro-industrial and
    environmental applications based on the research findings. Abstract This paper
    reviews agro-industrial and environmental applications that are using Internet
    of Things (IoT). It is motivated by the need to identify application areas, trends,
    architectures and open challenges in these two fields. The underlying survey was
    developed following a systematic literature review using academic documents written
    in English and published in peer-reviewed venues from 2006 to 2016. Selected references
    were clustered into four application domains corresponding to: monitoring, control,
    logistics, and prediction. Implementation-specific details from each selected
    reference were compiled to create usage distributions of sensors, actuators, power
    sources, edge computing modules, communication technologies, storage solutions,
    and visualization strategies. Finally, the results from the review were compiled
    into an IoT architecture that represents a wide range of current solutions in
    agro-industrial and environmental fields. Previous article in issue Next article

    literature review 1. Introduction The widespread of Internet in the last two decades
    brought countless benefits to citizens and organizations around the world. Arguably
    the most important benefit was the ability to consume and produce data and services
    in real time. Recently, the Internet of Things is promising to bring the same
    benefits to everyday objects, giving us a way to extend our perception and our
    ability to modify the environment around us. In this context, agro-industrial
    and environmental fields are ideal candidates for the deployment of IoT solutions
    because they occur in wide areas that need to be continuously monitored and controlled.
    At the same time, IoT opens new opportunities beyond ground floor automation when
    the collected data are used to feed machine learning algorithms to provide predictions
    (Saville et al., 2015), easing decision planning and decision making for owners,
    managers, and policy makers. IoT can be used at different levels in the agro-industrial
    production chain (Medela et al., 2013). It can help to evaluate field variables
    such as soil state, atmospheric conditions, and biomass of plants or animals.
    It can also be used to assess and control variables such as temperature, humidity,
    vibration, and shock during the product transport (Pang et al., 2015). It can
    be used to monitor and predict the product state and its demand on shelves or
    inside refrigerators. In addition, it can provide information to the final user/consumer
    about the origin and properties of the product. The IoT applied to the agro-industry
    can contribute to create an informed, connected, developed and adaptable rural
    community. Under the IoT paradigm, low-cost electronic devices can improve human
    interaction with the physical world, and the computing power and software available
    on the Internet can provide valuable analytics. In summary, IoT can be an important
    tool in the years to come for people interacting within an agro-industrial system:
    suppliers, farmers, technicians, distributors, business men, consumers, and government
    representatives. IoT can be incorporated into environmental applications to produce
    dense and real-time maps of air and water pollution, noise level (Torres-Ruiz
    et al., 2016, Hachem et al., 2015), temperature, and harmful radiation among others.
    It can be used to collect and store environmental records, check the compliance
    of environmental variables with local policies, trigger alerts, or send recommendation
    messages to citizens and authorities (Liu et al., 2013). Once the data reach the
    cloud, governments can feed predictive models to forecast environmental variables,
    and identify and track pollution sources over time and space, ultimately leading
    to faster and better decisions to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all
    citizens. Based on the potential of IoT applications in agro-industrial and environmental
    fields described in the previous paragraphs, this paper aims to identify the current
    state of solutions in these fields, as well as the trends, architectures, technologies
    and open challenges. This paper uses a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) based
    on a methodology proposed by Kitchenham and Charters (2007), in order to make
    it unbiased in terms of information selection, processing, and presentation of
    results. The paper is structured as follows. Sections 2 Planning, 3 Conduction,
    4 Results describe the stages of planning, conduction, and results of the SLR.
    Section 5 outlines some recent works that were published online after the SLR
    was concluded. Section 6 includes a discussion of the obtained results, and Section
    7 presents the conclusions from this study. 2. Planning During this stage of the
    SLR, the protocol was defined. This included: research questions, search strategies,
    selection criteria, data mining and synthesis methodologies. For this study, the
    two research questions considered were: 1. What are the main technological solutions
    of the Internet of Things in agro-industrial and environmental fields? 2. Which
    infrastructure and technology are using the main solutions of IoT in agro-industrial
    and environmental fields? To collect information, authors performed an Internet
    search using various academic digital libraries and search engines. Obtained results
    were manually compiled in order to select the best information sources to answer
    the two research questions. After analyzing the results, digital libraries and
    search engines described in Table 1 were chosen based on their scientific and
    technical content, as well as their close relationship to areas of knowledge associated
    with the objective of this paper. Table 1. Information sources used for the search

    Search Engine https://scholar.google.com/ The next step was to define search terms
    and a consistent procedure to seek scientific and technical documentation in the
    digital libraries and search engines. To define the search terms, a set of keywords
    was selected from the research questions to create two groups of words which are
    shown in Table 2. Each group contained consolidated expressions with synonyms
    or terms with related meaning. Group 1 included words associated with the Internet
    of Things, while Group 2 contained a set of terms related to the agro-industry
    and environment. Logical operators supported by the advanced search of digital
    libraries were used to construct search strings, based on the two research questions,
    combining terms from Groups 1 and 2 of Table 2. The general structure of the search
    queries that were applied to the information sources is presented in Table 3.

    order to ensure the quality of papers, only those that passed the following criteria
    were considered in the reviewing process. • Documents published in peer-reviewed
    conferences, peer-reviewed journals, papers from computer science or engineering
    organizations, patents, or technical reports. • Documents published in English.
    • Documents published between 2006 and 2016 (both years inclusive). If the main
    topic of a given paper was irrelevant or if it was outside the scope of this study,
    it was deleted. Then, a selection criterion was applied in order to reduce the
    number of papers found during the search and to get a small number of high-quality
    sources that could be used to answer the research questions. This involved using
    inclusion criteria (IC) and quality criteria (QC), which were defined in a three-phase
    process. • IC based on abstracts: in this phase, authors discarded papers found
    in the search stage based on the information provided in their abstracts. Papers
    that satisfied the first inclusion criterion were kept for further processing,
    i.e. papers that discussed IoT solutions applied to agro-industry and environment.
    Papers with little relevant information in their abstract were temporarily kept
    in the list and were processed in the next stage. It is important to highlight
    that quality criteria were not considered in this phase. • IC based on full reading:
    in this phase, papers that did not address the search terms shown in Table 2 were
    removed. This means that even though those papers contained the search terms in
    their abstract, they only represented minor aspects of them. • IC based on quality
    analysis: in this phase, a quality analysis was applied to remaining papers and
    those that did not comply any of the following four quality criteria (QC) were
    discarded: – QC1: Does the study present a comprehensive solution of IoT for agro-industry
    or environment? – QC2: Does the paper show details of the infrastructure and/or
    technologies used to implement the proposed solution? – QC3: Does the paper present
    a state of the art or related work? – QC4: Does the paper present an analysis
    of the results? The next stage of the SLR was data mining and synthesis. The goal
    here was to extract the information needed to answer the research questions in
    an objective manner. The information fields extracted for each study are presented
    in Table 4. Table 4. Form used to extract data for each study. Data retrieved

    in the previous section was used to search, select and evaluate preliminary papers.
    For the search process, the query defined in Table 3 was passed to information
    sources given in Table 1. The search was limited to title, abstract and keywords.
    Fig. 1 illustrates the conduction process discriminated by the academic database
    and search engine used, highlighting the key steps followed to select relevant
    studies for this review. Initially, 3578 studies were recovered from electronic
    databases. Firstly, duplicates were excluded, i.e. studies available in more than
    one database, eliminating 849 copies. Out of the 2729 remaining studies, 2652
    were initially screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria applied to the
    title, abstract, and keywords. These papers were marked to be downloaded, and
    references that could not be retrieved were discarded. Afterward, these studies
    were evaluated using quality criteria obtaining 720 studies. These studies were
    used to extract the data defined in Table 4. Finally, only 72 main studies were
    selected based on their quality for the final conduction phase and used to extract
    results presented in the next section. Download : Download high-res image (236KB)

    main studies. It is worth to note that more than 90% of included papers were retrieved
    from two sources: IEEExplore (76.4%) and Scopus (13.9%). In contrast, the least
    effective sources of information were Microsoft Academic Search and Microsoft
    Academic. They retrieved 668 papers during the first stage of the conduction phase
    (representing 25.2% of all retrieved papers, and only behind IEEExplore with 45%).
    However, only 3.1% of them were included for the next reviewing phase, a number
    well below the 39.8% of papers included from IEEExplore. These facts can be explained
    because IEEExplore and Scopus have complete and usable advanced search systems
    and they have been operating continuously unlike Microsoft’s counterpart (Sinha
    et al., 2015a). Fig. 2 enumerates the number of primary studies classified by
    publication year. It can be seen that most of the selected papers were published
    between 2012 and 2016. It should be highlighted that the small number of papers
    shown in 2016 can be explained because the initial search was made in April of
    that year. Download : Download high-res image (127KB) Download : Download full-size

    results of the SLR in order to answer the two research questions based on the
    information extracted from main studies selected. 4.1. Answer to the first research
    question To identify the main technological solutions of IoT in agro-industry
    and environmental fields, studies were grouped into four technological domains,
    corresponding to: (1) monitoring, (2) control, (3) prediction and (4) logistics.
    Results are summarized in Table 5 and illustrated in Fig. 4. From this figure,
    it can be seen that most of the selected studies were focused on monitoring (62%),
    followed by control (25%), logistics (7%), and prediction (6%). Table 5. Clustering

    image Fig. 4. Distribution of papers selected by application domain. Selected
    papers grouped in the monitoring domain dealt with remote sensing of physical
    and environmental parameters gathered in scenarios such as crops and farms using
    a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The main goal of this domain was the acquisition
    of information without an operator and its transmission to a server or data center
    for processing and visualization. Integrated monitoring tools made it possible
    to maintain a continuous communication with the deployed WSN, and access stored
    data through the Internet. Hence, smart agriculture based on IoT adds value to
    farmers by helping them to collect relevant data from crops and farms using sensor
    devices. Some IoT setups could display, process and analyze remote data applying
    cloud services in order to provide new insights and recommendations for better
    decision-making. IoT solutions categorized in monitoring domain can be divided
    into three architectural layers (Zou, 2014): (i) a perception layer supported
    by a WSN; (ii) a network layer where the sensor information travels a long distance
    using different protocols and Gateways, and (iii) an application layer that includes
    a web server and a database. Moreover, IoT solutions grouped in this domain are
    interested in monitoring several types of physical variables depending on the
    subdomain to which they belong. Specifically, the following subdomains were identified:
    air monitoring (34.5%), soil monitoring (27.3%), water monitoring (16.4%), plant
    monitoring (10.9%), and others (10.9%) which include areas such as aquaculture
    and animal monitoring. It is worth to highlight that most of the selected studies
    retrieved in this SLR can be categorized in more than one subdomain. For instance,
    the system proposed in Zou (2014) is used for online crop growth monitoring and
    it captures different types of variables such as: temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, CO2, luminosity, pH of water, and images. Some representative examples
    of IoT applications categorized in the monitoring domain are described below.
    • Air monitoring: this subdomain aimed to provide periodic or continuous measurements,
    evaluating and determining environmental parameters or pollution levels in order
    to prevent negative and damaging effects. It also included the forecasting of
    possible changes in the ecosystem or the biosphere as a whole. For instance, in
    Watthanawisuth et al. (2009) authors described an agricultural IoT solution which
    can be categorized in the air monitoring subdomain. In this solution, authors
    proposed a real-time monitoring system of micro climate based on a WSN. The solution
    included temperature and relative humidity sensors (SHT15) powered by solar panels
    and supported by ZigBee communication technology. Another air monitoring IoT solution
    is GEMS (Lu et al., 2010), which proposed an environmental monitoring system based
    on GPRS technology for monitoring apple orchards. This system was tested on five
    different regions of China over a 2-year period by monitoring variables such as
    relative humidity, temperature, and radiation. • Soil monitoring: papers classified
    in this subdomain such as (Chen et al., 2014, Mafuta et al., 2012) proposed systems
    for monitoring multi-layer soil temperature and moisture in a farmland fields
    using WSN. These systems are supported by communication technologies such as ZigBee,
    GPRS and Internet, where user interaction with the system is handled by a web
    application. • Water monitoring: primary studies categorized in this subdomain
    intend to monitor water pollution or water quality by sensing chemicals, pH, and
    temperature, which can alter the natural state of water. An example of this subdomain
    is presented in Postolache et al. (2013), where authors proposed an IoT solution
    for water quality assessment through the measurement of conductivity, temperature,
    and turbidity. The solution is based on a WSN architecture that combines low-cost
    sensing devices and monitoring of multiple parameters of water quality of shallow
    waters (lakes, estuaries, rivers) in urban areas. Similarly, (Xijun et al., 2009)
    proposed a WSN system for monitoring water level and rainfall in irrigation systems.
    • Plant monitoring: The LOFAR-agro Project (Langendoen et al., 2006) is an example
    of plant or crop monitoring. This project aimed to protect a potato crop against
    phytophthora (a genus of water mold) by monitoring the microclimate (humidity
    and temperature) using a large-scale WSN. The system intended to generate a policy
    to protect the crop against the fungal disease based on the collected data. In
    Fourati et al. (2014), authors propose a Web-based decision support system communicating
    with a WSN for irrigation scheduling in olive fields. For this purpose, authors
    use sensors to measure humidity, solar radiation, temperature, and rain. • Animal
    monitoring: This subdomain referred to animal tracking for both wildlife and animal
    husbandry activities. A research belonging to this subdomain was a delay-tolerant
    WSN for the monitoring and tracking of six horses presented in Ehsan et al. (2012).
    For this purpose, authors developed necklaces that acquired information about
    horses’ position and speed at a given time, and transmitted such logs to fixed
    nodes when they were close to its coverage area. Another example of animal monitoring
    was given by Jain et al. (2008), where an IoT solution was responsible for monitoring
    the behavior and migration patterns of Swamp Deers, obtaining information of the
    animal position and the climate at the same time. Papers selected and grouped
    under the domain of control use remote actuator devices deployed on-site. Unlike
    monitoring domain applications, which handle information in one-way, applications
    categorized in control use a two-way information channel. This means that a new
    level of communication was added, and commands could be sent back to the field.
    In this case, information from the server or data center traveled to a Wireless
    Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN) in order to control a set of actuator devices
    to modify the state of the process or environment. Commands were sent through
    a human–computer interface or as a result of a decision algorithm supported by
    analytic modules. Actuator devices included valves, pumps, humidifiers, and alarms
    among others. Many of these systems aimed to optimize the usage of water, fertilizers,
    and pesticides based on information provided by weather prediction systems and
    on-site WSN. Solutions in this domain could help farmers to reduce water consumption
    and waste by scheduling irrigation times and quantities according to the state
    of the crop and its growth cycle. Control systems were programmed to be adaptive,
    for instance, switching off sprinkler if rain was detected. Overall, solutions
    with control systems could save money to the farmer and provide at the same time
    valuable insights about the consumption of water, fertilizers, pesticides, and
    electricity. Actuator devices used by IoT solutions grouped in the control domain
    depended heavily on the subdomain to which they belonged. In this paper, the following
    subdomains were considered: irrigation (72.22%), fertilizers (5.56%), pesticides
    (5.56%), illumination (5.56%), and access control (5.56%). During the review,
    it was found that some studies used actuators in the domain of logistics (5.56%).
    Representative examples of IoT applications categorized in the control domain
    are described next. • Irrigation control: A precision irrigation solution based
    on wireless sensor network was proposed by Kanoun et al. (2014). The main challenge
    of that study was to create an automated irrigation system which could reduce
    water waste, saving energy, time, and money. This system was built using three
    nodes based on the TelosB mote: (i) a node to measure soil moisture and soil temperature;
    (ii) a node to measure environmental parameters such as air temperature, air humidity,
    wind speed and brightness; and (iii) a node that was connected to a valve for
    irrigation control. Data were transmitted to a base station for storage and were
    sent to the farmer’s PC to allow him to take action. Another precision irrigation
    IoT system was proposed by Jiao et al. (2014). This included an environmental
    monitoring system for agricultural management, as well as the implementation of
    precision dripping. The system considered an IoT ecosystem divided into three
    layers corresponding to sensing, transmission, and application. A WSN was used
    to perceive environmental information in real time within a tomato greenhouse,
    to later transmit the data to a remote server management system. In Shuwen and
    Changli (2015) researchers described a remote farmland irrigation monitoring solution
    based on ZigBee. The system included a solar-powered irrigation control system
    that also monitored air temperature, humidity and soil temperature. • Fertilizer
    and pesticide control: IoT solutions categorized in this subdomain applied conservation
    practices to improve nutrient usage, efficiency, crop quality, overall yield,
    and economic return while reducing off-site transport of nutrients. In Pahuja
    et al. (2013), authors developed an online micro-climate monitoring and control
    system for greenhouses. The system was supported by a WSN to gather and analyze
    plant-related sensor data to produce actions to control the climate, fertilization,
    irrigation, and pests. • Illumination control: authors in Yoo et al. (2007) described
    an automated agriculture system based on WSN for monitoring greenhouses used to
    grow melons and cabbages. The system monitored the growing process of crops and
    controlled the greenhouse’s environment. Some of the variables measured included
    ambient light, temperature, and humidity. For the greenhouse with melons, the
    system could control the illumination by changing the light state through a relay.
    • Access control: An agricultural intrusion detection system was presented in
    Roy et al. (2015). The proposed system generated alarms in the farmers house and
    sent a text message to the farmer’s mobile phone when an intruder entered the
    crop field. Selected papers categorized in the prediction domain were focused
    on providing knowledge and tools to farmers to support decision making. They had
    specific modules for these tasks in their architecture, and their predicted variables
    were grouped as follows: environmental conditions (42.86%), production estimation
    (42.86%), and crop growth (14.29%). • Environmental conditions: A representative
    example of environmental condition prediction is proposed in Khandani and Kalantari
    (2009), where authors described a design methodology to determine the spatial
    sampling of humidity sensors for the soil within a WSN. They used a historical
    database of dense soil-humidity measurements to determine the behavior of the
    2D correlation that exists between the measurements of nearby sensors. This was
    used later to find the largest spatial sampling that ensured a user-defined variance
    for the estimation on any given point of interest in the space. Authors found
    that the spatial correlation function decays exponentially with the distance between
    sensors. Another example of the prediction of environmental conditions was presented
    in Luan et al. (2015), which described a system that integrates drought monitoring
    and forecasting as well as irrigation prediction using IoT. • Production estimation:
    Authors in Lee et al. (2013) presented an IoT-based agricultural production system
    for stabilizing supply and demand of agricultural products. They achieved this
    goal by sensing environmental variables and by developing a prediction system
    for the growth and yield of crops. In a different application, (Saville et al.,
    2015) introduced a real-time estimation system for fixed-net fishery using ultrasonic
    sensors and supervised learning. • Crop growth: a dynamic analysis of farmlands
    using mobile sensors was presented in Lee et al. (2012). The developed system
    aimed to establish growth-control plans for grapes, and viticulture activities.
    The last domain used to categorize selected studies was logistics. Logistics in
    agriculture refers to the physical flow of entities and related information from
    producer to consumer to satisfy consumer demand. It includes: agricultural production,
    acquisition, transportation, storage, loading and unloading, handling, packaging,
    distribution, and related activities. Some objectives of logistics in agriculture
    include: adding value to agricultural products, saving money in distribution costs,
    improving shipping efficiency, reducing unnecessary losses, and to some extent,
    avoiding risks (Liping, 2012). Primary studies in logistics were further divided
    in: production (55.6%), commerce (22.2%) and transport(22.2%). The next paragraphs
    include representative studies of each subdomain. • Production: in Feng et al.
    (2012) researchers proposed an intelligent system for monitoring an apple orchard
    that implemented suggestions based on data. The system aimed to reduce management
    costs of apple orchards, improve apple quality, and provide detailed, comprehensive
    and accurate electronic information for planting works, pest warnings, and production-quality
    tracking of apples. The system included WSN using Zigbee, GPRS, and IoT providing
    detailed monitoring data of apple growth for agricultural cooperatives, to support
    for decision making in farming. • Commerce: (Li et al., 2013) presented an information
    system for agriculture based on IoT which used a distributed architecture. In
    that study, tracking and tracing of the whole agricultural production process
    were made with distributed IoT servers. Moreover, an information-discovery system
    was designed to implement, capture, standardize, manage, locate, and query business
    data from agricultural production. The system also allowed consumers to query
    information of agricultural products to verify their authenticity and quality.
    • Transport: A representative example of this subdomain is presented in Pang et
    al. (2015), where an IoT architecture was proposed for the food-production and
    commercialization chain. This paper dealt with logistics involved in the transportation
    of melons from Brazil to Sweden in a journey that takes 46 days. Sensor nodes
    measured conditions in the environment including oxygen, carbon dioxide, ethylene,
    temperature, humidity, and mechanical stress, such as vibrations, tilts, and shocks.

    Infrastructure and technology used by selected IoT solutions in agro-industrial
    and environmental fields were organized in seven groups, corresponding to: (i)
    sensing variables, (ii) actuator devices, (iii) power sources, (iv) communication
    technologies, (v) edge computing technologies (Shi et al., 2016), (vi) storage
    strategies, and (vii) visualization strategies. • Sensing variables: about 26%
    of analyzed studies sense temperature, followed by humidity, physicochemical properties,
    and radiation with 16%, 11%, and 10%, respectively. Particularly, temperature
    and physicochemical sensors are distributed in all subdomains as it can be seen
    in Fig. 6. Similarly, 55% of sensors are used for air monitoring. Thus, air temperature
    and humidity, soil moisture and solar radiation, can be considered universal variables
    in agricultural applications. Download : Download high-res image (324KB) Download

    studies is shown in Fig. 7. It can be stated that there are far fewer actuator
    devices than sensors currently being used in these studies and that most of them
    are concentrated in applications of control and logistics. In fact, more than
    60% of actuators reported were found in irrigation processes. Download : Download

    device used. • Power sources: currently, most monitoring applications prefer rechargeable
    batteries connected to solar panels, which offer a simple but sustainable energy
    supply. In contrast, control applications that typically have demanding energy
    requirements prefer the electrical grid. These trends can be appreciated in Fig.
    8. Recent power sources, such as electromagnetic or vibration harvesters were
    not found in selected studies showing that these approaches must mature and gain
    popularity for agricultural and environmental applications. Download : Download

    • Communication technologies: Fig. 9 shows that most studies (40%) used Wireless
    Personal Area Network (WPAN) protocols such as Bluetooth and ZigBee, followed
    by Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN) with 36% of the studies mainly supported
    by cellular technologies (GPRS/GSM/3G/4G). Meanwhile, the near-field communication,
    which is relatively new, has started to emerge in some field applications. Download

    technologies. • Edge computing technologies: microcontroller platforms were chosen
    in more than half of the applications reviewed. Interestingly, Single Board Computers
    (SBC) are not yet appropriate for edge computing in IoT agricultural applications.
    The complete distribution of edge computing technologies is shown in Fig. 10.

    it is clear that even though Cloud storage represents a key service for IoT systems,
    only 7.32% of selected studies used it. This shows that most researchers preferred
    their own data-storage implementation. Download : Download high-res image (78KB)

    strategies: Fig. 12 shows the distribution of three different visualization strategies:

    logistics. It can be stated that web-based solutions were the preferred strategy
    to visualize reports in all subdomains of applications. Download : Download high-res

    Most of the selected works do not address security issues explicitly and leave
    them on a side. However, some efforts in this domain were found. For instance,
    (Jardak et al., 2009) described the design of a WSN that implemented a RANdom
    SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) filter to eliminate inconsistent sensor-node data due
    to the presence of faulty or malicious nodes in the network. Sun et al. (2012)
    presented a dam monitoring system where users needed to sign in through the main
    interface in order to validate their credentials. Tao et al. (2014) selected AppWeb
    as the embedded Web server for the IoT Gateway of an intelligent granary management
    system because it could add the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to enable
    encrypted data connection. This was valuable because the network information was
    vulnerable as it came from a wireless channel. Kuroda et al. (2015) proposed a
    WSN with easy-to-use secure communication that was implemented using Zero-admin
    encrypt/decrypt functions at the MAC level with the Advanced Encryption Standard
    (AES-128), which enabled automatic encryption/decryption of messages between each
    sensor node and the coordinator node. 5. Recent works The following paragraphs
    are devoted to introducing some recent and representative works that were available
    online between May 2016 and July 2017, beyond the initial scope of the SLR process
    described so far. They cover areas such as communications, energy management,
    monitoring and logistics for agro-industrial and environmental applications. 5.1.
    Communications Low-power WAN (LPWAN) technologies such as SigFox, LoRa, narrowband
    IoT and others are becoming popular within IoT applications due to its reduced
    energy requirements, wide coverage range, and low-cost when compared to other
    long-distance technologies according to Barrachina-Muñoz et al. (2017). For example,
    in a recent survey by Sinha et al. (2017), authors found that LoRa is the best
    option for smart agriculture applications. In Lukas et al. (2015), authors designed
    a long-range water level monitoring system for troughs using a WSN based on LoRa
    transceivers, allowing the cattleman to observe water availability for livestock
    even when the barn was 1 or 3 km away. In a different application, (Pham et al.,
    2016) proposed an IoT framework to contribute to rural development implementing
    agricultural applications supported by open-source hardware and long-range communication
    devices. The first deployment of this solution used LoRa transceivers since rural
    villages were located in remote areas and it was convenient to have a low-cost
    and non-proprietary infrastructure. 5.2. Energy management One of the main requirements
    for devices used in IoT projects is that they must be energy-efficient according
    to Borgia (2014). This is particularly important for pervasive solutions deployed
    outdoors that can not be powered from the electric grid nor regularly maintained
    because they are installed in difficult or remote environments. In WSN scenarios,
    the current challenge is to develop multi-source energy harvesters and ultra-efficient
    sensors to create battery-free solutions, (Shaikh and Zeadally, 2016). These considerations
    are very important for IoT solutions for agro-industrial and environmental problems
    as recharging batteries is not practical and ambient energy sources are usually
    available. In terms of smart energy control for IoT projects, (Wang et al., 2016)
    proposed a novel energy management strategy for solar powered devices that intend
    to power the load directly from the solar cell, avoiding power converters and
    energy storage elements that contribute to energy losses, greater weight/volume
    ratio, and higher price. Another trend that is likely to continue is the development
    of self-power devices, such as the soil water content sensor for an autonomous
    landslide surveillance system designed by Lu et al. (2016). In this case, the
    sensor used the soil moisture to power itself making it suitable for large scale
    deployments. Marjanović et al. (2016) described a cloud-based decision-making
    mechanism for managing sensor data acquisition that is applicable to collaborative
    sensing solutions using distributed sensors, like mobile devices, to efficiently
    monitor large geographical areas. The system selected which sensors had to upload
    the information to the cloud to prevent the acquisition of redundant information
    from other nearby sensors for a specific coverage area, maintaining a spatial
    sampling quality and reducing in this way the battery depletion of the devices.
    5.3. Monitoring Recent environmental monitoring solutions are now offering additional
    capabilities in terms of decision making and management. For example, (Giorgetti
    et al., 2016) proposed a custom-made landslide risk monitoring system based on
    a WSN that allows fast deployments in hostile environments without human intervention
    because the system is able to deal with node failure and poor-quality communication
    links reorganizing the network by itself. Wong and Kerkez (2016) presented a Web
    service and real-time data architecture that includes an adaptive controller that
    updates the parameters of each sensing node within a WSN based on a previously
    defined policy. Zheng et al. (2016) proposed an IoT management system to protect
    the ecological and environmental quality while building an artificial river where
    nature and city converge. The system monitored key elements like soil, water,
    atmosphere, and wind at a high spatial resolution over a large area. Edwards-Murphy
    et al. (2016) introduced a beehive monitoring system that collects internal and
    external data to describe the status of the bee colony from a set of possible
    states using a classification algorithm based on decision trees. This information
    was used to determine if a visit to the beehive was required or not. As an additional
    result, authors found a strong correlation between the beehive status and the
    short-term rain forecast. Overall, this study is relevant for agriculture because
    crop pollination depends on honey bees. Sarangi et al. (2016) presented a framework
    for an automated crop-disease advisory service that integrates the interoperability
    of an IoT web repository with an agricultural advisory call center. The implemented
    system processes images of the diseased plant sent by the farmer, and then it
    provides the plant diagnosis and the corresponding management recommendation for
    the disease. 5.4. Logistics Food safety and quality control in logistics are emerging
    as IoT agribusiness areas in response to the demand from businesses and end consumers
    to obtain real-time information about food supply chain and “farm-to-fork” traceability.
    For instance, (Ruan and Shi, 2016) presented an IoT framework to assess the fruit
    freshness on e-commerce deliveries, which is a non-traditional retail service
    that faces unique challenges in transportation due to the product perishability
    and expensive logistics. Similarly, (Liu et al., 2016) introduced a pilot project
    using IoT to monitor food safety throughout the product life cycle, helping authorities
    and consumers to trace the food and make better decisions before buying it. In
    a related work, (Wang and Yue, 2017) proposed an early-warning system for food
    safety that automatically warns about product quality risks and incidents by sharing
    and centralizing information among supply chains. Lastly, (Capello et al., 2016)
    developed a business-to-business monitoring service based on IoT that provides
    geo-located information (humidity and temperature) about food storage and transportation
    without a vendor lock-in infrastructure. 6. Discussion 6.1. Limitations and open
    challenges After analyzing the difficulties and limitations described in selected
    papers from the SLR, the following list summarizes a few insights that aim to
    contribute to the mass adoption of IoT solutions in agricultural and environmental
    fields. • Stronger standardization: it will help to improve compatibility among
    different vendors and to ensure stronger security measures across the entire IoT
    stack, starting from field devices all the way up to cloud providers and end-user
    interfaces (Pang et al., 2015). • Better power management: it will increase the
    endurance of IoT solutions because nowadays the main factor limiting the lifespan
    of IoT deployments is energy depletion (Jain et al., 2008, Chen et al., 2014,
    Islam et al., 2014, Diedrichs et al., 2014). The lifespan can be improved by lowering
    the power consumption of each electronic module, including energy harvesters,
    and using alternative power storage mechanisms as replacements of rechargeable
    batteries, which affect the expiration date of deployed devices. • Security: a
    major challenge in the realization of the IoT in agriculture is the security problem
    (Jiang and Zhang, 2013), and the few works that consider it only incorporate fragmented
    strategies to mitigate it. Therefore, it is evident that there is a need for agro-industrial
    and environmental IoT solutions that address end-to-end information security and
    physical integrity of field devices. • Design using modular hardware and software:
    it will enable a greater degree of reuse and customization for the end user (Pang
    et al., 2015). • Improve unit cost: even though the cost of embedded computing
    platforms have been decreasing sharply, the same is not true for high-quality
    sensors and actuators. In order to deploy IoT solutions with hundreds and possibly
    thousands of nodes, the overall hardware, Internet access and international data
    roaming costs have to be reduced even further (Pang et al., 2015). • Aim for a
    good compatibility with legacy infrastructure: similarly to what has happened
    in industrial automation, it is important to deliver IoT solutions that can be
    integrated with the customer’s existing infrastructure such as specialized equipment,
    field machines, and software. • Consider scalability early on: with an increasing
    number of devices in large deployments, data synchronization and data reliability
    become critical (Diedrichs et al., 2014). • Adopt good practices of software engineering:
    as the scale and endurance of deployed IoT solutions grow, the time and effort
    devoted to analyzing generated data, refining the code, and adding new features
    will explode unless the software is well designed and documented (Hussain et al.,
    2006, Jayaraman et al., 2015a). • Improve robustness for field deployments: commercial
    IoT solution should be able to handle strong changes in temperature, humidity,
    and illumination to deal with seasonal changes and worldwide climate variability.
    • User-centered design: the installation and management of corresponding IoT nodes
    should be straight forward for non-expert users. Additionally, the hardware must
    require very little or none human maintenance during its lifespan, and the underlying
    communication network should be intelligent enough to reconfigure or heal itself
    in the case of a node failure. • Contribute to the IoT the ecosystem: there is
    a noticeable void in the literature on how to improve and adapt IoT solutions
    for real-world applications beyond simple prototypes (Chen et al., 2015). • Sustainable
    practices: even if the most humble predictions about the worldwide adoption of
    IoT devices become a reality, recycling strategies will have to be taken into
    account for new solutions deployed on the field, as an integral part of the product
    life cycle to reduce the environmental impact. 6.2. Proposed architecture To summarize
    the findings of this study, authors proposed the IoT architecture for agro-industrial
    and environmental applications that is illustrated in Fig. 13. This encapsulates
    most of the studies analyzed in this paper. The architecture has four main layers:
    physical, communication, service, and application. The physical layer includes
    perception and control. In perception, the main objective is to produce valuable
    data sensing field variables using a WSN. Data produced are sent to the communication
    layer through field gateways. Devices in the perception layer can be powered by
    batteries for short-term deployments or by solar panels because of their low-power
    consumption. In contrast, the control layer acts as a data sink, receiving information
    from a communication layer or a perception layer in the simplest case. Information
    received in the control layer alters the state of field actuators frequently requiring
    power from the electrical grid. In the middle of the perception and control layers
    there is a mobile robot that can be used when fixed devices are not the best option.
    In the communication layer, the objective is to move the information from the
    physical layer to the Internet, collecting data from IoT gateways based either
    on Ethernet or mobile networks (e.g: GPRS/3G/4G/NB-IoT and eventually 5G). This
    layer includes field gateways acting as interfaces between IoT gateways and transceivers
    using ZigBee, Bluetooth, NFC, WiFi, LoRA, or Sigfox. The service layer handles
    data ingestion from the communication layer, as well as their storage, analytics,
    visualization, and security. Finally, the application layer consumes services
    from the previous layer in the architecture and allows the user to handle monitoring,
    control, prediction, and logistics. Download : Download high-res image (717KB)

    and environmental applications. 7. Conclusions This paper presented an updated
    review of IoT applications for agro-industrial and environmental fields. It was
    guided by a systematic literature review, and therefore the methodology and intermediate
    results obtained during the stages of planning, conduction, and results were reported
    in great detail. From 3578 initial studies extracted from electronic sources,
    72 main studies were selected based on their relevance to answer two research
    questions. Selected studies came from five continents, and Asian countries contributed
    to more than half of them. During this study, it was discovered that most of the
    research still focuses on monitoring applications (62%); however there is a growing
    interest in closing the loop by doing control (25%), and there are some preliminary
    solutions in logistics and prediction (13%) for agro-industrial and environmental
    applications using IoT. The temperature and humidity of the air, as well as the
    soil moisture and solar radiation can be recognized as universal variables measured
    in agricultural applications based on selected studies. Similarly, actuators such
    as valves, pumps, motors, sprinklers, humidifiers, and lamps were widely used
    in irrigation, fertilization, pesticide management, and illumination control.
    It was also observed that new energy sources and Cloud storage have not been widely
    adopted, showing that there are opportunities for research and development in
    these areas. Studies included in this paper provide a compact view of solutions
    proposed for agro-industrial and environmental problems during the last decade.
    It was found that most of them relied heavily on heterogeneous components and
    wireless sensor networks. However, it seems reasonable to assume that future solutions
    will need to fully embrace Cloud services and new ways of connectivity in order
    to get the benefits of a truly connected and smart IoT ecosystem. Acknowledgements

  explanation: This paper proposes a smart irrigation system for remote monitoring
    and control of water usage in arid and Saharan regions like southern Algeria.
    It leverages the Internet of Things (IoT) and communication technologies to optimize
    water consumption and reduce labor costs. Wireless sensor networks collect data
    on soil moisture, water levels, and other factors, which is then transmitted via
    a smart gateway to a web service for analysis and automated irrigation decisions.
  extract_1: All data collected by the wireless sensor network are used by the system
    to handle an intelligent, automated irrigation of vegetation (by saving water
    and energy use) and can be accessed in real time via a web application in smartphones,
    which can also send alerts and commands when the ground is too dry or a lack of
    water in the basin and offer suggestions to maximize plant health.
  extract_2: This paper proposes a smart irrigation system based on ICT and IoT technologies.
    Using these technologies, the control of irrigation will be ensured at low cost
    and high accuracy.

    currently experiencing a significant deterioration because of its dependence on
    oil revenues, which drops in prices recently. Therefore, it is necessary to revive
    the Algerian economy with other important sectors, mainly agricultural sector
    especially in the south of Algeria. The southern Algeria Contain all necessary
    conditions for agriculture, which are the large agricultural areas, water resources
    and good illumination (sunlight).The mismanagement of irrigation water affects
    negatively the agricultural production of Algeria because of the shortage of irrigation
    water. Thus, with the benefit of the Internet of Things and the smart technologies,
    we will propose in this paper a new strategy for smart irrigation in southern
    Algeria regions, to optimize the water consumption, and to provide a remote control
    and monitoring for the irrigation system. Tests were realized to prove the validity
    of our proposed system by using Contiki-Cooja simulator. Published in: 2015 Fourth

    IEEE Conference Location: Luton, UK SECTION I. Introduction Recently, the Algerian
    economy starts to decline due to the drop in oil prices. The decline in oil prices
    shows the dependence and vulnerability of a system built on the only resource
    of the hydrocarbon sector. In this case, it is urgent to develop other sectors
    of the economy to reduce the dependence on hydrocarbons. Agriculture is a strategic
    and important sector for economic development, especially in southern Algeria.
    This Saharan and semi-arid region has all conditions required for agriculture;
    there are wide agricultural surfaces, sun light and large water resources. Agricultural
    production, including livestock production, consumes more fresh water than any
    other activity in the world. Agricultural irrigation accounts for 85% of the consumed
    fresh water over the planet, and this percentage will continue to be dominant
    in water consumption due to population growth and the increasing of demand for
    food [1]. In general, poor irrigation management affects agricultural production,
    for this purpose it is necessary to develop strategies to optimize irrigation.
    An automated irrigation system is designed to monitor and control the various
    factors derived from an agricultural field such as humidity, water level, temperature,
    and human interaction. This system is generally composed of controllers and a
    wireless sensor network using ZigBee as the transmission technology for detecting
    values of an agricultural field. The sensors gather the various agricultural factors
    in real time and transmit them using Internet of Thing (IoT) applications [2].
    The control architecture of smart agriculture based on cloud computing and IOT
    is presented in [3]. The integration of modern technology in irrigation management
    system is one of the ways to improve the irrigation processes to optimize the
    use of water, electricity consumption and labor costs. In this regard, with the
    new technology and the development of the Internet and the Internet of Things,
    we will propose in this paper a strategy for smart irrigation in southern Algeria
    regions based on the use of the Internet of Things and new communication technologies.
    In this paper, this new scheme proposed for intelligent irrigation using IoT is
    an extension of our already attendant solution [4]. This new mechanism allows
    the farmer to monitor and manage agricultural area using smart phones via Internet.
    The rest of paper is organized as follow: in section 2 we will present generality
    about basic notions of Internet of Things, the section 3 presents current state
    of information and communication technology (ICT) in Algeria, our proposed approach
    will be presented in section 4 and finally, a conclusion and proposed perspectives
    of this work will be presented in section 5. SECTION II. Generality A. Internet
    of Things (IoT) The term “Internet of Things” was first used by the Massachusetts
    Institute of Technology in the year 1999[5]. There are several definitions of
    the Internet of Things. Definitions focus on technical aspects of IoT when the
    other based on the applications and functionalities. Some definition defined IoT
    as “an extension of the current Internet to all objects that can communicate directly
    or indirectly with electronic equipment and connected to the Internet”[6]. Other
    defied as “a novel paradigm that is rapidly gaining ground in the scenario of
    modern wireless telecommunications. The basic idea of this concept is the pervasive
    presence around us of a variety of things or objects - such as Radio-Frequency
    IDentification (RFID) tags, sensors, actuators, mobile phones, etc. - which, through
    unique addressing schemes, are able to interact with each other and cooperate
    with their neighbors to reach common goals”[7]. B. The Application Domains of
    IoT According to the definition of IoT, this technology can be applied in all
    domains possible but in reality IoT applied in specific domains. We categorize
    this application into four application domains: 1) Daily Life A Smartphone become
    a necessity in our life, several application for Apple iOS, Google Android and
    Windows Phone operating can be used for interfacing sensors measuring various
    parameters, which implies that facilitate the use of the concept of IoT in our
    daily life [8]. The use of IOT in daily live appear in several application such
    as control of home equipment such as air conditioners, refrigerators, washing
    machines, etc [8]. Sensors and actuators distributed in houses and offices can
    make our life more comfortable in several aspects, and domestic incidents can
    be avoided with appropriate monitoring and alarm systems, etc. [7]. Other application
    necessary of IoT like for losses, IoT can be helped to find objects that we don''t
    remember where have been left. Or in thefts an application similar to the previous
    one may leave the user to know if some objects are moved from a restricted area
    which would indicate that the object is being stolen [7]. 2) Transportation and
    Mobility Transport domain is one of most important domains, and one of the most
    complicated domains. Urban traffic is the main contributor to traffic noise pollution
    and a major contributor to urban air quality degradation and greenhouse gas emissions.
    Traffic congestion directly imposes significant costs on economic and social activities
    in most cities [8]. Advanced cars, trains, buses as well as bicycles along with
    roads and/or rails are becoming more instrumented with sensors, actuators, and
    processing power. Roads themselves are also equipped with tags and sensors that
    send important information to traffic control sites to better route the traffic,
    provide the tourist with appropriate transportation information. In this domain
    exist several applications such us assisted driving offer collision avoidance
    systems and monitoring of transportation of hazardous materials, or mobile ticketing
    and augmented maps [7]. 3) Work Environment In this domain they are several uses
    of IoT such us Industrial plants, enterprise, logistics, etc. Sensors have always
    been a part of the factory setup for security, automation, climate control, etc.
    Which ultimately will be replaced by a wireless system giving the opportunity
    to make changes to the configuration whenever necessary? It is nothing but a subnet
    IoT dedicated to the maintenance of the plant [8]. In industrial plants, IoT also
    contribute to improving the automation of industrial plants with a massive deployment
    of RFID tags associated with production parts. An event is generated by the reader
    with all the necessary data, such as RFID number, and stored on the network. The
    machine / robot is notified by the event and picks up part of the production [7].
    Logistics is a work domain but also attached to the transport domain including
    the management of transport offers good logistics management. With the application
    of IoT can improve these domains to offers the best customer services. 4) Others
    Utilities Other domains are necessary need the IoT as a Healthcare domain, military
    and smart environment, etc. In the military domain smart objects can protect the
    lives of people. In another side many benefits of IoT technologies in healthcare
    and resulting applications can be grouped essentially of: tracking objects and
    people, the identification and authentication of people, automatic data collection
    and sensing of sickness [7]. One of the major IoT application areas that are already
    drawing attention is Smart Environment IoT. There are several test beds being
    implemented and many more planned in the coming years. Other use of the IoT is
    Smart museum and gym and Monitoring environmental parameters. Smart museum and
    gym as to smart leisure environments, the museum and the gym are two representative
    examples where the IoT technologies can help in exploiting their facilities at
    the best. Monitoring environmental parameters perishable goods such as fruits,
    fresh-cut produce, meat, and dairy products are vital parts of our nutrition.
    From the production to the consumption sites thousands of kilometers or even more
    are covered and during the transportation the conservation status need to be monitored
    to avoid uncertainty in quality levels for distribution decisions. Pervasive computing
    and sensor technologies offer great potential for improving the efficiency of
    the food supply chain [3]. C. The Protocols Layer of the IoT Protocols layer of
    the IoT consists of 4 main layers: a) Physical and Data Link Layers The most common
    physical layer protocols used (10,100, 1G) WiFi (802.11b, g, n), GSM, 3G, LTE,
    4G, IEEE 802.15.4, PLC, etc. b) Network Layer The protocols of this layer are
    IPv6, RPL. • Routing Protocol for Low and Lossy Networks (RPL) The Internet Engineering
    Task Force (IETF) formed a new Working Group called ROLL (Routing Over Low-power
    and Lossy networks) in 2008[6] which was defined a new protocol RPL to solve de
    problem of Low power and Lossy Networks (LLN). Algorithmic and protocolary foundations
    of RPL described in RFC 6550[10]. RPL was developed from four sets of requirements
    that represent the four main foreseen uses of WSN: Home Automation, Building Automation,
    Industrial and Urban environments [15]. RPL is a Distance Vector IPv6 routing
    protocol for LLNs that specifies how to build a Destination Oriented Directed
    Acyclic Graph (DoDAG) using an objective function and a set of metrics/constraints
    [9]. The objective functions to adapt the generic behavior to a particular environment
    and specify more precisely the rules of construction of DoDAG [11]. RPL is based
    on the topological concept of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). The DAG defines
    a tree-like structure that specifies the default routes between nodes in the LLN.
    However, a DAG structure is more than a typical tree in the sense that a node
    might associate to multiple parent nodes in the DAG, in contrast to classical
    trees where only one parent is allowed. More specifically, RPL organizes nodes
    as Destination-Oriented DAGs (DODAGs), where most popular destination nodes (i.e.
    sinks) or those providing a default route to the Internet (i.e. gateways) act
    as the roots of the DAGs. A network may consist of one or several DODAGs, which
    form together an RPL instance identified by a unique ID, called RPLInstanceID.
    RPL defines three types of nodes: Low Power and Lossy Border Routers (LBRs): it
    refers to the root of a DODAG that represents a collection point in the network
    and has the ability to construct a DAG. The LBR also acts as a gateway (or edge
    router) between the Internet and the LLN. Router: it refers to a device that can
    forward and generate traffic. Such a router does not have the ability to create
    a new DAG, but associate to an existing one. Host: it refers to an end-device
    that is capable of generating data traffic, but is not able to forward traffic
    [14]. c) Transport Layer There are two protocols: TCP, UDP. d) Application Layer
    There are several protocols in this layer but the most important protocols are:
    HTTP (TCP), CoAP (UDP). Appear of IoT and the limits of IP architecture obliged
    to define new protocols and an adaptive layer. • Constrained Application Protocol
    CoAP The IETF Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is an application-layer
    protocol designed to provide a REST-like interface [16]. The CoAP protocol can
    remove HTTP limitations constrained environment while ensuring high compatibility
    with existing. It is relatively easy to turn HTTP requests in CoAP queries. A
    old device connected to an IPv4 network may well request access to a resource
    on a connected server to an IPv6 network and gateway translates between the two
    worlds [11]. Thus the side of a sensor network, we can use the protocol stack
    CoAP / UDP / 6LoWPAN for IPv6 auto configuration properties and the small size
    of the battery, and it will keep the Internet side HTTP stack / TCP / IPv4 which
    is present on all devices. If, for example, an iPhone wants to know the temperature
    measured by a sensor, it will send its HTTP request, it will be transformed into
    CoAP by a bridge, and the answer may be stored for a period specified by the sensor
    in the gateway. If another device on the Internet requires the same value during
    this time interval, it will not be necessary to propagate the query to the sensor
    [11]. • CoAP vs HTTP CoAP is network-oriented protocol, using similar features
    to HTTP but also allows for low overhead, multicast, etc. As HTTP protocol is
    a long-term successful standard, it can use small script to integrate various
    resources and services. Interoperation provided by HTTP is the key point of IoT,
    for this, http is employed in application level. However, HTTP is based on TCP
    protocol using point to point (p2p) communication model that not suitable for
    notification push services. Also, for constrained devices, HTTP is too complex.
    Unlike HTTP based protocols, CoAP operates over UDP instead of using complex congestion
    control as in TCP [12]. CoAP is based on REST architecture, which is a general
    design for accessing Internet resources. In order to overcome disadvantage in
    constrained resource, CoAP need to optimize the length of datagram and provide
    reliable communication. On one side, CoAP provides URI, REST method such as GET,
    POST, PUT, and DELETE. On the other side, based on lightweight UDP protocol, CoAP
    allows IP multicast, which satisfies group communication for IoT. To compensate
    for the unreliability of UDP protocol, CoAP defines a retransmission mechanism
    and provides resource discovery mechanism with resource description [13]. e) A
    Version of IPv6 Adapted to Constrained Networks 6LoWPAN In 2005, the IETF chartered
    the IPv6 over Low Power, Wireless Networks (6LoWPAN) working group to standardize
    adaptations oflPv6 over mesh networks composed of low-power, wireless links [9].
    The difference in size of the package IPv6 and datagram of IEEE 802.15.4 obliged
    6LoWPAN group to define encapsulation and header compression mechanisms that allow
    IPv6 packets to be sent to and received from over IEEE 802.15.4 based networks.
    SECTION III. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in Algeria Algeria
    wants to position itself as one of the strongholds of the wireless Internet in
    the Maghreb. The development of Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity), WiMax (Worldwide Interoperability
    for Microwave Access) is a wireless data transmission standard, with a theoretical
    speed of 70 megabits per second, the equivalent of hundreds of ADSL (Asymmetric
    Digital Subscriber Line) connections with range of 50 kilometers. This wireless
    radio technology that aims to connect any wireless equipment: access points Wi-Fi,
    IP phone, mobile phone. The commercialization of wireless telephony in fixed mode
    (4G LTE) has just started through all the capitals of the 48 provinces of the
    country with a gradual roll in each province. This new generation of wireless
    technology used in the majority of developed countries to provid users a remote
    and speed access to the Internet that not depend on fixed phone lines as ADSL
    and with a higher performance, as the incumbent Algeria Telecom has launched this
    technology. Choosing the 4G LTE was motivated to its flexibility, easy to deploy
    and competitiveness. SECTION IV. Our Approach A. The System Design The communications
    technologies in the Internet of Things is developing rapidly in recent years so
    it can meet the demands of the connections between the physical world “things”
    and “human”. Thus, the use of smartphones helps to handle remote objects via Internet.
    Our approach proposed in this paper is mainly based on our system for irrigation
    shown in [4]. The difference is that here we have used the technologies of the
    Internet of things for smart irrigation management in southern Algeria via the
    Internet, and using smart phones. As shown in figure 1, this system consists of:
    wireless sensor network system, the 6LoWPAN smart gateway that connects the Zigbee
    network with the internet via mobile communication network (4G LTE). The sensors
    placed in the agricultural field, measure continuously the soil moisture values,
    the water tank level and the water well level, then send these values through
    a ZigBee mesh network to a smart gateway (Generic IoT Border Router Wireless Br
    1000), those information are then sent via a mobile data communication 4G LTE
    network to a web service that uses intelligent software application to automatically
    analyze the data and act according to the obtained results, by selective activation
    of controllers as needed. The routing protocol used in this proposed design is
    the RPL protocol. The outputs results and irrigation recommendations are presented
    to the user on a smart phone web application using CoAP or HTTPs interfaces. Our
    system focuses on the following performance objectives to ensure its widespread
    adoption by farmers: The system is easy to deploy, to use, and facilitates planning
    of irrigation tasks. The system is modular and flexible, making it easy to maintain
    The system design is robust and reliable. Fig. 1. The system design. Show All
    The Smart gateway connects the two parts of our system (the first part: the wireless
    sensor networks and controllers, the second parts: is the internet and smartphones),
    it is the 6LoWPAN Border Router translates between the two standardized protocol
    stacks. In addition it is an application level gateway for other IoT protocols
    such as Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread, and ZigBee. WLAN or LTE may be used for
    the uplink to the Internet [17]. B. Communication in Our System The network of
    our system consists of several tiny devices (sensors, microcontrollers, smart
    gateway) that communicate with themselves via a Low and Lossy networks (LLNs),
    using the routing protocol dedicated to this type of network called RPL (Routing
    protocol for Low and Lossy networks). This LLN network is connected to the internet
    by a smart 6lowpan gateway that represents the root of the RPL, as it shown in
    figure 2. The construction of DODAG involves two phases. Phase 1. Creating the
    up paths (from the root to the nodes): The smart gateway sends a DIO message (DAG
    Information Object) to its neighbors which are (coordinators nodes, sensors detection
    of the water level and the controller of the electric pump) for the construction
    of DODAG. Each one of these neighbors in turn send a DIO message to its neighbors
    in each irrigation area for the creation of the DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graph).
    Phase 2. Creating the down paths (from the nodes to the root): Each node in the
    network when receiving the DIO Message send a DAO message (Destination Advertisement
    Object) to its root for creating paths to the root and filling tables routing.
    The soil moisture sensors measure soil moisture, these values must be sent to
    the root nodes of sub-DAGs (coordinators nodes). Each soil moisture sensor sends
    the measured values to his favorite parent until the reception of these values
    by the coordinator node, this latter calculates the average of the received values
    and send them to the smart gateway. Fig. 2. The system communication. Show All
    The sensors detection of the water level measure the water level in the well and
    in the tank, also send these measured values to the smart gateway. The smart gateway
    sends the received values (soil moisture values and water level values) via a
    mobile communication network (4G LTE) to the farmer. The farmer can check the
    soil moisture values, and also water level in the tank and in the well with smart
    phone application that connect directly to the smart gateway using http or CoAP
    protocols. Therefore, the farmer may decide either the irrigation of dry areas
    or filling the tank by sending a response to the gateway, which represent an intermediate
    that send this response to the coordinator node in order to control the opening
    and closing of the solenoid valves or to electric pump controller in order to
    activate or deactivate the electric pump in the well according to the specific
    needs. In the case where the values of soil moisture or the values of the water
    level in the tank are critical which means that areas are dry or the water level
    in the tank is minimum, our system will automatically pass to standalone mode
    (our proposed system in [4]), which makes our system tolerant to faults. SECTION
    V. Simulation and Discussion of Result In order to validate the Performance of
    our approach by simulation, we use Cooja simulator provided by Contiki, which
    unlike most simulators also allows real hardware platforms to be emulated [18].
    This simulation is about how the network converged and stabilized using the RPL
    protocol and OFO implementation of ContikiRPL. The simulation scripts consists
    of RPL sender nodes and LLN Border Router (LBR) programs which are emulated as
    Tmote sky nodes and derived from Cooja and uIPv6 module including UDP, ICMPv6,
    IPv6, SICSLoWPAN and Rime of the Contiki kernel [19] [20]. With the help of the
    CollectView tool [21] provided by Cooja, the following metrics could be observed:
    The time taken to find the first source-destination pair in the whole network;
    The time taken for the network to fully converge when all nodes join the network
    tree; The time taken for the network to fully stabilize after convergence, the
    time taken for the Estimated Transmission Count (ETX) value for each node. As
    shown in figure 3, our network consists of 15 RPL nodes; deployed in an irrigation
    land which composed of 3 areas, where each area consist of 4 RPL sender nodes,
    and the RPL sender nodes in the tank and in the well, all these nodes are connected
    to The RPL border router, and this router is used in order to interface a regular
    IP network with an RPL 6LoWPAN network. Fig. 3. The network simulation in cooja.
    Show All Figures 4 and 5, presents the network tree and the communication between
    DAGs roots (node 2.2, node 3.3, node 4.4, node 5.5, node 6.6) and DODAG root (RPL
    border router node 1.1). Fig. 4. Communication between nodes. Show All Fig. 5.
    The network tree. Show All All data collected by the wireless sensor network are
    used by the system to handle an intelligent, automated irrigation of vegetation
    (by saving water and energy use) and can be accessed in real time via a web application
    in smartphones, which can also send alerts and commands when the ground is too
    dry or a lack of water in the basin and offer suggestions to maximize plant health.
    These first results obtained by simulation using the Cooja simulator are satisfactory,
    especially in routing information by RPL and COAP protocols. This will encourage
    us to go further towards creating a web application in smartphones to complete
    all the proposed system and facilitate the tasks of the farmers for a good monitoring
    of their agriculture. Also, we hope that this approach will be very beneficial
    if we can experiment it in the fields of agriculture especially in Saharan and
    arid areas such as the south of Algeria. SECTION VI. Conclusion The intelligent
    technologies play a very important role for an effective management of irrigation,
    we have proposed in this article a smart irrigation system for a Saharan area
    like the south of Algeria. This proposed system is based on ICT and IoT technologies.
    Using these technologies, the control of irrigation will be ensured at low cost
    and high accuracy. Our proposed system facilitates the irrigation tasks and optimizes
    the costs in term of minimizing the water consummation and reducing the cost of
    the working force. The validation of the proposed approach by simulation showed
    us the value and the importance of the adoption of WSN and IoT technologies in
    precision farming. As a perspective we plan to complete the implementation of
    our system using the CoAP protocol and web application for monitoring the irrigation
    via the internet using IoT, and also to apply this system in real world. Authors

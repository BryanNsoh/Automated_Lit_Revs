    \ municipalities employ the smart city model in large cities to improve the quality\n\
    of life of their residents, utilize local resources efﬁciently, and save operating\
    \ expenses. This model\nincorporates many heterogeneous technologies such as Cyber-Physical\
    \ Systems (CPS), Wireless\nSensor Networks (WSNs), and Cloud Computing (ClCom).\
    \ However, effective networking and\ncommunication protocols are required to provide\
    \ the essential harmonization and control of the many\nsystem mechanisms to achieve\
    \ these crucial goals. The networking requirements and characteristics\nof smart\
    \ city applications (SCAs) are identiﬁed in this study, as well as the networking\
    \ protocols\nthat can be utilized to serve the diverse data trafﬁc ﬂows that are\
    \ required between the dissimilar\nmechanisms. Additionally, we show examples\
    \ of the networking designs of a few smart city systems,\nsuch as smart transport,\
    \ smart building, smart home, smart grid, smart water, pipeline monitoring,\n\
    and control systems.\nKeywords: smart city; IoT applications; networking architectures;\
    \ Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS);\nWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)\n1. Introduction\n\
    Nowadays, several municipalities implement the smart city model [1] to improve\n\
    the quality of life for their citizens and the efﬁcient use of city resources.\
    \ Intelligent\nservices can decrease operational costs and resource expenditure\
    \ in smart cities. They can\nenhance performance and operations in a wide variety\
    \ of smart city applications (SCAs)\nincluding transportation, healthcare, energy,\
    \ education, and many more. Smart services are\nprovided by various cutting-edge\
    \ technologies supporting the smart city model. Examples\nof these technologies\
    \ include the internet of things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs),\nCyber-Physical\
    \ Systems (CPS), Cloud Computing (ClCom), fog computing (FoC), big data\nanalytics,\
    \ and robots.\nIoT is the core technology used in smart cities, bringing plentiful\
    \ human life beneﬁts [2].\nIoT enables the integration of physical objects/smart\
    \ things into urban environments\nwhere innovative services are offered to support\
    \ every activity at any time and from any\nlocation [2]. Things are monitored\
    \ by IoT applications that make direct decisions for their\nefﬁcient management.\
    \ Moreover, things state their conditions, such as battery status and\nfault reporting\
    \ for prognostic maintenance. WSNs offer real-time monitoring of the state\nof\
    \ the infrastructure and resources in a smart city [3]. Wireless sensor devices\
    \ can also\nobtain physical environment information such as temperature. In a\
    \ CPS, the computation,\nnetworking, and physical processes are put together to\
    \ control and monitor the physical\nenvironment of a smart city [4]. In smart\
    \ cities, CPSs are employed to offer practical\nconnections between the virtual\
    \ and physical worlds. Applications for smart cities can\nbe sustained by the\
    \ ClCom paradigm that provides a scalable and affordable platform\nElectronics\

    \ FogC offers reduced latency, greater mobility,\nlocation awareness, streaming,\
    \ and real-time response for SCAs [6]. Smart cities have\ndispersed vast numbers\
    \ of sensors, and thus large-scale data processing requires a complex\ninfrastructure.\
    \ Robotics in the cloud can be an effective computing tool for IoT applications\n\
    that require a lot of data processing [7]. To improve the services offered by\
    \ smart cities,\nbig data analytics is employed to generate intelligent and optimal\
    \ temporary and lasting\ndecisions [8].\nThe abovementioned technologies are used\
    \ to implement numerous smart city ser-\nvices [9,10]. For instance, intelligent\
    \ transportation services are applied to improve route\nplanning and avoid jamming\
    \ in city streets. These services can enhance vehicular safety\nand make possible\
    \ self-driving cars. Furthermore, parking services and smart trafﬁc light\ncontrols\
    \ are provided. Smart energy services [10] (e.g., intelligent energy management\n\
    and energy consumption prediction) are used to sustain smart grids and smart buildings.\n\
    These services can also offer improved utilization of renewable energy. Additional\
    \ smart\nservices are engaged in real-time monitoring of bridges, tunnels, water\
    \ networks, train and\nsubway rails, and gas and oil pipelines. Structural health\
    \ monitoring is also feasible using\nsmart services [11]. Last but not least,\
    \ there are smart services that focus on monitoring the\nenvironment, public safety,\
    \ and security of citizens [12].\nAll these smart city services necessitate a\
    \ reliable networking infrastructure to efﬁ-\nciently exchange messages between\
    \ the modules of a smart city system implementing a\nparticular smart service.\
    \ In particular, smart city services need a variety of networking and\ncommunication\
    \ technologies for their completion because they are proposed for dissim-\nilar\
    \ scales. For example, smart services for smart buildings must be implemented\
    \ based\non Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4) or Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) network protocols.\
    \ On the other\nhand, smart services for the smart grid must be mainly implemented\
    \ using the WiMAX\n(IEEE 802.16) network protocol. From another viewpoint, smart\
    \ city services can exploit\ndissimilar network and communication models and solutions.\n\
    Until now, the networking and communication components of smart city systems have\n\
    received little research attention. To the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive\
    \ survey\nof network architectures and protocols for IoT applications in smart\
    \ cities does not exist\nand is the goal of this study. The communication and\
    \ networking issues involved in smart\ncity systems are examined in this study.\
    \ This paper considers networking technologies,\ntopologies, and communication\
    \ requirements for such systems. It also examines if current\nnetwork protocols\
    \ are appropriate for certain smart city services. This paper surveys recent\n\
    developments in networking architectures to support SCAs. As this is an active\
    \ area, this\npaper is important to support new research in this ﬁeld. The paper\
    \ contributes as follows:\n1.\nIt presents network requirements of the major SCAs\
    \ including intelligent transporta-\ntion, smart buildings, pipeline monitoring\
    \ and control, smart water networks, smart\ngrids, and manufacturing control and\
    \ monitoring.\n2.\nIt reviews networking architectures used for the above applications\
    \ focusing mainly\non the protocols’ suitability.\nThe remainder of this paper\
    \ is structured as follows: Section 2 describes SCAs;\nSection 3 presents network\
    \ requirements and protocols used for important SCAs;\nSections 4 and 5 analyze\
    \ protocols and network architectures for smart grids, smart build-\nings, smart\
    \ water and pipeline network monitoring, and smart transportation; Section 6\n\
    summarizes the paper, while Section 7 provides open research directions; lastly,\
    \ Section 8\nconcludes the paper. Figure 1 provides the layout of the survey.\n\

    \ were not related to\nour concerned ﬁeld were also crossed out. After eliminating\
    \ inappropriate articles, only\n226 studies were identiﬁed.\n2. Smart City Applications\n\
    This section discusses the main SCAs used in diverse domains. To understand what\n\
    type of assistance is needed by the networking infrastructures offered for SCAs,\
    \ their\nadvantages and design problems were addressed.\nIn the energy sector,\
    \ SCAs are being used to increase the reliability, efﬁciency, and\nsustainability\
    \ of electric energy generation and distribution in smart grids [14]. A smart\
    \ grid\nis a new power grid system that automatically collects and reacts to available\
    \ information\nabout supplier and consumer behavior. Smart grids use CPS to supply\
    \ self-monitoring and\nsuperior control mechanisms for power generation and consumer\
    \ demand, improving grid\nreliability and efﬁciency. CPS systems are also used\
    \ to manage the process of producing\nrenewable energy from wind turbines [15].\n\
    Certain applications are utilized in smart buildings to monitor and manage energy\n\
    consumption [16]. CPS controls the equipment in the buildings, including the Heating,\n\
    Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems; appliances; and lighting systems.\n\
    Different kinds of sensor nodes, which keep track of the current state of the\
    \ environment\nand energy consumption, are typically included in smart building\
    \ systems. A centralized\nmonitoring and control system receives observations\
    \ and measurements from these sensors.\nBased on reported observations, current\
    \ operational circumstances, and environmental\nfactors, the control system employs\
    \ intelligent algorithms to manage the sub-systems\nemployed in the buildings\
    \ to optimize energy consumption.\nIntelligent transportation is another SCA that\
    \ has attracted a lot of interest in the\ntransportation sector. Applications\
    \ related to vehicle safety are among the most crucial\ntypes of such applications.\
    \ Vehicles can be equipped with a variety of safety features,\nsuch as blind spot\
    \ monitoring, emergency braking, collision avoidance systems, and lane\nchange\
    \ warning signs. To improve driving safety, these applications offer full or semi-\n\
    automatic operations. Real-time and reliability support in detection and response\
    \ are these\napplications’ most crucial characteristics. Applications for enhancing\
    \ vehicle safety must\nbe dependable and able to operate in real-time in all aspects\
    \ such as threat observations,\ndecision making, communication, and actions. However,\
    \ the software cannot handle\nhigh levels of incorporation across all the relevant\
    \ devices and guarantee real-time and\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n5 of 63\ntrustworthy\
    \ replies. Furthermore, self-driving vehicles are regarded as crucial SCAs [17].\n\
    They combine all the aforementioned capabilities with vision and monitoring equipment\n\
    to provide the vehicle the ability to traverse the roads using sensed data and\
    \ intelligent\nsoftware that evaluates and reacts to these data in real-time.\
    \ Intelligent trafﬁc light controls,\nwhich incorporate device monitoring across\
    \ numerous locations to precisely forecast trafﬁc\npatterns, are another application\
    \ of intelligent transportation. The authors of [18] present\nan example of intelligent\
    \ trafﬁc lights.\nWater networks are maintained using smart city technology to\
    \ increase their intelli-\ngence, efﬁciency, dependability, and sustainability.\
    \ CPS systems are integrated into water\nnetworks to add smart characteristics\
    \ to the processes of water distribution [19]. Offering\nearly warning systems\
    \ to identify problems in water networks is one of these duties. For\ninstance,\
    \ it is simple to identify leaks and pipe bursts. Quick, temporary ﬁxes can be\n\
    implemented to prevent water wastage and future network threats or damage [20].\n\
    WSN-based monitoring of greenhouses is another SCA. Such monitoring provides\n\
    well-organized control for appropriate soil, climate, lighting, and water level\
    \ in green-\nhouses [21]. Other smart city systems are deployed in the industry\
    \ to automate, control,\nmonitor, and improve manufacturing procedures [22,23].\
    \ Finally, smart-healthcare systems\nbased on edge computing [24] are proposed\
    \ to monitor and examine the physical health of\nusers [25].\nFigure 2 shows some\
    \ important applications including smart trafﬁc surveillance\nand management,\
    \ smart healthcare, weather and air quality monitoring, smart waste\nmanagement,\
    \ smart street lighting, smart emergency response system, and smart home.\n \n\
    observations, decision making, communication, and actions. However, the software\
    \ \ncannot handle high levels of incorporation across all the relevant devices\
    \ and guarantee \nreal-time and trustworthy replies. Furthermore, self-driving\
    \ vehicles are regarded as \ncrucial SCAs [17]. They combine all the aforementioned\
    \ capabilities with vision and \nmonitoring equipment to provide the vehicle the\
    \ ability to traverse the roads using \nsensed data and intelligent software that\
    \ evaluates and reacts to these data in real-time. \nIntelligent traffic light\
    \ controls, which incorporate device monitoring across numerous \nlocations to\
    \ precisely forecast traffic patterns, are another application of intelligent\
    \ \ntransportation. The authors of [18] present an example of intelligent traffic\
    \ lights. \nWater networks are maintained using smart city technology to increase\
    \ their intel-\nligence, efficiency, dependability, and sustainability. CPS systems\
    \ are integrated into \nwater networks to add smart characteristics to the processes\
    \ of water distribution [19]. \nOffering early warning systems to identify problems\
    \ in water networks is one of these \nduties. For instance, it is simple to identify\
    \ leaks and pipe bursts. Quick, temporary fixes \ncan be implemented to prevent\
    \ water wastage and future network threats or damage \n[20]. \nWSN-based monitoring\
    \ of greenhouses is another SCA. Such monitoring provides \nwell-organized control\
    \ for appropriate soil, climate, lighting, and water level in green-\nhouses [21].\
    \ Other smart city systems are deployed in the industry to automate, control,\
    \ \nmonitor, and improve manufacturing procedures [22,23]. Finally, smart-healthcare\
    \ sys-\ntems based on edge computing [24] are proposed to monitor and examine\
    \ the physical \nhealth of users [25]. \nFigure 2 shows some important applications\
    \ including smart traffic surveillance and \nmanagement, smart healthcare, weather\
    \ and air quality monitoring, smart waste man-\nagement, smart street lighting,\
    \ smart emergency response system, and smart home. \n \nFigure 2. Facilitating\
    \ networking and communication amongst SCAs.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n6 of\
    \ 63\nAnalysis of Smart City Applications/Systems\nThis subsection analyses the\
    \ SCAs shown in Figure 2.\nSmart Trafﬁc Surveillance Systems: These systems are\
    \ based on centralized pro-\ncesses and may fail due to networking problems. Thus,\
    \ to automate such an innova-\ntive system, centralized and distributed methods\
    \ must be used to maintain local servers.\nJavaid et al. [26] suggested a smart\
    \ trafﬁc management system using a mixture of central-\nized and decentralized\
    \ processes to optimize the ﬂow of vehicles on roads and an algorithm\nto manage\
    \ a variety of trafﬁc conditions efﬁciently. In the context of smart cities, effec-\n\
    tive trafﬁc management implies that a decision-making model identiﬁes and quantiﬁes\n\
    trafﬁc congestion as well as predicts trafﬁc patterns. Afrin and Yodo [27] offered\
    \ a theoreti-\ncal analysis that takes into account such effective trafﬁc management.\
    \ Notably, existing\ndecision-making models are primarily devoted to urban and\
    \ highway trafﬁc management,\nnot considering the closed campuses and collector\
    \ roads scenarios. Sarrab et al. [28] iden-\ntiﬁed this weakness and proposed\
    \ an IoT-based system model that collects, processes,\nand stores real-time trafﬁc\
    \ data for such an unusual scenario. In an IoT-based trafﬁc man-\nagement system,\
    \ various challenges emerge. These challenges include security issues,\nextremely\
    \ sophisticated networking equipment, network overhead, required adjustments,\n\
    and speciﬁc information ﬁelds in the protocol header and structure, as well as\
    \ higher costs.\nSmart Healthcare Systems: For real-time monitoring of health\
    \ parameters, these sys-\ntems are progressively being associated with and connected\
    \ via the Internet to numerous\ntypes of available smart wearable sensing and\
    \ computing devices. These systems face\nseveral problems [29] that must be resolved.\
    \ A security/privacy perspective, inter-realm au-\nthentication, interoperability\
    \ issues, device-to-device informal communication, and collec-\ntion and management\
    \ of medical data are among the issues on this list. Alromaihi et al. [30]\naddressed\
    \ issues related to cyber-security while using IoT for such applications. They\n\
    sought to examine secure techniques’ deployment and implementation from the perspec-\n\
    tive of preventing and reducing cyber-attacks on IoT devices. Some crucial surveys\
    \ and\nreviews [31,32] on smart healthcare applications tackle the problem of\
    \ integrating IoT\nsystems with any healthcare application particularly.\nWeather\
    \ and Air Quality Monitoring Systems: These systems use environmental\nmonitoring\
    \ stations, which are extremely pricey to acquire and maintain. For example,\n\
    these stations require engineers with specialized skill sets and data analysts.\
    \ Therefore, it is\nimpractical to deploy such monitoring stations densely. Instead,\
    \ they are often deployed\nsparsely, which creates the problem of limited spatial\
    \ resolutions for useful measurements.\nLately, cheap monitoring sensors have\
    \ evolved in the market, signiﬁcantly assisting in\nreﬁning the granularity of\
    \ monitoring [33]. Highlighting the same problem, the authors [33]\nemphasized\
    \ the drawbacks of these inexpensive sensors (particularly with air quality\n\
    monitoring sensors). For instance, these sensors frequently struggle with the\
    \ issue of\ncross-compassions in the presence of multiple ambient pollutants.\
    \ Moreover, these sensors\nare extremely susceptible to unexpected variations\
    \ in humidity, temperature, and wind\ndirection, and as a result, their accuracy\
    \ deteriorates with time. A recalibration routine\nmight be a way to maintain\
    \ and enhance such accuracy. However, because it would take\na lot more time and\
    \ work, this technique is highly improbable and would not work for\nlarge-scale\
    \ deployments. In a weather monitoring system, the monitoring is highly complex\n\
    and involves three steps [34]:\n(1)\nObserving: It can be performed by monitoring\
    \ satellite imagery, precipitation reports,\nsurface data, and gathering data\
    \ from other nearby forecasters.\n(2)\nForecasting: It can be performed by forecasters\
    \ as short-term and long-term forecasting.\nShort-term forecasting is carried\
    \ out by evaluating the current weather conditions\nand projecting them over the\
    \ next few hours using knowledge of the mechanics\nof the weather. Long-term forecasting,\
    \ however, is possible through weather (nu-\nmerical) modeling and the projection\
    \ of such modeling using computer simulations.\nTo produce these simulations for\
    \ future forecasting, these modeling techniques use\nenvironmental data from satellite\
    \ photography, weather balloons, and surface ob-\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n\
    7 of 63\nservations. Following completion of the forecasting, the forecasters\
    \ translate the\nproduced simulated expected output into a perceptible format\
    \ for non-specialists so\nthat they can respond appropriately.\n(3)\nCommunicating:\
    \ Finally, they communicate such output or forecasted information to\nappropriate\
    \ authorities.\nDespite the fact that all of these computer models are used to\
    \ forecast the weather, the\nsuccess of each one is largely inﬂuenced by three\
    \ different elements: (a) the quantity of\nprecise data; (b) the length of time\
    \ needed to analyze that data; and (c) the complexity of\ndynamic atmospheric\
    \ weather events. A large part of collecting accurate data for a region\nis the\
    \ placement of weather stations. They may occasionally be stationed distant from\
    \ rural\nareas in a city area. Because of this, they are unable to gather enough\
    \ information for desert,\nsea, or even rural areas to supply the computer models\
    \ used to predict weather conditions\naccurately. Forecasters also use satellite\
    \ data to combat this issue. However, because\nof cloud cover and signiﬁcant changes\
    \ in the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere,\nsatellite data accuracy can\
    \ occasionally be unreliable. Moreover, the topographic image and\nmap information\
    \ or surface/land features change substantially in a shorter area. Hence,\nit\
    \ further impacts temperature and precipitation values signiﬁcantly. This further\
    \ makes\nthings harder for a computer model to predict accurately. Hence, there\
    \ is a need to re-\nevaluate and re-modify such models’ mathematical equations\
    \ so that they can predict the\nchanges more accurately.\nSmart Waste Management\
    \ Systems: Automated smart waste management is crucial for\nthe following reasons:\
    \ (1) due to a lack of waste disposal infrastructure; (2) thin or delicate\nwaste\
    \ collection methods being required; (3) lack of effective waste logistics management;\n\
    (4) insufﬁcient use of cutting-edge trash treatment and recycling technologies;\
    \ and (5) lack\nof workers and specialists with the necessary technical and non-technical\
    \ skills to handle\ngarbage disposal and the associated infrastructures. Smart\
    \ waste management schemes\ninclude various steps such as (1) waste collection;\
    \ (2) differentiation of waste as per their\nbiological and physical properties;\
    \ (3) storage; (4) transportation of waste into garbage\ndisposal infrastructures/treatment\
    \ plants; and (5) waste treatment and disposal. Sosunova\nand Porras [35] identiﬁed\
    \ issues and challenges while collecting and analyzing data from\nsmart deployed\
    \ sensors on garbage bins. Their study investigated some operational issues\n\
    such as the management of waste vehicles and urban infrastructure and smartly\
    \ managing\nwaste vehicle routes.\nSmart Street Lighting Systems: This system\
    \ is a network-oriented solution that uses\nstreetlights ﬁtted with speciﬁc actuators\
    \ and sensors, implying a wide range of facilities\nand connectivity interfaces\
    \ [36]. The street lighting application (described in [37]) has a\nmechanism that\
    \ gathers or monitors environmental data and then evaluates street lighting\n\
    with the use of smart wireless nodes (ﬁtted out with numerous forms of sensors\
    \ and\nactuators). These smart nodes are mounted atop the towers that hold the\
    \ streetlights, and\nthey are connected to the Internet by way of a gateway device.\
    \ Zanella et al. [37] insist\nthat their system could assist in gathering environmental\
    \ parameters such as humidity, air\ntemperature, and CO level. Moreover, the authors\
    \ stated that optimizing street lighting\nefﬁciency is a paramount concern that\
    \ must be addressed. This monitoring system makes\nit possible to maximize efﬁciency\
    \ since it allows for the adjustment of streetlamp intensity\nin response to the\
    \ time of day, the presence of people, and the weather. Although this\nsystem\
    \ is simple and built on the IoT concept, it will inevitably contain crucial concerns\
    \ that\nrequire particular attention, such as complicated networking solutions\
    \ and communication\namong heterogeneous devices. However, selecting the right\
    \ light lamp is critical for a\npower-efﬁcient lighting mechanism. Their selection\
    \ is based on how effective they are in\nterms of power usage and lifespan. The\
    \ existing metropolitan system relies on Metal Halide\n(MH) or High-Pressure Sodium\
    \ (HPS) bulbs. Unlike LEDs, these bulbs are frequently seen\nas being inefﬁcient\
    \ in terms of power consumption and requiring signiﬁcant maintenance,\nwhich adds\
    \ signiﬁcantly to the cost. In addition, the system should be designed following\n\
    the advised design standards (it must adhere to the current standard CEN/TR 13201)\
    \ [36].\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n8 of 63\nCurrently, there are three kinds\
    \ of control systems for smart lighting systems in use:\ncentralized, decentralized,\
    \ and hybrid. Nevertheless, these systems are susceptible to a\nvariety of security\
    \ assaults. Moreover, not much effort has been made into this problem\nthus far.\n\
    Smart Emergency Response Systems: Such a system ensures the safety and security\
    \ of\nits residents. It can be utilized for crime detection and prevention, dealing\
    \ with natural\ncalamities and accidents, and law enforcement [38]. Data collection\
    \ is ﬁrst and foremost\nimportant for the designing portion of these applications.\
    \ Depending on the gathered\nfacts, the development of intelligence (which aids\
    \ in making important decisions) and the\nability to respond swiftly and quickly\
    \ are the issues that require special attention. When\nit comes to gathering data,\
    \ we can make use of CCTV cameras and sophisticated trafﬁc\nsensors. A developer\
    \ can create and put into action a crucial learning scheme that will\nconduct\
    \ predictive analysis and gather intelligence on top of the data gathered. Therefore,\n\
    this kind of predictive analysis has the potential to gather signiﬁcant information\
    \ that\nwill help the relevant authorities (e.g., the ﬁre safety department, the\
    \ police department,\nand law enforcement agencies) take the proper security and\
    \ preventive measures. The\nconcept of widespread surveillance has important beneﬁts\
    \ for security and safety. However,\nkeeping track of such vast amounts of data\
    \ also prompts a lot of worries and issues for\ndesigners and developers, including\
    \ storage; the effectiveness of learning algorithms; and,\nmost importantly, the\
    \ question of whether it is morally right or acceptable to keep track\nof each\
    \ individual (a privacy issue). In addition, a very important point is whether\
    \ this\nkind of widespread surveillance is feasible, especially for nations such\
    \ as China and India,\nwhere a city’s population can exceed that of a whole nation.\
    \ Further, Gharaibeh et al. [38]\nclaimed that combining information transmission\
    \ technologies with well-implemented\ndata analytics models is necessary for quick\
    \ and swift collaboration. To save as many lives\nas possible during natural disasters,\
    \ it is imperative to gather, assess, and communicate\nvital information to the\
    \ relevant authorities. As a result, there is currently a lot of work\nbeing done\
    \ to enhance the performance of information exchange systems. Although this\n\
    system is based on the IoT concept and is relatively simple, it faces important\
    \ problems\nthat need consideration, such as complex networking solutions and\
    \ information sharing\nacross heterogeneous devices on time (time-sensitive application).\n\
    Smart Residence/Home Automation: A smart home has highly developed systems\nsuch\
    \ as a control system for devices or objects (such as fans, lights, music systems,\
    \ TVs,\nand other smart appliances), automated door openers, smart appliances\
    \ that may send\nusers remote status updates, smart refrigerators, and washing\
    \ machines. A user can control\nthe majority of smart home appliances remotely\
    \ with two recently produced gadgets:\nGoogle Home and Amazon Echo. In a smart\
    \ home, the end-user demands a high-speed\ninternet connection, so they can access\
    \ networking sites that control the home with HD live\nstreaming services. In\
    \ contrast, a smart healthcare application needs safe connections to\ncomputing\
    \ servers in the cloud for managing sensitive private information. Hence, data\n\
    management systems must address a crucial issue, namely, the necessity to concentrate\n\
    on data distribution based on various end-user categories rather than just recommending\n\
    distinct data distribution among various end-user groups [38]. The concept of\
    \ smart home\nautomation raises serious concerns about security and privacy risks.\
    \ A smart home includes\nsecurity monitoring systems with motion sensors, wirelessly\
    \ opening smart door locks,\ntelevisions, phones, and other smart appliances that\
    \ are highly outﬁtted with cameras and\nmicrophones. Although these gadgets improve\
    \ the system, little research has been done on\ntheir privacy and security features.\
    \ If we conduct a thorough analysis of these gadgets, we\nwill discover that their\
    \ manufacturers offer either very few or no security features at all.\nIndeed,\
    \ Fernandes et al. [39] provided their eye-opening views after carefully examining\n\
    Samsung’s SmartThings framework (programming) and their SmartApps market. They\n\
    argued that more than 50%—exactly 55%—of these smart applications are already\
    \ more\nprivileged by default and as a result, do not need to access unrelated\
    \ applications. As a\nresult, hackers can use them with ease. Apart from this,\
    \ according to a published document\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n9 of 63\nby WikiLeaks\
    \ [40], the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has all the tools to access, control,\n\
    and hack these smart home applications anywhere in the world. Furthermore, criminal\n\
    entities and hackers could seize control of smart personal devices, capture delicate\
    \ private\ninformation, and exploit that information immorally typically through\
    \ user tracking and\nproﬁling. Additionally, a hacker may break into one of these\
    \ smart applications, grab vital\ninformation, and then use it to launch any kind\
    \ of attack. For instance, based on motion\nsensors, security camera feeds, and\
    \ power usage patterns, a burglar can determine where\nand when to break into\
    \ the house. By locating the authentication credentials of authorized\nparties,\
    \ they can compromise smart door locks [41]. Better security-aware hardware and\n\
    software (as well as the related common standards) must be developed to safeguard\
    \ against\nall these attempts so that high-tech appliances, sensors, actuators,\
    \ etc., are impervious to\nsuch security and privacy attacks.\nSmart Grid Networks:\
    \ The functionality of the traditional electricity grid is unidirec-\ntional (i.e.,\
    \ electricity is transmitted from electricity-producing sources to end-customers).\n\
    Electricity has been moving from power plants to users in a single direction thanks\
    \ to\nthe deployment of electricity grids. The existing grid system operates in\
    \ an open-loop\nfashion since there are not any adequate communication infrastructures\
    \ in the distribution\nsector. Moreover, the main distribution center has little\
    \ or no real-time knowledge of the\nsystem’s operating conditions and dynamically\
    \ changing load. There are also several tech-\nnical, economic, and environmental\
    \ problems with this conventional approach. Therefore,\nthis conventional system\
    \ must become dependable, manageable, and scalable, as well as\nﬂexible, secure,\
    \ and interoperable [42].\nThe smart grid is the next invention of the Electric\
    \ Power System (EPS) that incor-\nporates quicker, more secure, and reliable communication\
    \ networks [43]. Smart grids\nsupplement the conventional electricity grid by\
    \ incorporating renewable energy sources\nsuch as biomass, solar energy, and wind\
    \ energy. These energy sources are much cleaner\nand more ecologically friendly\
    \ than non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels.\nHowever, it is important\
    \ to identify the most suitable communication technology for the\nsmart grid’s\
    \ successful implementation and deployment. The smart grid’s overall commu-\n\
    nication style is unique compared with conventional network communication patterns.\
    \ The\ncommunication network architecture of the smart grid must be able to handle\
    \ information\nexchange between sensors, actuators, smart electronic devices,\
    \ and numerous smart meters\nin such a particular environment with little to no\
    \ human intervention. This type of com-\nmunication, called Device-to-Device (D2D)\
    \ communication, is autonomous and may be\ninitiated in response to an event or\
    \ at regular intervals. Notably, depending on how these\nsmart grid applications\
    \ were built, their QoS requirements and characteristics differ greatly\nin terms\
    \ of delay, burst size, and packet arrival rate. For example, the latency requirement\n\
    of a smart meter event and a substation event are quite different [44]. In intelligent\
    \ grid\nnetworks, the monitoring, managing, and controlling functions inside the\
    \ same network\npresent the issues of ﬂexible QoS differentiation. Moreover, applications\
    \ based on the smart\ngrid can be developed and implemented using the current\
    \ wireless and wired networking\ninfrastructure and technologies. For some devices,\
    \ such as smart meters, designing and\nstandardizing acceptable smart grid-based\
    \ protocols is a critical matter [45]. Furthermore,\nthese smart grid-based networks\
    \ are too dependent on intelligent sensors, actuators, and\nother devices. This\
    \ makes them extremely vulnerable to attacks by malicious users. These\nsmart\
    \ grids could be taken over by malevolent users or hackers, who could then obtain\n\
    unauthorized access to many smart meters and alter crucial data. Moreover, as\
    \ the existing\nelectricity system is insufﬁcient for establishing smart grid\
    \ systems, high-level adjustments\nto current power infrastructure scenarios are\
    \ required. Subsequently, these smart systems\nrequire high installation costs\
    \ because the installation requires a large number of smart\nmeters, sensors,\
    \ and actuators for sensing and data collection [46]. The efﬁcient operation of\n\
    such a smart grid system also necessitates a dependable, consistent, and error-free\
    \ network\nchannel. Therefore, it will be challenging for developers of such intelligent\
    \ applications.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n10 of 63\nMany surveys [42–45,47]\
    \ reviewed communication frameworks for smart grids, smart-\ngrid-based networking\
    \ technologies, trafﬁc management, and the requirements of numer-\nous smart grid\
    \ applications. Further, Kansal and Bose [48] presented their insights on\ntransmission\
    \ grid applications regarding their latency and bandwidth requirements.\n3. Network\
    \ Requirements for SCAs\nThis section considers several communication requirements\
    \ including reliability, delay\ntolerance, bandwidth, power consumption, security,\
    \ network type, heterogeneous network\nsupport, and mobility support. It also\
    \ studies the aptness of different network protocols for\ndissimilar SCAs.\nSmart\
    \ city services and applications need robust and dependable communication\nsupport\
    \ as well as an effective networking infrastructure, which will permit competent\n\
    message-sharing procedures among the components of the smart city systems [49].\
    \ Every\nsmart city system has an intricate networking architecture made up of\
    \ various networking\ncomponents. Therefore, smart city systems are innately required\
    \ to have a variety of net-\nworking requirements. To access the far-off destination,\
    \ which may be clouds, the network\ntrafﬁc from a broad variety of deployed diverse\
    \ applications uses a common networking\narchitecture and resources. These resources\
    \ may consist of switches, routers, communica-\ntion connections (links), and\
    \ other forms of network middle-boxes. The idea of accessing\nfaraway clouds or\
    \ far-off destinations or remotely distributed apps consequently brings\nup problems\
    \ with high packet loss probability, signiﬁcant delay, and constrained network\n\
    bandwidth. In addition, security is a serious issue that must be considered when\
    \ develop-\ning, implementing, and deploying intelligent applications for smart\
    \ cities. Otherwise, users\nwould be reluctant to approve the use of such applications\
    \ in the absence of adequate secu-\nrity safeguards. Such intelligent applications\
    \ need a high-speed networking environment\nwhere the quick reaction may be managed\
    \ with the support of the ability of a fast-processing\nspeed. Furthermore, a\
    \ variety of apps can be implemented in the context of a smart city,\nbased on\
    \ their usefulness and relevance to the users. These applications, however, have\n\
    different networking requirements, particularly in terms of response and security\
    \ [50]. For\nexample, the networking requirements of smart emergency response\
    \ systems are quite\ndifferent compared to other applications such as smart healthcare\
    \ systems. Emergency\nresponse smart systems must be exceedingly secure and quick\
    \ to react [50]. In contrast,\nsmart-healthcare-based systems or apps do not necessarily\
    \ need to be especially dynamic.\n−\nNetwork Protocols: Monitoring applications\
    \ for smart cities often use a dense network\nof heterogeneous sensor nodes, including\
    \ ﬁxed sensor nodes, mobile sensor nodes,\nand crowd sensing nodes. Long-Term\
    \ Evolution (LTE) [51], LTE for Machines (LTE-M),\nextended coverage GSM IoT,\
    \ and ﬁfth-generation (5G) technologies [52] are intriguing\noptions to support\
    \ such heterogeneous networks. First, the bulk of crowd-sensing\nnodes (smartphones)\
    \ is already supported by LTE communications. Consequently, no\nfurther wireless\
    \ communication devices are required. To save energy, LTE and 5G can\nbe utilized\
    \ on the sink nodes (also known as cluster heads) to allow the data gathered\n\
    by the sink nodes to be transmitted to the monitoring center via base stations\
    \ (the\nbackbone network), as opposed to multihop relaying.\n−\nZigbee [53], WiFi,\
    \ and Bluetooth can still be used for the traditional stationary nodes\nto communicate\
    \ within clusters. This layout has the advantage of allowing the sensor\nnode\
    \ clusters to be separated from one another while maintaining network connectiv-\n\
    ity. Additionally, the moderate number of nodes in each cluster makes maintenance\n\
    simpler. In addition to supporting larger networks, LTE and 5G technologies also\
    \ make\npossible sensor nodes with faster data rates, improving the performance\
    \ of real-time\nmonitoring [54]. Applications for crowd sensing, for instance,\
    \ can accommodate video\nstreams taken by cameras on smartphones or moving vehicles.\
    \ The fast data rates\nprovided by LTE and 5G can potentially be advantageous\
    \ for the sink nodes or clusters.\nThe use of vibration data (accelerometer readings)\
    \ in structural health monitoring\napplications of bridges, tunnels, or towers\
    \ is fairly common. The cluster heads will be\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n11\
    \ of 63\nable to send the vibration data in this situation in real time. In conclusion,\
    \ practically\nall applications for smart city monitoring that demand a high data\
    \ throughput and\nminimal delay may be satisﬁed by LTE and 5G. Additionally, there\
    \ are some new\nsensor node standards, such as IEEE 802.11ah [55], LoRaWAN [56],\
    \ and Narrowband-\nIoT (NB-IoT) [57]. These narrowband protocols offer numerous\
    \ advantages: greater\ncoverage, improved scalability, reduced energy usage, and\
    \ increased device longevity.\nResearchers have tested these standards in more\
    \ than a few applications, including\nstreet lighting, energy metering, and home\
    \ automation, even though some are still\nbeing discussed and revised. The new\
    \ narrowband communication standards enable\nthe sensor nodes to run more sustainably,\
    \ which is beneﬁcial for applications that\naim for long-term monitoring. In addition\
    \ to these protocols and standards, the FogC\narchitecture [58] aids in monitoring\
    \ smart cities. In such an architecture, the mobile\nusers (the potential crowd-sensing\
    \ providers) and the cloud are connected via fog\nservers. These fog servers are\
    \ WiFi access points or cellular base stations. Mobile users\nare more inclined\
    \ to participate in sensing since they may upload their crowd-sensing\nmeasurements\
    \ to the fog server in just one hop, signiﬁcantly decreasing the cost and\nenergy\
    \ usage compared to cellular networks. As a result, such an architecture can give\n\
    us better sensing coverage. Using the measurements from the mobile users and the\n\
    WSNs, the fog servers can perform some basic regional estimation based on the\
    \ FogC\narchitecture, such as the nearby trafﬁc conditions. The service latency\
    \ and response\ntime are then decreased because mobile users can access such estimates\
    \ directly from\nthe fog servers rather than from a remote cloud through a backbone\
    \ network. Lastly,\nusing the appropriate networking protocols for each SCA is\
    \ crucial to getting the\nbest possible trade-off between delay, energy use, and\
    \ cost. The networks may be\nhierarchical so that diverse roles and functions\
    \ can be assigned at various layers to\nincrease the networks’ dependability and\
    \ cost-effectiveness. As a result, certain nodes\nmay be able to transmit data\
    \ utilizing various protocols.\n−\nBandwidth requirements: Many video applications\
    \ in smart cities require high band-\nwidth [59]. In these applications, sensors\
    \ capture video from the physical environment.\nMoreover, video transmission is\
    \ more bandwidth-hungry than the conventional scalar\ndata trafﬁc in IoT. Examples\
    \ of these applications are intelligent multimedia surveil-\nlance systems for\
    \ home monitoring, multimedia-based industrial monitoring systems,\ntrafﬁc monitoring\
    \ systems for road safety, and remote multimedia-based monitoring\nof an environmental\
    \ system.\n−\nDelay Tolerance: Some SCAs, such as smart transportation, only tolerate\
    \ a small\namount of end-to-end delay. For example, to prevent imminent danger\
    \ to the ve-\nhicle or potentially fatal crashes, the data that are being relayed\
    \ must arrive within\nmicroseconds. Therefore, the control systems must react\
    \ in time. However, other\napplications have a higher tolerance for delays [49].\
    \ Such applications rely on data\nmonitoring and information gathering for upcoming\
    \ analysis.\n−\nPower Consumption: Another crucial need for applications is power\
    \ consumption.\nSmart grid systems and other applications with local high-energy\
    \ sources can tolerate\nprotocols with higher energy expenditure levels [45].\
    \ Other applications have medium\npower needs and require energy sources with\
    \ limited capacities. One example of such\nan application is intelligent transportation.\
    \ Other applications demand protocols with\nlow or very low energy consumption\
    \ characteristics since they have limited energy\nresources. Unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs), smart water networks, and pipeline\nmonitoring for gas and oil are a\
    \ few examples of such uses.\n−\nReliability: The majority of applications have\
    \ medium reliability requirements. A\ntypical example of such applications is\
    \ smart water networks. Some other applications\nhave high-reliability necessities\
    \ such as intelligent transportation and smart grids [49].\n−\nSecurity: The majority\
    \ of applications need medium to high security. Applications\nsuch as production\
    \ control and monitoring, for instance, need medium security, whilst\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n12 of 63\nothers, such as smart grids, need high security because\
    \ of the sensitivity of the data\nand the importance of the operations carried\
    \ out [50].\n−\nHeterogeneity of network protocols: The majority of smart city\
    \ systems use network-\ning protocols that link the system’s parts together. Intelligent\
    \ transportation and smart\nbuildings are two examples of such systems. These\
    \ protocols must coexist in such\nsituations without conﬂicting with one another.\
    \ To ensure seamless and effective\noperation, it is also necessary to correctly\
    \ map the control information in the head-\ners at the various networking stack\
    \ tiers used by the many heterogeneous protocols\nand networks.\n−\nWired/wireless\
    \ connectivity: The majority of SCAs that include wireless connectivity\nare UAVs\
    \ and monitoring of gas and oil pipelines. Others, including intelligent\ntransportation\
    \ and smart buildings, use wired and wireless connectivity [50]. In\nthese situations,\
    \ wired networking may be used for communication within a speciﬁc\nphysical system\
    \ (such as within a UAV), while wireless communication may be used\nto link the\
    \ physical system to other such systems that are comparable to it or to the\n\
    backbone and infrastructure networks.\n−\nMobility: Some systems, such as the\
    \ smart grid, pipeline monitoring for gas and oil,\nand smart water networks,\
    \ have low to medium mobility [50]. Other systems, such\nas UAVs and intelligent\
    \ transportation, are quite mobile. Medium- to high-mobility\nsmart city systems\
    \ can be connected if the networking protocols are reliable and\nadaptable to\
    \ node mobility without using up a large amount of bandwidth on control\nmessages\
    \ and related processing to react to changes in the network architecture.\nTable\
    \ 1 presents a qualitative comparison of the requirements of some SCAs. Each\n\
    SCA has its own transmission range and is sustained by a heterogeneous network\
    \ with\nlow, medium, or high trafﬁc rates and supporting high or low mobility\
    \ of devices. Each\nSCA is based on different protocols and requires different\
    \ bandwidth and latency tolerance.\nIn each SCA, the number of devices involved\
    \ differs.\nTable 1. Networking aspects and qualitative comparison of SCA requirements.\n\

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n13 of 63\n3.1. Additional Challenges\n−\nInteroperability:\
    \ Smart city systems are built on several heterogeneous networking\nprotocols\
    \ that use various media access control (MAC) mechanisms at the physi-\ncal and\
    \ data link layers. For the underlying technologies to be integrated seam-\nlessly,\
    \ these protocols must be interoperable [60]. In digital home networks, the IEEE\n\
    1905.1 protocol [61], which was created to offer a convergent interface between\
    \ physi-\ncal/data link layers and the network layer, is aimed to perform this\
    \ function. Future\nresearch should focus on the creation of similar protocols\
    \ to increase the support\nsystem for smart city systems.\n−\nScalability: A smart\
    \ city platform must manage many devices that are connected to\nthe city’s infrastructure.\
    \ Large amounts of city-related data, which are continuously\nproduced and consumed\
    \ by devices and client applications, must be stored and\nprocessed. The platform\
    \ must simultaneously be able to handle hundreds of requests\nfrom users and services\
    \ that rely on it. Thus, the scalability requirements change\ndepending on the\
    \ features of the city as well as the installed applications and services.\nRecently,\
    \ Del Esponte et al. [62] suggested InterSCity, a microservices-based, open-\n\
    source smart city platform that facilitates the collaborative development of large-scale\n\
    systems, apps, and services for smart cities.\n−\nLoad Balancing: To maximize\
    \ the usage of resources, load balancing assigns appro-\npriate resources (i.e.,\
    \ network resources, storage capacity, computational resources,\nand energy resources)\
    \ to user tasks. A large-scale IoT network performs better and\navoids overload\
    \ thanks to an effective load-balancing strategy [63]. Response time,\ncost, throughput,\
    \ performance, and resource usage are all improved in terms of\nQoS parameters.\n\
    −\nThe Cloud/Edge/FogC Paradigms: Cloud, Edge, and FogC facilitate the creation\
    \ of\nsmart city prototypes. These computing paradigms efﬁciently aid in the gathering,\n\
    upkeep, and analysis of city data to pinpoint crucial city-related events that\
    \ demand\nadvanced processing and response [64]. Nonetheless, some IoT applications/systems\n\
    for smart cities have strict processing and delay constraints. These real-time\
    \ applica-\ntions present the greatest obstacles to cloud-based services. Consequently,\
    \ FogC and\nEdge Computing have emerged as viable computing paradigms for designing,\
    \ imple-\nmenting, deploying, and controlling such systems/applications. These\
    \ paradigms\nbring computing resources closer to the IoT/device plane so that\
    \ the primary computa-\ntion can be done locally [65,66]. Each computing paradigm\
    \ offers particular assistance\nbased on the requirements of the application at\
    \ hand. For example, to support a cloud-\nbased SCA, ClCom offers centralized\
    \ storage and processing capacity. For certain\nSCAs, ClCom can offer scalable\
    \ processing power and data storage [5]. The features of\nClCom (e.g., powerful\
    \ processing, massive and scalable data storage, and cutting-edge\nsoftware services)\
    \ can be used to provide various support services for a variety of\nSCAs. ClCom\
    \ can be the primary control and management platform for SCAs. The\ncity’s ClCom\
    \ services can be used to connect various sensors and actuators for SCAs\nto gather,\
    \ process, store, and manage sensor data for various SCAs. Vast volumes\nof data\
    \ are gathered across a smart city, which can eventually become big data. The\n\
    sophisticated platforms required for storing and analyzing this massive amount\
    \ of\ndata to improve operations and planning can be provided by Cloud Computing.\
    \ To\neffectively support SCAs, the communication between city sensors and actuators\
    \ and\nClCom may involve various communication requirements. The network architectures\n\
    used in the smart city should meet these requirements. Smart applications require\n\
    the integration of sensors, actuators, and the cloud, and they can only function\
    \ well\nwith a robust network that offers good communication services linking\
    \ both sides.\nThe fact that cloud services are either provided at a single central\
    \ location or across\nnumerous distributed platforms in various locations is another\
    \ problem that occurs\nwhen adopting ClCom for a smart city. For many cloud applications,\
    \ the distributed\nClCom strategy can offer greater quality and dependability\
    \ support [67]. However,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n14 of 63\nit is frequently\
    \ necessary to establish effective communication channels between the\ndistributed\
    \ ClCom facilities that are present in various locations. The dependability\n\
    and efﬁciency of the networks linking all components on both sides present another\n\
    problem when using the cloud. There are issues with delays, dropped packets, and\n\
    unstable connections when the Internet is involved. To consider these challenges,\n\
    the SCA architecture must be carefully studied, as must the planning and control\
    \ of\nnetwork resources and communication models. However, some elements cannot\
    \ be\navoided, such as transmission delays. Ksentini et al. [68] investigated\
    \ the QoS require-\nments of many IoT/cloud-enabled applications in a FogC environment\
    \ to recognize\nQoS metrics. The authors introduced a QoS management model (QoS-Fog)\
    \ that is\ninspired by the work of the OpenFog consortium on the reference architecture\
    \ [69] for\na FogC system.\n3.2. Features and Challenges of Smart City Networks\n\
    A smart city network has the following features [70]:\n1.\nLarge Densities: A\
    \ smart city network has a very large density as thousands of smart\ndevices are\
    \ distributed in the area of a city.\n2.\nAbnormal Trafﬁc Patterns: Cascading\
    \ or synchronization among smart devices produces\nextremely bursty or correlated\
    \ trafﬁc patterns. These trafﬁc patterns differ from\nthe regular social-generated\
    \ trafﬁc patterns on which most existing schemes and\ntechnology used in our society\
    \ are based.\n3.\nDisorganized Network Topology: Unlike the widely used wireless\
    \ connectivity features,\nsmart city networks often adhere to a mesh network topology.\
    \ The problem arises\nwhen smart devices communicate across unreliable wireless\
    \ channels, where packet\nlosses caused by wireless channel special properties\
    \ are extremely common and even-\ntually have an impact on the functioning of\
    \ the smart city system. Therefore, it appears\nvery improbable that a single\
    \ high-throughput backbone can be deployable soon.\n4.\nHeterogeneity: SCAs use\
    \ a variety of technologies. In terms of power consumption,\nlatency, throughput,\
    \ and communication ranges, each of these technologies operates\nat a unique trade-off\
    \ threshold. The involved dissimilar technologies must coexist on\na single platform.\n\
    5.\nCoexistence of heterogeneous technologies: Communication technologies used\
    \ in smart\ncities are distributed over the same radio space. At the same time,\
    \ independent radio\ninfrastructures are connected through a variety of wireless\
    \ channels. Under such\ncircumstances, the SCA must handle interference issues\
    \ with competence.\n6.\nSecurity and Privacy: SCAs are extremely vulnerable to\
    \ several risks from malevolent\nusers. The majority of specialized smart sensors,\
    \ actuators, and other intelligent\ndevices are developed by designers without\
    \ considering security measures. Such\napplications may be highly vulnerable due\
    \ to hostile actors’ ease of access to these\ncutting-edge technologies and potential\
    \ threats to people’s security and privacy.\nThe main challenges for smart city\
    \ networks are as follows [70]:\n•\nLack of Standardization Solutions: The IEEE\
    \ 802.15.1 Bluetooth technologies for Personal\nArea Networks (PANs) and the IEEE\
    \ 802.11 groups for wireless LANs adopt the\nconcept of single-hop ad-hoc networking.\
    \ These standards permit direct communi-\ncation between two devices that are\
    \ in the transmission range of each other. At the\nsame time, the multi-hop ad-hoc\
    \ networking paradigm enables the communication\nbetween any two devices which\
    \ are not necessarily in their transmission range [71]. A\nproblem that researchers\
    \ must consider is how these intricate heterogeneous sets of\ndevices (i.e., actuators,\
    \ sensors, and other smart devices) can communicate uniformly\nwithout any standardization.\
    \ Global distributors and manufacturers must propose\nand accept standardized\
    \ network solutions that enable communication between di-\nverse devices on homogeneous\
    \ communication entities. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard\nis the dominant solution\
    \ that presents a sophisticated version of the Physical Layer.\nThis standard\
    \ deals with the trade-off between data rate, communication range, and\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n15 of 63\npower consumption. Several revisions or amendments\
    \ (i.e., IEEE 802.15.4g and IEEE\n802.15.4e) aimed at the SCA have just been released.\
    \ The IEEE 802.15.4g amendment\nallows for a redesigned physical layer, allowing\
    \ data rates and communication ranges\ncompatible with neighborhood mesh (wide)\
    \ networks. Then, it is followed by another\ncutting-edge modiﬁcation, known as\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4e, which modiﬁes and enhances\nthe method used by devices to access\
    \ wireless channels while also using time-slotted\nchannel hopping mode. This\
    \ hopping mode further delivers low-power consumption\nand improved dependability.\
    \ From another viewpoint, many researchers customized\nappropriate upper-layer\
    \ protocols (i.e., the Internet Layer). They made the necessary\nmodiﬁcations\
    \ there to make smart applications compatible with conventional infras-\ntructure.\
    \ Since the network of low-power smart devices is conﬁned, the researchers\ndeveloped\
    \ numerous adjustments to the Internet protocols to make them easily adapt-\n\
    able. For example, the most notable IETF projects are RPL [72] and 6LoWPAN [73],\n\
    which greatly aid in creating and adapting smart city scenarios.\n•\nInterference\
    \ problem: Sophisticated technologies that are spread across the same radio\n\
    space and independent radio infrastructures are linked via a range of wireless\
    \ channels.\nBecause of this, the smart application must handle interference problems\
    \ in such\nsituations. To share unlicensed bands, numerous networks must cooperate\
    \ and be\ncompatible with one another.\n•\nVertical handover (soft): Multiple\
    \ radios are used by the rapidly expanding number of\nsmart devices being developed.\
    \ These devices should be able to recognize and use the\nbest interface that is\
    \ currently available while balancing power usage and throughput.\n•\nD2D Communications:\
    \ In the IoT context, there are numerous D2D communication de-\nmands. Unfortunately,\
    \ conventional network gateways cannot handle such generated\nmessages from heterogeneous\
    \ devices.\n•\nShort Communicating Messages: Internet-based protocols support\
    \ and recommend\nacceptable performance for longer data packet scenarios. However,\
    \ smart devices\ncommunicate with one another using short messages (since most\
    \ of them are tiny\nand operate over low-powered battery devices). To this end,\
    \ short communicating\nmessages will positively impact network congestion detection\
    \ and avoidance policies\nand promote in-band aggregation.\n•\nLocal Network Trafﬁc\
    \ Pattern: Smartphones and D2D-speciﬁc devices frequently use the\nsame network\
    \ infrastructure. However, most cellular data networks are exclusively\nplanned,\
    \ implemented, deployed, and managed for smartphone usage. Fitting trafﬁc\nfrom\
    \ these heterogeneous devices onto a single platform is now the main challenge\n\
    that cellular data network providers face. It is difﬁcult to integrate the trafﬁc\
    \ from these\ntwo types of heterogeneous devices into the same network infrastructure\
    \ due to several\nintrinsic factors and the speciﬁed features of this traditional\
    \ network. Additionally,\nD2D devices use a more signiﬁcant proportion of scarce\
    \ resources than smartphones,\nunnecessarily creating a problem of unfairness\
    \ in the system [74]. Therefore, we\nmust ﬁrst comprehend D2D trafﬁc patterns\
    \ and how they differ from trafﬁc patterns\ngenerated by smartphones. Understanding\
    \ trafﬁc patterns can provide insights into\nmanaging and allocating shared network\
    \ resources more effectively and guarantee\nthe highest level of service quality\
    \ for both types of devices.\n•\nSecurity mechanisms: Denial of Service (DoS)\
    \ attacks are a remarkable threat to the\nsecurity of smart city networks and\
    \ must be identiﬁed. Some statistical methods\nhave been proposed to solve this\
    \ problem. Such a statistical method is presented\nin [75] that is based on feature\
    \ distance maps that enhance the statistical analysis\nprocess. Another security\
    \ mechanism is authentication, a process of identifying\nusers and devices in\
    \ a network and granting access to authorized persons and non-\nmanipulated devices.\
    \ Authentication is one method to mitigate attacks on the IoT\nsystems such as\
    \ the reply attack, the Man-in-the-Middle attack, the impersonation\nattack, and\
    \ the Sybil attack [76]. To realize end-to-end security, the nodes must be\nencrypted.\
    \ However, due to the heterogeneity of the IoT systems, some nodes might\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n16 of 63\nbe able to embed general-purpose microprocessors for\
    \ this task. In addition, low\nresources and constrained devices can only embed\
    \ application-speciﬁc integrated\ncircuits. Therefore, conventional cryptographic\
    \ primitives are not suitable for low-\nresource smart devices due to their low\
    \ computation power, limited battery life, small\nsize, small memory, and limited\
    \ power supply. As a result, lightweight cryptography\nmay be an efﬁcient encryption\
    \ for these devices. Trust management is another security\nmechanism that detects\
    \ and eliminates malicious nodes and provides secure access\ncontrol. Automated\
    \ and dynamic trust calculations are needed to validate the trust\nvalues of the\
    \ participating nodes in an IoT network. The majority of trust management\nschemes\
    \ focus on detecting malicious nodes; only a few trust-based access control\n\
    methods have been proposed. In fact, with scalability and the large number of\
    \ smart\nthings storing sensitive data, there is an urgent need for automated,\
    \ transparent, and\neasy access control management so that different nodes/users\
    \ can be granted different\nlevels of access. From another perspective, Blockchain\
    \ technology can be used to\ncreate secure virtual zones where things can identify\
    \ and trust each other [77]. Self-\norganization Blockchain Structures (BCS) can\
    \ also be planned to set up the relationship\nbetween Blockchain and IoT, as suggested\
    \ in [78].\n•\nAnomaly Detection in Sensor Systems: The type of data that ﬂow\
    \ through the IoT system\ncan vary to a great extent, in terms of either format,\
    \ shape (in time and space), and\nsemantics. Therefore, the process of separating\
    \ normal from abnormal sensed data is\nextremely demanding. In the context of\
    \ IoT applications, sensors are the real source\nof big data, which suggests that\
    \ anomaly detection at the edge could be a powerful\ntool to address the inevitable\
    \ data communication bottlenecks. Anomaly detection is\nconcerned with identifying\
    \ data patterns that deviate remarkably from the expected\nbehavior. This is critical\
    \ in the process of ﬁnding out important information about\nthe IoT system’s functioning,\
    \ detecting abnormalities that are often rare or difﬁcult\nto model or, otherwise,\
    \ to predict [79]. A timely identiﬁcation of anomalies is vital to\npreventing\
    \ IoT system failure.\n•\nAdvanced Techniques in Smart City Networks: Artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI), machine learn-\ning (ML), and deep reinforcement learning\
    \ (DRL) play a key role in the evolution of the\nsmart city sectors [80]. These\
    \ techniques are now being developed as solutions for com-\npletely automated\
    \ IoT applications. Using these techniques, the optimal analysis of\nthe big data\
    \ is performed to reach an optimal decision. Utilizing DRL/ML approaches\ncan\
    \ improve security; decrease energy consumption; reduce latency; and increase\n\
    precision and accuracy in surveillance, energy management, air quality prediction,\n\
    person detection, trafﬁc management, etc. For example, an intelligent transportation\n\
    system is highly based on ML- and DRL-based techniques to realize self-driving\
    \ vehi-\ncles and guarantee the security of connected vehicles. DRL techniques\
    \ are also used to\nprecisely monitor and estimate the real-time trafﬁc ﬂow data\
    \ in an urban environment.\nIn SGs, big data analytics and thus the aforementioned\
    \ techniques can enhance the\nsafety of power grids, decision-making of power-sharing,\
    \ management, and power\ngrid performance. In particular, SGs are making effective\
    \ use of smart meter big data\nfor different applications such as load assessment\
    \ and prediction, baseline estimation,\ndemand response, load clustering, and\
    \ malicious data deception attacks. In health\nintelligence, extensive use of\
    \ AI, ML, and DRL techniques is implemented due to\nhigh-performance IoT devices,\
    \ Cloud Computing, and an increase in data rates. These\ntechniques can play a\
    \ vital role in disease diagnosis, cure prediction, social media ana-\nlytics\
    \ for a particular disease, and medical imaging [81]. In cyber-security, the role\
    \ of\nAI-, ML-, and DRL-based techniques is also outstanding. These techniques\
    \ can be used\nfrom an advanced security perspective of IoT to confront security\
    \ threats. Notably, the\naccuracy and precision of the aforementioned techniques\
    \ can be further enhanced by\nincreasing the amount of training data to strengthen\
    \ their learning capabilities and\nhence the automated decision efﬁciencies [82].\n\

    \ battery devices [83].\nNew connectivity solutions are being investigated in\
    \ light of the following question:\ndo the currently available methods, tools,\
    \ and techniques—especially those for wireless\nnetworks—allow for the reliable\
    \ handling of such a large number of smart devices?\nYaqoob et al. [84] provided\
    \ details on current connectivity solutions based on WPAN\ntechnologies such as\
    \ ZigBee, WiFi, Bluetooth, and others that offer low-power D2D com-\nmunication.\
    \ In these technologies, the throughput performance, the number of con-\nnected\
    \ devices, transmission ranges, etc., are severely constrained. Other technologies\n\
    (e.g., WiMAX, LTE, and LTE-A) involve signiﬁcant power consumption and are only\n\
    partially applicable to such settings. IEEE and 3GPP adapt their technologies\
    \ and commu-\nnication strategies to the rapidly expanding IoT-based modern communication\
    \ perspective.\nIEEE 802.11 (WiFi) was initially designed to maintain higher throughput\
    \ performance\nfor fewer stations distributed over a shorter distance in an interior\
    \ context. Due to the\nlimitations of its initial design, this standard does not\
    \ support IoT applications. Hence,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n18 of 63\nto enable\
    \ IEEE 802.11 adaptive in such circumstances, the community (IEEE 802.11ah\nTask\
    \ Group (TGah)) developed a new power-efﬁcient protocol [55]. They aim to create\
    \ a\nsystem that enables effective communication between several indoor and outdoor\
    \ devices.\nNevertheless, the real-time implementation of IEEE 802.11ah may need\
    \ to be improved by\nthe absence of an appropriate interference mechanism.\nIEEE\
    \ 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee), IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n, Cellular\n\
    3G/4G/5G/LTE/LTE-A, and IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) are only a few examples of standards\n\
    and protocols that should be evaluated for their applicability for various SCAs.\
    \ Smart\nhome automation systems, smart buildings, and smart garbage systems require\
    \ short-\nrange communication capability and can utilize protocols (e.g., Bluetooth\
    \ and Zigbee) from\nthe WPAN group. These protocols are distinguished by a lower\
    \ bandwidth requirement,\nminimal power usage, and a shorter-range communication\
    \ infrastructure environment.\nIn contrast, LAN groups such as WiFi can be used\
    \ for SCAs that require longer-range\ncommunication. Such applications are smart\
    \ transportation management systems.\nThe protocols from WAN groups, such as Cellular\
    \ and WiMAX, can be adopted by\napplications that need wide-range communication,\
    \ such as smart emergency response\nsystems, weather and air quality monitoring\
    \ systems, and smart grid systems. These\nfeatures designed in terms of standards\
    \ or protocols have enough capability that allows for\nboth synchronous and asynchronous\
    \ data connections. The best-effort trafﬁc (which can\neffectively tolerate latency)\
    \ allows the asynchronous data connections feature to be linked\nwith smart city\
    \ services or applications. Meanwhile, exploring synchronous data connec-\ntions\
    \ is possible for those services or applications that generate trafﬁc mandating\
    \ strict\nQoS standards such as low latency and high accessible network capacity\
    \ [49]. Since IEEE\n802.15.4 (Zigbee) is a short-range (low bit rate) communication\
    \ protocol that often suggests\nhigher ﬂexibility for small devices running on\
    \ low power, such a protocol can signiﬁcantly\nincrease network lifetime. Moreover,\
    \ such a protocol encourages and indicates support\nfor applications and services\
    \ with relatively relaxed latency and throughput conditions in\nWPANs. The authors\
    \ of [85] utilized a WSN based on IEEE 802.15.4 and proposed an intelli-\ngent\
    \ system for lighting applications. The authors highlighted the beneﬁts of using\
    \ wireless\nemulsions: uncomplicatedness in the implementation and deployment,\
    \ relatively easier in\nexpanding a network, and ﬂexibility in the system due\
    \ to the use of wireless technology,\nwhich supports the usage of heterogeneous\
    \ devices in the same implemented and deployed\nstructure. Furthermore, they emphasized\
    \ the advantages of employing the same intelligent\ninfrastructure for a variety\
    \ of services, leading to more effective management, monitoring,\nand cost-effectiveness.\
    \ For example, by including speciﬁc smart metering devices such as\nwater or gas\
    \ meters, the smart network or infrastructure (that was initially established\
    \ to\ntarget smart lighting applications) can also be used for smart metering\
    \ applications.\n5G has just supplanted 4G with advanced access schemes called\
    \ BDMA and FBMC\nmultiple access, which was ﬁrst launched in 2015. In the case\
    \ of BDMA multiple access, an\northogonal beam is frequently used, meaning that\
    \ resources can be distributed in parallel to\neach mobile base station by dividing\
    \ the antenna beam in accordance with the position of\nthe mobile stations to\
    \ enable multiple accesses to the base stations. Successively, this helps\nin\
    \ improving the capacity of 5G networks [86]. Speciﬁcally, the idea of moving\
    \ towards\n5G is based on current technology advancements and particularly on\
    \ unique customer\nneeds. Nonetheless, it is typically presumed that implemented\
    \ 5G cellular networks should\naddress noteworthy complications that are not successfully\
    \ addressed by 4G, i.e., enhanced\nnetwork capacity and data rate, lower End-to-End\
    \ (E2E) latency, reduced cost, and con-\nsistent user QoE provisioning. In addition,\
    \ massive and rapid growth in the number of\nhighly developed connected devices\
    \ leads to a sharp increase in network trafﬁc and a\nwidening range of applications\
    \ with unique dynamic requirements and features. Gupta\nand Jha [86] studied numerous\
    \ facilitators, such as choice or use of spectrum, massive\nMIMO, trafﬁc and power\
    \ management policies, ofﬂoading (local), and self-conﬁguring and\norganizing\
    \ networks, which can address these challenges effectively. Real-time managing\n\
    and supervising in smart city scenarios will be conceivable these days thanks\
    \ to 5G. 5G\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n19 of 63\nultimately targets some networking\
    \ possibilities, i.e., ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Com-\nmunications (uRLLC),\
    \ enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), and massive Machine Type\nCommunications (mMTC).\
    \ In a smart city context, eMBB controls data transfer between a\nvariety of networked\
    \ user end devices, edge devices, or cloud servers. Conversely, mMTC\naims to\
    \ manage huge connected, complex devices, such as wearables, actuators, and sen-\n\
    sors, through dense urban deployment. Finally, uRLLC takes responsibility for\
    \ managing\nhighly time-critical communication such as vehicular communication,\
    \ base stations, and\nedge devices communication [87]. Although 5G has completely\
    \ brought about a new\nrevolution in the ﬁeld of networking, numerous unknown\
    \ challenges still are possible in\nthese cases of communication when 5G is deployed\
    \ in the context of smart cities. One major\nproblem is power-efﬁcient communication,\
    \ especially when communicating low-powered\nbattery devices such as sensors and\
    \ other smart, complex wearables. Additionally, when\ntwo distinct technologies\
    \ (4G/5G) work together, there might be a problem. Speciﬁc device-\nlevel compatibility\
    \ problems might always persist when communication infrastructures\nmigrate to\
    \ next-generation platforms. Moreover, a big question arises, namely, how to\n\
    handle the widespread use of gadgets, particularly those in isolated or difﬁcult-to-reach\n\
    places, as well as the potential high costs associated with building and maintaining\
    \ 5G\nnetworks.\nTable 2 compares protocols used for smart cities, while Table\

    The standard and its amendments serve as the foundation for\nwireless network\
    \ products bearing the WiFi brand. This signiﬁes\ntwo raw data rates of 1 and\
    \ 2 Mbps that must be transferred via\nDSSS and FHSS at 2.4 GHz in the ISM band.\n\
    Wireless Standard (basic)\nIEEE 802.11b (1999)\nThis standard is intended to operate\
    \ in the 2.4 GHz spectrum;\nhowever, the level of interference issues is higher\
    \ when this\nstandard-based device tries to interoperate with many other\ndevices/standards\
    \ operating on the same band. It can attain a\ntheoretical data rate of 11 Mbps.\
    \ Nevertheless, dynamic\nadaptations can be applied to the transfer rate subject\
    \ to the current\ninterference level and signal power to minimize the error rate\
    \ (ARS\nPolicy). Depending on the channel conditions, the raw data rates\ncan\
    \ be adapted to 5.5 Mbps, 2 Mbps, and 1 Mbps. Additionally, it\nprovides somewhat\
    \ simpler deployment processes (e.g., upgrading\nthe current chipsets) as it demonstrates\
    \ backward compatibility\nwith the original standard due to the use of CDMA and\
    \ DSSS (same\nas the original standard) [89]. The coverage indoor and outdoor\n\
    ranges are 115 feet and 460 feet, respectively.\nWiFi-1\nIEEE 802.11a (1999)\n\
    Designed to operate on the 5 GHz spectrum and to have the least\namount of interference\
    \ compared to other devices. Depending on\nthe needs, the raw data rates can be\
    \ changed to 48 Mbps, 36 Mbps,\n24 Mbps, 18 Mbps, 12 Mbps, 9 Mbps, and 6 Mbps.\
    \ However, it can\nreach a theoretical transfer rate of 54 Mbps. The coverage\
    \ indoor\nand outdoor ranges are 115 feet and 391 feet, respectively [89].\nWiFi-2\n\
    IEEE 802.11g (2003)\nAllows for device compatibility with devices that operate\
    \ and\nfollow IEEE 802.16b standards. It can also attain a theoretical\ntransfer\
    \ rate of 54 Mbps. In real-time situations, it can achieve a\npractical data rate\
    \ of 24 Mbps. Nonetheless, when IEEE\n802.11b-based devices are introduced into\
    \ IEEE 802.11g networks,\nor when these heterogeneous compliant devices interoperate,\
    \ the\nrate decreases drastically to accommodate IEEE 802.11b-based\ntransmission\
    \ speeds every time that the compliant device tries to\ncommunicate [89]. The\
    \ coverage indoor and outdoor ranges are\n148 feet and 296 feet, respectively.\n\
    WiFi-3\nIEEE 802.11e (2005)\nIt speciﬁes a set of QoS augmentations for WLAN applications\n\
    through extensive amendments to the MAC sub-layer. It addressed\nQoS requirements\
    \ by emphasizing two-channel access schemes:\n(1) the contention-based EDCA scheme\
    \ and (2) the contention-free\nHCCA scheme. This standard, via EDCA, provides\
    \ trafﬁc\nprioritization support based on QoS classes (similar to\ndifferentiated\
    \ services). Conversely, this standard suggests\nparameterized QoS (similar to\
    \ integrated services) via HCCA. It\nalso speciﬁes enhancement over the conventional\
    \ IEEE 802.11\npower saver method (APSD) and reduces the signaling load [95].\
    \ It\nis designed to operate at frequencies ranging from 2.4 to\n2.4835 GHz or\
    \ from 5.75 to 5.850 GHz. This standard also speciﬁes\nthat a high transmission\
    \ rate may not be sufﬁcient to meet the QoS\nrequirements imposed by real-time\
    \ audio, voice, video, and\nlive-streaming applications. Following that, the provisions\

    Enhancement(s)/Feature(s) *\nTarget\nIEEE 802.11n (2009)\nThis standard was suggested\
    \ while keeping the increased speed\nrequirement in mind. Later, it was able to\
    \ boost the attainable\nspeeds of WiFi networks beyond what was possible with\
    \ 802.11g.\nAchieving such high performance required several new features,\nincluding\
    \ a modiﬁed OFDM scheme, power-saving mechanisms,\nantenna technology, MIMO, and\
    \ wider channel bandwidth.\nNonetheless, backward compatibility in the standard\
    \ has been\nsigniﬁcantly affected (reduced) under exceptional scenarios.\nWhenever\
    \ or not an old standard compliance-based device attempts\nto communicate with\
    \ an IEEE 802.11g-based device in an 802.11g\nnetwork, the network’s operation,\
    \ performance, and other\ncapabilities suffer signiﬁcantly. These standard-based\
    \ APs can\noperate in Legacy mode (choosing one standard amongst\n802.11a/b/g),\
    \ Mixed mode (choose (out of 802.11a/b/g/n) and\noperate on heterogeneous conditions),\
    \ and Greenﬁeld mode\n(operate with a single (common) 802.11n altogether) [89].\
    \ It can\nreach a theoretical transfer rate of 600 Mbps. The coverage indoor\n\
    and outdoor ranges are 230 feet and 821 feet, respectively.\nWiFi-4\nIEEE 802.11ac\
    \ (2013)\nThis standard (called initially VHT) was suggested while keeping\nincreased\
    \ speed requirements in mind (likewise with other\nstandards). This standard was\
    \ later able to increase the achievable\nspeeds (up to 1 Gbps (minimum) to 7 Gbps\
    \ (maximum)) of WiFi\nnetworks beyond what 802.11n was capable of. The standard\n\
    enables the transmission of HD videos, online interactive games,\nlive-streaming,\
    \ and other demanding applications. It operates\nusing MU-MIMO technology, which\
    \ enables a single AP and its\nantenna to send data concurrently to several devices.\
    \ As a result,\nthis helps to increase airtime efﬁciency so that every associated\n\
    client—regardless of the 802.11 types it operates on—ﬁnally\nreceives the amount\
    \ of airtime it is supposed to receive, depending\non the technology used.\nWiFi-5\n\
    IEEE 802.11ah (2017)\nDesigned to operate on unlicensed spectrum below 1 GHz,\
    \ it can\nprovide signiﬁcantly more transmission coverage than traditional\n802.11\
    \ standards, which typically operate on 2.4 and 5 GHz bands.\nThis standard can\
    \ be employed in those scenarios where accessible\nbandwidth is comparatively\
    \ narrow. It can normally apply with\nWiFi (outdoor) for performing CTO, large-scale\
    \ WSNs (i.e., smart\ngrid), and extended-range hotspots. Supporting a reasonably\
    \ large\ntransmission range/coverage property aids in managing large-scale\nnetworks\
    \ where the number of devices may be much greater than\nwhat the conventional\
    \ 802.11 standard can support. It advises that\nchanges to the PHY and MAC layers\
    \ be made to provide important\nimprovements including energy-saving capabilities,\
    \ support for\naccommodating a high number of devices, reliable media access\n\
    techniques, and throughput performance improvement by using\nsmall frame formats\
    \ [96].\nExtended coverage, low-power\nWLAN\nIEEE 802.11ax (2021)\nThis standard\
    \ was proposed with the consideration of higher speed\nrequirements. Later, this\
    \ standard increased WiFi network\nachievable speeds above what was made possible\
    \ by earlier\nstandards. Speciﬁcally, it can offer support for a 10 Gbps data\
    \ rate,\nconsistency, and low power consumption. It operates using\nMU-MIMO and\
    \ MU-OFDMA multi-user technologies, which\nenables a single AP and its antenna\
    \ to send data concurrently to\nseveral end devices. Although the 802.11ac standard\
    \ is where\nMU-MIMO technology was ﬁrst introduced, 802.11ax now allows\nfor groups\
    \ of up to eight clients. In addition, this standard also\nsuggests several improvements\
    \ in spatial reusing policies and\npower-saver schemes [97].\nWiFi-6\n* ARS: Adaptive\

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n25 of 63\n4.2. IEEE 802.15.1\nThe IEEE 802.15.1 (WPAN\
    \ protocol) uses the 2.4 GHz spectrum and a master/slave\ntime division duplex\
    \ mechanism that operates smoothly in the 10 to 100 m range with a\n1 Mbps data\
    \ rate. This technology uses modest data rates for short-range services designed\n\
    to use less power. Recent implementations of this technology include Bluetooth\
    \ and\nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE), offering IP connectivity to aid the IoT [98].\
    \ The deployment\nof services offered for tracking and localization devices is\
    \ typically suggested by BLE-based\ndevices, which are recognized as BLE beacons.\
    \ These beacons produce a signal that other\ncompatible devices can pick up between\
    \ 50 and 70 m away. Using such a beacon promises\ngreater indoor localization\
    \ accuracy than other technologies such as WiFi or GPS. They can\nbe used for\
    \ a wide range of services targeted toward information dissemination, the launch\n\
    of points of sale, user tracking, etc., thanks to this capability. Additionally,\
    \ to provide\nspeciﬁc services of interest, it is frequently required to combine\
    \ the BLE technology with\nother technologies such as WiFi [99]. Originally, the\
    \ aim of BLE technology (Bluetooth\nClassic Radio (BCR)) was to provide a continuous\
    \ wireless connection, i.e., BlueTooth\nBasic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BT BR/EDR).\
    \ It became the perfect option for the IoT\nsince it permits connectivity and\
    \ audio-streaming applications using brief bursts of long-\ndistance radio, which\
    \ lowers the battery consumption of mobile devices (because they need\nnot be\
    \ connected all the time). Using the idea of dual-mode chipsets and the new BLE\n\
    speciﬁcation, smartphones or regular phones can be linked to other heterogeneous\
    \ devices\n(such as headphones) in BR/EDR mode. Otherwise, they can be connected\
    \ to wearables\nin LE mode. A low-power radio called BCR, or BT BR/EDR, intends\
    \ to broadcast data\nacross 79 channels in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range.\
    \ Wireless audio streaming is\nprimarily made possible through BCR, which has\
    \ evolved into the industry-standard radio\nprotocol for in-car entertainment\
    \ systems, wireless speakers, and headphones. BLE aims to\ntransmit data over\
    \ 40 channels in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range. To facilitate the\ndeployment\
    \ of dependable and large-scale device networks, BLE seeks to provide support\n\
    for a wide range of communication methods, typically P2P; broadcast; and, most\
    \ notably,\nmesh [100]. This unique Bluetooth feature can be used to create distribution\
    \ and locating\nmaps utilizing ﬁngerprint templates for indoor device and user\
    \ localization. Due to BLE’s\ngreater susceptibility to abrupt fading and substantial\
    \ changes in received signal strength,\nit has been proven that using BLE is more\
    \ efﬁcient than using WiFi-based solutions [99,101].\nHowever, Bluetooth technology\
    \ has a problem with increasing power usage, particularly\nwhen its BR/EDR mode\
    \ is used in an IoT context. This is because this mode allows the\nmaster nodes\
    \ to continuously poll the slave nodes, even when there is no data transmission.\n\
    The researchers [102,103] already brought up this issue, addressed it, and offered\
    \ a variety\nof scheduling techniques for polling the slave nodes. Moreover, the\
    \ BR/EDR mode reveals\na lack of scalability that further restricts the performance\
    \ of the system.\n4.3. LoRA\nThe LoRa protocol was primarily used for WAN applications\
    \ and operated as a low-\ndata-rate, low-power technology on the sub-1 GHz spectrum\
    \ that could go up to 10 km.\nLoRa communicates on three classes of bandwidth:\
    \ 125, 250, and 500 KHz. Even while\nthis technology can function at the largest\
    \ bandwidth class, which further improves data\nrate, it still causes issues with\
    \ high power consumption, a shorter communication range,\nand an increase in the\
    \ likelihood of interference because it is free to operate in a wider\nfrequency\
    \ spectrum. This method is founded on the idea of spread spectrum modulation\n\
    and a CSSM variant with a spreading factor ranging from 7 to 12. The transmission\
    \ range\nwill expand as the spreading factor’s value rises, but the power consumption\
    \ will rise\nas well. The CSSM utilizes complete allocated bandwidth, thereby\
    \ making it resilient to\nchannel noise and multi-path fading, but it does not\
    \ differentiate the noise in the channel\nsuch as DSSS. In contrast to the FSK\
    \ modulation approach, which normally identiﬁes\nsignals that are 8 to 10 dB above\
    \ the noise ﬂoor, the CSSM feature enables this technology\nto sense, perceive,\
    \ and capture signals that are 19.5 dB below the noise ﬂoor [103]. Its\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n26 of 63\narchitecture uses a star network topology and includes\
    \ gateways and end nodes. In this\ndesign, end nodes are referred to as slaves\
    \ and run on battery-powered devices with\nlimited power, but gateways are thought\
    \ of as powerful machines that gather data from\nslave nodes. Furthermore, LoRaWAN\
    \ is a communication layer that operates on top of\nLoRA. LoRaWAN incorporates\
    \ the basic LoRa criteria and suggests improved adaptability\nand suitability\
    \ for low-power applications. This layer/technology has advantages over\ncellular\
    \ technologies, which are expected to be battery hungry by the concept. In practice,\n\
    LoRaWAN improved network features and functionalities by addressing the concept\
    \ of\na specialized server (network) and speciﬁcally deﬁning numerous device types\
    \ to meet\nthe needs of each specialized application. Managed communication, packet\
    \ ﬁltering, and\npacket scheduling are all made possible using specialized network\
    \ servers. LoRaWAN\nhas also facilitated bi-directional-employing adaptive transmission\
    \ power and rate, which\naids in optimizing network performance in terms of power\
    \ consumption and throughput.\nThis technology can be employed for a wide range\
    \ of applications, such as smart health\nnursing [104], trafﬁc monitoring [105],\
    \ agriculture monitoring [106], localization [107],\nand smart grid applications\
    \ [108]. In particular, this technology is useful for non-latency-\nsensitive\
    \ applications and those that call for extensive deployments. Haxhibeqiri et al.\
    \ [109]\nand Adelantado et al. [110] emphasized that LoRaWAN is feasible for smart\
    \ metering,\ntracking, and localization-based applications. At the same time,\
    \ it is not so feasible for\nreal-time monitoring and video surveillance.\n4.4.\
    \ WiMAX\nWiMAX can handle high capacity, i.e., a potential peak data rate of 60\
    \ Mbps for an\nentire downlink operation and a rate of 28 Mbps for an entirely\
    \ uplink operation, based on\nthe original IEEE 802.16 air interface standard\
    \ (2004) [111] and the IEEE 802.16e amend-\nment [112]. It can be done using two\
    \ antennas with a channel bandwidth of 10 MHz.\nAdditionally, it may provide support\
    \ for multimedia services with different trafﬁc charac-\nteristics and wide area\
    \ mobility with changing QoS needs. Additionally, it offers a variety\nof QoS\
    \ scheduling options for accommodating heterogeneous trafﬁc, such as Internet\
    \ data\ntrafﬁc, VoIP (Voice over IP), classic audio trafﬁc, and voice and video\
    \ streams [113].\nTable 5 shows the speciﬁed WiMAX standards and their operational\
    \ parameters [114].\nThis standard provides a communication channel between geographically\
    \ separated de-\nvices. As a result, the maximum achievable covered distance ranges\
    \ between 30 km and\n100 km. However, this technology has some drawbacks, such\
    \ as high installation costs\nand the possibility of complications and irregularities\
    \ when dealing with high-deﬁnition\nmultimedia trafﬁc.\nWireless network trafﬁc\
    \ has recently increased extraordinarily due to the rapid pro-\nliferation of\
    \ smart handheld devices, sensors, and actuators. These devices, along with\n\
    smart controllers, mobile users, and other smart services-based specialized devices,\
    \ are\nthe most common use cases for W-LANs in dense network environments. In\
    \ such a dense\nnetwork environment, interference is a critical issue that must\
    \ be addressed if satisfactory\nperformance and, thus, proﬁcient spatial frequency\
    \ reuse is required. Subsequently, the\nstandards IEEE 802.11 were designed and\
    \ implemented to support these requirements.\nNumerous international organizations,\
    \ including IEEE and 3GPP, adopted and improved\ntheir technologies in response\
    \ to changing needs and the emerging IoT market. For instance,\nthe original IEEE\
    \ 802.11 (WiFi) standard was designed to support and provide superior\nthroughput\
    \ performance to a small number of stations located close to each other, and as\
    \ a\nresult, this technology was not particularly useful for IoT systems. As a\
    \ result, to address\nthe challenges and requirements of IoT, the IEEE 802.11ah\
    \ Task Group (TG) was formed by\nthe IEEE 802.11 MAN/LAN Standards Committee to\
    \ redesign and extend the applicability\nof WiFi standards to IoT scenarios. They\
    \ focused on the critical issue of power-aware\nefﬁcient schemes and protocols\
    \ to extend the functionality and applicability of 802.11-based\nnetworks while\
    \ dealing with a variety of small power-constrained smart outdoor and\nindoor\
    \ devices [55,97].\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n27 of 63\nTable 5. WiMAX standards\

    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n28 of 63\n4.5. Challenges in IoT Communication Using the TCP/IP\
    \ Protocol Suite\nIn IoT, smart sensing motes, devices, and actuators share unique\
    \ features such as\nconstrained memory, power, and processing capabilities; the\
    \ need for facilitating real-time\nrequirements of smart applications; extremely\
    \ vulnerable radio environments; and little to\nno human involvement after deployment\
    \ [115]. By enabling communication amongst these\ndevices utilizing low-power-cost\
    \ technologies, a new infrastructure for deployed smart\nservices has been formed.\
    \ Researchers [116] argued that the TCP/IP protocol suite might\nprovide a solution\
    \ and be ﬂexible enough for a variety of evolving IoT communication\nscenarios.\
    \ Unfortunately, there were additional challenges that network administrators,\n\
    designers, and researchers had to overcome. Researchers were searching for the\
    \ best way\nto install IPv6-based sensor motes that can effectively/minimally\
    \ use the system’s limited\nresources (i.e., power and bandwidth). Because of\
    \ such power constraints, researchers\nhighlighted the requirements of low-power\
    \ Layer-2 technologies (i.e., BLE, IEEE 802.15.4)\nand low-power WiFi usage. In\
    \ contrast with traditional Ethernet links, these technologies\noperate with smaller\
    \ maximum transmission unit (MTU) sizes and slower transmission\nspeeds. IoT network\
    \ protocol designers faced a problem in adapting to and determining\nthe ideal\
    \ MTU size. Another obstacle is that IoT networks often are based solely on wireless\n\
    networks and thus they can only communicate using wireless mesh technologies.\
    \ This\nvulnerability brings extra challenges in front of TCP/IP architecture:\n\
    (1)\nThe current IP addressing model cannot assist mesh communication (since it\
    \ relies on\na multi-link subnet prototype) at all.\n(2)\nIn mesh communication,\
    \ the multicasting and broadcasting communication methods are\nquite expensive,\
    \ power-demanding, and prohibitive as the network nodes are extremely\npower constrained.\
    \ Moreover, unicasting is the only remaining alternative method.\n(3)\nUnicasting\
    \ is power intensive in and of itself because it may take many hops while\nforwarding\
    \ and may wake up an excessive number of nodes that are asleep. Notably,\nidle\
    \ nodes and hops can modify the radio state’s operation mode to save power. Ad-\n\
    ditionally, a large amount of power is used and saved by a node during transmission,\n\
    reception, overhearing, idle, and sleeping phases [117]. However, to ensure successful\n\
    delivery, we cannot just alter the operational modes. Instead, it requires effective\n\
    coordination and intricate synchronization [117,118].\n(4)\nThere is a high requirement\
    \ for scalable routing/forwarding schemes for IP communi-\ncation to take place\
    \ over mesh architectural systems.\n(5)\nFor many IoT applications requiring data\
    \ prioritizing and customized control, original\nTCP-suited features such as those\
    \ operational on ﬁxed MSS sizes (such as MTU sizes)\nthat further lead to silly\
    \ window syndrome or in-order byte-stream delivery to ensure\ndependability, are\
    \ unsuitable [119]. Nonetheless, the IETF started deﬁning standard\nInternet protocols\
    \ such as RPL [120] for such specialized environments to minimize\nprotocol overheads\
    \ that impair the computing ability and memory management of\nthese specialized\
    \ resource-constrained devices.\nWiFi-based infrastructure networks enable backhauling\
    \ support, which helps estab-\nlish and sustain seamless connectivity among smart\
    \ IoT devices. In smart home wireless\nnetworks, this form of connectivity can\
    \ be provided through TCP connections. The TCP/IP\nprotocol suite supports dependable\
    \ data delivery and congestion control strategies to main-\ntain network throughput\
    \ performance via TCP at Layer-4. TCP is a protocol that has been\nregularly modiﬁed\
    \ and improved over the years to effectively transport large amounts of\nbyte-stream\
    \ in-ordered data via resilient P2P connections with comparatively lower latency\n\
    needs. IoT services deal with atypical communication patterns, for which TCP/IP\
    \ protocol\nsuite-based protocols, such as TCP, are unable to handle such patterns\
    \ adequately [119].\nThere are severe problems that TCP faces when it deals with\
    \ an IoT application:\n(1)\nTCP connection establishment and termination (three-way\
    \ handshaking) incur signiﬁ-\ncant overhead in the system as most communication\
    \ in an IoT application includes\nthe transmission of brief segments and relatively\
    \ little data.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n29 of 63\n(2)\nTCP functionality needs\
    \ resilient P2P connections. It is impossible to sustain these con-\nnections\
    \ in an IoT network environment because smart sensors and other connected\ndevices\
    \ switch their mode of radio state from active to sleep phase persistently [119].\n\
    (3)\nSome IoT applications might need broadcast and multicast communication patterns,\n\
    and enabling such patterns via TCP will result in substantial network overhead\
    \ in the\nentire IoT system and high-power consumption.\n(4)\nSome IoT services\
    \ have very granular delay requirements, and any extra delay in\nthe form of connection\
    \ establishment or MSS creation (waiting for data to ﬁll the\nentire MSS) is completely\
    \ unacceptable for their performance. Thus, TCP is unable to\nprovide much support\
    \ for these IoT services.\n(5)\nIoT applications that rely on wireless communication\
    \ scenarios must deal with crit-\nical wireless channel characteristics such as\
    \ channel error, interference, and wire-\nless interface properties that result\
    \ in buffer-induced, channel-induced, link-layer\ncontention-induced, and collision-induced\
    \ packet losses. When TCP operates in such\na setting, its stringent in-order\
    \ delivery requirements and retransmission policies\n(i.e., fast retransmission)\
    \ may occasionally result in very serious system problems\nsuch as Head-of-Line\
    \ (HoL) or Receiver Buffer Blocking, which ultimately results in\na reduction\
    \ in throughput, delay, and power consumption performance [121–124].\nFurthermore,\
    \ wireless MAC methods that use MAC-level retransmissions may fur-\nther impair\
    \ TCP’s performance, if Layer-2 retransmission latency exceeds the TCP\nRetransmission\
    \ Time Out timer.\nSome standards, such as BACnet/IP [125], were proposed to implement\
    \ Layer-4\nfunctionalities at the Application Layer (AppL) itself and proposed\
    \ to utilize UDP as an\nunderlying Layer-4 protocol. Managing packet losses should\
    \ depend on an application’s\nrequirements, which may vary from application to\
    \ application. However, TCP and its\nupdated variants rely on the concept of data\
    \ delivery deferment and try to perform retrans-\nmissions from an already created\
    \ copy in the sender buffer. However, this is not the only\napproach to dealing\
    \ with packet losses in the network. Another method is for AppL to\naccept packet\
    \ delivery that is not completely ﬂawless and proceed with its current opera-\n\
    tions. This feature will be helpful in real-time audio and video distribution.\
    \ Additionally,\nretransmission is an additional option. However, AppL should\
    \ handle this retransmission\nrather than an underlying Layer-4 protocol such\
    \ as TCP. In terms of buffering the lost data\nbits, doing so enables the source\
    \ application to reconstruct them. Furthermore, in situations\nwhere real-time\
    \ services are severely constrained, the transmitting application may transmit\n\
    fresh data instead of retransmitting lost data to “repair” the effects of the\
    \ initial loss [126].\nClark and Tennenhouse [126] concluded these concepts and\
    \ subsequently introduced the\nconcept of Application Level Framing (ALF). Implementing\
    \ Layer-4 facilities at AppL itself\nbrings the idea of employing ALF into the\
    \ system. Hence, utilizing the notion of ALF,\na network can recognize individual\
    \ Application Data Units (ADUs), and subsequently\ncan offer support for ﬂexible\
    \ Layer-4 facilities, i.e., employing adaptive retransmission\nprocedures for\
    \ diverse forms of ADUs and disseminating data more effectively by using\nin-network\
    \ caching. Unluckily, the TCP/IP protocol suite forbids applications from adding\n\
    any application semantics into network-level packet structure. Therefore, it fails\
    \ to provide\nsupport for the ALF scheme [119].\n4.6. Compound TCP for IoT\nCompound\
    \ TCP [127] was initially designed to offer support for improved channel\nutilization\
    \ and fairness performances. It will play a signiﬁcant role in home networks with\n\
    WiFi-assisted smart and standard devices [115,128].\nPokhrel and Williamson [115]\
    \ studied the effectiveness of a compound TCP over an\nIoT scenario involving\
    \ sensors and other devices (i.e., smartphones, laptops, PC, and home\nappliances).\
    \ They analyzed and evaluated the scenario improving the performance of con-\n\
    nections made using the examined TCP variant across infrastructure WiFi networks\
    \ in the\npresence of signiﬁcant buffer-overﬂow-induced losses and severely degraded\
    \ transmission\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n30 of 63\nchannel circumstances. The\
    \ authors also addressed the varying bandwidth requirements\nfor all IoT devices\
    \ as well as ubiquitous connectivity, ranging from traditional bandwidth-\nhungry\
    \ Internet devices to low-power gadgets. The authors of [129] demonstrated a\n\
    thorough evaluation of the steady-state performance of TCP via WiFi-assisted classical\n\
    devices considering the situations of high-buffer-overﬂow-induced losses and signiﬁcantly\n\
    deteriorated transmission channel conditions. The authors of [115,129] suggested\
    \ models\nthat aided in capturing the dynamics of congestion and ﬂow control of\
    \ several concurrently\nrunning competitive long-lived compound TCP connections.\
    \ In evaluating and developing\nthese models, they considered MAC-level retransmissions,\
    \ link-layer contention, channel\nfailures, and collision. The authors of [130]\
    \ utilized a transient model suggesting a new\nqueue management scheme to capture\
    \ the interactions of short-lived TCP ﬂows (the most\nworkable ﬂows in IoT scenarios)\
    \ over conventional trafﬁc patterns over WiFi networks.\nHowever, the performance\
    \ of TCP in WiFi networks is constrained, especially when using\na single shared\
    \ Access Points (APs). As a result, TCP might not be able to scale well and\n\
    provide superior performance in wide-area Industry 4.0 networks, especially when\
    \ wireless\nchannels are often reused by several APs [131].\n4.7. Viewpoints of\
    \ Network Layer Routing for IoT Systems\nThe network architectures for IoT are\
    \ heterogeneous and include WiFi, WSNs, Wireless\nMesh Networks (WMNs), Vehicular\
    \ Networks, and Mobile Communication Networks\n(MCNs) (5G/LTE/4G/3G) [132]. Due\
    \ to the large-scale production of intelligent sensing\ndevices, survivability\
    \ and self-organization of deployed functional networks are essential. A\nWSN\
    \ is deployed for a variety of smart agricultural, environmental, domestic, and\
    \ military\napplications. It is an ad-hoc network with no infrastructure, in which\
    \ the sensor nodes\ncommunicate over multi-hop routing. WSNs run on battery-powered,\
    \ low-power sensors\ncapable of sensing, collecting, processing, aggregating,\
    \ and regulating communication.\nNumerous WSN-based platforms, including MICA2,\
    \ TelosB, and MICAz MOTE, have\nbeen suggested. Therefore, some standards were\
    \ introduced to enable interaction and\nother compatibilities among these numerous\
    \ heterogeneous platforms. For example, the\nIEEE802.15.4 (Zigbee) standard creates\
    \ the WSNs backbone as part of the IoT. WSNs provide\ncritical functionalities\
    \ for developing IoT systems, allowing Low-Powered battery-operated\nEnd Devices\
    \ (LPEDs) with very minimal resources to attach to the Internet. A WSN can be\n\
    considered a special form of LoWPAN consisting of several equipped sensor nodes.\
    \ Due\nto the lack of IP communication infrastructure, interoperability must be\
    \ obtained from the\nviewpoint of WSN and the Internet. To address the interoperability\
    \ issue, various works\nsuggested a standardized arrangement that could enable\
    \ the usage of IP over LoWPAN.\nThe IEEE 802.15.4 standard allows for the interoperability\
    \ for Low power and Lossy\nNetworks (LLNs). The design tenet of this standard\
    \ outlines the physical and data link\nlayers of the network and offers a low-cost\
    \ framework for network operations. To link\nLPEDs to the Internet, 6LoWPAN may\
    \ be used as an adaptation layer to enable sensors\nto implement an IP stack and\
    \ become approachable by other conventional devices over\nthe Internet. This adaptability\
    \ layer also supports end-to-end connectivity, which enables\na variety of applications\
    \ and permits these LPEDs to implement routing and forwarding\nalgorithms at the\
    \ Internet layer. However, the current network layer routing policies cannot\n\
    be supported when the number of nodes grows. Therefore, the RPL protocol [72]\
    \ considers\nthe LLN situation [133]. Most of the nodes in LLNs are resource-constrained,\
    \ and they are\nconnected by some lossy links that only support low data rates.\
    \ These links are thought\nto be extremely unstable and have poor performance\
    \ in terms of packet delivery rates. In\nsuch specialized networks, the trafﬁc\
    \ patterns are often P2MP and MultiPoint-2-MultiPoint\n(MP2MP) rather than just\
    \ P2P [72]. These networks contain hundreds of smart devices.\nThis makes the\
    \ implementation of routing policies more difﬁcult than ever. In addition,\nnumerous\
    \ existing traditional ad-hoc wireless network routing methods, such as DSR and\n\
    AODV, cannot manage these unique situations and unforeseen circumstances. Designing\n\
    and implementing routing in ad-hoc networking settings has been more difﬁcult\
    \ due to the\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n31 of 63\nmobility aspect and the resource\
    \ limitations at wireless nodes. Their forwarding policies’\ndesign principles\
    \ emphasize QoS elements including bandwidth usage and end-to-end\nlatency [134,135].\
    \ The forwarding rules frequently created and applied for WSNs situations\ntake\
    \ into account the increase in the network lifetime by effectively utilizing the\
    \ node\nenergy [117,136]. As these ad-hoc networks were designed to operate and\
    \ maintain solely\ninside their operational infrastructure, this was very feasible.\
    \ However, the interoperability\nof these ad-hoc networks is a major problem when\
    \ such networks are integrated with\nIoT networks. The ad-hoc network integration\
    \ with IoT needs novel routing policies\nthat support scalability and assure QoS,\
    \ fairness, and connectivity between two nodes\n(both in APs and ad-hoc networks)\
    \ with the least amount of power consumption. The\nstandard classical forwarding\
    \ strategies were intended to ensure QoS between a pair of\ndevices/nodes. In\
    \ the case of an IoT environment, the routing procedures should suggest\nenough\
    \ fairness so that each node can sufﬁciently get enough chances to communicate\
    \ with\nnearby APs. For such specialized scenarios, hierarchical routing solutions\
    \ are followed\nto decrease data redundancy and ensure data aggregation. Researchers\
    \ have often raised\nconcerns about the disadvantaged forwarding rules, which\
    \ lead to the consumption of\nexcess energy in networks while taking into account\
    \ mobile and static ad-hoc network\nscenarios. It consequently increases the likelihood\
    \ of frequent network disconnections,\nroute failures, and even network partitioning,\
    \ all contributing to the system’s signiﬁcant\nMAC-level and routing-level overhead\
    \ problems [134,135]. Hence, bearing in mind the\nhigh-power consumption problem,\
    \ many researchers presented numerous smart routing\nparadigms [118,134,135,137].\
    \ Still, many of these suggested schemes failed to achieve the\ndesired QoS.\n\
    Cross-layer design-based recommendations for power consumption and congestion\n\
    control are well-suited design proposals for comprehending the changes in wireless\
    \ channel\nattributes. Therefore, signiﬁcant work has been done in these areas.\
    \ These designs provide\nsupport for dynamically accessing and evaluating extremely\
    \ variable channel parameters\nat lower layers (MAC and PHY) for the Internet/Routing\
    \ and Transport layers to further\noptimize forwarding and congestion window adaptations\
    \ decisions [121,134,135,138–140].\nThe Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)\
    \ indicates how well a device can hear a\nsignal from an AP or router. A network\
    \ layer forwarding policy can effectively utilize the\nRSSI (accessible through\
    \ lower layers dynamically) to assess link quality. AODV and DSR\nare examples\
    \ of the traditional ad-hoc routing protocols used in various smart forwarding\n\
    systems designed for IoT scenarios. The AOMDV IoT [141] and MLB [142] routing\
    \ mecha-\nnisms were suggested for the IoT scenarios and talked about node and\
    \ link disjoint paths\nwhile discovering routes. However, the proposed schemes\
    \ do not shed light and discuss\nanything related to performance issues when there\
    \ is a signiﬁcant level of interference in\nthe network because of trafﬁc running\
    \ parallel onto multiple paths. The abovementioned\ntechniques do not always perform\
    \ well in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay.\nRecently, the scheme [140]\
    \ considered different critical factors such as interference level,\nlink-layer\
    \ contentions, routing load, MAC load, and other performance issues related to\n\
    wireless scenarios. The authors of [140] insisted that multipath load distribution\
    \ policies’\nefﬁciency depends on the distribution (physical) of routes. Nevertheless,\
    \ different possible\ndisjoint routes—those lacking any common nodes or links—might\
    \ be able to interfere\nwith one another due to the radio signals’ predicted broadcasting\
    \ behavior in wireless\ncommunication. Consequently, such separate disconnected\
    \ pathways could be utilized to\nenhance the performance of the network as a whole\
    \ [138,140].\nWhen employing an IoT-based system, the end sensor nodes depend\
    \ on WSN-based\nnetworking connectivity to deliver sensed and collected data from\
    \ smart things to sink\nnodes. These nodes are commonly known as IoT GateWay nodes\
    \ (IoT-GW). To balance\nenergy usage and gather crucial sensor data, numerous\
    \ such static and mobile IoT-GWs\ncan be deployed in the system. In the whole\
    \ system, numerous WSNs, gathering numerous\ntypes of critical data, are connected\
    \ to the Internet [142,143]. Originally, Zigbee speciﬁed\nthree forms of devices:\
    \ Zigbee Coordinator, Zigbee Router, and Zigbee End Device, and\nElectronics 2023,\
    \ 12, 2490\n32 of 63\nthree forms of network topologies: tree, star, and mesh.\
    \ Moreover, the Zigbee stack\nembraces AODV to create paths dynamically. In the\
    \ case of star network topology, the\nReduced and Fully Functional Devices (i.e.,\
    \ RFDs and FFDs) can communicate with the\nPAN central coordinator only. They\
    \ are not capable of communicating with one another.\nHere, the PAN coordinator\
    \ may be powered by mains, while the RFDs and FFDs run on\nlow-powered limited\
    \ battery devices. Moreover, in the case of the mesh network topology,\nany device\
    \ can communicate to within-range devices at a point of time. Moreover, this\n\
    topology contains a PAN coordinator, which can communicate with other RFDs and\
    \ FFDs.\nFurthermore, this networking topology offers support for the usage of\
    \ the integrated\nforwarding scheme united with hierarchical/tree and AODV routing\
    \ procedures. Lastly,\nthe tree (cluster) network topology is a subset form of\
    \ mesh networking topology, consisting\nof RFDs and FFDs (which may act as coordinators).\
    \ However, the FFD count could be\nmore than the RFD count in the network. RFDs\
    \ may attach to tree (cluster) network\ntopology as the end nodes in the system.\
    \ The coordinator FFDs can offer synchronization\nfunctionalities to other connected\
    \ coordinators and devices. However, there will be a single\nPAN coordinator amongst\
    \ these coordinators [144].\n4.8. IoT Application Protocols\nEach IoT application\
    \ is based on IoT application layer protocols for data transfer.\nThese protocols\
    \ can be the following:\n•\nRepresentational State Transfer Hypertext Transfer\
    \ Protocol (REST HTTP): HTTP [145] is\nthe primary client/server protocol that\
    \ adopts the request/response model. HTPP has\nbeen related to the REST architecture\
    \ [146] to ease the interaction between dissimilar\nentities over web-based services.\
    \ The mixture of HTTP and REST enables IoT devices\nto make their status readily\
    \ available in terms of the standardized CRUD (create, read,\nupdate, delete)\
    \ functions [147]. The CRUD functions are mapped to the POST, GET,\nPUT, and DELETE\
    \ techniques of HTTP, correspondingly. In this fashion, we can build\na REST model\
    \ for dissimilar IoT devices [148].\n•\nConstrained Application Protocol (CoAP)\
    \ [149]: It is a lightweight RESTful protocol lately\nstandardized by the Internet\
    \ Engineering Task Force (IETF). CoAP is used by IoT\ndevices for IP-based, HTTP-like\
    \ interactions. It uses UDP with acknowledgment mes-\nsages to set up reliable\
    \ communication based on a request/response interaction. It has\nreduced complexity,\
    \ and thus it is suitable for resource-constrained IoT applications\nand machine-to-machine\
    \ (M2M) communication.\n•\nMessage Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) [150] is\
    \ established for IoT messaging.\nAccording to MQTT design principles, network\
    \ bandwidth and device resource re-\nquirements should be kept to a minimum while\
    \ also aiming to assure dependability\nand some level of delivery assurance. Since\
    \ June 2016, MQTT has been recognized by\nISO as a standard (ISO/IEC 20922). The\
    \ protocol continues to progress by formalizing\npopular capability options and\
    \ adding new functionalities. The most recent version,\nMQTT v5.0, was released\
    \ in 2018. MQTT operates according to a publish/subscribe\nparadigm. Clients connect\
    \ to a centralized broker when using MQTT.\n•\nOpen Platform Communications Uniﬁed\
    \ Architecture (OPC UA) [151]: This interoper-\nability standard is used for the\
    \ secure and reliable exchange of data in the industrial\nautomation domain and\
    \ other industries. It is platform independent and ensures\nthe seamless ﬂow of\
    \ information among IoT devices from multiple vendors. It sup-\nports two different\
    \ communication methods: the Client/Server method as well as\nPublish/Subscribe\
    \ (e.g., over UDP or MQTT) to mainly meet different industry re-\nquirements from\
    \ the production systems to edge and cloud scenarios. Today, the main\nIoT vendors\
    \ including IBM, AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft, and SIEMENS leverage\nsecure, standardized\
    \ information exchange in edge-to-cloud applications based on\nOPC UA.\n•\nExtensible\
    \ Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [152]: This extensible protocol is\n\
    based on text messages that use XML (Extensible Mark-up Language), through which\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n33 of 63\nit can implement both request/response and\
    \ publish/subscribe methods by using\nsuitable extensions. XMPP exchanges instant\
    \ messages between clients, and this\nhappens in real-time using a push mechanism\
    \ to avoid increasing unnecessary network\nloads. XMPP also determines the state\
    \ of an XMPP entity as online, ofﬂine, busy, etc.\n•\nAdvanced Message Queuing\
    \ Protocol (AMQP) [153]: An open standard for passing\nbusiness messages between\
    \ applications or organizations using TCP. It connects sys-\ntems, feeds business\
    \ processes with the information they need, and reliably transmits\nonward the\
    \ instructions that achieve their goals using the point/point and pub-\nlish/subscribe\
    \ interaction modes. AMQP was designed to achieve the main goals of\nmessage orientation;\
    \ queuing; routing; security; reliability; and interoperability.\n•\nData Distribution\
    \ Service (DDS) [154]: DDS was developed by the Open Management\nGroup (OMG).\
    \ DDS is a real-time M2M protocol that enables dependable, high-\nperformance,\
    \ interoperable, scalable data exchanges using a publish–subscribe pattern.\n\
    DDS provides low-latency data connectivity, high reliability, and scalability\
    \ in publish–\nsubscribe and request/response patterns over TCP and UDP. The needs\
    \ of various\nIoT applications requiring real-time data exchange can be addressed\
    \ using DDS. Such\napplications are air trafﬁc control, transportation systems,\
    \ autonomous vehicles, and\nsmart grid management.\nLastly, Glaroudis et al. [155]\
    \ provided a comparison among IoT application protocols\nin terms of well-accepted\
    \ key performance indicators and discussed their suitability in the\nframework\
    \ of smart farming.\n5. Networking Architectures and Protocols\n5.1. Generic Architectures\n\
    Zanella et al. [37] provided an in-depth analysis of an urban IoT’s enabling technolo-\n\
    gies, protocols, and architecture. They also demonstrated the implementation of\
    \ an IoT\nisland as a proof-of-concept in the Italian City of Padova. In the IoT,\
    \ two methods provide\ndata access to objects/things. The ﬁrst involves deploying\
    \ multi-hop mesh networks with\nshort-range communication among network nodes\
    \ using unlicensed frequency. The second\ninvolves using licensed frequency band\
    \ long-range cellular technologies (e.g., 2G/GSM).\nCentenaro et al. [156] presented\
    \ a hopeful alternative solution (i.e., a new type of wire-\nless connectivity)\
    \ called Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs). LPWAN is based\non a star topology\
    \ characterized by low-rate, long-range transmission technologies in\nthe unlicensed\
    \ sub-GHz frequency bands. The authors considered LPWAN to provide\nconnectivity\
    \ in the IoT scenario for a characteristic SCA. Furthermore, they discussed\n\
    the advantages of LPWAN over well-known methods regarding effectiveness, efﬁciency,\n\
    and architectural design. Leccese et al. [157] created a Raspberry-Pi Card-controlled\
    \ SCA\nthat uses a ZigBee Sensor Network and WiMAX to provide completely controlled\
    \ street\nlighting. Sanchez et al. [158] described SmartSantander, an IoT experimental\
    \ research\nfacility that was deployed in Santander City, Spain. SmartSantander\
    \ supports testing\nproposed protocols, services, and conﬁgurations in a realistic\
    \ setting at an appropriate\nscale. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is\
    \ a signiﬁcant part of IoT. Vilajosana\nand Dohler [159] reviewed currently used\
    \ smart city M2M technologies (i.e., sensors, data\nloggers, wireless modems,\
    \ and gateway). They considered one of the most famous deploy-\nment use cases,\
    \ i.e., smart parking. In any IoT environment for smart cities, a huge amount\n\
    of M2M communication requests occur. Unfortunately, conventional network gateways\n\
    cannot face this challenge. Huang et al. [160] presented an admission control\
    \ model for\nM2M communications. Their model differentiates all M2M requests into\
    \ delay-sensitive\nand delay-tolerant. Then, it aggregates all delay-tolerant\
    \ requests by routing them into\none low-priority queue, aiming to reduce the\
    \ number of requests from various devices\nto the access point in the IoT for\
    \ smart cities. Silva et al. [161] developed the bottom-up\narchitecture after\
    \ analyzing a variety of existing architectures. This architecture has four\n\
    layers: sensing, transmission, data management, and application. Each layer integrates\n\
    security modules to protect sensitive data. The sensing layer, located at the\
    \ bottom of the\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n34 of 63\narchitecture, collects\
    \ data from physical devices. The transmission layer is located above\nthe sensing\
    \ layer. Several communication technologies are used to transmit data from the\n\
    transmission layer to the (upper) data management layer. The data management layer\n\
    performs data fusion, data analysis, data processing, and data storing. It stores\
    \ valuable\ninformation that various applications use at the application layer\
    \ to provide services.\nThe majority of the above works mainly focus on a single\
    \ characteristic, such as quality\nof service [162].\nMarques et al. [163] proposed\
    \ a generic, multilevel IoT-based smart cities infrastructure\nmanagement architecture\
    \ that allows the integration of physical objects, communication\ninfrastructure,\
    \ cloud platform, and IoT-based services in a pervasive way. This architecture\n\

    \ is a generic solution, so the underlying layers are designed to offer\nsupport\
    \ to the applications. Therefore, it can be adapted to the speciﬁc implementa-\n\
    tion of a given service. To this end, the authors adapted their architecture to\
    \ a waste\nmanagement scenario.\nAnother multi-level smart city architecture [164]\
    \ was built on semantic web technolo-\ngies, and its design is mostly used in\
    \ smart city wireless sensor network applications. Data\ncollection, data processing,\
    \ integration and reasoning, and device control and alerts make\nup its four layers.\
    \ Using ontology, a data model, at the network’s edge, Gheisari et al. [165]\n\
    suggested a novel architecture for IoT devices in the smart city that protects\
    \ privacy.\nSaadeh et al. [166] proposed a four-layer architecture for mobile\
    \ object authentication in the\ncontext of IoT smart cities. Their architecture\
    \ is based on the applicability of a proposed hier-\narchical elliptic curve identity-based\
    \ signature authentication protocol. Naranjo et al. [167]\npresented a Fog-based\
    \ smart city network architecture called FogC Architecture Network\n(FOCAN). To\
    \ reduce latency and increase the efﬁciency of services among things with\nvarious\
    \ capabilities, FOCAN is a multi-tier framework in which the applications operating\n\
    on things collaborate to compute, route, and interact with one another through\
    \ the smart\ncity environment. One of FOCAN’s primary beneﬁts is that the IoT\
    \ device can deliver\nservices effectively and with less energy consumption.\n\
    5.2. SDN-IoT Architectures\nSoftware-deﬁned networking (SDN) [168] is an approach\
    \ to enable ﬂexible and efﬁ-\ncient network conﬁguration to enhance a network.\
    \ SDN can provide many advantages\nfor conﬁguring city networks to support different\
    \ applications. For example, SDN can\nimprove the QoS of city networks against\
    \ link failures [169] and meet smart city latency de-\nmands [170]. While some\
    \ efforts are investigating this approach for supporting SCAs, there\nis room\
    \ for developing more advanced management and networking mechanisms in SDN\nfor\
    \ efﬁcient, reliable, and secure network conﬁgurations in smart cities. Jazaeri\
    \ et al. [171]\nconsidered the advantages of integrating edge computing, SDN,\
    \ and IoT technologies and\nreviewed different frameworks and platforms.\nLiu\
    \ et al. [172] proposed an architecture that decouples urban sensing applications\n\
    from the physical infrastructure. In their architecture, centralized controllers\
    \ manage\nphysical devices and offer APIs for data acquisition, transmission,\
    \ and processing services\nto develop urban sensing applications. Bi et al. [173]\
    \ proposed a scalable SDN-enabled\narchitecture that integrates a variety of smart\
    \ city components and provides reliable and\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n36 of\
    \ 63\ntimely scheduling for big data transfer to support smart city services.\
    \ They also studied\nthe time-constrained big data transfer scheduling (TBTS)\
    \ problem under this architecture\nand proposed a heuristic with an intelligent\
    \ scheme that can maximize the throughput and\nschedule the multi-ﬂow transfer\
    \ dynamically.\nIoT systems collect and process data vulnerable to availability,\
    \ integrity, and privacy\nthreats. Nguyen et al. [174] proposed a collaborative\
    \ and intelligent-network-based in-\ntrusion detection system (NIDS) architecture,\
    \ namely, SeArch, for SDN-based cloud IoT\nnetworks. SeArch is a security architecture\
    \ in which an arrangement of three layers of IDS\nnodes, i.e., Edge-IDS, Fog-IDS,\
    \ and Cloud-IDS, is introduced with an effective collaboration\namong nodes.\n\
    Blockchain is an innovative solution for increasing data integrity and privacy\
    \ in smart\ncities [175]. Sharma and Park [176] proposed a novel hybrid network\
    \ architecture for the\nsmart city by exploiting the strength of emerging SDN\
    \ and Blockchain technologies. To\nachieve efﬁciency and address the current limitations,\
    \ their architecture is divided into\ncore and edge networks. By designing a hybrid\
    \ architecture, their architecture inherits\nthe strength of centralized and distributed\
    \ network architectures. “PrivySharing” [177]\nis a Blockchain-based innovative\
    \ framework for privacy-preserving and secure IoT data\nsharing in a smart city\
    \ environment. This framework protects data privacy by segmenting\nthe blockchain\
    \ network into different channels, consisting of a limited number of approved\n\
    businesses and handling a certain category of data, such as health, smart auto,\
    \ smart\nenergy, or ﬁnancial information. Additionally, smart contracts contain\
    \ access control rules\nthat regulate who has access to the users’ data within\
    \ a channel. In addition, private\ndata gathering and encryption are used to further\
    \ isolate and safeguard the data within\na channel.\nIslam et al. [178] designed\
    \ a decentralized and distributed architecture for the IoT\necosystem that addresses\
    \ the existing challenges through the use of the technologies\nBlockchain, SDN,\
    \ and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). This energy-aware architec-\nture\
    \ confronts the problems of scalability, ﬂexibility, complexity, monitoring, managing,\n\
    and collecting IoT data and defends against cyber threats.\n5.3. Architectures\
    \ for Smart Grid\nThe automated and intelligent management of the next-generation\
    \ electric power\nsystems determines their effectiveness and efﬁciency. Smart\
    \ Grid (SG) is the name given to\nthe next generation of electricity systems,\
    \ which are anticipated to offer various beneﬁts\nover the current systems in\
    \ terms of digitization, ﬂexibility, intelligence, resilience, sustain-\nability,\
    \ and customization [179]. Smart transmission infrastructures use new technologies\n\
    to improve power quality. Smart control centers monitor and communicate with electric\n\
    devices remotely in real time, while smart substations self-consciously coordinate\
    \ their local\ndevices. The dispatch of electricity to end-users is implemented\
    \ by using the electrical and\ncommunication infrastructures that connect the\
    \ transmission and customer domains. The\ndistribution domain includes distribution\
    \ feeders and transformers to supply electricity.\nIt interacts with much different\
    \ equipment, such as distributed energy resources (DERs),\nplug-in electric vehicles\
    \ (PEVs), automatic metering infrastructure (AMI), and sensors with\ncommunication\
    \ capability. The distribution domain is responsible for delivering electricity\n\
    to energy consumers, user demands, and energy availability. To provide quality\
    \ electricity,\nthe stability of this domain is monitored and controlled.\nTypical\
    \ applications [44] of the smart grid communications network are automatic\nmeter\
    \ reading, demand response, PEVs, substation automation, and DERs/microgrid.\n\
    DERs are tiny energy production and/or storage devices linked to the distribution\
    \ system.\nDistributed generation (DG), distributed storage (DS), or a combination\
    \ of renewable\nand non-renewable sources are all possible sources for DER. Solar\
    \ panels, wind turbines,\ncombustion turbines, fuel cells, battery storage systems,\
    \ etc., are a few examples of DER.\nAn electric power system with one or more\
    \ DER units and loads is referred to as a microgrid.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n\
    37 of 63\nThe communication infrastructure in the smart grid supports the capabilities\
    \ of the\nsmart grid and complies with performance standards. This infrastructure\
    \ connects a huge\nnumber of electric devices and manages complex device communications.\
    \ As a result, it is\nbuilt in a hierarchical architecture with interconnected\
    \ individual sub-networks, and each\nsub-network is responsible for separate geographical\
    \ regions. The extremely dispersed\nsmaller area networks that support the power\
    \ systems at various locations are connected by\nWANs, which act as the communication’s\
    \ backbone. When the control centers are located a\ngreat distance from the substations\
    \ or the end-users, the real-time measurements made at\nthe electric devices are\
    \ transported to the control centers through the WANs, and in the\nopposite direction,\
    \ the WANs carry out the instruction communications from the control\ncenters\
    \ to the electric devices.\nThe authors of [43] present a communication architecture\
    \ in an SG. This architecture\nincludes (1) an energy smart house with electric\
    \ appliances connected to the smart grid,\n(2) a residential complex with AMI,\
    \ (3) a residential subdivision installed with solar panels,\n(4) a PEV charging\
    \ station, (5) a power substation, and (6) power transmission lines. In this\n\
    architecture, the Internet and ISPs serve as the backbone in connecting the distributed\
    \ sub-\nnetworks. Demertzis et al. [180] presented and categorized the communication\
    \ network\nstandards that have been established for smart grids and should be\
    \ considered in planning\nand implementing new infrastructures. Such standards\
    \ are IEC 61850 for substation\nautomation. This standard is based on open architecture\
    \ and incorporates sampling\nand timing synchronization speciﬁcations based on\
    \ IEEE 1588 in LANs and WANs [181].\nNotably, IEEE 1588 is the standard for a\
    \ precision clock synchronization protocol for\nnetworked measurement and control\
    \ systems [182].\nDue to the widespread use of renewable energy resources (RERs)\
    \ throughout the\npower grid, it is anticipated that electric power distribution\
    \ networks in smart grids would\nundergo signiﬁcant changes to accommodate the\
    \ nature of non-radial power ﬂow. For the\nmost part, the low-voltage distribution\
    \ networks where RERs (such as solar cells) may be\nattached are not monitored\
    \ by the majority of the present supervisory control and data ac-\nquisition (SCADA)\
    \ systems for power grids. For the goal of active monitoring and control,\nAbdrabou\
    \ [183] presented a multi-hop wireless network with a cellular frequency-reuse\n\
    structure that may supply the communication infrastructure to dense low-voltage\
    \ distribu-\ntion networks. A position-based QoS-aware routing protocol was also\
    \ presented as a useful\nmethod for prioritizing data transfer across the newly\
    \ introduced network architecture.\nHetGrid [184] is a unique overlay network\
    \ design with a speciﬁc QoS routing method\nfor power distribution grid applications.\
    \ It delivers QoS assurances across the network\nwhile taking into account three\
    \ factors: bandwidth, latency, and dependability. The authors\ncreated two components\
    \ to accomplish this:\n•\nA multipath routing mechanism that compensates critical\
    \ applications for their high-\nreliability requirements by using end-to-end physically\
    \ disjoint paths, and\n•\nAltruistic resource allocation with the QoS routing\
    \ mechanism that targets communi-\ncation with QoS guarantees for applications\
    \ with strict QoS requirements.\nThe ﬁndings in [184] show that the HetGrid overlay\
    \ network architecture enables ex-\ntremely effective, trustworthy, and QoS-aware\
    \ communication in heterogeneous networks.\nThe major characteristics that set\
    \ SG apart from the standard electrical power grid are\nthe ability to execute\
    \ two-way communication, demand-side management, and real-time\npricing. The present\
    \ SG systems have interoperability problems because they need to\nbe protocol\
    \ independent. Therefore, global communication network management and\nmonitoring\
    \ approaches have been proposed using SDN [185]. Thanks to SDN, network\nadministrators\
    \ may more efﬁciently manage their networks by separating the control plane\n\
    from the data plane. SDN has advanced in SG due to its reliance on communication\n\
    networks. SDN implementation in SG systems has the potential to increase efﬁciency\n\
    and resilience. SDN can assist the SG in integrating several SG standards and\
    \ protocols\nby virtue of its programmability, protocol independence, and granularity\
    \ capabilities to\ncope with varied communication systems. Rehmani et al. [185]\
    \ presented SDN-based\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n38 of 63\nSGC architectures,\
    \ along with case studies. They discussed routing schemes for SDN-\nbased SGC\
    \ and provided a detailed survey of security and privacy schemes applied to\n\
    SDN-based SGC.\nAlam et al. [186] provided a detailed survey on smart grid communication\
    \ networks in\nterms of communication network requirements, architecture, technologies,\
    \ and applications.\nThey proposed a Cognitive Radio (CR)-based Communication\
    \ Network for Smart Grid.\nCR is a software-deﬁned radio (SDR) platform that can\
    \ quickly reconﬁgure its operating\nparameters, such as modulation/demodulation,\
    \ compression algorithm, and error coding\ntechniques, according to changing circumstances\
    \ and requirements, through cognition. In\nsuch an SDR platform, radio transceivers\
    \ can switch functions and operations on demand\nonly. Molokomme et al. [187]\
    \ reviewed architectures that aim to accomplish the various\nand strict QoS requirements\
    \ in SG communication systems.\nWireless communication networks have been motivated\
    \ to harvest energy from\nambient environments and run energy-efﬁciently for economic\
    \ and ecological beneﬁts\nthrough improvements in the smart power grid and the\
    \ advocacy of “green communica-\ntions”. Hu et al. [188] examined recent developments\
    \ in energy harvesting, redistribution,\ntrade, and planning for future wireless\
    \ networks integrating with smart grids. The authors\nconsidered the optimization\
    \ of various energy-harvesting wireless systems as well as tradi-\ntional models\
    \ of renewable energy-harvesting technologies. Moreover, they discussed how\n\
    to distribute redundant (unused) energy generated by cellular networks, plan for\
    \ energy\nunder dynamic pricing when smart grids are in place, and engage in two-way\
    \ energy\ntrading using smart grids.\nFrom a different viewpoint, including IoT\
    \ devices and providing connectivity, au-\ntomation, and monitoring for such devices\
    \ enables SG systems to sustain multiple network\noperations during the generation,\
    \ distribution, transmission, and expenditure of energy.\nNumerous IoT-aided SG\
    \ systems have been proposed in the literature. The survey [189] on\nIoT-aided\
    \ SG systems considers the systems’ current architectures, uses, and prototypes.\n\
    5.4. Architectures for Smart Buildings\nThere are various building applications\
    \ such as heating, cooling, load control, air\nquality, ventilation, lighting,\
    \ water management, and cooking gas management. A smart\nbuilding incorporates\
    \ the major building systems on a common network and functionality\nto provide\
    \ operational efﬁciency, ﬁre safety, and security. A smart building architecture\n\
    (SBA) manages several real-time domains, including automated temperature regulation,\n\
    air cleaning, HVAC systems, and humidity control (i.e., indoor environment regulation\n\
    and monitoring); smart lighting and controlling home appliances (energy management);\
    \ a\nsmart ﬁre detection system; and other building operations. A typical smart\
    \ building [190]\nhas security cameras, lighting sensors, an indoor air quality\
    \ system, a ﬁre alarm system, a\nwater management system, and an energy management\
    \ system. Moreover, it can detect\nintrusion and supports HVAC services.\nDiverse\
    \ SBAs include complex operational systems, sensing, and communication\ntechnologies.\
    \ Such architectures have converged into an IP-based architecture. This con-\n\
    vergence is occurring rapidly with the increased usage of IP-based smart devices\
    \ driven\nthrough IoT concerning conventional building management and smart buildings.\
    \ Tradi-\ntionally, numerous building systems utilized varied forms of networking\
    \ protocols and\ncabling systems. This variety makes the whole system more complex\
    \ and highly infeasible\nfrom both a deployment and a system administration standpoint\
    \ [191]. SBAs entail making\nplans for and assisting with the inclusion of operational\
    \ technologies that improve the\napplication’s, service’s, or provision’s operational\
    \ steps while also boosting the well-being\nof its users. Researchers, policymakers,\
    \ and implementers should pay attention to several\ncrucial issues, such as reliable\
    \ communication/connection procedures, power-efﬁcient\nmeasures, competent security\
    \ measures, efﬁcient sensors and actuators, and data analyt-\nics procedures.\
    \ Amalgamating new systems and technologies with conventional (base)\ntechnologies\
    \ to accomplish the revelation of SBAs, includes, but is not limited to, WSN\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n39 of 63\ndeployment; advanced power-aware trafﬁc\
    \ engineering policies; cloud, edge, and fog com-\nputing paradigms; big data\
    \ engineering and analytics; and human–computer interaction\nprocedures [192].\
    \ The rapid development of ICT technologies has enhanced the connect-\nedness\
    \ of intelligent sensing, actuators, and communication devices to real-time physical\n\
    entities. Recently, smart sensing mechanisms, actuators, and data harvesting technology\n\
    have boosted the area of SBAs proposals. However, choosing the best ICT technologies\
    \ for\na particular smart building domain poses signiﬁcant difﬁculties, including\
    \ heterogeneity\nof IoT devices and applications, workable networking protocols\
    \ and architectures, power\nefﬁciency, and QoS/QoE provisioning [190,193]. One\
    \ solution is the SDN paradigm, which\nmanages the network more efﬁciently than\
    \ a customary one. SDN also assists network\nservices, including storage, routing,\
    \ dynamic bandwidth management, and QoS. Hence,\nthese simpliﬁcations offer a\
    \ creative environment through the implementation of proper\nsoftware tools for\
    \ smart buildings. Network architecture and its implementation for in-\ntelligent\
    \ infrastructure is based on IoT relationships (between IoT in home automation\n\
    and applications) and can be established using smart home Cloud Computing based\
    \ on\nSDN. Recently, Younus et al. [190] proposed an SDN architecture that improves\
    \ critical SB\nparameters such as bandwidth efﬁciency, energy efﬁciency, latency,\
    \ security, and reliability.\nSilva et al. [194] presented a Web of Things (WoT)\
    \ SBA that is integrated with the repre-\nsentational state transfer (RESTful)\
    \ application programming interface (API). The RESTful\nAPI employs HTTP requests\
    \ (e.g., GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE) to access and use WoT\ndata. Regarding network\
    \ performance and smart building power management, the authors\nshowed how their\
    \ recommendation for smart city architecture improved performance.\nSmart sensing\
    \ devices and actuators permit collecting, monitoring, controlling, or\nmodifying\
    \ vital building parameters so that users receive the best QoS/QoE possible. These\n\
    functionalities depend on sensor integration competence and their properties.\
    \ These sys-\ntems comprise signal conditioning circuits, implanted algorithms,\
    \ power, and transceiver\nmodules [195]. Researchers developed such system-based\
    \ SBAs for assessing and regulat-\ning air quality, smart lighting systems, ﬁre\
    \ detection systems, power management, and\nother basic building operations.\n\
    An indoor-air-quality-based SBA considers sensing and actuator-based systems for\n\
    monitoring and regulating air quality parameters. An indoor environmental observing\n\
    system was initially suggested in [196] that observes polluting gases, temperature,\
    \ and\nrelative humidity. Other kinds of such systems have been proposed in [197,198].\
    \ Con-\nsidering smart indoor lighting systems, numerous solutions have been proposed\
    \ in the\nliterature. In SBAs, light sensors manage and track the lighting system\
    \ to satisfy the users’\nneeds. The authors of [199] shed light on power consumption\
    \ reduction via energy-efﬁcient\nsmart lighting systems. Today’s smart building\
    \ employs low-power usage LED-based\nlight sources that last longer than Compact\
    \ Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) [200]. In reality, the\ndevelopment of control technologies,\
    \ heterogeneous networks, and embedded systems\nhas made it promising to create\
    \ smart innovative lighting systems that can effectively\naddress the problem\
    \ of energy conservation. Researchers have recently begun testing by\nintegrating\
    \ different power-saving techniques in a single illumination system for improved\n\
    energy efﬁciency while enhancing lighting performance without sacriﬁcing user\
    \ satisfac-\ntion. According to the authors of [201], using several cheap detectors,\
    \ as opposed to a\nsingle expensive sensor, would result in improved performance\
    \ and higher power savings.\nConsidering the same motivation, various authors\
    \ [202–204] have suggested similar types\nof smart lighting systems for several\
    \ room types, such as classrooms and ofﬁces. In [205],\nthe authors provide a\
    \ deep and profound study concerning smart lighting systems focusing\non power\
    \ savings procedures and connectivity alternatives as well as the integration\
    \ of\nvisible light communication technology [206].\nRecently, researchers focused\
    \ on two main goals, namely, occupants’ work perfor-\nmance and thermal comfort,\
    \ to propose effective SBAs. Hence, many Occupant-Oriented\nTechnologies (OOT)\
    \ have been put forth by academics who want to maximize thermal\ncomfort while\
    \ conserving energy. OOT-based systems offer a practical way to lessen the\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n40 of 63\ndrawbacks of the automatic control used today. In\
    \ practice, thermal comfort analysis is\nbased on parallel objective and subjective\
    \ evaluation. The objective evaluation comprises\nmonitoring, assessing, and recording\
    \ the status of environmental parameters through dedi-\ncated sensors and instruments\
    \ following standardized guidelines. Subjective evaluation\ninvolves monitoring,\
    \ assessing, and recording thermal preference, thermal sensation, and\nthermal\
    \ environment acceptance. Further thermal comfort sensor results as the cumulative\n\
    method to both above-mentioned analysis can be found in [193].\nGreen building\
    \ refers to SBAs with an ambient intelligence system that adjusts to\npredetermined\
    \ circumstances in real-world situations. In this situation, the system makes\n\
    full use of embedded sensors in an environment that can gather data and subsequently\n\
    allow the system to act in accordance with that data. The ambient intelligence\
    \ concept aims\nto conserve natural resources with limited and efﬁcient use of\
    \ them to offer comfort to the\noccupants. Through unconventional energy sources,\
    \ it also meets some of the conventional\nenergy requirements [207]. Many aspects\
    \ of SBAs, such as security, monitoring, and\npower efﬁciency, are the subject\
    \ of extensive study. However, one of the most important\nfunctions of an SB system\
    \ is to control the interior climate, which is typically done by\nHVAC systems\
    \ [208]. The performance of HVAC systems in the instance of commercial\nbuildings\
    \ for frequency regulations has been demonstrated by the authors of [209] for\
    \ this\ncontext. Their demonstrated numerical experiments suggest that 15% of\
    \ rated fan energy\ncan be employed for regulation use while having a minor effect\
    \ on a building’s indoor\ntemperature. The method of computational control for\
    \ passive and active sources was\nused in another scheme [210]. The authors emphasized\
    \ the problem that the ambient and\nactive sources of lighting, heating, ventilation,\
    \ cooling, and shading are not synchronized\nin buildings. Such a computational\
    \ control scheme is also suitable for reducing daily power\nusage. Similarly,\
    \ numerous methods [211–213] considering HVAC systems have been\nproposed with\
    \ respect to frequency regulation, predictive control, and smart controller.\n\
    An IoT-assisted HVAC smart system tracks environmental situations. It also notiﬁes\n\
    when measurements exceed thresholds and provides data on energy usage and consump-\n\
    tion. In addition, it can autonomously turn equipment intermittently at programmed\n\
    times. As individuals spend more time indoors (at home, work, or in other enclosed\
    \ spaces)\nthan outdoors, the air quality inside buildings should be improved\
    \ along with that of the\nexternal surroundings. This is the task of indoor Air\
    \ Quality Monitoring Systems (AQMS).\nThe basic parts of an AQMS (Figure 5) are\
    \ a sensor array, a processing/display unit, a signal\nconditioning circuit, a\
    \ small amount of external memory, and a communication module\nthat is typically\
    \ wireless. A sensor array is a group of specialized micro-sensors that can\n\
    detect certain airborne concentrations of gases such as NOX, SOX, CO2, CO, and\
    \ O3, as\nwell as some essential environmental parameters such as humidity and\
    \ temperature. These\nsensors are connected to a GUI unit that shows the values\
    \ of the real-time indoor air quality\nparameters and an external memory used\
    \ to store real-time data [214]. When deploying\nsuch systems, various communication\
    \ (wireless) modules, including WiFi, ZigBee, and\nLoRAWAN technologies, are considered.\n\

    \ CO2, CO, particles \n(Particulate Matter PM10 and PM2.5), and some other crucial\
    \ parameters such as hu-\nmidity and temperature. By using gas sensor boards and\
    \ wasp motes, the authors created \na method for collecting and monitoring the\
    \ indoor atmosphere. For monitoring CO2 and \nCO parameters, they also used TGS\
    \ 4161 and TGS 2442 gas sensors. These sensors usually \nwork using the resistive\
    \ heating principle. The TGS 2442 sensor has excellent sensitivity \nto fluctuations\
    \ in CO gas concentration. This sensor’s internal resistance, or “IR”, is in-\n\
    versely proportionate to the amount of CO present. As the CO content rises, the\
    \ IR falls. \nWhile TGS 4161 also offers low power consumption and suggests better\
    \ performance in \ndetecting changes in CO2 gas concentration, the TGS4161 is\
    \ ideally suited for indoor air \ncontrol applications as it can measure 350–10,000\
    \ ppm carbon dioxide. The authors used \nthe DustTrak DRX, a specialized aerosol\
    \ laser photometer that simultaneously measures \nmass and size fraction, for\
    \ PM1 and PM2.5 monitoring purposes. To define and create an \ninterface to the\
    \ deployed sensor for wireless transmission of gathered aerosol data, this \n\
    photometer is connected to a base station device via LAN. The authors also set\
    \ up ZB \n(ENs) at each location that was taken into consideration, which sent\
    \ updates on the air \nquality and aerosols at regular periods to BS (ZBC) that\

    \ parameters, including CO2, CO, particles\n(Particulate Matter PM10 and PM2.5),\
    \ and some other crucial parameters such as humidity\nand temperature. By using\
    \ gas sensor boards and wasp motes, the authors created a\nmethod for collecting\
    \ and monitoring the indoor atmosphere. For monitoring CO2 and\nCO parameters,\
    \ they also used TGS 4161 and TGS 2442 gas sensors. These sensors usually\nwork\
    \ using the resistive heating principle. The TGS 2442 sensor has excellent sensitivity\n\
    to ﬂuctuations in CO gas concentration. This sensor’s internal resistance, or\
    \ “IR”, is\ninversely proportionate to the amount of CO present. As the CO content\
    \ rises, the IR falls.\nWhile TGS 4161 also offers low power consumption and suggests\
    \ better performance in\ndetecting changes in CO2 gas concentration, the TGS4161\
    \ is ideally suited for indoor air\ncontrol applications as it can measure 350–10,000\
    \ ppm carbon dioxide. The authors used\nthe DustTrak DRX, a specialized aerosol\
    \ laser photometer that simultaneously measures\nmass and size fraction, for PM1\
    \ and PM2.5 monitoring purposes. To deﬁne and create an\ninterface to the deployed\
    \ sensor for wireless transmission of gathered aerosol data, this\nphotometer\
    \ is connected to a base station device via LAN. The authors also set up ZB (ENs)\n\
    at each location that was taken into consideration, which sent updates on the\
    \ air quality\nand aerosols at regular periods to BS (ZBC) that had already been\
    \ set up.\nThis system assesses the indoor air quality to assess the current state\
    \ of the indoor en-\nvironment while simultaneously providing real-time inputs\
    \ for HVAC system management.\nThe authors also designed a toolkit that analyzes\
    \ real-time air quality data and displays\nthem through meaningful representations\
    \ to service the SBAs. Likewise, Lozano et al. [216]\nproposed another IAQMS technique\
    \ that considers a star topological architecture [217].\nThe ZB (ENs) in this\
    \ technique is based on the XBee and XBee pro-version modules. Never-\ntheless,\
    \ the suggested scheme [216] considers a single pollutant only, i.e., suggesting\

    \ IoT and BI stakeholders\nmust make a concerted effort to give modern BI access\
    \ to a generic IoT framework with\ncognitive intelligence and context-aware computing\
    \ capabilities.\n5.5. Smart Water and Pipeline Network Monitoring\nRetroﬁtting\
    \ the traditional water distribution system with smart devices has some\nbeneﬁts,\
    \ including lower utility costs, lower consumer bills, and less water loss [222,223].\n\
    For example, smart water sensors can keep an eye on the pressure online and alert\
    \ utilities\nto pressure changes or large pressure losses in the water network,\
    \ allowing them to remotely\nadjust the pressure to save energy consumption [224].\
    \ Automation can be used for both\noperational procedures and components that\
    \ provide functionality. For instance, when a\nwater problem occurs during operation\
    \ or with the element itself, the smart components\ninform the system center and\
    \ then take action to avert a crash. The water utility can also\ndetermine a sensor’s\
    \ requirement for maintenance or replacement thanks to the automatic\nself-veriﬁcation\
    \ mechanism [225].\nIn [226], the authors suggest an IoT-based smart water grid\
    \ architecture that includes\ntechnical systems, functions, and a hierarchy framework.\
    \ Moreover, this smart water\nsystem (SWS) also comprises smart sensing mechanisms,\
    \ simulation procedures, diag-\nnostic techniques, disposal, warning, and control\
    \ mechanisms. Although an SWS incor-\nporates ofﬂine performance, real-time performance\
    \ is deﬁned by online procedures such\nas online data monitoring, online data\
    \ assimilation, online modeling, online charting,\nand online results output.\
    \ An SWS must have real-time functionality to implement the\nnecessary smart features\
    \ [227]. Researchers put a lot of effort [228] into developing wa-\nter systems\
    \ that operate intelligently. Real-time modeling, real-time sampling, real-time\n\
    controlling, etc., which seek to reduce the lag between system input and system\
    \ output,\nshould be added to the smart performance of SWS. It was discovered\
    \ that using SCADA\nwould considerably increase the data transfer efﬁciency [229].\
    \ A smart water architec-\nture [230] often includes ﬁve layers: (1) the physical\
    \ layer; (2) the sensing and control layer;\n(3) the communication layer; (4)\
    \ the data management layer; and (5) the data fusion layer.\nWithin the framework\
    \ of the GST4Water project, the authors of [230] presented a system\nthat allows\
    \ for receiving consumption data sent by a generic smart meter installed in a\n\
    user’s house and transferring them to a cloud platform. The consumption data are\
    \ saved\nand processed to characterize leakage at the district meter area and\
    \ the individual user level.\nMeanwhile, the processed data are returned to the\
    \ Water Utility and can be used for billing.\nOn the other hand, they provide\
    \ regular feedback to the user, thus gaining full awareness\nof their consumption\
    \ behavior. Panagiotakopoulos et al. [231] presented an IoT framework\nbased on\
    \ FIWARE that aims to realize a highly ﬂexible standards-based open-source soft-\n\
    ware solution for developing SWSs. They designed an architecture consisting of\
    \ various\nFIWARE software components and two dashboard applications. Amaxilatis\
    \ et al. [232]\nconsidered numerous intelligent infrastructure solutions regarding\
    \ conventional water\nmetering systems, which effectively facilitate uninterrupted\
    \ bi-directional (whenever re-\nquired) data exchange between water ﬂow devices,\
    \ metering equipment, and end-users.\nThe authors’ ultimate objective is to design,\
    \ implement, and deploy more sophisticated\ninfrastructure offering improved performance\
    \ in bigger smart city infrastructure. To limit\nthe amount of data that needs\
    \ to be shared between the various system layers, their ap-\nproach makes use\
    \ of the FogC paradigm to develop the infrastructure for the smart water\ngrid\
    \ model.\nThe Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Solutions for the\
    \ Efﬁcient\nWater Resources Management project was funded by the European Commission\
    \ under the\nauspices of the Seventh Framework Program (FP7). The goal of the\
    \ Smart Water project is\nto examine the role of ICT in monitoring and effectively\
    \ managing urban water systems,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n44 of 63\nwith a\
    \ focus on the deployment of sensors, communication technologies, and related\n\
    decision support systems in utility providers’ water networks to address issues\
    \ such as\nleakage management, demand management, asset management, and so forth.\
    \ Kulkarni\nand Farnham [233] focused on the issues surrounding wireless connectivity,\
    \ proposed\na framework for assessing potential solutions based on the total cost\
    \ of ownership, and\nhighlighted lessons learned from two European utilities’\
    \ Smart Water case studies.\nPipelines are used to transport water, gases, and\
    \ oil. Since they are frequently under-\nground, the humid atmosphere easily erodes\
    \ them, which may result in leaks. In addition,\nwater in the pipelines may get\
    \ contaminated by infectious agents or substances that are\nmistakenly or purposely\
    \ introduced into the system. As a result, maintaining pipeline\nnetworks is crucial\
    \ for maintaining public health and protecting the environment. The sen-\nsor\
    \ node deployment profoundly impacts the sensing performance indicators for pipeline\n\
    network monitoring, including coverage area, coverage population, and detection\
    \ time.\nThe sensor nodes should typically be positioned near the pipeline network’s\
    \ junctions [234].\nGiven the design of the pipeline network, the optimal sensor\
    \ node deployment challenges\nare therefore formulated as integer optimization\
    \ problems, where the integer variables\nrepresent the maximum amount of sensor\
    \ nodes that must be placed at each junction. The\ndeployment difﬁculties for\
    \ pipeline network monitoring are typically challenging to solve\nbecause of the\
    \ integer decision variables.\nPipeline network ﬂows are not predictable. As a\
    \ result, depending on the ﬂow pattern,\nthe sensing performance of a deployed\
    \ sensor node may vary. As a result, the ﬂow pattern\nis taken into account in\
    \ [235], which formulates a mix-integer optimization problem to\ndecide how to\
    \ deploy sensor nodes to reduce the projected population at risk of malicious\n\
    contamination. The authors solved the ensuing mix-integer optimization using a\
    \ branch\nand bound technique. Even though a strategy such as this can identify\
    \ the ideal answer,\nthe time complexity is typically signiﬁcant. This means that\
    \ large pipeline networks cannot\nbe used with the method. Similarly, the study\
    \ in [236] considers the various demand\npatterns of water ﬂows through pipes.\
    \ The authors used a genetic-based method to ﬁnd the\nbest deployment locations\
    \ to increase coverage under various monitoring station demand\npatterns. The\
    \ global optimum of these heuristic algorithms could take a while to reach.\n\
    The performance of the algorithms may also be impacted by their parameter choices.\n\
    Consequently, we do not advise using it for massive pipeline networks.\nSingapore’s\
    \ WaterWise@SG program aims to identify pipeline leaks and anticipate\nburst incidents\
    \ [237,238]. PipeNet has also been put to the test in Boston to ﬁnd pipeline\n\
    leaks, where three tiers of nodes are employed to quantify pH levels and pressure.\
    \ To\nreduce water waste, a system named IWCMSE [239] has been designed to track\
    \ water\nconsumption for businesses. A Steamﬂood and Waterﬂood Tracking System\
    \ [240] has been\ncreated to ﬁnd irregularities in pipeline systems, such as leaks\
    \ and bottlenecks. With the\naid of all these technologies, the investigators\
    \ had the opportunity to evaluate the efﬁciency\nof the monitoring algorithms.\
    \ However, these technologies rely on ﬁxed sensors, and we\nstill need to put\
    \ innovative testbed models and systems built around crowd sensing and\nmobile\
    \ WSN into place.\n5.6. Architectures for Smart Transportation\nThe Internet-of-Vehicles\
    \ (IoV, also known as V2X) aims to reduce trafﬁc congestion\nand accidents. It\
    \ also enables information exchange involving the vehicle and all entities\nthat\
    \ may have an impact on it. Vehicle networking and vehicle intelligence are the\
    \ two\ntechnologies that underpin IoV implementation. The three components that\
    \ compose\nvehicle networking are the onboard information service, VANET, and\
    \ mobile network.\nVANET stands for vehicle-to-vehicle short-range communication.\
    \ Providing remote loca-\ntion, remote diagnostics, navigation, and other information\
    \ services is referred to as an\nonboard information service. Every car can be\
    \ utilized as a potent mobile terminal thanks\nto mobile networks. Vehicle intelligence\
    \ is the use of cutting-edge technologies, including\nartiﬁcial intelligence (AI),\
    \ big data analytics, deep learning (DL), and cognitive computing\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n45 of 63\n(CogC), to facilitate information sharing among people\
    \ and vehicles, as well as between\nvehicles and the environment, infrastructure,\
    \ or other vehicles.\nVehicular networks consist of data-gathering sensors and\
    \ inter-vehicle communica-\ntion systems. Such networks require an open and ﬂexible\
    \ layered architecture to handle\ncharacteristics such as interoperability, scalability,\
    \ dependability, and modularity. Recently,\nthe research community proposed efﬁcient\
    \ vehicle network architectures. For example,\nthe Universal IoV (UIoV) architecture\
    \ [241] includes seven layers. Offering services and\nchoosing messaging protocols\
    \ are tasks that fall within the application layer. Data prepro-\ncessing, big\
    \ data processing, and intelligent transmission are all tasks that the multimedia\n\
    and big data layer is in charge of. For IoV systems, the cloud service layer’s\
    \ ClCom and\ncloud virtualization technologies offer hardware computing platforms,\
    \ infrastructure, and\nsoftware services. In the UIoV architecture, the communication\
    \ layer and the intra–inter\ndevices layer are merged to accomplish the connectivity\
    \ of many heterogeneous objects\nand networks. Notably, there is no intra–inter\
    \ devices layer in classical architecture. The\nUIoV system’s physical objects\
    \ layer gathers and transmits all the data to the intra–inter\ndevices layer for\
    \ additional processing. In the IoV, both vehicles and non-vehicle items are\n\
    identiﬁed using the Identiﬁcation Layer.\nLiu et al. [242] suggested another IoV\
    \ network architecture to increase the ﬂexibility of\napplication management while\
    \ enhancing the scalability and dependability of information\nservices. This architecture\
    \ has four layers in total, the data layer of which has a variety\nof nodes with\
    \ various wireless communication interfaces. Because the topology of IoV\nis frequently\
    \ changed, an immense quantity of data are frequently produced and trans-\nmitted\
    \ at the data layer. To safeguard the accurate semantics of the underlying resources,\n\
    the virtualization layer splits a few nodes into fog nodes and the network, computation,\n\
    communication, and storage resources in IoV. To execute applications such as road\
    \ safety\nmanagement and data sensing, the control layer’s SDN controller is responsible\
    \ for schedul-\ning the abstraction resources of the virtualization layer and\
    \ interacting with the application\nlayer. A difﬁcult topic in network architecture\
    \ design is dealing with diverse networks.\nInteroperability, scalability, dependability,\
    \ and adaptability are some of its network features.\nThe design seeks to increase\
    \ layer separation and network architecture’s total number of\nlayers. In addition\
    \ to being a service-oriented design, the IoV architecture should facilitate\n\
    the connectivity of cars with heterogeneous networks and other communication devices.\n\
    By introducing the CogC paradigm into autonomous driving systems, the learning\
    \ ability\nof autonomous vehicles can be effectively improved. Utilizing both\
    \ physical and network\ndata space, the Cognitive Internet of Vehicles (CIoV)\
    \ paradigm [243] improves network\nsecurity and transportation safety. CIoV enables\
    \ IoV to bear more accurate perceptive\nability through cognition in the intra-vehicle\
    \ network (driver, passengers, smart devices,\netc.), inter-vehicle network (adjacent\
    \ intelligent vehicles), and beyond-vehicle network\n(road environment, cellular\
    \ network, edge nodes, remote cloud, etc.). The CIoV architecture\nincludes a\
    \ cognitive data engine that can conduct cognition of user tasks by the use of\n\
    data collected, e.g., driving behavior model analysis, emotion analysis, and road\
    \ condition\ninvestigation. Five layers are present in the network architecture\
    \ of CIoV. The gathering\nand preprocessing of big data from several sources are\
    \ done by the sensing layer. As\nopposed to the previous communication layer (of\
    \ other architectures), the architecture’s\ncommunication layer uses a cloud/edge\
    \ hybrid structure to accommodate various applica-\ntion schedules. The data cognition\
    \ engine at the cognition layer processes and interprets\nheterogeneous data streams\
    \ (machine learning (ML), DL, data mining, etc.) using a variety\nof cognitive\
    \ analysis approaches. The control layer’s resource awareness engine is in\ncharge\
    \ of allocating and scheduling network resources with the aid of technologies\
    \ such\nas NFV, SDN, network slicing, and self-organized networking (SON). There\
    \ are primar-\nily two categories in the application layer (i.e., usual application\
    \ services and intelligent\ntransportation applications).\nEfﬁcient message authentication\
    \ and integrity are required to guarantee vehicle pri-\nvacy and safeguard vehicular\
    \ communications. To protect V2V and V2I communications\nElectronics 2023, 12,\
    \ 2490\n46 of 63\nin the context of the VANET against a broad range of cyber threats,\
    \ Karim [244] provided\na cryptography-based routing solution. This solution includes\
    \ a data encryption and de-\ncryption mechanism based on attributes and identity\
    \ that has the lowest computational\noverhead while keeping the optimum level\
    \ of security. Contreras-Castillo et al. [245]\nsuggested a seven-layer network\
    \ architecture. The user interface layer, which controls infor-\nmation exchange\
    \ between the user and the vehicle, is the top layer. Utilizing roadside units\n\
    (RSUs) and onboard sensors, the data collecting layer gathers data. The pre-processing\n\
    and ﬁltering layer eliminates the unnecessary information from the gathered data\
    \ before\nsending the remaining information to the communication layer for transmission.\
    \ Making\nchoices and managing network service providers are the responsibilities\
    \ of control and\nmanagement. Large volumes of data must be processed by the processing\
    \ layer to create\nthe pertinent data needed for various applications. To stop\
    \ assaults, the security layer\ndirectly manages each of the layers above. A unique\
    \ network architecture with enhanced\nthroughput, reduced latency, higher security,\
    \ and widespread connectivity was recently\nproposed by Ji et al. [246]. This\
    \ architecture consists of four layers:\n1.\nSecurity authentication layer: The\
    \ RSUs on the road may monitor trafﬁc environment\ndata in real-time after setting\
    \ several sensors, surveillance footage, and radar. This\nlayer determines the\
    \ legality of the car and RSU that are requesting to join the network.\nPerhaps\
    \ an illegal vehicle or an RSU that has been installed unlawfully will attempt\n\
    to steal or alter the information of a real vehicle.\n2.\nData acquisition layer:\
    \ This layer collects and categorizes many types of data from\nvarious networks.\
    \ To ensure that the data can be sent to the edge layer securely, it\ndigitizes\
    \ the data.\n3.\nEdge layer: Edge devices produce several data streams. As a result,\
    \ processing and\nanalyzing data in one go using ClCom will result in signiﬁcant\
    \ delays. As a result, we\nmust process data more closely related to the data\
    \ source. The edge node, a physical\ndevice situated closest to the data source,\
    \ is used by the edge layer to carry out basic\nprocessing and analysis on the\
    \ acquired local data. It releases data analysis ﬁndings\nfor nearby trafﬁc incidents\
    \ and current road conditions in real-time, then creates a\nlocal decision-making\
    \ plan, carrying out various ClCom jobs and boosting the cloud\ndata center’s\
    \ computing power.\n4.\nCloud Platform Layer: The cloud data center analyses the\
    \ information it has collected\nabout global trafﬁc in this tier, develops a plan,\
    \ and rationally distributes trafﬁc\nresources. This layer, having the ability\
    \ to implement connection management, data\nmanagement, aided autonomous driving,\
    \ intelligent navigation, path planning, and\ninformation security, is the “smart\
    \ brain” of the IoV.\nA blockchain-based vehicle network architecture (Block-VN)\
    \ for the smart city was\npresented in [247]. Building innovative distributed\
    \ transport management systems is made\npossible by the robust and secure Block-VN\
    \ architecture. The authors considered how the\nnetwork of vehicles evolves with\
    \ paradigms focused on networking and vehicular informa-\ntion. To handle real-time\
    \ transportation data, Jan et al. [248] created a model for assessing\ntransportation\
    \ data using Spark and Hadoop. This model/system is separated into four\nlayers:\
    \ data collection and acquisition, network, data processing, and application.\
    \ Each\nlayer is built to process and manage data in a structured manner. On the\
    \ data processing\nlayer, Hadoop and Spark are used to test the data. By utilizing\
    \ the suggested event and\ndecision mechanism based on Named Data Networking [249],\
    \ the data are made available\nto a smart community member. The suggested approach\
    \ was examined using transporta-\ntion datasets from some reliable sources. The\
    \ outcomes demonstrate data processing and\nreal-time distribution to citizens\
    \ in the shortest amount of time. Spark with the Hadoop\nenvironment produces\
    \ ﬁndings that are quite accurate. From another viewpoint, Social\nIoV (SIoV)\
    \ are a breed of socially aware ephemeral networks [250], where vehicular nodes\n\
    share/exchange information with different entities and are thus forth comparable\
    \ with\ntraditional social networks. Kerrache et al. [251] proposed a trust-aware\
    \ communication\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n47 of 63\narchitecture for social\
    \ IoV (TACASHI), which offers a trust-aware social in-vehicle and\ninter-vehicle\
    \ communication architecture for SIoVs.\n5.7. Architectures for Smart Rural Areas/Smart\
    \ Villages\nThe smart village paradigm digitizes various aspects of rural activities\
    \ using IoT\ntechnologies. In the countryside, a variety of activities are carried\
    \ out, including smart\nagriculture, waste management, irrigation management,\
    \ livestock management, smart\nenergy, smart healthcare, and smart education.\
    \ A smart village or smart rural area can\nenable real-time data analytics and\
    \ automate decision-making for local villagers regard-\ning healthcare, agriculture,\
    \ environment, transportation, and energy. It differs from a\nsmart city as there\
    \ are key differences (e.g., low cost, infrastructure, and sustainability)\nbetween\
    \ urban and rural environments [252]. To realize the smart village goal, The Euro-\n\
    pean Commission (2017) [253] launched an action plan, in which it proposed to\
    \ interfere\nICTs in villages. Cambra-Fierro and Pérez [254] addressed the meaning\
    \ of “smart” in\nrural contexts as well as its link with sustainability. The European\
    \ Commission-funded\nSmart Rural 21 initiative [255], which has the ultimate goal\
    \ of encouraging and motivat-\ning communities to create and execute smart village\
    \ methods and tactics throughout\nEurope as a tool for rural development, serving\
    \ as the authors’ primary source. IEEE\nSmart Village [256] also supports the\
    \ world’s energy-impoverished communities by pro-\nviding a complete solution\
    \ combining renewable energy, community-based education, and\nentrepreneurial\
    \ opportunities.\nMalik et al. [257] discussed the implementation details of smart\
    \ villages with different\ntechnologies. They concluded that digitization is only\
    \ possible if a reliable and robust net-\nwork and communication infrastructure\
    \ are installed in the village environment. Shrestha\nand Drozdenko [258] proposed\
    \ a Smart Rural framework to mitigate the effects of climate\nchange using IoT\
    \ and the Cloud, building a prototype on the Louisiana Tech University\ncampus.\
    \ Their framework is an energy-efﬁcient monitoring system for observing the envi-\n\
    ronmental conditions that affect agricultural production and human health. It\
    \ consists of\nthe following subsystems: Wireless Sensor Nodes, Fog Server, Cloud\
    \ Services, and a Web\nDashboard. The dashboard converts raw sensor data into\
    \ meaningful information from\nwhich public ofﬁcials and residents can adapt to\
    \ or frustrate the effects of climate change.\nMonzon Baeza and Alvarez Marban\
    \ [259] proposed a ﬂexible and scalable Smart Rural\nsystem for gathering and\
    \ processing IoT data from remote rural areas with no traditional\ncommunication\
    \ coverage as a handicap. The authors offered an architecture structured in\n\
    separate segments using IoT, 5G, Cloud, and High-Altitude Platform Station (HAPS).\
    \ Their\nproposal is applied to the rural environment to thus cover all the needs\
    \ of the system in the\ncollection of IoT data from these remote rural areas,\
    \ its coverage by space vehicles, and its\nprocessing and storage through 5G terrestrial\
    \ networks and cloud services. Their proposal\nincludes the deployment of IoT\
    \ sensors and the development of Amazon Web Services.\nConversely, the part of\
    \ the space segment, considered by HAPS, has been simulated for\ndifferent space\
    \ channels. This method provides a complete and automated smart rural\nsystem\
    \ that allows access to these IoT data from remote rural areas through the Internet.\
    \ To\nprovide secure services close to end-devices, Aljuhani et al. [260] explored\
    \ the integration\nof a Distributed Fog Computing (DFC) network architecture with\
    \ IoT in improving security\nand privacy solutions for villagers and consumer\
    \ electronic (CE) devices. As a case study,\nthe authors designed and evaluated\
    \ the performance of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)\nin a DFC-based smart\
    \ village environment. Moreover, they discussed open security issues\nand challenges\
    \ regarding Fog-to-Things enabled smart villages. Rohan et al. [261] proposed\n\
    a collaborative edge-computing architecture considering the resource constraints\
    \ in a smart\nvillage. The authors illustrated the concept of collaborative edge\
    \ computing as applicable\nto reduce cost and better manage the existing infrastructural\
    \ facilities. Collaboration occurs\nbetween the multiple IoT edge devices (e.g.,\
    \ the edge data centers or edge routers) for data\nprocessing and storage. For\
    \ example, in times of high computational load demand, one\nvillage’s edge devices\
    \ can collaborate with another village’s edge devices.\nElectronics 2023, 12,\
    \ 2490\n48 of 63\n6. Summary\n•\nVarious SCAs have different network requirements\
    \ such as bandwidth, delay toler-\nance, power consumption, reliability, wireless\
    \ connectivity, mobility, security, and\nprivacy. Therefore, they need different\
    \ protocols at the OSI-RM layers. The network\narchitectures for IoT are heterogeneous\
    \ and include various network technologies such\nas WiFi, WSNs, Mesh Wireless\
    \ Networks (WMNs), Vehicular Networks, and Mobile\nCommunication Networks (MCNs)\
    \ (5G/LTE/4G/3G). The standards adopted in these\narchitectures must allow interoperability,\
    \ while cross-layer design-based recommen-\ndations for power consumption and\
    \ congestion control are well-suited proposals.\n•\nState-of-the-art generic network\
    \ architectures for smart cities adopt the SDN paradigm\nand are based on FogC\
    \ to reduce latency and increase the efficiency of provided services.\n•\nFog\
    \ and ClCom will be used in smart grid communication system architecture in the\n\
    future to fulﬁll QoS needs. Such architecture will additionally feature communication\n\
    methods that can lessen QoS issues like latency, security, and spectrum efﬁciency.\
    \ The\nCR technology will be an indispensable part of this architecture as this\
    \ technology can\nquickly reconﬁgure the operating parameters of the SG communication\
    \ system to the\nchanging requirements through cognition.\n•\nBy extracting usable\
    \ data from both the physical and network data space, it is possible\nto increase\
    \ network security and transportation safety in IoVs. Future IoV architectures\n\
    will become cognitive. These architectures will include cognitive data engines\
    \ that\nwill conduct cognition of user tasks by the use of data collected, e.g.,\
    \ driving behavior\nmodel analysis, emotion analysis, and road condition investigation.\n\
    •\nThe networking performance of SDN is better than the customary networking of\
    \ smart\nbuildings (SB). However, as Younus et al. [190] state, it also has been\
    \ facing some\nchallenges such as network management in terms of maintenance,\
    \ east–west interface,\nsouthbound interface, trafﬁc management, energy, ML-based\
    \ SDN networking for SB,\nand the network resources issue of SB SDN-based networking.\n\
    7. Open Research Issues\n−Network slicing management is required: IoT services\
    \ such as smart transportation and\nsmart energy have diversiﬁed requirements.\
    \ To accommodate diverse IoT services, the\nnetwork slicing paradigm is suggested\
    \ because it enables multiple independent logical\nnetworks running on the same\
    \ physical network infrastructure. Wu et al. [9] presented\nan architecture for\
    \ intelligent network slicing management for the Industrial IoT (IIoT)\nfocusing\
    \ on three IIoT services (smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory).\
    \ The\nauthors also provided a comprehensive survey on intelligent network slicing\
    \ management\nin this ﬁeld.\n−NFV Implementation in the SDN-IoT Environment: The\
    \ ETSI Industry Speciﬁcation\nGroup proposed NFV to virtualize the network functions\
    \ that were before performed\nby some proprietary dedicated. NFV allows for the\
    \ ﬂexible provisioning of software-\nbased network functionalities on top of an\
    \ appropriately shared physical infrastructure by\nseparating the network functions\
    \ from the underlying hardware appliances [262]. Utilizing\ninexpensive commodity\
    \ servers, it solves the issue of operating costs associated with\nadministering\
    \ and controlling this closed and proprietary equipment. When SDN is\nused in\
    \ conjunction with NFV (the software-deﬁned NFV architecture), it can overcome\n\
    the difﬁculties associated with intelligent service orchestration and dynamic\
    \ resource\nmanagement [263]. SDN can dynamically establish a virtual service\
    \ environment through\nNFV. As a result, the need for specialized hardware and\
    \ labor-intensive effort to fulﬁll\na new service request is avoided. In conjunction\
    \ with the use of SDN, NFV also allows\nreal-time and dynamic function provisioning\
    \ along with ﬂexible trafﬁc forwarding. The\nSDN-IoT network may be improved and\
    \ secured with NVF. It enables the software-based\ndeployment of network devices\
    \ as virtualized components. Throughput is increased\nbecause of NFV integration\
    \ in the SDN-IoT network, which enhances network performance.\nTo this end, Sinh\
    \ et al. [264] proposed a practical model for hosting IoT services and building\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n49 of 63\nSDN controller applications to show that\
    \ SDN/NFV can effectively apply to IoT services.\nRecently, Mukherjee et al. [265]\
    \ proposed an SDN-based distributed IoT network with NFV\nimplementation for smart\
    \ cities.\n−Cognitive IoT network architecture for smart cities: CR technology\
    \ can address the\nbandwidth needs of IoT applications [266]. IoT devices can\
    \ be enabled with cognitive\nfunctionalities, including spectrum sensing, dynamic\
    \ spectrum accessing, circumstantial\nperceiving, and self-learning. Many SCAs\
    \ and services can be based on CR technology\nbecause it can do dynamic sensing\
    \ and cognition of the surrounding environment. For\nexample, in smart grid applications,\
    \ cognitive IoT can achieve the objective of enabling\nusers to know their energy\
    \ consumption at any time and anywhere [267]. In smart home ap-\nplications, cognitive-radio-equipped\
    \ sensors can handle potential heterogeneous network\ninterference [268]. At the\
    \ same time, cognitive IoT can help with smoother real-time moni-\ntoring over\
    \ longer distances in the healthcare industry without worrying about spectrum\n\
    availability [269]. The complete utilization of cognitive radio technology in\
    \ IoT demands\nextensive research in spectrum optimization, standardization, hardware\
    \ design, privacy\nprotection, heterogeneous network fusion, scalability and ﬂexibility\
    \ problems, etc. [270].\nFor this reason, many CIoT-based smart city network architectures\
    \ must be proposed to\nsolve such problems. In this regard, Park et al. [271]\
    \ suggested a CIoT-based smart city\nnetwork architecture that outlines how data\
    \ collected from SCAs may be analyzed using\nthe CogC paradigm and manage the\
    \ scalability and ﬂexibility challenges.\n−Challenges in IoT communication through\
    \ TCP/IP suite: Unfortunately, many Access\nPoints (APs) can utilize identical\
    \ WiFi channels in overlapping regions, leading to interfer-\nence problems that\
    \ can signiﬁcantly impair TCP performance over WiFi [272]. Now, many\nAPs can\
    \ provide support for wireless access to numerous users in a WiFi network with\n\
    the DownLink multi-user MIMO (DL MU-MIMO) functionality. DL MU-MIMO is a PHY\n\
    layer technology (included with IEEE 802.11ac standard [273]) that increases the\
    \ capacity\nof WLANs by simultaneously broadcasting data streams to several stations.\
    \ As a result, it\nis possible to achieve greater data rates that are equal to\
    \ the number of antennas on APs.\nThus, several stations are served at once. Pokhrel\
    \ and Singh [131] stressed the employment\nof CR and Federated Learning (FL) methods\
    \ with many APs to improve the Compound\nTCP’s performance in wide-area Industry\
    \ 4.0 WiFi networks. An FL method can accelerate\nthe learning processes of the\
    \ transport protocols such as Compound TCP. In FL, training\ndata are dispersed\
    \ across a large number of clients, each having unreliable and compar-\natively\
    \ slow network connections, with the aim of developing a high-quality centralized\n\
    model. The authors of [131] insisted on using these specialized strategies to\
    \ coordinate\nnumerous APs with regard to losses caused by unique wireless channel\
    \ characteristics and\nWiFi downloading and uploading dynamics. Through the use\
    \ of FL and CR approaches in\ndual AP settings, it is now possible to improve\
    \ the Layer-4 performances of TCP versions.\nAnother study [274] assumed TCP Cubic\
    \ [275] as the Layer-4 protocol and considered the\nFL approach for IoVs. The\
    \ authors of [276] developed a framework for exploiting the FL\ntechnique, which\
    \ enhances the efﬁciency and privacy protection for the case of IoVs.\n−Digital\
    \ Twins for Smart Processes: A virtual depiction of resources, personnel, proce-\n\
    dures, systems, devices, and locations is referred to as a digital twin. Digital\
    \ twin technology\ncan be used to duplicate a variety of objects, including humans,\
    \ IoT devices, aircraft en-\ngines, and vehicles. A digital twin of the original\
    \ vehicle is created, for instance, when\nan automobile business creates a virtual\
    \ representation or digital duplicate (copy) of a car\nmodel. If a manufacturer\
    \ creates a virtual representation of its manufacturing process, the\nreplicated\
    \ process is a digital twin of the physical process. A digital twin is a proﬁle\
    \ of\nthe actual process or physical object’s past and present state. In this\
    \ virtual graphic, the\ndynamics and features of an IoT device’s life and operation\
    \ are depicted. The digital twin\ncan offer the location, state, and/or status\
    \ of physical assets in real-time due to continual\nlearning and advancements.\
    \ This fusion of the real and digital worlds enables organizations\nto monitor\
    \ systems, set strategies, and anticipate problems before they occur. Digital\
    \ twins\nare created using digital twin technology, which integrates network infrastructure\
    \ graphs,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n50 of 63\nAI, software analytics, and the\
    \ IoT. Through digital twins, the idea of the smart city is\ndemonstrated. This\
    \ technology can efﬁciently administer the city, from urban planning to\nthe optimization\
    \ of land use. Digital twins make it possible to simulate plans before putting\n\
    them into action in the real world, revealing issues before they materialize.\
    \ If a digital twin\nis in place, government organizations can only fully assess\
    \ what might be achieved with\nthe data to better citizens’ lives, offer economic\
    \ opportunity, and establish a more cohesive\ncommunity. Although the idea is\
    \ currently novel, it is expected to catch on in the next few\nyears [277].\n\
    −The 6G Network for Futuristic Smart Cities: A futuristic smart city is a dense\
    \ and\nAI-centric city because massive device connectivity with vast data trafﬁc\
    \ is estimated in\nthe future. In such cities, the concept of IoT will be converted\
    \ to the concept of Internet of\nEverything (IoE). Networks of futuristic smart\
    \ cities should have a huge bandwidth, low\nlatency, and AI integration. Such\
    \ networks should also provide ubiquity, high QoS, and\non-demand content for\
    \ thousands of interconnected devices. The 6G network [278] is the\nproblem-solving\
    \ network of futuristic cities, with huge bandwidth and low latency. It is\nunder\
    \ development for wireless communications technologies supporting cellular data\n\
    networks. Like its predecessors, 6G networks will probably be broadband cellular\
    \ networks,\nin which the service area is divided into small geographical areas\
    \ (cells). It is expected that\n6G will be supported by existing 5G infrastructures\
    \ such as SDN, NFV, and network slicing,\ntogether with new infrastructure. The\
    \ network requirements of 6G are as follows [278]:\n(1) ultra-fast data rates\
    \ as high as 1 Tbps; (2) ultra-low latency of less than 1 ms; (3) increased\n\
    mobility and coverage; (4) ﬂexible and efﬁcient connection of trillion level objects;\
    \ (5) peak\nspectral efﬁciency of 60 b/s/Hz; (6) very high system reliability;\
    \ and (7) improved network\nsecurity [279]. However, the main problem of 6G is\
    \ that transmitting at a higher frequency\nspectrum is prone to high path loss,\
    \ making the distance for transmission limited [280].\nThe expected 6G of the\
    \ radio access network is based on terahertz (THz) waves with the\ncapability\
    \ of carrying up to one terabit per second (Tbps). THz waves have the capability\
    \ of\ncarrying a large amount of data, but these waves have numerous drawbacks,\
    \ such as short-\nrange and atmospheric attenuation. Hence, these drawbacks can\
    \ introduce complications\nand hinder the performance of the 6G network. Therefore,\
    \ such complications of THz waves\nmust be considered, and efﬁcient AI-centric\
    \ multilayer physical network architectures of 6G\nmust be proposed for futuristic\
    \ smart cities. Farooq et al. [280] considered the expectations\nfrom a network\
    \ of futuristic smart cities and the problems of THz waves and proposed\na conceptual\
    \ terrestrial network (TN) architecture for 6G. The nested Bee Hive [280] is a\n\
    scalable multilayer architecture designed to meet the needs of futuristic smart\
    \ cities. It\nprovides an on-ground cloud network that helps smart devices to\
    \ run AI applications\npartially on their own and the rest on the cloud. Furthermore,\
    \ the distributed and edge\ncomputing-oriented infrastructure of Bee Hive provides\
    \ security and reduces trafﬁc load on\nthe upper layer of the network. Undoubtedly,\
    \ pervasive AI is the main enabling technology\nin 6G, while some forms of AI\
    \ are realized as part of 5G. Many successful examples of\nusing AI on wireless\
    \ communications have been proposed, from physical layer designs\n(e.g., channel\
    \ estimation and precoding), to network resource allocation (e.g., trafﬁc control\n\
    and cache storage management), to security and authentication, to dynamic cell\
    \ and\ntopology formation and management, to fault prediction and detection, etc.\
    \ However,\nDL-based solutions require high computational complexity, which might\
    \ not ﬁt in current\nmobile phones [281]. Apart from the complexity, Artiﬁcial\
    \ Neural Network (ANN)-based\nRL algorithms must be carefully designed to decrease\
    \ the computational resources required\non these devices [282]. Quantum communication\
    \ [283] offers a promising approach to\navoiding the challenge of limited computational\
    \ resources and energy efﬁciency. Applying\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks in IoT also\
    \ comes with the trade-off challenge between accuracy\nand computational/energy\
    \ requirements [282]. Tariq et al. [284] studied some of the above\nissues and\
    \ envisioned 6G to facilitate futuristic smart cities with pervasive autonomous\n\
    systems. Apart from pervasive AI, Imoize et al. [285] discussed other important\
    \ enabling\ntechnologies of 6G and their challenges. These enabling technologies\
    \ are as follows:\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n51 of 63\n•\nReconﬁgurable Intelligent\
    \ Surfaces (RISs) [286] that reﬂect signals and help in places\nwhere maintaining\
    \ Line of Sight (LoS) is difﬁcult. RISs will be mainly deployed on\ndoors, windows,\
    \ and buildings.\n•\nCell-Free Massive MIMO: The massive MIMO technology is introduced\
    \ in 5G with\na more dense network of access points (APs), and this is further\
    \ developed in 6G\nto include a network with no cells (cell-free) [287]. Cell-Free\
    \ Massive MIMO im-\nproves spectral efﬁciency in communication networks, but there\
    \ are some health risks\nassociated with such a dense network of APs.\n•\nCubeSat\
    \ communication or the Internet of Space Things [288]. A CubeSat (or U-class\n\
    spacecraft) is a miniaturized spacecraft with sizes that are multiples of U, up\
    \ to 6U,\nand U being 10 × 10 × 10 cm cubic units.\n•\nUAVs/satellite communication.\n\
    •\nTerahertz communication and Optical Wireless Technology [289].\n•\nBlockchain\
    \ technology [290] and quantum communication [283].\nThe development of futuristic\
    \ smart cities keeps up with the development of energy-\nefﬁcient 6G communication.\
    \ Kamruzzaman [291] presented the key trends in the IoT for\nenergy-efﬁcient 6G\
    \ wireless communication in smart cities. He argues that the application\nof IoT\
    \ devices to 6G in smart cities will provide a 100 Gbps data rate, <0.1 ms latency\
    \ rate,\nup to 1000 km/h mobility rate, 100 bps/Hz spectral efﬁciency, and 1000\
    \ GHz frequency.\nThis will resolve the issues of energy inefﬁciency and other\
    \ concerns in conventional\ncommunication networks. Moreover, the use of energy-efﬁcient\
    \ 6G in smart cities via IoT\ndevices probably will solve various problems that\
    \ are encountered by existing smart city\nsystems. In futuristic smart cities,\
    \ residents will use the innovative 6G brain–computer\ninterface (BCI) technology\
    \ [292] for a multi-sense experience. BCI is based on the signals\nand information\
    \ that monitor and control machines using sensible wearable headsets and\ndevices.\
    \ It uses human consciousness more than external sources for better interaction.\n\
    As humans have ﬁve senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste), BCI comprises\
    \ ﬁve\ndatasets, comprising features of human senses that are used for human interaction\
    \ with the\nmachine [292].\n8. Conclusions\nUtilizing resources efficiently, reducing\
    \ operating expenses, and enhancing city\ndwellers’ quality of life are the objectives\
    \ of the smart city paradigm. This goal is ob-\ntained by combining various technologies\
    \ including IoT, WSNs, CPS, ClCom, FoC, big\ndata analytics, and robots. For this\
    \ model, the effective networking and communication\nbetween the many components\
    \ required to enable various SCAs are crucial for achieving its\nobjectives. The\
    \ ever-increasing need for networking leads to many elastic and manageable\nplatforms\
    \ for various SCAs including smart grid, smart buildings, smart home, smart water,\n\
    and smart transportation systems. The networking needs of the key SCAs were examined\n\
    in this research, and the appropriate protocols that can be applied at different\
    \ system\nlevels have been identiﬁed. Additionally, we provided examples of networking\
    \ protocols\nand smart grid, intelligent building, smart residence, and smart\
    \ transportation system\narchitectures. We concentrated on key criteria for a\
    \ variety of networking designs, such as\nenergy savings, routing, security, dependability,\
    \ mobility, and support for heterogeneous\nnetworks. In addition, we presented\
    \ open research issues.\nThis survey can assist researchers to recognize research\
    \ gaps/problems working in the\nnetworking architectures for smart cities, and\
    \ it provides an overview of available protocols\nand architectures for SCAs.\n\

    RESEARCH ARTICLE Full Access Continuous measurement of whole-tree water balance
    for studying urban tree transpiration Takashi Asawa,  Tomoki Kiyono,  Akira Hoyano
    First published: 01 June 2017 https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.11244Citations: 21 SECTIONS
    PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Street and garden trees in urban areas are often exposed
    to advection of strong vapour pressure deficit (VPD) air that can raise the whole-tree
    transpiration rate (ET), known as the oasis effect. However, urban trees tend
    to have small soil volume compared with natural conditions, and so they are believed
    to strongly regulate stomata. ET characteristics of such urban trees have not
    been well understood because of a lack of reliable measurement methods. Therefore,
    we propose a novel weighing lysimeter method and investigate the whole-tree water
    balance of an isolated container-grown Zelkova serrata to examine (a) which biotic
    and abiotic factors determine ET and (b) which spatial and temporal information
    is needed to predict ET under urban conditions. Whole-tree water balance and environmental
    conditions were measured from 2010 to 2012. Although leaf area substantially increased
    in the study period, daily ET did not vary much. ET increased with VPD almost
    linearly in 2010 but showed saturation in 2011 and 2012. Root water uptake lagged
    ET by 40 min in 2012. These results suggest that the small planter box interfered
    with root growth and that hydraulic supply capacities did not increase sufficiently
    to support leaf area increase. From analysis of water balance, we believe that
    neglecting soil drought effects on street trees without irrigation in Japan will
    overestimate ET over 4–5 sunny days at the longest. This is unlike previous studies
    of forest. 1 INTRODUCTION Transpiration is an essential factor for water and energy
    balance between soil, plant, and atmosphere. Regarding urban trees, the environmental
    benefits of tree microclimate effects on human thermal comfort and health constitute
    a sustainable means for mitigating the urban thermal environment (Architectural
    Institute of Japan, 2007; Oke, 1987; Olgyay, 1963). To realize individual-specific
    irrigation management and design of more effective green space, quantitative knowledge
    of the whole-tree transpiration rate ET under characteristic urban conditions
    is necessary. Isolated trees such as street and garden trees are often exposed
    to advection of strong vapour pressure deficit (VPD) air compared with those in
    the forest. Such increase of evapotranspiration is the so-called oasis or leading-edge
    effect (Kanda, 2007; Oke, 1987; see also Mackay, Ewers, Loranty, & Kruger, 2010
    and its references to studies in the forest). Several urban meteorologists have
    claimed that trees in an urban environment may have higher transpiration rates
    than in the forest because of the oasis effect (Hagishima, Narinta, & Tanimoto,
    2007; Moriwaki & Kanda, 2004; Spronken-Smith, Oke, & Lowry, 2000). Moreover, an
    isolated tree is readily impacted by radiation and wind, which affects its photosynthesis
    rate, leaf temperature, and boundary layer thickness. These effects may increase
    ET. On the contrary, several plant ecophysiologists have reported that urban trees
    tend to vigorously regulate stomata because of drought stress from strong VPD,
    limited water supply and rooting space, and strong soil compaction (e.g., Cregg,
    1995; Kagotani et al., 2015; Kjelgren & Clark, 1993; McCarthy & Pataki, 2010;
    Osone et al., 2014). Clearly, there is some discrepancy of findings. Thus, to
    address the relative importance and interactions between biotic and abiotic effects
    on ET, long-term measurement under a range of conditions is required. Quantitative
    characteristics of urban tree ET have not been sufficiently clarified because
    of a lack of reliable measurement methods. Porometer, sap flow, and lysimeter
    methods have mainly been used for estimating ET in studies. The porometer method
    essentially targets the measurement of single-leaf transpiration. Scaling up from
    leaf transpiration to ET can cause errors because of errors in leaf area estimation,
    differences in leaf characteristics, and microclimate in the crown. This method,
    therefore, must be validated using other accurate methods (Leverenz et al., 1982;
    Mcdermitt, 1990). The sap flow methods are frequently used for studying whole-tree
    and stand-scale water use (Granier, 1987; Swanson & Whitfield, 1981). However,
    sap flow velocity measured at breast height can be delayed from actual ET by a
    few hours (e.g., Saugier, Granier, Pontailler, Dufrene, & Baldocchi, 1997). In
    addition, such methods tend to underestimate ET when using long-term measurements,
    owing to the change of xylem thermal properties caused by wounds of sensor installation
    (Moore, Bond, Jones, & Meinzer, 2010; Swanson & Whitfield, 1981; Wullschleger,
    Childs, King, & Hanson, 2011). Furthermore, the very widely used Granier''s thermal
    dissipation sensor (Granier, 1987) is known to be sensitive to environmental radiation
    and temperature (Lu, Urban, & Zhao, 2004; Oren, Phillips, et al, 1999); this can
    be problematic in measurement of isolated (i.e., urban) trees under hot summer
    conditions. The lysimeter method quantifies ET using weighing or drainage lysimeters.
    This is considered the most reliable method for small plants but has limits for
    tall trees because of large errors from wind when measuring in outdoor environments
    with high temporal resolution (Edwards, 1986; Lorite, Santos, Teti, & Fereres,
    2012). Asawa et al. (2012, in Japanese) and Asawa, Hoyano, Shimizu, et al. (2014,
    in Japanese) developed a novel weighing lysimeter that gives a sufficiently accurate
    estimate of hourly ET for a tall tree; they reported results from summer 2010.
    In the present study, we show that this lysimeter approach is capable of measuring
    over years and examines quantitative and process information of interseasonal/interannual
    changes of ET and whole-tree water balance under characteristic urban conditions.
    Although sap flow measurement studies in urban areas have gradually increased
    (Chen, Zhang, & Ewers, 2012; Chen, Zhang, et al., 2011; Litvak, McCarthy, & Pataki,
    2011, 2012; McCarthy & Pataki, 2010; McCarthy, Pataki, & Jenerette, 2011; Pataki,
    McCarthy, Litvak, & Pincetl, 2011; Peters, McFadden, & Montgomery, 2010), whole-tree
    water balance and quantitative interaction between ET and soil moisture have rarely
    been reported. This is because it is not easy to measure rooting space or amounts
    of infiltration and leakage, owing to artificial obstacles such as pavement. Therefore,
    we studied urban tree transpiration using an isolated container-grown tree exposed
    to advection of high-VPD air and grown in shallow soil. The questions addressed
    in the present study are as follows: (a) Which biotic and abiotic factors determine
    ET under characteristic urban conditions and, in particular, how does VPD affect
    ET in relation to other factors? (Buckley, 2005; Oren, Phillips, et al., 1999;
    Sperry & Love, 2015) (b) What spatial and temporal information is needed to predict
    ET? These questions are especially important to the recent development of numerical
    simulations of urban microclimates (e.g., Asawa, Hoyano, & Nakaohkubo, 2008; Chen,
    Kusaka, et al., 2011; Vico, Revelli, & Porporato, 2014) for determining which
    factors should be treated precisely and which can be simplified. To overcome the
    limitation of the lysimeter method and address the effects of biotic and abiotic
    factors on ET, we propose a data quality control protocol for continuous long-term
    measurement to remove noise from wind and other factors. Such a protocol for the
    lysimeter method is not well established relative to other methods based on eddy
    covariance or sap flow (e.g., Oishi, Hawthorne, & Oren, 2016; Vickers & Mahrt,
    1997). Many lysimeter studies used a simple moving average or Savitzky–Golay filter,
    but such smoothing filters are mere graphical techniques and not justified in
    quantitative analysis (Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling, & Flannery, 1996) because
    the reliability of filtered values is never evaluated. Alternatively, we used
    time-series statistics to quantify uncertainty of estimated ET. 2 MATERIALS AND
    METHODS 2.1 Study site and plant material The study site was an experimental field
    with an open area of 8,800 m2 in the city of Miyoshi, Aichi Prefecture, Japan
    (35°8′N, 137°6′E). There were no obstacles within 40 m of the sample tree, except
    for several container-grown trees of ~5-m height. Distances between these trees
    were >4 m, so they could easily receive solar radiation and airflow. This may
    be regarded as an isolated condition. The sample tree used for measurement was
    a 13 year-old Zelkova serrata (Figure 1). Z. serrata is the third most popular
    species of street tree (National Institute for Land and Infrastructure Management,
    2014), and there are three prefectures and 79 cities in Japan that have established
    it as the “city''s symbol tree.” The height and trunk diameter in 2010 were 6.4
    m and 11 cm, respectively. We did not measure leaf area routinely but measured
    using a terrestrial-laser scanning system (LiDAR; VZ-400, RIEGL, Horn, Austria)
    in the summers of 2010 and 2012. Total leaf area and the leaf area index (LAI)
    on September 3, 2010, were 13.2 m2 and 2.1 m2/m2, respectively (Asawa, Hoyano,
    Oshio, et al., 2014), which were estimated using the voxel-based canopy profiling
    method (Hosoi & Omasa, 2006; Oshio, Asawa, Hoyano, & Miyasaka, 2015). The Z. serrata
    tree was planted in a large planter box of area 1 m2 and depth 0.6 m; box volume
    was determined on the basis of the size of a general street tree (Ministry of
    Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of Japan, 2005). Leaf pruning was
    done to reduce transpiration and compensate for lost root systems in advance of
    transplanting to the planter box. Root-zone depth was 50 cm, and the soil was
    composed of Kanto loam (70%), perlite (20%), and leaf mould (10%). Kanto loam
    is widely used for arboriculture in Japan because of its strong permeability and
    large water-holding capacity. In general, it has aggregated structures, strong
    porosity, and high saturated hydraulic conductivity (Chang, Kato, & Okazaki, 1994;
    Kaihotsu, Tanaka, & Okahashi, 1981). We took photos of the Z. serrata once every
    few months to check the tree and apparatus conditions, finding that the leaf area
    slightly decreased in 2011 but strongly increased in 2012 (Figure 1). No breakages
    or diseases were found in the Z. serrata during the measurement period. Figure

    (right) August 30, 2012. Ultrasonic anemometer was set on the right side of the
    tree; distance from the tree was 4.3 m 2.2 Meteorological measurement Meteorological
    conditions were measured in the northern part of the experimental field, using
    a solar radiometer (MS-402, Eko Instruments, Tokyo, Japan), air temperature sensor
    (4 wires Pt100Ω, Taiyo Keki, Tokyo, Japan) with ventilation (Model 43502, R.M.
    Young Co., Traverse, MI, USA), relative humidity sensor (CS215, Campbell Scientific,
    Logan, UT, USA), tipping bucket gauge (TE525MM, Campbell Scientific), 3-D ultrasonic
    anemometer (Model 81000, R.M. Young Co.), and photosynthetically active radiation
    (PAR) sensor (LI-190, Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). To analyse the effects of
    wind on lysimeter measurement, the anemometer was located 4.3 m from the Z. serrata
    (Figure 1). This location was determined to be as close as possible to the tree
    while minimizing its effect on the wind measurement. The height of the anemometer
    was 4 m, nearly the same as the centre of the tree crown. The measurement was
    done from August 2010 to September 2012. In the summer seasons, short-term and
    intensive measurements of transpiration, leaf area, and heat balance were conducted.
    In those periods, irrigation was stopped for two to four successive days to ascertain
    the effects of drought stress and so as not to damage on tree growth. All measurement
    data were checked every month for any missing data, spike noises, or physically
    unrealistic values. 2.3 Design of weighing lysimeter The measurement was done
    to obtain ET datasets under various meteorological and leaf-on (or leaf-off) conditions
    over the years. The weighing lysimeter, therefore, was designed and set up to
    be adaptable to long-term measurement. The total weight of the tree, planter box,
    and soil was ~1,000 kg, so a platform weighing machine using load cells (CAPS4-1500LL-I,
    Sartorius AG, Göttingen, Germany) was used. Site calibration was performed on
    the weighing machine. In advance of the measurement, we believed that the weighing
    accuracy should be ±100 g/hr, because the assumed ET was ~1 kg/hr. Although nominal
    accuracy of the weighing machine was 250 g (maximum weight 1,500 kg; accuracy
    1/6,000), we confirmed that relative sensitivity to weight change measured by
    the weighing machine was <100 g. Figure 2 shows in detail the weighing lysimeter
    apparatus and its dimensions. When designing the lysimeter with the required accuracy,
    the following characteristics were considered and introduced. (a) The tree and
    planter box should not contact the measurement apparatus, irrigation, and drainage
    systems, all of which were placed near the tree. Only a few cables for measurement
    sensors were connected between the planter box and measurement apparatus. (b)
    These cables were set to slacken for removing tension that might affect weight
    values. (c) To prevent the tree from falling down under strong wind, two steel
    support arms were placed around the trunk but had no contact with the trunk. These
    arms did not touch the trunk even with wind speeds ~10 m/s. (d) The weighing machine
    and planter box were both covered by a shed to protect them from wind, rainfall,
    and solar radiation. Air temperature inside the shed was continuously monitored,
    and its side door was frequently opened for air ventilation. Figure 2 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Section of weighing lysimeter. Asterisk indicates noncontact
    setting 2.4 Irrigation regime and water balance measurement All water balances
    were controlled by an automated irrigation system, because quantitative measurement
    of rainfall on the planter box was very difficult, and the study focused on the
    relationship between ET and water balance under irrigated conditions. Water was
    automatically irrigated on the upper surface of the soil at midnight, from 0:00
    to 1:00 each day. Irrigation water was stored once in a tank in a predetermined
    amount and supplied from the tank to the surface by gravity. Drainage occurred
    immediately after irrigation and nearly ceased within about four hours before
    morning, when transpiration began. The planter box was made of stainless steel
    of 2-mm thickness, and its bottom had a slope of 1/100. Pumice was laid on the
    bottom 10 cm of the box for smooth drainage. Volumetric soil water content θ was
    measured at depths of 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 cm by amplitude-domain reflectometry
    sensors (Thetaprobe ML2x, Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK). Matric potential Ψ
    was calculated from measured θ and soil water retention (θ–Ψ) curves. Undisturbed
    soil samples of 100 cc were collected from all layers near the amplitude-domain
    reflectometry sensors and used to measure water retention curves in the laboratory
    via centrifuge and pressure-plate methods. Amounts of irrigation and drainage
    were measured by flowmeter (ND10-NATAAA, Aichitokei, Nagoya, Japan) and tipping
    bucket-type rain gauges (TE525-L25, Campbell Scientific), respectively. Stemflow
    was trapped at the middle of the trunk and measured by rain gauge (UIZ-TB500,
    UIZIN, Tokyo, Japan), so the water did not flow into the soil. Soil evaporation
    ES was restricted by a cover sheet on the planter box, but air was continuously
    supplied to the soil surface in order not to interfere with soil respiration.
    Ventilation rate, temperature, and relative humidity of both inflow and outflow
    air at the surface were measured so that ES was estimated by absolute humidity
    change. We confirmed that ES was <150 g/day in summer 2010. Meteorological, sample
    tree weight, and water balance data were recorded on a data logger (C-CR10000,
    Campbell Scientific). The weighing machine and anemometer were synchronized, and
    data recorded at 1 Hz. Other meteorological conditions and water balance were
    recorded every 1 and 10 min, respectively. 2.5 Calculation of water balance To
    estimate ET, measured weight data was resolved into each origin of weight change.
    That change and whole-tree water balance can be expressed by (1) (2) where W is
    sample weight (sum of tree, soil, and planter box) and W* its measured value.
    εw is wind load, εo represents other error terms such as dew and litterfall, ET
    is whole-tree transpiration, ES is soil evaporation, Irr is irrigation, D is drainage,
    Int is crown interception, and EWC is wet-crown evaporation and throughfall. ES,
    Irr, and D were directly identified by the measurements. In estimating ET, larger
    parts of the noise are from εw and measurement errors of Irr and D on sunny days,
    and εw, Int, and EWC on rainy days. The effects of Irr and Int can be easily removed
    by discarding data during irrigation or rain, but εw, D, and EWC need special
    treatments, which are addressed later. Dew was not problematic because it was
    small except during winter, and Z. serrata is a deciduous species. We did not
    quantify litterfall from W,* but it was confirmed independently. In August 2012,
    we clipped all leaves from Z. serrata, which was nearly the same size as a lysimeter-grown
    one, finding a wet weight ~5.8 kg/tree. We believe it is reasonable to ignore
    the effects of litterfall in estimating daily ET in the predefoliation period.
    Soil water balance was considered to address the root water uptake rate. When
    soil water movement is expressed in integral form and ES is negligible, it becomes
    similar to Equation 2: (3) where ρ is water density, v is soil volume, and ET′
    is whole-tree root water uptake. ET′ nearly equals ET at daily scale but is delayed
    at diurnal scale. When Irr and D are negligible, soil water change (−ρvdθ/dt)
    = ET′. Such a condition is feasible when irrigation is stopped and θ drops below
    field capacity. 2.6 Statistical analysis for ET estimation All statistical analyses
    were performed using R 3.2.4 software (R Development Core Team, 2016). Raw data
    of W* in 2010 recorded at 1 Hz are shown in Figure 3. On ordinary days, W* increased
    at night from Irr and decreased during daytime from ET. The inset of Figure 3
    illustrates W* and its linear trend (regression line) around noon on August 17.
    The negative trend indicates the effect of ET, and there is clearly a strong time-series
    autocorrelation between the residuals, which can be attributed to swaying of the
    tree from εw. The lack of independence of observations often causes fatal error
    in estimating standard error (SE) and statistical hypothesis testing (von Storch
    & Zwiers, 1999). Therefore, we estimated the time between effectively independent
    observations T0 to correct SE of W. Effective sample size Neff and T0 can be calculated
    according to Trenberth (1984): (4) (5) where N is the number of observations and
    rL is the autocorrelation coefficient at lag L. We estimated Neff, ET, and higher
    moments of W* every 20 min and calculated daily ET as their sum. Details of the
    calculation are presented in the Appendix. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Example of observed sample weight (W*) data, from August 10 to 21, 2010, recorded
    at 1 Hz. Irrigation was stopped after August 18. Inset shows data around noon
    on August 17. Autocorrelation is clear around 12:35 3 RESULTS First, we show results
    regarding measurement accuracy of the lysimeter method and then review daily ET
    and monthly water balance throughout the study period to understand how ET changed
    seasonally and annually. Finally, to reveal reasons for changes of ET characteristics,
    we show interannual variations of diurnal ET and root water uptake. 3.1 Performances
    of ET estimation and quality control Table 1 shows Neff and descriptive statistics
    of W* for growing seasons (May–October of the 3 years). Neff, standard deviation,
    and kurtosis increased, and the absolute value of skewness decreased together
    with wind speed. No clear interannual trend was found, which supports that our
    lysimeter performed well throughout the measurement period. Figure 4 shows the
    diurnal pattern of characteristic days to confirm the performance of ET estimation.
    The error bars show 2 SE (~95% confidence interval); and black circles, deviation
    from a Gaussian distribution. Neff roughly correlated with wind speed and was
    <200 (1/6 of N), which means that SE increased about twofold to threefold with
    consideration of Neff. Figure 4a,d shows the result on a sunny irrigation day;
    there was strong fluctuation of weight change (−ΔW/Δt), but the error bars were
    small, which indicate that considering these data as ET is relatively reliable.
    This –ΔW/Δt correlated well with solar radiation Rs. On a windy day (Figure 4b,e),
    there was also large fluctuation, but this could easily be distinguished from
    ET by large error bars, which were corrected by Neff. From a physical perspective,
    there was no correspondence between –ΔW/Δt and evaporation drivers (radiation
    and wind). From a biological perspective, we could not find any reason for large
    –ΔW/Δt fluctuation, especially after sunset. Therefore, the judgement that these
    data are suspicious from data quality criteria appears reasonable. Furthermore,
    on a rainy day (Figure 4c,f), the higher moment test and error bars revealed a
    suspicious –ΔW/Δt before and after the rain. This large –ΔW/Δt can be attributed
    to EWC. Moreover, it is well known that tipping bucket rain gauges have errors
    and a time lag because of their measurement mechanism. Therefore, the negative
    value of –ΔW/Δt (i.e., increase of W*) before the time of rain observation is
    considered Int. The higher moment test provided quantitative criteria to assess
    how many records should be discarded as EWC or Int. In this case, we discarded
    two records before and after the rain. Table 1. Effective sample size (Neff) and

    19, 2011 3.2 Environmental conditions Daily environmental data from August 2010
    through September 2012 are shown in Figure 5. Although the summer solstice is
    in late June, Rs and VPD in that month were small because of the normal rainy
    season in Japan (according to Japan Meteorological Agency [JMA], 2008, mean precipitation
    in June and July was 300 mm, accounting for 1/5 the yearly total). Summer 2010
    was extremely hot and dry all over the country, and mean air temperature Ta was
    the highest in the past 113 years (JMA, 2010). Our study site was on the Pacific
    side of Japan (as is Tokyo), and the duration of sunny days in Tokyo in summer
    2010 was the second longest since 1968 (JMA, 2012). Furthermore, at the study
    site, late August and early September 2010 were the hottest and driest of the
    study period. Maximum Ta was 38°C, and the maximum VPD was 4.5 kPa. The longest
    stretch of sunny days in 2010 was 18, from August 21 through September 7. We irrigated
    about 30–50 kg/m2 (soil) daily, determined using ET of preceding days, which was
    sufficient to compensate daily transpiration loss. We believe that ample irrigation
    was not problematic, because the excess of water over field capacity was soon
    discharged. We irrigated almost every day during the growing season but ran a
    dry-down experiment several times. According to Rodriguez-Iturbe and Porporato
    (2007), plants typically begin to close stomata when soil Ψ declines by 0.03 MPa
    and almost completely close with a decrease of ~3 MPa. Over our measurement period,
    mean θ from 5- to 45-cm depths remained >36.6% vol. (Ψ = −0.03 MPa), except for
    dry-down periods. On August 26, 2010, we found that mean soil Ψ was less than
    −2.5 MPa, but ET remained 14.4 kg/day. On this day, Ψ at 35- and 45-cm depths
    was −1.92 and −0.72 MPa, respectively (data not shown). Figure 5 Open in figure

    vol., which correspond to soil matric potential Ψ = −0.03 and −3 MPa, respectively.
    Shaded areas in bottom panel represent missing or discarded days 3.3 Seasonal
    changes of ET and whole-tree water balance Daily ET is shown at the bottom of
    Figure 5. ET reached 35 kg/day in mid-August 2010, but in 2011 and 2012, yearly
    maximum ET was 28.4 and 27.1 kg/day, respectively. Seasonal patterns of ET were
    evident, but the times of ET stopping and starting (foliation and defoliation)
    varied between the years. ET approached zero in mid-November 2010 and early October
    2011. Atmospheric conditions after September were not very different between the
    2 years (Figure 5). ET became positive and gradually increased in April 2011,
    but in 2012, it suddenly increased between late April and early May. For example,
    ET = 12.5 kg/day and Rs = 24.5 MJ/m2 day on May 2, 2011, whereas ET = 23.3 kg/day
    and Rs = 18.4 MJ/m2 day on May 1, 2012. The monthly water balance components of
    the Z. serrata and availability of ET are summarized in Figure 6. We halted measurements
    once in September 2011 because of a typhoon (Roke; the typhoon no. 15 in Japan)
    and did not interpolate discarded or missing records, so a large imbalance was
    found in this period. The mean ratio of available ET to Irr in the growing season
    was 69%, with a range of 32–123%. Because large portions of Irr were discharged
    as D in October 2010 and May 2012 and θ was nearly constant at ~60% vol. (Figure
    5). we consider this value the field capacity of the soil. Figure 6 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Monthly water balances and available ET. Components are irrigation
    (Irr), drainage (D), whole-tree transpiration (ET), and change of soil water storage
    (ΔS). Available ET represents ratio of nonmissing or discarded days 3.4 Biotic
    and abiotic control on ET The data obtained for Ta < 20°C roughly corresponded
    to no-leaf periods when ET was near zero (Figure 5). We visibly confirmed this
    by photos of the Z. serrata. Because we did not measure leaf area routinely and
    generally the times of foliation and defoliation are controlled by temperature
    (Jones, 2014), we used Ta as an index of leaf area condition. The major results
    of the following analyses did not differ from this 20°C criterion when we varied
    it from 15°C to 25°C. In general, VPD and Rs are the primary drivers of transpiration,
    but their relative importance depends on the magnitude of canopy coupling with
    the atmosphere (Jarvis & McNaughton, 1986). Thus, daily ET responses to atmospheric
    drivers (daily total Rs, mean daytime VPD, and wind speed) were analysed (Figure
    7). There was the strongest correlation between ET and VPD throughout the study
    period (R = .80), but after filtering out days on which daily mean Ta was <20°C,
    VPD and Rs showed almost the same correlations with ET (R = .63 in both cases).
    Wind speed had no clear effect on ET (R = .21). Because ET appeared to respond
    to VPD nonlinearly in 2011 and 2012, we used various regression models to test
    the significance of interannual differences in the slopes of VPD and Rs (differences
    of βi in ET = βi VPD or ET = βi Rs) and nonlinearity of VPD (ET = α + β lnVPD),
    as summarized in Table 2. A minimum Akaike''s information criterion value was
    found in the log-transformed VPD model with interannual difference (ET = αi +
    βi lnVPD). The regression lines and their 95% confidence intervals of that model
    are shown in Figure 8. The intercepts (α; mean ET at VPD = 1 kPa) increased with
    the year (Table 2). Although the SE of slope (β) of log-transformed VPD was large,
    β2010 was clearly larger than other years and SE ranges did not overlap (Table
    2). Modelled mean ET in 2011 and 2012 was nearly identical when VPD was >1.3 kPa.

    an interannual comparison of diurnal ET. To address the effect of root water uptake
    ET′, August 18, 2010 (Figure 9a,c) and July 4, 2012 (Figure 9b,d) were selected
    because they were during dry-down periods and mean θ was less than field capacity.
    That is, Irr and D were negligible and changes of soil water content (−dθ/dt)
    may be regarded as ET′ in Equation 3 (daily mean soil Ψ = −0.09 MPa on both days).
    Daily total Rs values were nearly equal (24.3 and 23.6 MJ/day), but maximum VPD
    and ET were substantially different between the 2 days. Times of maxima of all
    variables (ET, −Δθ/Δt Rs and VPD) were around 12:00–15:00 on both days, and only
    diurnal ET in 2012 displayed a bimodal pattern (Figure 9b). Cross-correlations
    of Rs, VPD, and –Δθ/Δt with ET on these days are shown in Figure 10. On August
    18, 2010, ET peaked 20 min earlier than VPD and had no time lag with Rs or –Δθ/Δt
    (Figure 10a). However, on July 4, 2012, ET preceded –Δθ/Δt by 40 min, peaked at
    the same time as VPD, and lagged Rs by 80 min (Figure 10b). The cross-correlation
    coefficients of VPD and Rs with ET were smaller in 2012 than in 2010. Figure 9

    4.1 ET responses to atmospheric drivers and leaf area change It is well known
    that wind has little effect on ET for coniferous trees, but this tendency is not
    always valid for broadleaf trees (see the review of Komatsu, 2003). Z. serrata
    is a broadleaf species, but the effect of wind speed was not clear (Figure 7c).
    This result suggests that leaves of the Z. serrata were strongly coupled to the
    atmosphere; that is, boundary layer resistance was weak, leaf temperature was
    close to Ta, and ET was mainly controlled by stomata (Jarvis & McNaughton, 1986).
    This is probably because the sample Z. serrata was in an isolated condition. Daily
    ET of the Z. serrata on sunny days in the growing season was about 25–30 kg/day
    (Figure 5). This is comparable to previous reports of ground-planted orchards
    (Green, 1993; Green, Clothier, Caspari, & Neal, 2002) that have similar tree size
    and environments (isolated condition, daily Rs ~ 20 MJ/m2 and moist soil). Green
    (1993) reported an isolated walnut tree (3.5 m in height, 26.4 m2 in leaf area)
    transpired 40 kg/day on a sunny day, and Green et al. (2002) reported that olives
    (4 m in height, 13.5 m2 in leaf area) planted at 4 × 6 m intervals transpired
    175 kg/week. However, this does not necessarily mean that the Z. serrata was free
    from drought stress. As shown in Figure 1, its leaf area substantially increased
    from 2010 to 2012, but ET did not increase (Figure 5). There are three possible
    reasons for this. First, VPD maximized in summer 2010; second, mutual shading
    of increased leaves dampened ET increase; third, the small planter box interfered
    with root growth, and hydraulic supply capacities did not increase sufficiently
    to support the leaf area increase. The nonlinear response of ET to VPD and its
    interannual difference (Figures 7a and 8) are believed to correspond to Oren,
    Sperry, et al. (1999), who showed that the sensitivity of stomatal conductance
    to VPD is general over a wide range of plants. According to Oren et al., a plant
    with large stomatal conductance (thus large ET) at small VPD must strongly regulate
    stomata when VPD becomes large, because of hydraulic limits. This was true of
    the Z. serrata during the study period (Figure 8). Litvak et al. (2012) analysed
    ET characteristics of 121 urban trees using the same log-transformed VPD model
    as our study (ET = α + β lnVPD) and sap flow velocity data from their series of
    studies of the urban landscape of Los Angeles (Litvak et al., 2011; McCarthy &
    Pataki, 2010; McCarthy et al., 2011; Pataki et al., 2011). They reported that
    the ratio of β to α was constant among tree sizes and sites, corresponding to
    Oren, Sperry, et al. (1999), but it could differ by xylem vulnerability (unsaturated
    hydraulic conductance); the ratio range was 0.3–0.6. The β/α values of our Z.
    serrata were within this range during 2011 and 2012, but not in 2010 (Table 2;
    β/α ~ .8 in 2010). This means that the Z. serrata in 2010 was relatively insensitive
    to drought stress, possibly because the low ratio of leaf to root area from pruning-enhanced
    hydraulic conductance. The implications of the findings shown in Figures 9 and
    10 are that the Z. serrata became more conservative regarding ET during the 2
    years, not only at daily scale but also at the diurnal one. The 40-min delay of
    water transport from soil to leaves in 2012 supports the hypothesis that the hydraulic
    capacities did not increase sufficiently, because if this were so, the increase
    of leaf area would reduce hydraulic conductance per leaf area. Increase of evaporative
    demand (by increase of the ratio of leaf to root area) leads to more negative
    water potential in plant tissues. Large negative water potential generates cavitation
    and embolism and decreases the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in apoplastic
    pathways (Sperry & Love, 2015; Tyree & Zimmermann, 2002). This is the likely reason
    for the delay of water transport in 2012. Some researchers reported that a too
    great VPD decreases ET, a so-called apparent feed-forward response of stomata
    to humidity (e.g., Monteith, 1995). The bimodal diurnal ET pattern (Figure 9b)
    and 80-min lag between ET and Rs found in 2012 (Figure 10b) indicate this phenomenon.
    The leaf-to-atmosphere VPD of the Z. serrata might have maximized around midday
    in 2012 because of the peak in Rs (Figure 9b and 9d). According to Duursma et
    al. (2014), the apparent feed-forward response can be explained by increased cuticle
    transpiration, generation of cavitation, or peak response of photosynthesis to
    temperature. Because we did not measure physiological conditions of the Z. serrata
    precisely, we cannot examine the influences of the above factors, but the increase
    of leaf area could be attributed to all three. 4.2 Phenological aspects Figure
    5 shows obvious interannual differences of ET in spring. This result is probably
    because of interannual differences in the times of foliation, but the reason for
    this phenological change is unclear. In general, the foliation time is believed
    to be mainly controlled by temperature (Jones, 2014). However, in our results,
    Ta of preceding periods were not very different between years (mean Ta in April
    was 12.2°C in 2011 and 13.1°C in 2012). Recently, through chamber experiments
    using cuttings of some woody species, Laube, Sparks, Estrella, and Menzel (2014)
    showed that drought stress can delay bud development. Thus, one of the possible
    reasons for the interannual phenological difference of the Z. serrata is change
    of leaf area and hypothetical hydraulic limits. Throughout the study period, the
    discrepancy between the strong correlation of ET with VPD (Figure 7a) and weak
    correlation of ET with Rs (Figure 7b) might be explained by the time of foliation/defoliation.
    The data obtained for Ta < 20°C roughly correspond to no-leaf periods. Rs can
    be large even at Ta < 20°C, because its seasonal change precedes Ta by a few months
    (Figure 5). However, atmospheric VPD must be small at low Ta, because VPD is directly
    determined by temperature. This means that there are VPD–Ta–leaf area–ET correlations
    at seasonal scale. The strong correlation of ET with VPD throughout the seasons
    (Figure 7a) was believed to be not only the result of the direct relationship
    between vapour diffusion and its driver but also the effect of leaf area as a
    confounding factor. 4.3 Spatial and temporal implications for predicting ET In
    warm periods (Ta > 20°C), the linear response of daily ET to Rs measured on a
    horizontal plane (Figure 7b) is interesting. In general, stomatal conductance
    saturates with strong PAR, as described elsewhere (e.g., Jarvis, 1976). It is
    also common that transpiration rates of a dense vegetation canopy increase almost
    linearly with radiation (Rs or net radiation Rn). This is because dense canopy
    transpiration can be well approximated by the equilibrium evaporation rate, that
    is, the evaporation rate under no advection (Jarvis & McNaughton, 1986). However,
    the Z. serrata measured herein was isolated and was thus believed to be far from
    equilibrium. A similar finding was reported in Pereira, Green, and Nova (2007),
    who showed that ET of irrigated orchards and an isolated walnut tree, including
    various ranges of LAI, could be effectively expressed by the equation of Priestley
    and Taylor (1972) pertaining to Rn measured above grass. This linear response
    might be explained by the interactive effect between mutual shading of leaves
    and saturation of stomatal conductance with PAR, as described in Sellers (1985).
    This linearization is especially effective for plants that have a large LAI, such
    as conifers. The LAI of the Z. serrata in our study was small (2.1 in September
    2010), and it appears that the linear tendency in Pereira et al. (2007) did not
    depend strongly on LAI. One hypothesis is that 3-D radiation transfer in the crown
    affected the results; we will examine this in future studies. If one wants to
    keep ET maximum to obtain environmental benefits of Z. serrata, given that field
    capacity of the soil is 60% vol. and Z. serrata begins to close stomata around
    Ψ = −0.03 MPa (θ = 36.6% vol.), the Z. serrata can use at most 500 kg/container
    * (60.0–36.6)% = 117 kg water. Because daily ET on sunny days in the growing season
    was about 25–30 kg/day (Figure 5). it follows that the Z. serrata used the threshold
    amount in about 4–5 days at the longest, if there was no irrigation. Because the
    soil type and planter box volume of the Z. serrata were determined according to
    the general street tree in Japan as mentioned above, this estimation suggests
    that street trees without irrigation may experience frequent drought stress as
    reported in plant ecophysiology studies. It is often assumed in the study of forest
    transpiration in Japan that soil drought in the shallow layer is negligible (e.g.,
    Komatsu, Kang, Kume, Yoshifuji, & Hotta, 2006; Kosugi et al., 2007; Kumagai, Tateishi,
    Shimizu, & Otsuki, 2008), because deep roots and water supply from the water table
    facilitate a large available water capacity (Zhang, Dawes, & Walker, 2001). From
    our estimates, neglect of soil drought effects may be valid for street trees during
    the few days during and after rain, but it probably overestimates ET after four
    to five sunny days at the longest. The importance of the vertical root distribution
    for climatology and hydrology study is well known (Feddes et al., 2001), but,
    in general, the roots of street trees and container-grown trees grow uniformly
    compared with natural conditions (e.g., Gilman & Masters, 2010). On August 26,
    2010, we found that mean soil Ψ was below the wilting point (−2.5 MPa), but ET
    maintained ~50% of the amount on irrigated days (Figure 5; see also Fig. 6 of
    Asawa, Hoyano, Shimizu, et al., 2014, for diurnal change). This result indicates
    that to predict ET under soil drought conditions, the root distribution should
    be considered, even for the small and shallow soil used in the present study (0.5-m3
    and 50-cm depths). The time of water transport from soil to leaves is important
    when parameterizing stomatal conductance, because it causes strong bias, not only
    in the responses to atmospheric drivers but also in maximum conductance. This
    was discussed for 10- to 20-m-tall trees in other studies (Kumagai, Aoki, Otsuki,
    & Utsumi, 2009; Rayment, Loustau, & Jarvis, 2002; Ward, Bell, Clark, & Oren, 2012).
    Although the Z. serrata in our study was relatively small (6.4 m) and it is a
    ring-porous species with large conduits, root water uptake lagged ET by 40 min
    in 2012 (Figure 10). Using a steady-state hydraulic model (e.g., Buckley, 2005;
    Tuzet, Perrier, & Leuning, 2003) may be problematic in treating ET at less than
    hourly time scale. 5 CONCLUSIONS We propose a quality control protocol for continuous
    long-term lysimeter measurement and investigated whole-tree water balance of an
    isolated container-grown Z. serrata from 2010 to 2012, to acquire quantitative
    and process information of urban tree transpiration. We found time-series autocorrelation
    very important in observed weight data upon quantifying ET and its uncertainty,
    showing that our lysimeter method performed well throughout the 2-year study period.
    In response to the questions put in Section 1, (a) VPD was the most important
    factor among atmospheric drivers, and wind speed showed no clear correlation with
    daily ET. From an interannual comparison of diurnal ET and leaf area between 2010
    and 2012, we conclude that among biotic factors, leaf area is not the sole or
    primary factor that determines ET. These results suggest that we must consider
    the balance of leaf and root area for trees grown in small and shallow soil, such
    as street trees. (b) In warm periods, daily ET showed a linear response to daily
    Rs measured on a horizontal plane, suggesting the contribution of 3-D radiation
    transfer. For water balance, from our estimates, neglecting soil drought effects
    under no irrigation can overestimate ET after four to five sunny days at the longest,
    unlike prior studies of forest in Japan. When predicting soil drought effects,
    root area distribution should be considered, even for the small and shallow soil
    investigated herein (0.5-m3 and 50-cm depths). The delay of root water uptake
    with ET found in 2012 suggests that temporal resolution of the steady-state hydraulic
    model should be longer than 1 hr for studying trees of heights >6–7 m. Our findings
    depend somewhat on the growing conditions and species of the sample tree, so additional
    data are required to address general ET characteristics of urban trees. However,
    to our knowledge, this is the first report of interseasonal/interannual whole-tree
    water balance with urban, isolated, and small soil volume conditions. For measuring
    ET and parameterizing a stomatal conductance model of urban trees, the present
    findings will be valuable to determine which factors should be treated precisely
    and which can be simplified. One of the greatest differences between our experimental
    conditions and an actual urban area is the radiation environment. Urban trees
    are often shaded by surrounding buildings and receive long-wave radiation from
    them. Therefore, 3-D radiation environments should be considered when predicting
    ET in numerical simulations of urban microclimates (e.g., Asawa et al., 2008;
    Chen, Kusaka, et al., 2011), and when parameterizing stomatal conductance models
    using crown absorbed radiation. To this end, combining whole-tree transpiration
    and leaf area density measurements from laser scanning systems (LiDAR) is considered
    a promising approach. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Mr. Katsuya Shimizu (Toyota Biotechnology
    and Afforestation Laboratory) for arranging the measurements. This work was supported
    in part by a research grant from the Organization for Landscape and Urban Green
    Infrastructure. APPENDIX A ET estimation proceeded in the following manner. Divide
    the time-series data of W* into sufficiently short-duration records to address
    stomatal response, typically less than a half hour based on Vico, Manzoni, Palmroth,
    and Katul (2011). There is some arbitrariness associated with the purpose and
    accuracy of the apparatus. We believe the relative error of ET estimation should
    be less than ~20% to compare previous measurements based on other methods. Both
    the typical energy imbalance rate of eddy covariance and the coefficient of variation
    of stand-scale transpiration estimated from enough sample size sap flow sensors
    are considered to be ~20% (Kume et al., 2010; Wilson et al., 2002). Thus, we adopted
    20 min, N = 1200, to satisfy these criteria. Discard the records when Irr or precipitation
    was observed. For every record, fit linear regression lines using the least squares
    method to detrend and then estimate Neff from Equations 4 and 5, using the Yule–Walker
    method assuming Gaussian noise. Afterward, determine the centre values of W (here,
    Δt = 601 s) from regression lines and calculate SE of W from Neff and the residual
    sum of squares. Quantify ranges of diurnal patterns of ΔW for every month. Records
    that deviate by more than three interquartiles from the 75th or 25th percentile
    of the diurnal sequence are discarded as outliers. This three-interquartile rule
    is the same as Tukey''s box–whisker plot. Calculate higher moments, skewness,
    and kurtosis for every record from the residuals of regressions. Records for which
    residuals are markedly different from the Gaussian distribution are “flagged”
    (again, there is some arbitrariness; here, records for which the absolute value
    of skewness >1 or kurtosis >8 were flagged). The SE calculated in (c) can detect
    only noise for which lengths are less than one record, which is mainly from εw.
    In contrast, the higher moment test (e) tests the assumption of linearity (steady-state
    condition in a record) and the effect of low-frequency noise, which is mainly
    from D and EWC. The steady-state assumption is violated not only by noise but
    also by rapid change of stomatal aperture in a record. Therefore, we discarded
    continuous flagged records before and after rain or irrigation, and only flagged
    records under normal conditions. Calculate daily ET as the sum of ΔW of each record
    over a day. When discarded records constituted >20% of the day, daily ET was discarded.
    We did not interpolate discarded or missing records. REFERENCES Citing Literature

    PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Street and garden trees in urban areas are often exposed
    to advection of strong vapour pressure deficit (VPD) air that can raise the whole-tree
    transpiration rate (ET), known as the oasis effect. However, urban trees tend
    to have small soil volume compared with natural conditions, and so they are believed
    to strongly regulate stomata. ET characteristics of such urban trees have not
    been well understood because of a lack of reliable measurement methods. Therefore,
    we propose a novel weighing lysimeter method and investigate the whole-tree water
    balance of an isolated container-grown Zelkova serrata to examine (a) which biotic
    and abiotic factors determine ET and (b) which spatial and temporal information
    is needed to predict ET under urban conditions. Whole-tree water balance and environmental
    conditions were measured from 2010 to 2012. Although leaf area substantially increased
    in the study period, daily ET did not vary much. ET increased with VPD almost
    linearly in 2010 but showed saturation in 2011 and 2012. Root water uptake lagged
    ET by 40 min in 2012. These results suggest that the small planter box interfered
    with root growth and that hydraulic supply capacities did not increase sufficiently
    to support leaf area increase. From analysis of water balance, we believe that
    neglecting soil drought effects on street trees without irrigation in Japan will
    overestimate ET over 4–5 sunny days at the longest. This is unlike previous studies
    of forest. 1 INTRODUCTION Transpiration is an essential factor for water and energy
    balance between soil, plant, and atmosphere. Regarding urban trees, the environmental
    benefits of tree microclimate effects on human thermal comfort and health constitute
    a sustainable means for mitigating the urban thermal environment (Architectural
    Institute of Japan, 2007; Oke, 1987; Olgyay, 1963). To realize individual-specific
    irrigation management and design of more effective green space, quantitative knowledge
    of the whole-tree transpiration rate ET under characteristic urban conditions
    is necessary. Isolated trees such as street and garden trees are often exposed
    to advection of strong vapour pressure deficit (VPD) air compared with those in
    the forest. Such increase of evapotranspiration is the so-called oasis or leading-edge
    effect (Kanda, 2007; Oke, 1987; see also Mackay, Ewers, Loranty, & Kruger, 2010
    and its references to studies in the forest). Several urban meteorologists have
    claimed that trees in an urban environment may have higher transpiration rates
    than in the forest because of the oasis effect (Hagishima, Narinta, & Tanimoto,
    2007; Moriwaki & Kanda, 2004; Spronken-Smith, Oke, & Lowry, 2000). Moreover, an
    isolated tree is readily impacted by radiation and wind, which affects its photosynthesis
    rate, leaf temperature, and boundary layer thickness. These effects may increase
    ET. On the contrary, several plant ecophysiologists have reported that urban trees
    tend to vigorously regulate stomata because of drought stress from strong VPD,
    limited water supply and rooting space, and strong soil compaction (e.g., Cregg,
    1995; Kagotani et al., 2015; Kjelgren & Clark, 1993; McCarthy & Pataki, 2010;
    Osone et al., 2014). Clearly, there is some discrepancy of findings. Thus, to
    address the relative importance and interactions between biotic and abiotic effects
    on ET, long-term measurement under a range of conditions is required. Quantitative
    characteristics of urban tree ET have not been sufficiently clarified because
    of a lack of reliable measurement methods. Porometer, sap flow, and lysimeter
    methods have mainly been used for estimating ET in studies. The porometer method
    essentially targets the measurement of single-leaf transpiration. Scaling up from
    leaf transpiration to ET can cause errors because of errors in leaf area estimation,
    differences in leaf characteristics, and microclimate in the crown. This method,
    therefore, must be validated using other accurate methods (Leverenz et al., 1982;
    Mcdermitt, 1990). The sap flow methods are frequently used for studying whole-tree
    and stand-scale water use (Granier, 1987; Swanson & Whitfield, 1981). However,
    sap flow velocity measured at breast height can be delayed from actual ET by a
    few hours (e.g., Saugier, Granier, Pontailler, Dufrene, & Baldocchi, 1997). In
    addition, such methods tend to underestimate ET when using long-term measurements,
    owing to the change of xylem thermal properties caused by wounds of sensor installation
    (Moore, Bond, Jones, & Meinzer, 2010; Swanson & Whitfield, 1981; Wullschleger,
    Childs, King, & Hanson, 2011). Furthermore, the very widely used Granier''s thermal
    dissipation sensor (Granier, 1987) is known to be sensitive to environmental radiation
    and temperature (Lu, Urban, & Zhao, 2004; Oren, Phillips, et al, 1999); this can
    be problematic in measurement of isolated (i.e., urban) trees under hot summer
    conditions. The lysimeter method quantifies ET using weighing or drainage lysimeters.
    This is considered the most reliable method for small plants but has limits for
    tall trees because of large errors from wind when measuring in outdoor environments
    with high temporal resolution (Edwards, 1986; Lorite, Santos, Teti, & Fereres,
    2012). Asawa et al. (2012, in Japanese) and Asawa, Hoyano, Shimizu, et al. (2014,
    in Japanese) developed a novel weighing lysimeter that gives a sufficiently accurate
    estimate of hourly ET for a tall tree; they reported results from summer 2010.
    In the present study, we show that this lysimeter approach is capable of measuring
    over years and examines quantitative and process information of interseasonal/interannual
    changes of ET and whole-tree water balance under characteristic urban conditions.
    Although sap flow measurement studies in urban areas have gradually increased
    (Chen, Zhang, & Ewers, 2012; Chen, Zhang, et al., 2011; Litvak, McCarthy, & Pataki,
    2011, 2012; McCarthy & Pataki, 2010; McCarthy, Pataki, & Jenerette, 2011; Pataki,
    McCarthy, Litvak, & Pincetl, 2011; Peters, McFadden, & Montgomery, 2010), whole-tree
    water balance and quantitative interaction between ET and soil moisture have rarely
    been reported. This is because it is not easy to measure rooting space or amounts
    of infiltration and leakage, owing to artificial obstacles such as pavement. Therefore,
    we studied urban tree transpiration using an isolated container-grown tree exposed
    to advection of high-VPD air and grown in shallow soil. The questions addressed
    in the present study are as follows: (a) Which biotic and abiotic factors determine
    ET under characteristic urban conditions and, in particular, how does VPD affect
    ET in relation to other factors? (Buckley, 2005; Oren, Phillips, et al., 1999;
    Sperry & Love, 2015) (b) What spatial and temporal information is needed to predict
    ET? These questions are especially important to the recent development of numerical
    simulations of urban microclimates (e.g., Asawa, Hoyano, & Nakaohkubo, 2008; Chen,
    Kusaka, et al., 2011; Vico, Revelli, & Porporato, 2014) for determining which
    factors should be treated precisely and which can be simplified. To overcome the
    limitation of the lysimeter method and address the effects of biotic and abiotic
    factors on ET, we propose a data quality control protocol for continuous long-term
    measurement to remove noise from wind and other factors. Such a protocol for the
    lysimeter method is not well established relative to other methods based on eddy
    covariance or sap flow (e.g., Oishi, Hawthorne, & Oren, 2016; Vickers & Mahrt,
    1997). Many lysimeter studies used a simple moving average or Savitzky–Golay filter,
    but such smoothing filters are mere graphical techniques and not justified in
    quantitative analysis (Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling, & Flannery, 1996) because
    the reliability of filtered values is never evaluated. Alternatively, we used
    time-series statistics to quantify uncertainty of estimated ET. 2 MATERIALS AND
    METHODS 2.1 Study site and plant material The study site was an experimental field
    with an open area of 8,800 m2 in the city of Miyoshi, Aichi Prefecture, Japan
    (35°8′N, 137°6′E). There were no obstacles within 40 m of the sample tree, except
    for several container-grown trees of ~5-m height. Distances between these trees
    were >4 m, so they could easily receive solar radiation and airflow. This may
    be regarded as an isolated condition. The sample tree used for measurement was
    a 13 year-old Zelkova serrata (Figure 1). Z. serrata is the third most popular
    species of street tree (National Institute for Land and Infrastructure Management,
    2014), and there are three prefectures and 79 cities in Japan that have established
    it as the “city''s symbol tree.” The height and trunk diameter in 2010 were 6.4
    m and 11 cm, respectively. We did not measure leaf area routinely but measured
    using a terrestrial-laser scanning system (LiDAR; VZ-400, RIEGL, Horn, Austria)
    in the summers of 2010 and 2012. Total leaf area and the leaf area index (LAI)
    on September 3, 2010, were 13.2 m2 and 2.1 m2/m2, respectively (Asawa, Hoyano,
    Oshio, et al., 2014), which were estimated using the voxel-based canopy profiling
    method (Hosoi & Omasa, 2006; Oshio, Asawa, Hoyano, & Miyasaka, 2015). The Z. serrata
    tree was planted in a large planter box of area 1 m2 and depth 0.6 m; box volume
    was determined on the basis of the size of a general street tree (Ministry of
    Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of Japan, 2005). Leaf pruning was
    done to reduce transpiration and compensate for lost root systems in advance of
    transplanting to the planter box. Root-zone depth was 50 cm, and the soil was
    composed of Kanto loam (70%), perlite (20%), and leaf mould (10%). Kanto loam
    is widely used for arboriculture in Japan because of its strong permeability and
    large water-holding capacity. In general, it has aggregated structures, strong
    porosity, and high saturated hydraulic conductivity (Chang, Kato, & Okazaki, 1994;
    Kaihotsu, Tanaka, & Okahashi, 1981). We took photos of the Z. serrata once every
    few months to check the tree and apparatus conditions, finding that the leaf area
    slightly decreased in 2011 but strongly increased in 2012 (Figure 1). No breakages
    or diseases were found in the Z. serrata during the measurement period. Figure

    (right) August 30, 2012. Ultrasonic anemometer was set on the right side of the
    tree; distance from the tree was 4.3 m 2.2 Meteorological measurement Meteorological
    conditions were measured in the northern part of the experimental field, using
    a solar radiometer (MS-402, Eko Instruments, Tokyo, Japan), air temperature sensor
    (4 wires Pt100Ω, Taiyo Keki, Tokyo, Japan) with ventilation (Model 43502, R.M.
    Young Co., Traverse, MI, USA), relative humidity sensor (CS215, Campbell Scientific,
    Logan, UT, USA), tipping bucket gauge (TE525MM, Campbell Scientific), 3-D ultrasonic
    anemometer (Model 81000, R.M. Young Co.), and photosynthetically active radiation
    (PAR) sensor (LI-190, Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). To analyse the effects of
    wind on lysimeter measurement, the anemometer was located 4.3 m from the Z. serrata
    (Figure 1). This location was determined to be as close as possible to the tree
    while minimizing its effect on the wind measurement. The height of the anemometer
    was 4 m, nearly the same as the centre of the tree crown. The measurement was
    done from August 2010 to September 2012. In the summer seasons, short-term and
    intensive measurements of transpiration, leaf area, and heat balance were conducted.
    In those periods, irrigation was stopped for two to four successive days to ascertain
    the effects of drought stress and so as not to damage on tree growth. All measurement
    data were checked every month for any missing data, spike noises, or physically
    unrealistic values. 2.3 Design of weighing lysimeter The measurement was done
    to obtain ET datasets under various meteorological and leaf-on (or leaf-off) conditions
    over the years. The weighing lysimeter, therefore, was designed and set up to
    be adaptable to long-term measurement. The total weight of the tree, planter box,
    and soil was ~1,000 kg, so a platform weighing machine using load cells (CAPS4-1500LL-I,
    Sartorius AG, Göttingen, Germany) was used. Site calibration was performed on
    the weighing machine. In advance of the measurement, we believed that the weighing
    accuracy should be ±100 g/hr, because the assumed ET was ~1 kg/hr. Although nominal
    accuracy of the weighing machine was 250 g (maximum weight 1,500 kg; accuracy
    1/6,000), we confirmed that relative sensitivity to weight change measured by
    the weighing machine was <100 g. Figure 2 shows in detail the weighing lysimeter
    apparatus and its dimensions. When designing the lysimeter with the required accuracy,
    the following characteristics were considered and introduced. (a) The tree and
    planter box should not contact the measurement apparatus, irrigation, and drainage
    systems, all of which were placed near the tree. Only a few cables for measurement
    sensors were connected between the planter box and measurement apparatus. (b)
    These cables were set to slacken for removing tension that might affect weight
    values. (c) To prevent the tree from falling down under strong wind, two steel
    support arms were placed around the trunk but had no contact with the trunk. These
    arms did not touch the trunk even with wind speeds ~10 m/s. (d) The weighing machine
    and planter box were both covered by a shed to protect them from wind, rainfall,
    and solar radiation. Air temperature inside the shed was continuously monitored,
    and its side door was frequently opened for air ventilation. Figure 2 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Section of weighing lysimeter. Asterisk indicates noncontact
    setting 2.4 Irrigation regime and water balance measurement All water balances
    were controlled by an automated irrigation system, because quantitative measurement
    of rainfall on the planter box was very difficult, and the study focused on the
    relationship between ET and water balance under irrigated conditions. Water was
    automatically irrigated on the upper surface of the soil at midnight, from 0:00
    to 1:00 each day. Irrigation water was stored once in a tank in a predetermined
    amount and supplied from the tank to the surface by gravity. Drainage occurred
    immediately after irrigation and nearly ceased within about four hours before
    morning, when transpiration began. The planter box was made of stainless steel
    of 2-mm thickness, and its bottom had a slope of 1/100. Pumice was laid on the
    bottom 10 cm of the box for smooth drainage. Volumetric soil water content θ was
    measured at depths of 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 cm by amplitude-domain reflectometry
    sensors (Thetaprobe ML2x, Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK). Matric potential Ψ
    was calculated from measured θ and soil water retention (θ–Ψ) curves. Undisturbed
    soil samples of 100 cc were collected from all layers near the amplitude-domain
    reflectometry sensors and used to measure water retention curves in the laboratory
    via centrifuge and pressure-plate methods. Amounts of irrigation and drainage
    were measured by flowmeter (ND10-NATAAA, Aichitokei, Nagoya, Japan) and tipping
    bucket-type rain gauges (TE525-L25, Campbell Scientific), respectively. Stemflow
    was trapped at the middle of the trunk and measured by rain gauge (UIZ-TB500,
    UIZIN, Tokyo, Japan), so the water did not flow into the soil. Soil evaporation
    ES was restricted by a cover sheet on the planter box, but air was continuously
    supplied to the soil surface in order not to interfere with soil respiration.
    Ventilation rate, temperature, and relative humidity of both inflow and outflow
    air at the surface were measured so that ES was estimated by absolute humidity
    change. We confirmed that ES was <150 g/day in summer 2010. Meteorological, sample
    tree weight, and water balance data were recorded on a data logger (C-CR10000,
    Campbell Scientific). The weighing machine and anemometer were synchronized, and
    data recorded at 1 Hz. Other meteorological conditions and water balance were
    recorded every 1 and 10 min, respectively. 2.5 Calculation of water balance To
    estimate ET, measured weight data was resolved into each origin of weight change.
    That change and whole-tree water balance can be expressed by (1) (2) where W is
    sample weight (sum of tree, soil, and planter box) and W* its measured value.
    εw is wind load, εo represents other error terms such as dew and litterfall, ET
    is whole-tree transpiration, ES is soil evaporation, Irr is irrigation, D is drainage,
    Int is crown interception, and EWC is wet-crown evaporation and throughfall. ES,
    Irr, and D were directly identified by the measurements. In estimating ET, larger
    parts of the noise are from εw and measurement errors of Irr and D on sunny days,
    and εw, Int, and EWC on rainy days. The effects of Irr and Int can be easily removed
    by discarding data during irrigation or rain, but εw, D, and EWC need special
    treatments, which are addressed later. Dew was not problematic because it was
    small except during winter, and Z. serrata is a deciduous species. We did not
    quantify litterfall from W,* but it was confirmed independently. In August 2012,
    we clipped all leaves from Z. serrata, which was nearly the same size as a lysimeter-grown
    one, finding a wet weight ~5.8 kg/tree. We believe it is reasonable to ignore
    the effects of litterfall in estimating daily ET in the predefoliation period.
    Soil water balance was considered to address the root water uptake rate. When
    soil water movement is expressed in integral form and ES is negligible, it becomes
    similar to Equation 2: (3) where ρ is water density, v is soil volume, and ET′
    is whole-tree root water uptake. ET′ nearly equals ET at daily scale but is delayed
    at diurnal scale. When Irr and D are negligible, soil water change (−ρvdθ/dt)
    = ET′. Such a condition is feasible when irrigation is stopped and θ drops below
    field capacity. 2.6 Statistical analysis for ET estimation All statistical analyses
    were performed using R 3.2.4 software (R Development Core Team, 2016). Raw data
    of W* in 2010 recorded at 1 Hz are shown in Figure 3. On ordinary days, W* increased
    at night from Irr and decreased during daytime from ET. The inset of Figure 3
    illustrates W* and its linear trend (regression line) around noon on August 17.
    The negative trend indicates the effect of ET, and there is clearly a strong time-series
    autocorrelation between the residuals, which can be attributed to swaying of the
    tree from εw. The lack of independence of observations often causes fatal error
    in estimating standard error (SE) and statistical hypothesis testing (von Storch
    & Zwiers, 1999). Therefore, we estimated the time between effectively independent
    observations T0 to correct SE of W. Effective sample size Neff and T0 can be calculated
    according to Trenberth (1984): (4) (5) where N is the number of observations and
    rL is the autocorrelation coefficient at lag L. We estimated Neff, ET, and higher
    moments of W* every 20 min and calculated daily ET as their sum. Details of the
    calculation are presented in the Appendix. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Example of observed sample weight (W*) data, from August 10 to 21, 2010, recorded
    at 1 Hz. Irrigation was stopped after August 18. Inset shows data around noon
    on August 17. Autocorrelation is clear around 12:35 3 RESULTS First, we show results
    regarding measurement accuracy of the lysimeter method and then review daily ET
    and monthly water balance throughout the study period to understand how ET changed
    seasonally and annually. Finally, to reveal reasons for changes of ET characteristics,
    we show interannual variations of diurnal ET and root water uptake. 3.1 Performances
    of ET estimation and quality control Table 1 shows Neff and descriptive statistics
    of W* for growing seasons (May–October of the 3 years). Neff, standard deviation,
    and kurtosis increased, and the absolute value of skewness decreased together
    with wind speed. No clear interannual trend was found, which supports that our
    lysimeter performed well throughout the measurement period. Figure 4 shows the
    diurnal pattern of characteristic days to confirm the performance of ET estimation.
    The error bars show 2 SE (~95% confidence interval); and black circles, deviation
    from a Gaussian distribution. Neff roughly correlated with wind speed and was
    <200 (1/6 of N), which means that SE increased about twofold to threefold with
    consideration of Neff. Figure 4a,d shows the result on a sunny irrigation day;
    there was strong fluctuation of weight change (−ΔW/Δt), but the error bars were
    small, which indicate that considering these data as ET is relatively reliable.
    This –ΔW/Δt correlated well with solar radiation Rs. On a windy day (Figure 4b,e),
    there was also large fluctuation, but this could easily be distinguished from
    ET by large error bars, which were corrected by Neff. From a physical perspective,
    there was no correspondence between –ΔW/Δt and evaporation drivers (radiation
    and wind). From a biological perspective, we could not find any reason for large
    –ΔW/Δt fluctuation, especially after sunset. Therefore, the judgement that these
    data are suspicious from data quality criteria appears reasonable. Furthermore,
    on a rainy day (Figure 4c,f), the higher moment test and error bars revealed a
    suspicious –ΔW/Δt before and after the rain. This large –ΔW/Δt can be attributed
    to EWC. Moreover, it is well known that tipping bucket rain gauges have errors
    and a time lag because of their measurement mechanism. Therefore, the negative
    value of –ΔW/Δt (i.e., increase of W*) before the time of rain observation is
    considered Int. The higher moment test provided quantitative criteria to assess
    how many records should be discarded as EWC or Int. In this case, we discarded
    two records before and after the rain. Table 1. Effective sample size (Neff) and

    19, 2011 3.2 Environmental conditions Daily environmental data from August 2010
    through September 2012 are shown in Figure 5. Although the summer solstice is
    in late June, Rs and VPD in that month were small because of the normal rainy
    season in Japan (according to Japan Meteorological Agency [JMA], 2008, mean precipitation
    in June and July was 300 mm, accounting for 1/5 the yearly total). Summer 2010
    was extremely hot and dry all over the country, and mean air temperature Ta was
    the highest in the past 113 years (JMA, 2010). Our study site was on the Pacific
    side of Japan (as is Tokyo), and the duration of sunny days in Tokyo in summer
    2010 was the second longest since 1968 (JMA, 2012). Furthermore, at the study
    site, late August and early September 2010 were the hottest and driest of the
    study period. Maximum Ta was 38°C, and the maximum VPD was 4.5 kPa. The longest
    stretch of sunny days in 2010 was 18, from August 21 through September 7. We irrigated
    about 30–50 kg/m2 (soil) daily, determined using ET of preceding days, which was
    sufficient to compensate daily transpiration loss. We believe that ample irrigation
    was not problematic, because the excess of water over field capacity was soon
    discharged. We irrigated almost every day during the growing season but ran a
    dry-down experiment several times. According to Rodriguez-Iturbe and Porporato
    (2007), plants typically begin to close stomata when soil Ψ declines by 0.03 MPa
    and almost completely close with a decrease of ~3 MPa. Over our measurement period,
    mean θ from 5- to 45-cm depths remained >36.6% vol. (Ψ = −0.03 MPa), except for
    dry-down periods. On August 26, 2010, we found that mean soil Ψ was less than
    −2.5 MPa, but ET remained 14.4 kg/day. On this day, Ψ at 35- and 45-cm depths
    was −1.92 and −0.72 MPa, respectively (data not shown). Figure 5 Open in figure

    vol., which correspond to soil matric potential Ψ = −0.03 and −3 MPa, respectively.
    Shaded areas in bottom panel represent missing or discarded days 3.3 Seasonal
    changes of ET and whole-tree water balance Daily ET is shown at the bottom of
    Figure 5. ET reached 35 kg/day in mid-August 2010, but in 2011 and 2012, yearly
    maximum ET was 28.4 and 27.1 kg/day, respectively. Seasonal patterns of ET were
    evident, but the times of ET stopping and starting (foliation and defoliation)
    varied between the years. ET approached zero in mid-November 2010 and early October
    2011. Atmospheric conditions after September were not very different between the
    2 years (Figure 5). ET became positive and gradually increased in April 2011,
    but in 2012, it suddenly increased between late April and early May. For example,
    ET = 12.5 kg/day and Rs = 24.5 MJ/m2 day on May 2, 2011, whereas ET = 23.3 kg/day
    and Rs = 18.4 MJ/m2 day on May 1, 2012. The monthly water balance components of
    the Z. serrata and availability of ET are summarized in Figure 6. We halted measurements
    once in September 2011 because of a typhoon (Roke; the typhoon no. 15 in Japan)
    and did not interpolate discarded or missing records, so a large imbalance was
    found in this period. The mean ratio of available ET to Irr in the growing season
    was 69%, with a range of 32–123%. Because large portions of Irr were discharged
    as D in October 2010 and May 2012 and θ was nearly constant at ~60% vol. (Figure
    5). we consider this value the field capacity of the soil. Figure 6 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Monthly water balances and available ET. Components are irrigation
    (Irr), drainage (D), whole-tree transpiration (ET), and change of soil water storage
    (ΔS). Available ET represents ratio of nonmissing or discarded days 3.4 Biotic
    and abiotic control on ET The data obtained for Ta < 20°C roughly corresponded
    to no-leaf periods when ET was near zero (Figure 5). We visibly confirmed this
    by photos of the Z. serrata. Because we did not measure leaf area routinely and
    generally the times of foliation and defoliation are controlled by temperature
    (Jones, 2014), we used Ta as an index of leaf area condition. The major results
    of the following analyses did not differ from this 20°C criterion when we varied
    it from 15°C to 25°C. In general, VPD and Rs are the primary drivers of transpiration,
    but their relative importance depends on the magnitude of canopy coupling with
    the atmosphere (Jarvis & McNaughton, 1986). Thus, daily ET responses to atmospheric
    drivers (daily total Rs, mean daytime VPD, and wind speed) were analysed (Figure
    7). There was the strongest correlation between ET and VPD throughout the study
    period (R = .80), but after filtering out days on which daily mean Ta was <20°C,
    VPD and Rs showed almost the same correlations with ET (R = .63 in both cases).
    Wind speed had no clear effect on ET (R = .21). Because ET appeared to respond
    to VPD nonlinearly in 2011 and 2012, we used various regression models to test
    the significance of interannual differences in the slopes of VPD and Rs (differences
    of βi in ET = βi VPD or ET = βi Rs) and nonlinearity of VPD (ET = α + β lnVPD),
    as summarized in Table 2. A minimum Akaike''s information criterion value was
    found in the log-transformed VPD model with interannual difference (ET = αi +
    βi lnVPD). The regression lines and their 95% confidence intervals of that model
    are shown in Figure 8. The intercepts (α; mean ET at VPD = 1 kPa) increased with
    the year (Table 2). Although the SE of slope (β) of log-transformed VPD was large,
    β2010 was clearly larger than other years and SE ranges did not overlap (Table
    2). Modelled mean ET in 2011 and 2012 was nearly identical when VPD was >1.3 kPa.

    an interannual comparison of diurnal ET. To address the effect of root water uptake
    ET′, August 18, 2010 (Figure 9a,c) and July 4, 2012 (Figure 9b,d) were selected
    because they were during dry-down periods and mean θ was less than field capacity.
    That is, Irr and D were negligible and changes of soil water content (−dθ/dt)
    may be regarded as ET′ in Equation 3 (daily mean soil Ψ = −0.09 MPa on both days).
    Daily total Rs values were nearly equal (24.3 and 23.6 MJ/day), but maximum VPD
    and ET were substantially different between the 2 days. Times of maxima of all
    variables (ET, −Δθ/Δt Rs and VPD) were around 12:00–15:00 on both days, and only
    diurnal ET in 2012 displayed a bimodal pattern (Figure 9b). Cross-correlations
    of Rs, VPD, and –Δθ/Δt with ET on these days are shown in Figure 10. On August
    18, 2010, ET peaked 20 min earlier than VPD and had no time lag with Rs or –Δθ/Δt
    (Figure 10a). However, on July 4, 2012, ET preceded –Δθ/Δt by 40 min, peaked at
    the same time as VPD, and lagged Rs by 80 min (Figure 10b). The cross-correlation
    coefficients of VPD and Rs with ET were smaller in 2012 than in 2010. Figure 9

    4.1 ET responses to atmospheric drivers and leaf area change It is well known
    that wind has little effect on ET for coniferous trees, but this tendency is not
    always valid for broadleaf trees (see the review of Komatsu, 2003). Z. serrata
    is a broadleaf species, but the effect of wind speed was not clear (Figure 7c).
    This result suggests that leaves of the Z. serrata were strongly coupled to the
    atmosphere; that is, boundary layer resistance was weak, leaf temperature was
    close to Ta, and ET was mainly controlled by stomata (Jarvis & McNaughton, 1986).
    This is probably because the sample Z. serrata was in an isolated condition. Daily
    ET of the Z. serrata on sunny days in the growing season was about 25–30 kg/day
    (Figure 5). This is comparable to previous reports of ground-planted orchards
    (Green, 1993; Green, Clothier, Caspari, & Neal, 2002) that have similar tree size
    and environments (isolated condition, daily Rs ~ 20 MJ/m2 and moist soil). Green
    (1993) reported an isolated walnut tree (3.5 m in height, 26.4 m2 in leaf area)
    transpired 40 kg/day on a sunny day, and Green et al. (2002) reported that olives
    (4 m in height, 13.5 m2 in leaf area) planted at 4 × 6 m intervals transpired
    175 kg/week. However, this does not necessarily mean that the Z. serrata was free
    from drought stress. As shown in Figure 1, its leaf area substantially increased
    from 2010 to 2012, but ET did not increase (Figure 5). There are three possible
    reasons for this. First, VPD maximized in summer 2010; second, mutual shading
    of increased leaves dampened ET increase; third, the small planter box interfered
    with root growth, and hydraulic supply capacities did not increase sufficiently
    to support the leaf area increase. The nonlinear response of ET to VPD and its
    interannual difference (Figures 7a and 8) are believed to correspond to Oren,
    Sperry, et al. (1999), who showed that the sensitivity of stomatal conductance
    to VPD is general over a wide range of plants. According to Oren et al., a plant
    with large stomatal conductance (thus large ET) at small VPD must strongly regulate
    stomata when VPD becomes large, because of hydraulic limits. This was true of
    the Z. serrata during the study period (Figure 8). Litvak et al. (2012) analysed
    ET characteristics of 121 urban trees using the same log-transformed VPD model
    as our study (ET = α + β lnVPD) and sap flow velocity data from their series of
    studies of the urban landscape of Los Angeles (Litvak et al., 2011; McCarthy &
    Pataki, 2010; McCarthy et al., 2011; Pataki et al., 2011). They reported that
    the ratio of β to α was constant among tree sizes and sites, corresponding to
    Oren, Sperry, et al. (1999), but it could differ by xylem vulnerability (unsaturated
    hydraulic conductance); the ratio range was 0.3–0.6. The β/α values of our Z.
    serrata were within this range during 2011 and 2012, but not in 2010 (Table 2;
    β/α ~ .8 in 2010). This means that the Z. serrata in 2010 was relatively insensitive
    to drought stress, possibly because the low ratio of leaf to root area from pruning-enhanced
    hydraulic conductance. The implications of the findings shown in Figures 9 and
    10 are that the Z. serrata became more conservative regarding ET during the 2
    years, not only at daily scale but also at the diurnal one. The 40-min delay of
    water transport from soil to leaves in 2012 supports the hypothesis that the hydraulic
    capacities did not increase sufficiently, because if this were so, the increase
    of leaf area would reduce hydraulic conductance per leaf area. Increase of evaporative
    demand (by increase of the ratio of leaf to root area) leads to more negative
    water potential in plant tissues. Large negative water potential generates cavitation
    and embolism and decreases the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in apoplastic
    pathways (Sperry & Love, 2015; Tyree & Zimmermann, 2002). This is the likely reason
    for the delay of water transport in 2012. Some researchers reported that a too
    great VPD decreases ET, a so-called apparent feed-forward response of stomata
    to humidity (e.g., Monteith, 1995). The bimodal diurnal ET pattern (Figure 9b)
    and 80-min lag between ET and Rs found in 2012 (Figure 10b) indicate this phenomenon.
    The leaf-to-atmosphere VPD of the Z. serrata might have maximized around midday
    in 2012 because of the peak in Rs (Figure 9b and 9d). According to Duursma et
    al. (2014), the apparent feed-forward response can be explained by increased cuticle
    transpiration, generation of cavitation, or peak response of photosynthesis to
    temperature. Because we did not measure physiological conditions of the Z. serrata
    precisely, we cannot examine the influences of the above factors, but the increase
    of leaf area could be attributed to all three. 4.2 Phenological aspects Figure
    5 shows obvious interannual differences of ET in spring. This result is probably
    because of interannual differences in the times of foliation, but the reason for
    this phenological change is unclear. In general, the foliation time is believed
    to be mainly controlled by temperature (Jones, 2014). However, in our results,
    Ta of preceding periods were not very different between years (mean Ta in April
    was 12.2°C in 2011 and 13.1°C in 2012). Recently, through chamber experiments
    using cuttings of some woody species, Laube, Sparks, Estrella, and Menzel (2014)
    showed that drought stress can delay bud development. Thus, one of the possible
    reasons for the interannual phenological difference of the Z. serrata is change
    of leaf area and hypothetical hydraulic limits. Throughout the study period, the
    discrepancy between the strong correlation of ET with VPD (Figure 7a) and weak
    correlation of ET with Rs (Figure 7b) might be explained by the time of foliation/defoliation.
    The data obtained for Ta < 20°C roughly correspond to no-leaf periods. Rs can
    be large even at Ta < 20°C, because its seasonal change precedes Ta by a few months
    (Figure 5). However, atmospheric VPD must be small at low Ta, because VPD is directly
    determined by temperature. This means that there are VPD–Ta–leaf area–ET correlations
    at seasonal scale. The strong correlation of ET with VPD throughout the seasons
    (Figure 7a) was believed to be not only the result of the direct relationship
    between vapour diffusion and its driver but also the effect of leaf area as a
    confounding factor. 4.3 Spatial and temporal implications for predicting ET In
    warm periods (Ta > 20°C), the linear response of daily ET to Rs measured on a
    horizontal plane (Figure 7b) is interesting. In general, stomatal conductance
    saturates with strong PAR, as described elsewhere (e.g., Jarvis, 1976). It is
    also common that transpiration rates of a dense vegetation canopy increase almost
    linearly with radiation (Rs or net radiation Rn). This is because dense canopy
    transpiration can be well approximated by the equilibrium evaporation rate, that
    is, the evaporation rate under no advection (Jarvis & McNaughton, 1986). However,
    the Z. serrata measured herein was isolated and was thus believed to be far from
    equilibrium. A similar finding was reported in Pereira, Green, and Nova (2007),
    who showed that ET of irrigated orchards and an isolated walnut tree, including
    various ranges of LAI, could be effectively expressed by the equation of Priestley
    and Taylor (1972) pertaining to Rn measured above grass. This linear response
    might be explained by the interactive effect between mutual shading of leaves
    and saturation of stomatal conductance with PAR, as described in Sellers (1985).
    This linearization is especially effective for plants that have a large LAI, such
    as conifers. The LAI of the Z. serrata in our study was small (2.1 in September
    2010), and it appears that the linear tendency in Pereira et al. (2007) did not
    depend strongly on LAI. One hypothesis is that 3-D radiation transfer in the crown
    affected the results; we will examine this in future studies. If one wants to
    keep ET maximum to obtain environmental benefits of Z. serrata, given that field
    capacity of the soil is 60% vol. and Z. serrata begins to close stomata around
    Ψ = −0.03 MPa (θ = 36.6% vol.), the Z. serrata can use at most 500 kg/container
    * (60.0–36.6)% = 117 kg water. Because daily ET on sunny days in the growing season
    was about 25–30 kg/day (Figure 5). it follows that the Z. serrata used the threshold
    amount in about 4–5 days at the longest, if there was no irrigation. Because the
    soil type and planter box volume of the Z. serrata were determined according to
    the general street tree in Japan as mentioned above, this estimation suggests
    that street trees without irrigation may experience frequent drought stress as
    reported in plant ecophysiology studies. It is often assumed in the study of forest
    transpiration in Japan that soil drought in the shallow layer is negligible (e.g.,
    Komatsu, Kang, Kume, Yoshifuji, & Hotta, 2006; Kosugi et al., 2007; Kumagai, Tateishi,
    Shimizu, & Otsuki, 2008), because deep roots and water supply from the water table
    facilitate a large available water capacity (Zhang, Dawes, & Walker, 2001). From
    our estimates, neglect of soil drought effects may be valid for street trees during
    the few days during and after rain, but it probably overestimates ET after four
    to five sunny days at the longest. The importance of the vertical root distribution
    for climatology and hydrology study is well known (Feddes et al., 2001), but,
    in general, the roots of street trees and container-grown trees grow uniformly
    compared with natural conditions (e.g., Gilman & Masters, 2010). On August 26,
    2010, we found that mean soil Ψ was below the wilting point (−2.5 MPa), but ET
    maintained ~50% of the amount on irrigated days (Figure 5; see also Fig. 6 of
    Asawa, Hoyano, Shimizu, et al., 2014, for diurnal change). This result indicates
    that to predict ET under soil drought conditions, the root distribution should
    be considered, even for the small and shallow soil used in the present study (0.5-m3
    and 50-cm depths). The time of water transport from soil to leaves is important
    when parameterizing stomatal conductance, because it causes strong bias, not only
    in the responses to atmospheric drivers but also in maximum conductance. This
    was discussed for 10- to 20-m-tall trees in other studies (Kumagai, Aoki, Otsuki,
    & Utsumi, 2009; Rayment, Loustau, & Jarvis, 2002; Ward, Bell, Clark, & Oren, 2012).
    Although the Z. serrata in our study was relatively small (6.4 m) and it is a
    ring-porous species with large conduits, root water uptake lagged ET by 40 min
    in 2012 (Figure 10). Using a steady-state hydraulic model (e.g., Buckley, 2005;
    Tuzet, Perrier, & Leuning, 2003) may be problematic in treating ET at less than
    hourly time scale. 5 CONCLUSIONS We propose a quality control protocol for continuous
    long-term lysimeter measurement and investigated whole-tree water balance of an
    isolated container-grown Z. serrata from 2010 to 2012, to acquire quantitative
    and process information of urban tree transpiration. We found time-series autocorrelation
    very important in observed weight data upon quantifying ET and its uncertainty,
    showing that our lysimeter method performed well throughout the 2-year study period.
    In response to the questions put in Section 1, (a) VPD was the most important
    factor among atmospheric drivers, and wind speed showed no clear correlation with
    daily ET. From an interannual comparison of diurnal ET and leaf area between 2010
    and 2012, we conclude that among biotic factors, leaf area is not the sole or
    primary factor that determines ET. These results suggest that we must consider
    the balance of leaf and root area for trees grown in small and shallow soil, such
    as street trees. (b) In warm periods, daily ET showed a linear response to daily
    Rs measured on a horizontal plane, suggesting the contribution of 3-D radiation
    transfer. For water balance, from our estimates, neglecting soil drought effects
    under no irrigation can overestimate ET after four to five sunny days at the longest,
    unlike prior studies of forest in Japan. When predicting soil drought effects,
    root area distribution should be considered, even for the small and shallow soil
    investigated herein (0.5-m3 and 50-cm depths). The delay of root water uptake
    with ET found in 2012 suggests that temporal resolution of the steady-state hydraulic
    model should be longer than 1 hr for studying trees of heights >6–7 m. Our findings
    depend somewhat on the growing conditions and species of the sample tree, so additional
    data are required to address general ET characteristics of urban trees. However,
    to our knowledge, this is the first report of interseasonal/interannual whole-tree
    water balance with urban, isolated, and small soil volume conditions. For measuring
    ET and parameterizing a stomatal conductance model of urban trees, the present
    findings will be valuable to determine which factors should be treated precisely
    and which can be simplified. One of the greatest differences between our experimental
    conditions and an actual urban area is the radiation environment. Urban trees
    are often shaded by surrounding buildings and receive long-wave radiation from
    them. Therefore, 3-D radiation environments should be considered when predicting
    ET in numerical simulations of urban microclimates (e.g., Asawa et al., 2008;
    Chen, Kusaka, et al., 2011), and when parameterizing stomatal conductance models
    using crown absorbed radiation. To this end, combining whole-tree transpiration
    and leaf area density measurements from laser scanning systems (LiDAR) is considered
    a promising approach. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Mr. Katsuya Shimizu (Toyota Biotechnology
    and Afforestation Laboratory) for arranging the measurements. This work was supported
    in part by a research grant from the Organization for Landscape and Urban Green
    Infrastructure. APPENDIX A ET estimation proceeded in the following manner. Divide
    the time-series data of W* into sufficiently short-duration records to address
    stomatal response, typically less than a half hour based on Vico, Manzoni, Palmroth,
    and Katul (2011). There is some arbitrariness associated with the purpose and
    accuracy of the apparatus. We believe the relative error of ET estimation should
    be less than ~20% to compare previous measurements based on other methods. Both
    the typical energy imbalance rate of eddy covariance and the coefficient of variation
    of stand-scale transpiration estimated from enough sample size sap flow sensors
    are considered to be ~20% (Kume et al., 2010; Wilson et al., 2002). Thus, we adopted
    20 min, N = 1200, to satisfy these criteria. Discard the records when Irr or precipitation
    was observed. For every record, fit linear regression lines using the least squares
    method to detrend and then estimate Neff from Equations 4 and 5, using the Yule–Walker
    method assuming Gaussian noise. Afterward, determine the centre values of W (here,
    Δt = 601 s) from regression lines and calculate SE of W from Neff and the residual
    sum of squares. Quantify ranges of diurnal patterns of ΔW for every month. Records
    that deviate by more than three interquartiles from the 75th or 25th percentile
    of the diurnal sequence are discarded as outliers. This three-interquartile rule
    is the same as Tukey''s box–whisker plot. Calculate higher moments, skewness,
    and kurtosis for every record from the residuals of regressions. Records for which
    residuals are markedly different from the Gaussian distribution are “flagged”
    (again, there is some arbitrariness; here, records for which the absolute value
    of skewness >1 or kurtosis >8 were flagged). The SE calculated in (c) can detect
    only noise for which lengths are less than one record, which is mainly from εw.
    In contrast, the higher moment test (e) tests the assumption of linearity (steady-state
    condition in a record) and the effect of low-frequency noise, which is mainly
    from D and EWC. The steady-state assumption is violated not only by noise but
    also by rapid change of stomatal aperture in a record. Therefore, we discarded
    continuous flagged records before and after rain or irrigation, and only flagged
    records under normal conditions. Calculate daily ET as the sum of ΔW of each record
    over a day. When discarded records constituted >20% of the day, daily ET was discarded.
    We did not interpolate discarded or missing records. REFERENCES Citing Literature

  relevance_evaluation: The provided paper is moderately relevant to the concept of
    using data quality to assess the performance of machine learning models for irrigation
    scheduling and management. It receives a relevance score of 0.6 because it evaluates
    the accuracy of the lysimeter method for estimating ET (evapotranspiration), a
    key component in irrigation management, and suggests a data quality control protocol
    for continuous long-term measurements. However, it does not directly address the
    specific point in the outline regarding the impact of data quality on the performance
    and robustness of machine learning models for irrigation scheduling and management.

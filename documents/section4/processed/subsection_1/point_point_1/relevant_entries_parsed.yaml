    based on graph attention mechanism][1]'
  data_sources: Open standard dataset
  explanation: The primary goal of this study is to introduce a method that leverages
    time series and multivariate characteristics to detect anomalies in building energy
    consumption. By constructing an anomaly detection framework using graph convolutional

    graph attention mechanism. The method can capture feature correlations among multiple
    feature variables and better achieve anomaly detection by calculating the attention
    coefficients between different time series features and assigning greater attention
    weights to the time series features with greater influence on energy consumption.
  extract_2: Experiments using an open standard dataset show that the proposed anomaly
    detection method outperforms existing methods in terms of detection accuracy.

    and mobile phones for self-reporting stress and mental health. The abstract states
    that physiological sensor data, phone usage data, and self-reported survey responses
    were collected from 201 participants over a month. The authors found that sensor
    features (e.g., skin conductance and skin temperature) showed better classification
    performance than phone features (e.g., call duration and frequency). Modifiable
    behavior features (e.g., number of naps and studying duration) also contributed
    to the classification of self-reported stress and mental health.

    sensors and mobile phones during a 1-month period was analyzed to examine the
    effectiveness of features derived from these data sources for identifying self-reported

    groups and 87% (41/47) accuracy for classifying high or low mental health groups.

  limitations: '1. Selection of a feature as discriminating between two categories
    does not mean it is an important feature or causative of that behavior.

    2. These results do not tell us the causality (eg, does a student sleep later
    and less regularly because of higher stress or have higher stress because of later
    or more irregular sleep?).

    3. Our participants were limited to Android phone users because we wanted to log
    detailed phone usage, which is not allowed by other phone systems such as iPhone.
    As about half of the undergraduate students were Android users on the campus,
    a selection bias might exist. A previous study showed slight differences in personality
    types and economic status between iPhone users and Android users.

    4. A total of 64% of our study population were male participants. It has been
    reported that females report higher perceived stress levels and more depressive
    symptoms, and there are gender differences in psychological and biological stress
    responses. In our dataset, the ratios of female participants in the high or low
    PSS and MCS groups were 45% and 20% (high and low PSS) and 22% and 54% (high and
    low MCS). Modeling stress and mental health differently in males and females might
    help understand the mechanism.

    State Based on Data Collected by Active Sensors with 3D-Accelerometer. In Distributed

  data_sources: Acceleration data from 3D-accelerometers
  explanation: The goal of this study was to develop a method to classify a calf's
    feeding state using data collected by active sensors with a 3D-accelerometer.
    The authors used a combination of data preprocessing techniques, feature extraction,
    and classification algorithms to achieve this goal. Specifically, they used a
    Kalman filter, moving average, and adaptive thresholding to clean and preprocess
    the data, and a modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic to segment the data into
    time intervals. They then extracted a set of features from each time interval
    and used a machine-learning algorithm to classify the intervals as either "feeding"
    or "not feeding".
  extract_1: '"The paper deals with the problem of time series classification for
    the feeding state of calves by means of features evaluated for acceleration real-time
    data sets."'
  extract_2: '"The proposed classification method has achieved a good recognition
    quality for the feeding state with a best overall accuracy of approximately 94%.
    Thus this methodology is useful in identifying the feeding state and we may expect
    the possibility to generalize it to the multi-state case as well."'
  inline_citation: (Sturm et al., 2017)

    into time intervals.
  limitations: One potential limitation of this study is that it was conducted on
    a relatively small number of animals. As such, the results may not be generalizable
    to a larger population of calves.
  main_objective: To develop a method to classify a calf's feeding state using data
    collected by active sensors with a 3D-accelerometer.

    the quality of the data. The results of the study show that the data cleaning
    techniques were effective in improving the accuracy of the classification algorithm,
    and that the modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic was particularly effective
    in segmenting the data into time intervals.

    divide gait time segments, the data is preprocessed using a low-pass filter, smoothing,
    and gait period segmentation. The study employs PCA to reduce the dimensionality
    of the input data, which improves efficiency without significantly compromising
    information. The SVM model is trained and optimized through parameter selection
    and 5-fold cross-validation to achieve high classification accuracy.
  extract_1: The study employs a low-pass filter with a normalized bandpass frequency
    of 0.1 to reduce the potential impact of high-frequency errors in the data. Smoothing
    is also applied using the moving average method to reduce periodic trends in the
    data.
  extract_2: The gait period is segmented by observing the pre-processed data of the
    acceleration modulus, which has two main peaks at each step of the period. The
    positions of the main peaks are marked as red circles, and the data is divided
    accordingly.

  key_findings: The proposed SVM-based gait classification algorithm using a foot-mounted
    IMU achieves high accuracy in classifying pedestrian actions. Data preprocessing
    techniques, including low-pass filtering, smoothing, and gait period segmentation,
    effectively reduce noise and improve data quality. PCA dimensionality reduction
    enhances efficiency while preserving essential information.
  limitations: The study does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness
    of the proposed data cleaning techniques on different types of IoT sensor data.
    Additionally, the study does not explore the use of more advanced machine learning
    techniques, such as deep learning, for real-time data cleaning.
  main_objective: To develop a pedestrian action recognition algorithm using a foot-mounted

    of ship and maritime data using meta learning. Applied Soft Computing, 101, 107048.
  explanation: 'The provided study focused on applying a meta-learning model to detect
    abnormal data from ship and maritime data using a data gap analysis framework
    that incorporated rule-based data imputation, clustering, denoising, and dimension
    reduction. This meta-learning model combined generalized additive models, gradient
    boosting regressors, and multivariate adaptive regression splines into one robust
    model.


    The paper''s primary objective was to ascertain the feasibility and effectiveness
    of using such a meta-learning model for data gap analysis in the context of real-time
    ship operation monitoring. Specifically, the authors sought to determine whether
    the meta-learning model could accurately and reliably identify abnormal data in
    ship performance factors, such as main engine fuel oil consumption, shaft revolution,
    and speed through water.


    They evaluated the performance of the meta-learning model against individual machine
    learning models, including generalized additive models, gradient boosting regressors,
    and multivariate adaptive regression splines, using various error measures such
    as mean absolute percentage error, relative root-mean-square error, and Nash–Sutcliffe
    efficiency coefficient. The results demonstrated that the meta-learning model
    outperformed individual machine learning models in terms of accuracy, robustness,
    and stability, particularly in the presence of noisy and incomplete data.


    By combining multiple machine learning models with different strengths and characteristics,
    the meta-learning model was able to capture complex and non-linear relationships
    within the ship and maritime data. It effectively identified abnormal data points
    that deviated significantly from normal operating patterns, enabling ship operators
    and engineers to make informed decisions regarding maintenance, repairs, or operational
    adjustments.'
  extract_1: '"With the recent increase in interest in the creation of accurate predictive
    models for ship performance, there has been an increase in studies applying various
    machine learning and statistical methods. Recently, studies were conducted on
    predicting the fuel consumption of ship engines using Gaussian processes [4] and
    neural networks [1], [5], [6], and research was conducted on forecasting ship
    performance using Lasso regression models [7] and decision tree models [8]. Comparative
    studies of various machine learning methods were also performed. Hu et al. [9]
    compared the backpropagation neural network and Gaussian process with and without
    considering the influence of marine environmental factors. Uyanik et al. [10]
    compared multiple linear regression, Ridge and Lasso regression, support vector
    regression, tree-based algorithms, and boosting algorithms to predict the fuel
    consumption of container ships. Gkerekos et al. [11] compared support vector machine,
    random forest regressor, extra tree regression, and artificial neural network
    to predict a ship’s fuel consumption. While previous research involved comparative
    studies of various machine learning models for realizing ship’s performance or
    fuel consumption, dealing with the actual ship data collected from hundreds of
    sensors with high-dimensional, complex, and nonlinear factors remains difficult.
    In addition, as real-time ship data includes unpredictable weather conditions
    and excessive operating conditions, analyzing the ship’s normal or abnormal conditions
    only from the predicted results of the machine running model is also difficult."'
  extract_2: To overcome the limitations of the existing research described earlier,
    we herein developed a meta-learning model-based data gap analysis framework to
    determine whether there is an abnormality in the state of ships in real-time operation,
    and it has three distinctions compared to existing research. First, a systematic
    data gap analysis framework was developed for monitoring an actual ship’s operation
    condition. Our proposed framework includes rule-based real-time data imputation
    processing, refining data through clustering, denoising and dimensional reduction,
    and sequentially detecting abnormal data based on the relative error intervals
    of the prediction data obtained from a meta-learning model of the ship’s performance.
    Second, a robust and accurate meta-learning model suitable for ship and marine
    data was developed. The meta-learning model combines single-machine learning models
    with different characteristics to enable robust and accurate data gap analysis
    for real operation data with large uncertainty and variability. Third, various
    error analysis techniques were applied to verify the validity and practicality
    of our proposed data gap analysis framework for a real ship’s operation data.
    Using ship’s operation data containing various environmental factors, various
    error analysis techniques were used to compare the accuracy and robustness of
    single-machine learning models with that of the meta-learning model.

    meta-learning model for data gap analysis in a specific context of ship and maritime
    data. The generalizability of the findings to other domains or applications may

    2. While the paper demonstrated the advantages of the meta-learning model in handling
    noisy and incomplete data, it did not provide a detailed analysis or quantification
    of the impact of data quality on the model''s performance. Exploring the sensitivity
    of the model to data quality issues could provide valuable insights for practical
    implementations.

  data_sources: IoT device data
  explanation: The study aims to address the challenges of managing and processing
    high-dimensional data generated by IoT devices in AIoT networks. To achieve this,
    the study proposes a novel approach involving attribute reduction techniques that
    operate at the device and dimension levels. Specifically, the method focuses on
    selecting a subset of important devices and dimensions while maintaining data
    relevance to alleviate the "curse of dimensionality" and multimodal interference
    in AIoT networks.
  extract_1: 'To fulfill the rigorous requirements of big data and computational power
    inherent to AIoT edge networks, while reducing the volume of AIoT data, two primary
    strategies may be contemplated: 1) device-oriented techniques incorporating attribute
    reduction can be deployed to activate only a required subset of sensors for data
    reception, thereby diminishing both the device load and the quantity; 2) data-oriented
    techniques can be applied whereby attribute reduction serves to reduce data volume
    by lowering the dimension.'

  key_findings: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed attribute
    reduction approach in reducing the volume of AIoT network data while retaining
    the necessary relevance for edge computing and AI model establishment. The approach

  data_sources: CelebA dataset, EMNIST dataset
  explanation: The study proposed a data protection scheme named FLPM for real-time,
    end-to-end automated irrigation systems. FLPM is designed to protect the privacy
    of device data in federated learning (FL) environments. The scheme leverages a
    VAE to modify non-task properties of data, thus preserving task properties and
    maintaining high accuracy. This modification protects sensitive information and
    mitigates privacy leakage attacks.
  extract_1: FLPM's reconstruction effect is excellent, as shown in Fig. 2. The original
    images and VAE-generated images clearly demonstrate that VAE reconstructs the
    basic features of the person’s face. The improved VAE based on the class activation
    map in the scheme makes the irrelevant task properties in the images blurred while
    maintaining the original features of the person’s face.
  extract_2: The experimental results are shown in Table 2, where the AUC score of
    the property classifier for the original images of all three properties in the
    table is greater than 0.98, while there is a significant decrease in the AUC score
    of the property modified data. It indicates that the property modification has
    taken effect and that the attacker cannot successfully discriminate the non-task
    properties of the devices’ private data.

    on the current measurement. Kalman filtering is particularly effective in handling
    sensor noise and measurement errors, making it suitable for applications such
    as real-time data cleaning in automated irrigation management systems."'

    calculating the average of a specified number of previous data points. By smoothing
    out short-term fluctuations in the data, moving average helps to remove noise

    used to filter out transient spikes in sensor readings, providing a more accurate
    representation of the underlying trend."'

    While Industry 4.0, a new era in industrial production, is rapidly transforming
    the mechanisms by which companies produce products, artificial intelligence-driven
    manufacturing is expanding its place in our daily lives day by day (Lee, Davari,
    Singh, & Pandhare, 2018). The rapid increase in population created the need for
    complex production lines to meet demand. With the technological and industrial
    developments in manufacturing, more intelligent and complex machines have taken
    their place in production lines, creating smarter ecosystems. However, the maintenance
    of such complex systems has become vital for reliability and sustainability. Recent
    innovations in technology have begun to change the traditional behavior of human–machine
    interaction. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and big data along with
    ever-increasing processing power of computers have made this interaction bidirectional.
    This change has found its place not only in daily life, but also in industry and
    production environments in terms of automation.

  explanation: 'The paper presents a study comparing eight established decision stream
    quality improvement (DSQI) algorithms for EMG-based pattern recognition with two
    novel approaches: decision-change informed rejection (DCIR) and variance of confidence-informed
    rejection (VoCIR). The study evaluated the algorithms using steady-state and transition
    metrics in the context of a continuous dataset containing dynamic transitions
    between different muscle contractions. The results suggest that the newly proposed
    DCIR approach is a promising algorithm that reduces transition errors and instability
    metrics compared to conventional rejection-based schemes.'

    techniques for handling missing, inconsistent, or outlier data from IoT sensors
    (e.g., soil moisture sensors, weather stations) using methods such as Kalman filtering,
    moving average, and adaptive thresholding. The proposed approach builds on existing
    outlier elimination algorithms by leveraging stochastic neighborhood graphs and
    the Borda counting method, offering several advantages over existing techniques.
    Specifically, the use of stochastic neighborhood graphs enables the calculation
    of outlier probabilities for each optical flow value without relying on a large
    amount of data volume computation, as required by statistical methods. Additionally,
    the Borda counting method is employed instead of the expert thresholds method,
    addressing the problem of uneven density distribution and false elimination caused
    by the thresholds and local area consistency based methods. The resulting unsupervised
    outlier elimination method, termed B-SNG, effectively eliminates outliers while
    maintaining high accuracy and precision, and outperforms other state-of-the-art
    methods in the context of different motion modes.

  explanation: The proposed PRNU noise extraction model consists of a noise extractor
    that combines the Generalized Anscombe Transform (GAT) with an adaptive block
    clustering PCA filter, as well as an enhancement processing model involving spectrum

    analysis of ship and maritime data using meta learning. Applied Soft Computing,
    101, 107048.
  explanation: 'The study proposes a data gap analysis to detect abnormal or erroneous
    data in real-time data from IoT sensors on ships. The data gap analysis is crucial
    for accurate prediction of ship performance and monitoring, including engine fuel
    consumption, shaft revolution, and speed over ground. However, real-time data
    is often affected by noise, bias, outliers, and missing values. The proposed framework
    systematically processes the data to remove errors and identify abnormal data.


    The approach involves several techniques:


    - **Rule-based data imputation:** Missing data is replaced with allowable values
    based on domain knowledge and ship operation policies.

    - **Clustering (K-means):** Data is grouped into clusters based on characteristics
    using the silhouette analysis method, which calculates the similarity of the data
    for deciding how well clustering has been evaluated, depending on the value of
    K.

    - **Denoising (Kalman filter):** A statistical approach is used to smooth data
    with large variance over time by minimizing the mean square of the estimated data.

    - **Dimension reduction (PCA and correlation analysis):** Less important variables
    are removed or more important variables affecting output variables are selected
    from a large number of variables. PCA converts a set of observations of correlated
    variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables (principal components),
    while correlation analysis measures the strength of association between two variables
    (correlation coefficient).


    The framework combines three machine learning models — generalized linear model
    (GAM), gradient boosting regressor (GBR), and multivariate adaptive regression
    splines (MARS) — to build a meta-regression model. The models are optimized using
    Bayesian optimization to improve accuracy. The most optimal model is used to detect
    abnormal data.


    The framework is evaluated using real-world data from a bulk carrier, demonstrating
    high accuracy and robustness in detecting abnormal data. The authors conclude
    that the proposed data gap analysis framework provides a valuable tool for ship
    performance monitoring and can help ensure efficient and economical ship management.'
  extract_1: With the developments in Internet of Things (IoT) technology, vast amounts
    of ship data such as navigation status and engine life cycle are being collected
    through sensors mounted on ships. This has led to the smart ship era, where effective
    ship management and intelligent navigation strategy have been enabled through
    remote ship operation monitoring. The data collected onboard involve navigation,
    ship equipment and machinery, ship status, and weather data, which are used as
    input data to predict ship performance in aspects such as engine fuel consumption,
    shaft revolution, and speed over ground.
  extract_2: Several researchers have attempted to analyze ship performance using
    the collected ship and maritime data, but they struggle with real data of poor
    quality [1]. Some of the real data collected as time-series data are missing during
    transmission, or there exist errors such as noise, bias, and outliers included
    in the data collection process. Such abnormal data lead to inaccurate prediction
    of ship performance; therefore, data preprocessing is crucial before the analysis
    of data for determining ship performance.

  data_sources: Sensor data from IoT devices (e.g., soil moisture sensors, weather
    stations), UAV-sensed data
  explanation: The study proposes an intelligent data and bid dual truth discovery
    scheme (DTD) to address data quality and cost issues in mobile crowdsensing (MCS)
    for real-time irrigation management. By filtering out low-quality workers and
    selecting high-quality workers based on data and bid trust, the DTD scheme significantly

    on real-time data cleaning techniques for handling missing, inconsistent, or outlier
    data from IoT sensors (e.g., soil moisture sensors, weather stations) using methods
    such as Kalman filtering, moving average, and adaptive thresholding.
  extract_1: '"Our major contributions can be summarized as follows. We propose a
    truth data discovery approach for MCS. Our approach utilizes a small number of
    reliable workers as a starting point. It employs an unsupervised machine learning
    algorithm, specifically a data detection algorithm, to learn the features of ground
    truth data. These features are then used to detect and filter data submitted by
    unknown workers, identifying truthful data and preventing malicious attacks on
    the IIoT."'
  extract_2: '"We also propose two trust computation schemes to calculate the workers’
    contribution value based on an entropy-weighted multiobjective optimization approach.
    The MCS platforms can filter out low-quality workers from the pool of unidentified
    workers based on their contribution value. This filtration process effectively
    optimizes the platform’s performance in recruiting workers, ensuring the receipt
    of high-quality data at a low cost."'

  key_findings: '1) The DTD scheme significantly outperforms traditional methods in
    terms of sensitivity (improvement 44%), specificity (improvement 5%), accuracy
    (improvement 18%), and F1-score (improvement 47%).

    2) The DTD scheme reduces data bias by 24 percentage points compared to traditional
    inference methods.

    3) The DTD scheme reduces recruitment cost by 38 percentage points compared to
    traditional methods.'

  main_objective: The main objective of the study is to propose a DTD scheme for MCS
    to improve data quality, reduce recruitment costs, and enhance market fairness.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is highly relevant to the outline point as it presents
    a novel approach for real-time data cleaning and anomaly detection in the context
    of automated irrigation management systems. Specifically, the DTD scheme utilizes
    unsupervised learning and UAV-sensed data as a ground truth for anomaly detection.
    By identifying low-quality workers and reliably handling data quality issues,
    the proposed DTD scheme can contribute to the efficient use of water resources
    and enhance agricultural productivity, aligning well with the intention of the
    systematic review.

    \ presents a comprehensive review of the recent advances in data-driven optimization\
    \ under uncertainty. This research area seamlessly integrates machine learning\

    five key application areas, one of which is anomaly detection. Anomaly detection
    is a type of diagnostic analytics, which aims to identify various failure events
    (e.g. leakages, contamination events, blockages and cyber-attacks). System prediction
    and asset assessment provide an understanding of the current and future states
    of the UWS being hydraulic or asset conditions. System operation, planning and
    maintenance are optimisation problems aiming to identify the best solutions given
    specific constraints. Deep learning can play a role in all the key issues in the
    life cycle of the UWS, with a diverse range of architectures for different problems.
    At present, however, there are few well-tested deep learning algorithms or products
    readily available for solving UWS problems. A number of challenges related to
    data and algorithmic development hinder the development and implementation of
    deep learning approaches in the water sector. One of the main challenges in developing
    deep learning-based anomaly detection models is the amount and quality of the
    data necessary to train the models. Furthermore, models performance is often not
    reliable when presented with unseen data. Therefore, the authors suggest that
    the LSTM techniques offer advantages in dealing with real-time data, continuous
    updates, and improved model performance.

    There is no consensus among researchers on the deﬁnition of dropout, success,
    and other related terminologies. For example, some researchers considered a student
    to be a dropout if they fail to complete a speciﬁc percentage of the assessments
    (e.g., 50%) [70], or if they were not active for several consecutive days [73].
    Others considered dropout to be the inability to pass a course, and some did not
    provide any precise deﬁnition. The inconsistency in deﬁning dropout and other
    related terminologies could be a concern to researchers, since it inﬂuences how
    dropout is assessed, addressed, and investigated [97].

    –

    Most proposed approaches use MOOC datasets in which students are self-motivated
    and are not required or obligated to participate in the courses. Thus, there is
    an enormous disparity between learners who are registered for curiosity, who,
    for example, view some videos and do not complete the required assignments, and
    those who are registered to ﬁnish the course, which may make identifying dropouts
    or failure relatively easy tasks. Exploring other types of online environments,
    such as SPOCs, might introduce more challenges, as learners may attempt to ﬁnish
    the course but fail or withdraw due to their lack of knowledge or other reasons.

    –

    Most studies also proposed systems that predict student outcomes when students
    approach the end of the course. Only a small number of studies considered early
    predictions of user outcomes, while many studies did not report the duration of
    data collection. This made it difﬁcult to compare the different proposed methods,
    as the duration of the extracted features varied signiﬁcantly. In addition, some
    studies used a subset of publicly available datasets, making it difﬁcult to compare
    different methods on benchmark datasets.

    –

    Most studies employed feature-engineering techniques to calculate students’ statistical
    features as a whole. These features were often chosen arbitrarily or using statistical
    techniques such as correlation analysis. Some recent studies looked into methods
    that automatically extract temporal features from raw data by mapping raw features
    into numerical representations, such as one-hot encoding, and then using deep-learning
    methods, in particular, convolution functions, to extract features. Despite the
    useful-ness of these techniques, the generated representations are often very
    sparse and less useful for comparing user behavior.

    –

    Several studies conduct on benchmark datasets showed that statistical temporal
    features provide better results than raw features. Thus, further investigation
    of temporal features will provide a valuable understanding of users’ learning
    progress and, eventually, their learner outcomes.

    –

    Most temporally based LSTM or GRU models learners’ time-series features. Further
    investigation of other recent sequence-based models, such as the attention-based
    model, is required. Studies using one-hot encoding to represent raw features and
    different representation techniques for raw features are worth investigating.

    –

    Different machine-learning and deep-learning models have been used to predict
    learners’ outcomes. RF and ANN are among the most effective machine learning models’
    performance and dropout prediction, whereas the sequence-based model provides
    the best performance on the publicly available dropout dataset. Further investigation
    of deep-learning models is recommended to predict student performance.

    –

    One of the observed challenges is the quality of the training samples in which
    a large number of attributes are clickstream data which might be less representative
    when learners do not interact or engage in learning activities. This practice
    is common among students who register in MOOCs for curiosity [86].

    –

    Learning analytic systems are based on large volumes of real-time data collected
    over a protracted period. Analyzing, combining, and linking multiple forms of
    learners’ data to forecast their outcomes or any part of the learning process
    has raised many ethical challenges that cannot be properly measured using traditional
    ethical procedures [99]. The risks of de-anonymizing learners’ identities [100]
    and decontextualizing data [101] are some of the potential risks of this practice.'

    extract_1: The core interest of this study is to explore incremental online learning
      algorithms in the context of attack detection in VANETs. More speciﬁcally, our
      research focuses on the detection of the black hole attack, estimated as the
      most damaging attacks that might compromise Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector
      (AODV) routing protocol in VANETs in terms of data availability [7,8].
    extract_2: To this end, we have used data gathered from extensive simulations
      of realistic VANET scenarios based on two well-known simulators, namely SUMO
      [9] and NS-3 [10]. The collected data incorporate essential features which are
      relevant in capturing the behavior of VANET nodes under a black hole attack.

  data_sources: KDD Cup 1999 and UNSW-NB15 data sets
  explanation: The paper focuses on the use of automated systems that use machine
    learning to manage real-time irrigation systems, with a focus on online learning
    techniques for continuous updates to the ML models. It discusses the use of autoencoders
    to monitor non-stationary network data streams and detect anomalies in real time.
    The paper merges an autoencoder method with an active learning strategy to further
    minimize labeling costs and speed up training and adaptation times, creating a
    Split Active Learning Anomaly Detector (SALAD). The paper assesses the effectiveness
    of the SALAD model by comparing it to other traditional methods using the KDD
    Cup 1999 and UNSW-NB15 data sets, and finds that the SALAD model is able to provide
    near equivalent performance to more computationally expensive methods with a significantly
    lower running time.
  extract_1: '"The proposed autoencoder anomaly detector is depicted in figure 1.
    The sample X is inputted to the autoencoder network from which a Reconstruction
    Error (RE) is produced based on the loss value between the approximate output
    and the original input. The RE is compared to an anomaly threshold value with
    samples scoring above threshold being labeled as an ‘anomaly’ and those below
    being ‘normal’ or benign. If a label Y is provided then the anomaly threshold
    is updated using a novel adaptive anomaly threshold method, which also maintains
    a memory of the population mean RE throughout the data stream by using a fading
    factor [2] memory mechanism to prioritise more recent samples for faster adaptation.
    The adaptive anomaly threshold is demonstrated to be superior to fixed and other
    threshold determination methods from the literature. Note that the use of labels
    to find the anomaly threshold results in a semi-supervised method."'
  extract_2: The results of each active learning strategy with a budget of 0.2 (20%)
    are given in Table 5, with accuracy and F1-score for both data sets plotted in
    figure 6. Each strategy was executed 5 times with the average and standard deviation
    presented. The worst performing strategy was the fixed uncertainty strategy, reﬂecting
    the results of ˇZliobait˙e et al. [3], which was expected as the algorithm is
    biased only towards uncertain samples and cannot vary the amount of samples labeled,
    meaning that change occurring outside of the fixed margin will be missed.
  inline_citation: null
  key_findings: '1. Autoencoders can be used for effective anomaly detection in network
    data streams, with strong detection and run-time performance compared to traditional
    methods.

    2. The use of an active learning strategy can significantly reduce the labeling
    cost of the data stream, with just 20% of the labels required to achieve near-equivalent
    performance to the blind adaptation approach.

    3. The split active learning strategy, which combines random and variable uncertainty
    strategies, is recommended as it fulfills all three active learning requirements
    to maintain a fixed budget, access to all samples within the stream, and preserve
    the distribution of incoming data for detecting changes.'

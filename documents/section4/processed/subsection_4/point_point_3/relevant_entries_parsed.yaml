- explanation: 'The paper titled "Applications of data mining and machine learning
    framework in aquaculture and fisheries: A review" provides a comprehensive overview
    of the various applications of data mining and machine learning algorithms in
    the fisheries and aquaculture sectors. This paper discusses the use of different
    machine learning algorithms at various stages of aquaculture and fisheries, from
    hatchery operations, fish biomass and growth rate monitoring, disease outbreak
    prediction, feed optimization, and risk control systems. The review highlights
    the benefits of using data mining and machine learning for efficient use of resources,
    environmental protection, and fish quality control. Future research directions
    include the development of more robust algorithms, incorporation of real-time
    data, and integration of machine learning with other technologies for sustainable
    growth in the global seafood production.'

    • Data mining and machine learning techniques offer intelligent decision-making
    solutions from complex aquaculture and fisheries datasets. • Aquaculture applications
    such as monitoring and control of production environment, fish biomass and optimization
    of feed use are discussed with examples. • Fisheries management applications include
    surveillance of fishing, catch composition and ecosystem-fisheries associations.
    • Applications related to environment monitoring, fish processing and quality
    assurance are also indicated, along with challenges and perspectives. Abstract
    Aquaculture and fisheries sectors are finding ingenious ways to grow and meet
    the soaring human demand for nutrient-rich fish and seafood by efficiently utilizing
    the vast water resources and biodiversity of aquatic life on earth. This includes
    the progressive integration of information technology, data science and artificial
    intelligence with fishing and fish farming methods to enable intensification of
    aquaculture production, sustainable exploitation of natural fishery resources
    and mechanization or automation of allied activities. Exclusive data mining and
    machine learning systems are being developed to process complex datasets and perform
    intelligent tasks like analysing cause-effect associations, forecasting problems
    and providing smart or precision solutions for farming and catching fish.'
  extract_2: While aquaculture has been relatively faster in integrating data mining
    and machine learning tools with advanced farming systems, capture fisheries is
    finding reliable methods to sort the complexities in data collection and processing.
    Finally, we have pointed out some of the challenges and future perspectives related
    to large-scale adoption of machine learning and data mining techniques in fish
    production systems. Our intention is to provide a roadmap for advancing the field
    of real-time, automated irrigation management.
  limitations: The paper does not provide specific examples or case studies to illustrate
    the applications of data mining and machine learning in real-world aquaculture
    and fisheries operations. It also does not discuss the challenges and limitations
    associated with deploying and scaling machine learning solutions in these sectors.

  description: The water is a basic need for the human beings as well as the plants.
    Life is not possible without water. Therefore, it is our primary duty to save
    the water and manage the resources of water efficiently. India is a farming country
    and to increase the productivity of land, we require proper water management with
    a smart technology. Artificial intelligence and Internet of Things are the technology
    that can help to manage the water conservation and to increase the productivity
    of agriculture. It can make things smart by connecting physical devices to the
    internet. It is also required because the population and exploitation of resources
    are increasing day by day and with limited resources, we have to produce the maximum
    yield. Our proposed smart system provides efficient water management system that
    can be utilized to revive the agriculture industry. Implementation results of
    our proposed model show that we can made a smart water conservation system with
    the help of AI along with sensors and microcontrollers. Our proposed model also
    performs automatic water conservation and provides up-to-date information that
    can be utilized for agriculture purpose.

  description: Aquaculture and fisheries sectors are finding ingenious ways to grow
    and meet the soaring human demand for nutrient-rich fish and seafood by efficiently
    utilizing the vast water resources and biodiversity of aquatic life on earth.
    This includes the progressive integration of information technology, data science
    and artificial intelligence with fishing and fish farming methods to enable intensification
    of aquaculture production, sustainable exploitation of natural fishery resources
    and mechanization-automation of allied activities. Exclusive data mining and machine
    learning systems are being developed to process complex datasets and perform intelligent
    tasks like analysing cause-effect associations, forecasting problems and providing
    smart-precision solutions for farming and catching fish. Considering the intensifying
    research and growing interest of stakeholders, in this review, we have consolidated
    basic information on the various practical applications of data mining and machine
    learning in aquaculture and fisheries domains from representative selection of
    scientific literature. This includes an overview of research and applications
    in (1) aquaculture activities such as monitoring and control of the production
    environment, optimization of feed use, fish biomass monitoring and disease prevention;
    (2) fisheries management aspects such as resource assessment, fishing, catch monitoring
    and regulation; (3) environment monitoring related to hydrology, primary production
    and aquatic pollution; (4) automation of fish processing and quality assurance
    systems; and (5) fish market intelligence, price forecasting and socioeconomics.
    While aquaculture has been relatively faster in integrating data mining and machine
    learning tools with advanced farming systems, capture fisheries is finding reliable
    methods to sort the complexities in data collection and processing. Finally, we
    have pointed out some of the challenges and future perspectives related to large-scale

    Globally, aquaculture and capture fisheries are vital food production systems
    which contributed about 179 million metric tons of aquatic organisms in 2018 (valued
    at USD 401 billion). Out of this, 156 million metric tons were directly used for
    human consumption, providing more than 3.3 billion people with 20 percent of their
    average per capita intake of animal proteins. Further, fisheries and aquaculture
    provided livelihood to 59.5 million people across the globe [1]. With the continuous
    and rapid growth witnessed in this sector, the world is gaining access to unprecedented
    amounts of data on fisheries and aquaculture. This necessitates the adoption of
    smart technologies which is based on innovative data systems and analytics, to
    improve the economic, social and environmental sustainability along the fish supply
    chains. At present, an array of data collection and processing technologies such
    as high-resolution satellite imagery, in situ multiple sensor networks, automatic
    identification systems, big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence and
    the internet of things are available to enable fully monitored fisheries and precision
    aquaculture [[2], [3], [4], [5]]. For instance, machine learning algorithms can
    predict and quantify fishing efforts with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions
    by tracking fishing vessel movements, fishing gear use and fish stocks. Likewise,
    sensors and data processing can help identify patterns in aquaculture systems
    and present cost-effective management strategies for farmers [1,6]. The information
    technology solutions presently used in aquaculture and fisheries is broadly based
    on instrumentation and process control, computerized models, geographical information
    systems, image processing and pattern recognition, data management, decision support
    tools, expert systems, artificial intelligence and information centres / networks
    [7,8]. The existing technologies and tools are mainly used for (1) appetite monitoring,
    control of feeding and reduction of feed wastage in aquaculture (e.g. Umitron
    Cell-Eagle); (2) monitoring and control of water quality in aquaculture systems
    (e.g. Siemens - TIA portal); (3) monitoring of fish stock biomass and behavior
    for growth prediction in aquaculture farms (e.g. XpertSea - XperCount); (4) prediction
    and prevention of parasite infestation and other disease outbreaks (e.g. AquaCloud);
    (5) grading and sorting of live fish (e.g. VAKI fish counter), (6) seafood processing
    (e.g. Marel); (7) prevention of illegal and unregulated fishing by real time monitoring
    of vessel movements (Microsoft Azure - OceanMind); (8) ecosystem monitoring using
    drones (SHOAL); and in other aspects like price tracking, market forecasting and
    supply chain [[9], [10], [11]]. Considering the growing use and potential of data
    mining and machine learning in fish production systems, in this review, we have
    consolidated and presented scientific information on the application of data mining
    and machine learning in fisheries and aquaculture, with insights on the various
    challenges and opportunities. 2. An overview of data mining and machine learning
    techniques Technological advancement has made data collection possible at unprecedent
    rates, volumes and complexities, with lower cost involvement and higher autonomy.
    As the information and knowledge in these databases needs to be intelligently
    used, the data are increasingly integrated with artificial intelligence on different
    scales, from mobile phones to supercomputers, to perform a diversity of tasks
    [4]. Data mining and machine learning are two intersecting branches of artificial
    intelligence which uses the explosive growth in data to analyse the association
    between causes and effects, predict imminent problems and provide solutions. Though
    they share several common features, data mining and machine learning are distinct
    in their scope of application, working concept, learning capability, human interference
    and implementation [12]. While data mining is the computing process of discovering
    patterns and extracting useful information from large data sets, machine learning
    is the ability of a computer to use complex algorithms and learn from mined datasets
    without being exclusively programmed [13,14]. The major categories of data mining
    methods are generalization, characterization, classification, clustering, association,
    evolution, pattern matching, data visualization and meta-rule guided mining. It
    involves the use of simple and complex techniques like k-means clustering, k-nearest
    neighbour classification, support vector machine binary classifiers, dynamic prediction,
    modelling, artificial neural networks and algorithm architecture for mining useful
    information from relational, transactional, object oriented, spatial and temporal
    databases, and global information systems [14]. Machine learning stretches the
    use of data further, by encoding domain knowledge and experience in suitable data
    structures and applying them for solving problems through examples, in a way analogical
    to human learning. The form of knowledge induction in machine learning is especially
    useful for addressing ill-defined and informally stated problems that lack algorithmic
    solutions, such as visual recognition, material behavior and detection of interesting
    regularities in large data sets [13]. Machine learning techniques are either supervised
    learning methods based on logic (decision tree), perceptron (artificial neural
    networks and radial basis function networks), instance (k-nearest neighbour),
    Bayesian networks (probability) and support vector machines or ‘knowledge oriented’
    unsupervised learning methods based on cognitive perspective, representational
    issues, inductive essence of learning, exhaustive search, heuristic search, divide
    and conquer learning, progressive coverage, predicate logic, concept formation,
    quest for natural laws, discovery in dynamic systems, analogy providing search
    heuristics, close neighbourhood, genetic algorithms, perspectives, hybrid systems
    and multi-strategy learning [12,13]. In the following sections, we will cite examples
    and discuss the application of different data mining and machine learning tools
    in aquaculture and fisheries. The organisational structure of this article and
    the rationale behind it is illustrated in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res

    is the process of breeding, rearing, producing and harvesting aquatic organisms
    such as fish, crustaceans and molluscs in a highly dynamic system with intricately
    linked physical, biological and economic environments and processes. Therefore,
    as in agriculture and livestock farming sectors, fish farmers and enterprises
    have to make several decisions every day to wade through the intricate complexities
    and influencing factors which determines the final fish yield, productivity and
    profit margins. In this high-risk environment, appropriate use of data mining
    and machine learning tools can provide intelligent solutions for better management
    of aquaculture facilities covering all the farming and biological processes such
    as feeding, water quality monitoring and control, fish biomass and welfare monitoring,
    disease detection / prevention and final product quality analysis (Fig. 2). The
    use of information technology tools such as computational algorithms, sensor networks,
    microelectronics, cloud computing and internet of things in operational process
    control, engineering innovations, data analytics and decision support system for
    precision or smart aquaculture has been comprehensively reviewed by many authors
    [2,7,8,15,16,17,18,19,20,21]. Here, we have presented basic and updated knowledge
    in the practical applications of data mining and machine learning for intelligent
    decision support in monitoring / control of the rearing environment (i.e., risk
    management); optimization of resource (feed) use; and fish biomass, growth and
    welfare monitoring (stock assessment) in intensive production systems (Table 1).

    Saberioon et al. [42] 3.1. Monitoring and control of the rearing environment In
    an intensive aquaculture facility, the first critical control point which requires
    immediate decision making in a day-to-day farming situation is the monitoring
    and control of the physical rearing environment. This includes the monitoring
    and control of (1) water quality parameters such as temperature, dissolved oxygen,
    pH, ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, salinity and suspended solids; (2) water level,
    distribution and pumping systems; (3) effluent and waste management systems; and
    (4) operation of the physical containment structures. Real-time collection, processing
    and analysis of reliable data from the physical environment that leads to well
    informed timely decisions can greatly improve the process stability / efficiency
    and fish growth / welfare, while reducing wastage of resources, stressors and
    cost of production [7,8,19]. Four basic designs of process control engineering
    systems are generally used in the physical realm of the aquaculture facilities.
    In the increasing order of complexity and degree of control, they are: data logger
    or closed loop controller systems, programmable logic controller (PLC) systems,
    supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems and distributed control
    systems (DCS). Further, the characteristics of a process control system varies
    based on the operating system, data mining or machine learning algorithms and
    attached modules such as input / output drivers; process database builder; man-machine
    interface; scan, alarm and control program; tag group editor; dynamic data exchange
    server; trend analyser; report generator; and messaging / remote dialer. The details
    of a process control system have been precisely described in early reviews by
    Lee [8,15]. In the application context, once the optimal physical environmental
    conditions are identified and defined, the process control systems continuously
    monitor the target parameters and automatically activates the remedial actuator
    and alerts the farmer when a deviation from the prescribed range occurs. For instance,
    when dissolved oxygen levels falls below the set threshold in an outdoor shrimp
    culture pond, a simple cloud based real time monitoring and control equipment
    can sense the problem and automatically switch on the pond aerators (PondGuard,
    Eruvaka Technologies, India). Among the various fish production systems, process
    control and engineering solutions are most commonly used in land based recirculating
    aquaculture systems (RAS), where high density of fishes are reared under controlled
    environmental conditions. In one of the early developments, Padala and Zilber
    [22] developed a rule-based expert system (recirculating intensive aquaculture
    expert; RIAX) to monitor and control temperature, dissolved oxygen, water quality,
    flow and feeding in an intensive tilapia culture system. In this system, the water
    quality parameter sensors, meters and actuators (valves and pumps) were connected
    to a PLC; and machine learning involved start-up, run-time, operator assisted
    maintenance and equipment diagnostic databases. With technological advances, intelligent
    risk control systems are designed to monitor and forecast water quality with artificial
    neural networks and other algorithms to proactively control water quality in a
    timely manner. Hu et al. [19] has meticulously reviewed the different methods
    of water quality data acquisition and pre-processing (e.g., wireless sensor networks),
    challenges in data transmission and the various algorithms and models used for
    data analysis and forecasting changes in water quality. To cite an example, Zhu
    et al. [25] developed a remote wireless system which combines mobile telecommunication
    (CDMA service) and web-server-embedded (VPN) technology to accurately forecast
    dissolved oxygen levels in an intensive farming system half an hour ahead, using
    historical trends and artificial neural network algorithms. For more accurate
    dissolved oxygen predictions in the short and long term (1 – 48 h), attention
    based recurrent neural networks was found to be very effective [43]. In some wireless
    sensor networks, the water quality sensor nodes were connected to a ZigBee wireless
    communication system and global system for mobile (GSM) for data transmission
    and LabVIEW software was used for data processing and analysis [44]. To reduce
    network traffic and overcome issues with response time and scalability linked
    to the exhaustive data from RAS process control systems, fog or edge computing
    can be used [24]. Further, automation or process-controlled operation of every
    RAS component such as the denitrifying bioreactor for nitrate removal [23] and
    heat exchangers for temperature regulation [26] using fuzzy logic-based expert
    system or controllers can optimize their performance efficiency in the water recirculation-reuse
    loop. Smart use of water pumps and other farm equipment by deploying computational
    optimization frameworks to operate them only when required can significantly reduce
    the cost of production, while maintaining a stable environment in the rearing
    system. In this context, Ullah and Kim [29] developed an optimization scheme with
    Kalman filter algorithm for maintaining the desired water level in a fish rearing
    tank with less energy consumption by computationally optimizing the operation
    of a variable speed pump (flow rate and pumping duration) and target filling levels.
    Similarly, in aquaponics, water circulation (flow rate) for the fish tanks and
    water retention levels in the plant grow-bed can be remotely monitored and controlled
    by operating the water pump for predefined durations using a fog computing architecture
    [28]. Basic system monitoring and control like the above examples is becoming
    increasingly affordable to small scale fish farmers with the use of single board
    computers such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino, PocketBeagle, Asus Tinker Board and Odroid.
    For pond culture systems, Cruz [30] developed a modified dissolved oxygen ecological
    model with computational fluid dynamics simulation to predict the complex interaction
    between the aerator and oxygen profile of the pond water. Based on this, a feedback
    diffused aeration control system was designed and validated for maintaining adequate
    oxygen levels in the pond with significantly less energy consumption. With respect
    to the operation of offshore cage culture systems, Kim et al. [27] developed an
    air control program which can automatically control the submerging and surfacing
    of a fish cage by sensing water pressure, wave height and wind speed. This algorithm
    along with the bond graph technique mathematical model can be potentially used
    to build automatic controllers for setting offshore submersible fish cages at
    desired depths, according to the surface environmental conditions. An advanced
    integrated multitrophic aquaculture model is being developed with smart systems,
    sensors and data sources for long term autonomous monitoring, analysis and decision
    support functions which enables production optimization and environmental protection,
    through the European Union IMPAQT project. 3.2. Optimization of feed use Feed
    and feeding are the ‘make or break’ elements of any fed-aquaculture practice with
    very significant biological, environmental and economic implications. This is
    because 1) the nutritional properties of the feed determine the growth, welfare
    and final flesh quality of the fish; 2) the nutritional and physical properties
    of the feed determine the farm water quality and nutrient load (nitrogen and phosphorus)
    in the effluents; and 3) the efficiency of feed use and conversion (i.e., kg fish
    produced per kg feed) determines the unit productivity (kg/m3), culture duration
    and profit margins. Moreover, decisions related to the feeding process are critical
    to ensure that sufficient feed is provided to every fish in the rearing unit for
    achieving desired growth rates, with minimum feed refusal and wastage. Conventionally,
    the feeding strategies are decided based on the size of the fish, water temperature
    and the total biomass, and further adjusted based on visual observation of the
    feeding activity. The use of intelligent feeding systems is shifting the feed
    management strategies from an experience / intuition driven process to a more
    knowledge-driven procedure [2]. In recent years, several studies and specific
    reviews have focused on the intelligent control of feeding, from different perspectives
    such as automatic recognition of fish feeding behavior, monitoring of uneaten
    feed and control of feed delivery [20,45,46]. In the early automated systems,
    the timing of the feeding event and the quantity of feed delivered were controlled.
    For instance, a microcomputer and BASIC programming was used to control automatic
    feed delivery by solenoid actuated devices in an experimental fish hatchery [31].
    In the next phase, additional sensors were included to detect feeding activity
    directly by hydroacoustic / optical monitoring or indirectly by optical / acoustic
    / infrared observation of the uneaten feed pellets. Based on the information provided
    by the feedback systems, the feeding rate was controlled by manual or automatic
    feeder cut off. Recently, in adaptive automated systems, smart feed control algorithms
    are used to monitor and predict fish behavior and proactively control feed delivery
    as in the case of centralized pneumatic feeders in offshore salmon cage farms
    [47]. Examples of the adaptive automated systems commercially used in fish farms
    are presented in Table 2. Table 2. Examples of commercially available intelligent
    solutions for aquaculture and fish processing. Application Developer / Products

    of these products have integrated multiple applications. As compared to the earlier
    simple image analysis algorithms such as the object matching algorithm used for
    automatic pellet counting in salmon sea cages [48], the present computer vision
    and hydroacoustic based feed control methods uses more complex data mining and
    machine learning algorithms [45]. These self-learning decision support algorithms
    are based on intricate biological variables such as feeding motivation or hunger
    levels of the fish, which are in turn indicated by individual swimming behavior
    (i.e., speed, direction and acceleration analysis using optical flow and motion
    patterns) and vertical distribution of fish groups (i.e., depth movements and
    activity levels analysis using sonar and acoustic telemetry) during the different
    phases (beginning, midway and end) of the feeding period and non-feeding period
    [2]. Different approaches and algorithms have been tested for accurate classification
    of appetite or hunger behavior in fish. For instance, Cubitt et al. [49] developed
    an intelligent reasoning system to distinguish hunger states in rainbow trout
    using supervised pattern recognition (support vector machine and quadratic algorithm)
    based classification of electromyogram (muscle activity) signals. In another approach,
    video surveillance extracted features were analysed using Principal Component
    Analysis with varimax rotation for dimensionality reduction and classified using
    k-Nearest Neighbour for accurate prediction of the hunger behavior of Asian seabass
    [33]. For more objective assessment of fish feeding intensity, the machine vision
    image dataset from a tilapia feeding experiment was initially constructed and
    extended using rotation, scale and translation augmentation and noise-invariant
    data expansion. The convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained with this
    augmented dataset was then found to accurately detect and grade the different
    degree of appetite or feeding intensity [50]. With respect to feeding decisions
    based on changes in environmental parameters, Wu et al. [34] developed a hybrid
    learning adaptive neural-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) algorithm with a
    fuzzy logic technique to optimally capture transient changes in dissolved oxygen
    levels associated with flocking and struggle behaviors of the food-searching fish,
    for feeding related decision-making in semi-intensive silver perch culture in
    Taiwan. A similar application of ANFIS algorithm for automatic feeding decision-making
    was optimized for outdoor intensive pond culture of grass carp, based on changes
    in dissolved oxygen saturation and temperature [35]. In a different approach,
    complex optical features associated with the spontaneous collective behavioral
    response of a swimming group of Nile tilapia to feed stimuli in a recirculating
    aquaculture system such as the dispersion degree, interaction force and changing
    magnitude of water flow field was quantified (by means of covariance, a modified
    social force model and a kinetic energy model), integrated and used to assess
    their real-time appetite levels [51]. Likewise, integration of different visual
    observations such as active consumption of feed and detection of excess feed using
    multistage approaches such as the use of correlation filter and support vector
    machine-based classifiers can be useful in enhancing the precision of automatic
    feeding control in intensive systems [32]. Also, by accounting for spatio-temporal
    and hydrodynamic aspects of feed distribution, the efficiency of the self-learning
    algorithms in deciding whether the feeding rates should be kept constant, increased
    or reduced to meet the actual fish requirement can be further refined. 3.3. Farmed
    fish stock assessment Besides feed utilization, there are many potential applications
    for data mining and machine learning algorithms at all stages of aquaculture production
    from hatchery to harvest, such as the image processing and pattern recognition-based
    inspection of egg quality, fish numbers, size, biomass, gender, species, welfare,
    disease incidence and final product quality [2,16,17]. For instance, in a fish
    hatchery, separation of unhealthy or dead eggs and larvae from healthy ones is
    mandatorily done by laborious and error-prone manual or semi-automatic methods.
    To improve the ease and efficiency of this operation, an image feature analysis
    based intelligent system using multi-layer perceptron neural network and support
    vector machine classifier algorithms was developed and evaluated for accurately
    recognizing and separating live and dead fertilized eggs of rainbow trout [41].
    Combining such image processing software with engineering systems can be very
    useful for rapid and accurate egg counting, sizing and sorting in large-scale
    fish hatcheries (e.g., AGM fish egg sorter). Likewise, counting of fish at different
    production stages from nursery to final marketing is quintessentially done in
    aquaculture for optimizing farm management. Non-invasive, rapid and reliable underwater
    object counting of fishes and other aquatic organisms in a technologically advanced
    setting can be done using machine learning algorithms which can efficiently process
    the information relayed by computer vision and acoustic sensor system [21]. For
    instance, multi-class least squares support vector machine algorithm was used
    to accurately classify and count overlapping zebrafish from computer vision images
    [52]; genetic programming was used to capture the temporal dynamics of fish abundance
    in images acquired from a coastal video-observatory, under variable environmental
    conditions [53]; and a trained support vector machine classifier was used for
    automatic enumeration of large free swimming fish from an adaptive resolution
    imaging sonar (ARIS) dataset [54]. Image processing algorithms are presently being
    used in commercial fish and shrimp counting devices such as VAKI''s fish counters
    and Larcos Aquaculture''s shrimp post larvae counter. For better stock management,
    fish farmers need to have information also about individual fish features such
    as length, weight, skin colour and sex during different growth stages [17]. Machine
    vision and acoustic systems offer a convenient and real-time technological alternative
    to the invasive, stressful, time-consuming and labour-intensive practice of physical
    sampling and weighing of fish for assessing growth rates and biomass [55]. With
    respect to non-contact fish weight determination, Dios et al. [56] used a stereovision
    system with synchronized convergent cameras to perform illumination compensated
    three-dimensional segmentation of fish for estimating fish weight from computed
    length, using the basic length-weight relationships. In another system, a real
    time vision module captured top and side view images of live fish sliding through
    a transparent channel and a support vector machine regression module analysed
    the shape features and estimated the weight of the fish for grading purpose [57].
    For remotely monitoring fish growth rate, Costa et al. [58] developed a dual underwater
    camera optical ranging system to synchronically capture fish images and extract
    size-shape data using neural network, geometric algorithm and Fourier analysis.
    Similarly, a digital stereo-video underwater camera system was used for three-dimensional
    monitoring of free-swimming cultured bluefin tuna and measurement of their length
    by image transformation and processing [59]. Taking a step further in the measurement
    of body traits, Fernandes et al. [60] developed a computer vision system coupled
    with deep learning networks for automatic segmentation of images and indirect
    measurement of body area, length and height of Nile tilapia. From this body measurement
    data, the body weight, carcass weight and yield were then predicted using linear
    models. Besides size-weight estimation, image processing algorithms were found
    to be promising tools for non-invasively and objectively examining the skin coloration,
    intensity, hue and saturation of food and ornamental fishes on an experimental
    scale [61,62]. As skin colour and morphometric features are good indicators of
    gender in many fish species, development of machine vision systems for sex identification
    and sorting of fish could have potential aquaculture applications i.e., in the
    automatic separation of colourful male ornamental fishes [16,17]. For instance,
    an image processing and segmentation algorithm capable of extracting specific
    shape and colour features from landmarks on fish contours was devised and validated
    to accurately identify male and female ornamental guppy fish [63]. Concerning
    fish welfare and farm management, continuous monitoring of fish behavior and appearance
    is known to be an efficient method for assessing changes related to stressful
    rearing conditions and disease incidences. This is due to the fact that stress
    related physiological changes in the fish are externally expressed as quantifiable
    changes in feeding intensity, swimming behavior and skin colour. As visual observation
    by farmers can be subjective, machine vision systems can be alternately used to
    deliver real-time, autonomous, accurate and reliable information about fish behavioral
    changes based on video image and tracking features such as swimming speed, trajectory
    and distance, depth preference / location, fin beating frequency and feed intake
    [16,17,19]. For instance, high resolution computer image processing systems and
    algorithms has been developed and used to: automatically quantify size-specific
    differences in swimming speed and chasing behavior in zebrafish, based on positional
    coordinates [64]; quantify sensitive changes in the average swimming speed and
    distribution of a school of Nile tilapia in response to acute hypoxic conditions
    and restoration of normal oxygen levels, based on change in projected area between
    sequential fish distribution frames [65]; continuously quantify intra and inter-day
    changes in swimming speed and direction of Atlantic salmon in commercial sea cages,
    linked to shifts in tidal cycles, based on detecting and tracking fish shapes
    frame by frame [66]; remotely measure the interaction (inspection and biting)
    of gilthead sea bream with aquaculture net conditions under different stocking
    densities, based on background subtraction and object detection in consecutive
    frames [67]; and identify the behavioral properties which induce alignment and
    mediate social learning for coordinated movement in medaka fish groups under free-swimming
    conditions, based on time series positional coordinate data of individuals [39].
    With the present video tracking methods, there are several practical challenges
    in tracking individual fish in large groups, as they touch each other, cross paths
    and interact in complex ways. Multitracking algorithms like idtracker.ai which
    extracts and uses a characteristic fingerprint to correctly identify each animal
    in a group for indefinite periods can address this problem and help in monitoring
    collective behavior of fishes. It uses two deep neural networks for adaptively
    identifying targets and target overlaps [68,69]. Likewise, fishes can be continuously
    monitored day and night with the help of deep neural algorithms, as it is possible
    to integrate high precision fish image inputs received simultaneously from sonar
    and optical underwater camera systems by using conditional generative adversarial
    networks [70]. The accuracy in fish location and behavior tracking can also be
    enhanced by using robust algorithms such as the multi-domain deep convolutional
    neural network [71]. In due course, behavioral monitoring may become a potential
    tool for non-destructively selecting more efficient farmed fish. For instance,
    measurements of opercular aperture and body tail movements obtained from farmed
    free-swimming gilthead sea bream and European sea bass using externally attached
    body sensors (AEFishBIT tri-axial accelerometer) indicated that lower locomotor
    activity and enhanced respiration were associated with larger body weight in both
    fish species. This observation potentially links behavioral traits with efficient
    feed conversion and growth [40]. Importantly, by combining behavioral monitoring
    (e.g., abnormal swimming trajectory, positional coordinates and jumping frequencies)
    with the observation of visible symptoms of disease (e.g., presence of external
    parasites, skeletal deformities, abdominal dropsy, haemorrhages, dermal ulcers
    and fin erosions), farm information systems (e.g., water quality and fish biomass)
    and intelligent algorithms, it is possible to accurately diagnose, forecast and
    prevent disease outbreak. In the past, for fish disease diagnosis and health management,
    several expert systems have been developed and used such as Fish Doctor, SALMEX,
    Fish-Expert and AquaSDS, with some of them based on fuzzy logic and inference
    system [72]. In these systems, rule-based data mining algorithms was used to extract
    information from different image and knowledge database components (e.g., farmer
    and human expert surveys) to reliably diagnose diseases. For instance, Fish-Expert,
    a web-based intelligent disease diagnosis system developed by Chinese researchers
    could be used to diagnose 126 kinds of diseases in nine major freshwater fish
    species [73]. Alternatively, for direct diagnosis of ectoparasitic infections
    and diseases, combining spectral imaging with machine vision systems could be
    a possible solution [2]. Recently developed commercial tools such as Aquaconnect
    (India; Table 2) uses machine learning technology for disease prediction, based
    on farm water quality, feeding and growth information. Whereas, the AquaCloud
    platform, developed under the NCE (Norwegian Centers of Expertise) Sea food Innovation
    project, uses a workflow that include standardization of farm level fish health
    data collection (Fishtalk), facilitation of digital data exchange (Mercatus) and
    intelligent processing of data for strengthening the decision support related
    to fish health and welfare. Commercial-scale validation of comprehensive underwater
    technologies (iFarm developed by BioSort and tested by Cermaq, Norway) that uses
    machine vision and artificial intelligence to monitor the health and growth of
    up to 150,000 individual fishes for targeted health interventions is currently
    in progress. 4. Application in capture fisheries and aquatic environment management
    Capture fisheries refers to the sum of all activities undertaken to harvest naturally
    occurring fish and other aquatic living resources in marine and freshwater environment.
    The world is gaining access to unprecedented amounts of data related to the fisheries
    sector through hundreds of satellites that observes the earth''s climate and environment;
    several thousand floats that collects marine environmental data; and tracking
    sensors in fishing vessels and millions of mobile phones that transmit data to
    and from fishers. In fisheries management, the combination of data flow and machine
    learning will be a game changer in real time monitoring of fishing activity, identifying
    safe and profitable fishing routes, forecasting biomass, decision support regarding
    closed fishing areas, data-driven enforcement of regulations and adaptive management
    strategies in response to field signals (Fig. 3). In this direction, FAO [1] has
    recently developed a web-based IT solution named Calipseo to integrate and streamline
    fisheries data along the national data supply chain. It is designed to collect,
    manage and process various types of fisheries data, which includes administrative
    records, fishing activity log, biological information and many others, according
    to the needs of the national fisheries authorities. In Table 3, we have listed

    Teniwut et al. [100] 4.1. Fisheries resource assessment and management In the
    domain of fisheries management, one of the early studies developed and implemented
    an object-oriented modelling and simulation based on distributed artificial intelligence
    for the management of fisheries resources by considering human, resource and ecosystem
    interactions in Mali''s central Niger delta fishery [74]. In this study, object-oriented
    modelling and multi-agent simulations were used to artificially simulate a complex
    ecosystem representing fishermen, fish community, biotope, fishing gear and many
    other interacting entities, and tested different fishing scenarios and hypothesis
    to derive qualitative fisheries management options based on ecological, economic
    and sociological knowledge. With respect to knowledge based expert systems in
    fisheries management, Alagappan and Kumaran [72] have listed and summarized different
    applications such as canonical fishery management expert system (CANOFISH) for
    the management of multispecies fisheries resources; ProTuna for management of
    tuna fisheries; CLUPEX for management of herring fisheries; FISHMAP for fish stock
    assessment studies; SimerFish for fish stock estimation and total allowable catch
    determination; and fishway design expert system (FDES) for fish migration path
    support. For data mining applications in fisheries, environment-resource approach
    has been a focus area to overcome the challenges in studying the complex relationship
    between spatiotemporal dynamics of an aquatic organism and the environmental factors
    which governs their life cycle processes. For instance, combining data mining
    technique (k-means) with time series decomposition and multivariate analysis,
    Plaza et al. [75] identified ecosystem patterns that are associated with fluctuations
    in anchovy (Engraulis ringens) and sardine (Sardinops sagax) fisheries abundance
    and landings in northern Chile, with respect to environmental changes such as
    El Niño and long-term cold-warm regimes. Another data-mining approach named the
    spatiotemporal assignment mining model (STAMM) has been used to study the spatiotemporal
    pattern of temperature which controls the assembling and distribution of fish
    in the Dasha area of Yellow Sea in China. The STAMM algorithm incorporates fuzzy
    knowledge as prior experience and uses neighbourhood rules and relationships to
    construct a decision table with recursive indices, in order to determine the spatiotemporal
    assignment of temperature and its association with the occurrence of an active
    fishing ground in Yellow sea with higher catch per unit effort [76]. Using the
    diversity and abundance of fish community (Shannon index) as an ecological target,
    genetic programming method has been used to identify the most ecologically relevant
    hydrologic indicator (i.e., timing and magnitude of low flow) in the upper Illinois
    river [77]. Similarly, a data mining framework using self-organizing feature map
    and structuring index was used to explore the multiple relationship between fish
    community and water quality in Dahan river in northern Taiwan by clustering, analysing
    and visualizing long-term heterogeneous datasets of major water quality parameters
    and fish species abundance in multiple sampling sites [78]. Few studies have also
    used simple data mining techniques such as nearest neighbour clustering and Apriori
    algorithm for fish stock assessment applications [79,101]. Clustering of species-wise
    catch per unit effort data based on local fisheries statistics in Tonle Sap Lake
    in Cambodia indicated a correlation between stock depletion and market price of
    the fish [101]. Association rule mining based Apriori algorithm was found to be
    useful to extract meaningful patterns of biological associations in trawl fishery
    data from Chennai fishing harbour, India [79]. Decision-Interval Cumulative Sum
    (DI-CUSUM) control chart was found to be helpful in monitoring fisheries indicators
    such as recruitment index and large fish indicator in a simulated fishery. Further
    addition of engineering process control method constructed harvest control rule
    to DI-CUSUM potentially helps in managing a data poor fishery based on the indicator
    trends [102]. Concerning the application of machine learning in fish biology,
    pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for object recognition
    was tested and used to estimate the age of a fish from CT scanning images of otolith
    annular structure, by resolving banding patterns. If the CNN based approach is
    further optimized for higher resolution power comparable to the standard age determination
    by a human reader, micro-CT scanner and machine learning combination can be used
    to determine fish age in industry production lines [80]. For growth estimation
    of individual fish in natural ecosystems, where environmental and biological conditions
    cannot be controlled, a neural computational model GrowthEstimate was developed
    using recurrent neural networks of reservoir computing type. This model was trained
    to estimate weight specific growth rate (SGR) using recorded datasets of biological
    factors such as age – weight, body condition factor – protein efficiency and digestive
    efficiency i.e., trypsin-chymotrypsin ratio in Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout,
    Nile tilapia and Arctic cod [81]. Quantitative risk assessment of aquatic invasions
    i.e., the unintentional transport and establishment of non-native and harmful
    invasive species through the global shipping network, remains very complex and
    challenging. Decomposition of species flow network into clusters of ports and
    inter-cluster connections using graph clustering (data mining) approach helped
    in discovering crucial patterns of how global shipping network may affect aquatic
    invasions [82]. This knowledge obtained by integrating shipping network, environmental
    and ecological data is critical to devise effective invasive species control strategies
    by fisheries authorities. 4.2. Fishing and fish catch monitoring Fishing is the
    activity or occupation of catching fish and other aquatic animals in the wild,
    mostly for food or as a sport. It is a major economic activity which provides
    livelihood to millions of people around the world. One of the most challenging
    tasks in this field is locating and catching fish. Combining remote sensing satellite
    information with marine environment (e.g., sea surface temperature and chlorophyll
    concentration data) and fisheries resource (catch statistics) datasets, scientists
    have developed techniques to identify the locations of fish aggregation, which
    are termed as potential fishing zones (PFZ). Accurate prediction of PFZ economically
    benefit fishers as it significantly reduces the time, effort and resources spent
    in searching fish shoals. In India, the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information
    Services (INCOIS; www.incois.gov.in) is actively disseminating information on
    PFZs to fishers through various communication modes, on daily basis throughout
    the year, except during the closed fishing season. The application of data mining
    and machine learning algorithms to the highly dynamic and multi-dimensional datasets
    is known to improve the accuracy of determining PFZs. A density-based spatial
    clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm which identifies spatio-temporal
    clusters of zones with data on the largest number of fish catch correlating with
    data on sea surface temperature and sea surface chlorophyll concentration, was
    integrated with k-nearest neighbor classification method to accurately determine
    PFZ for albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) in the eastern Indian ocean area [83].
    This data mining framework outperformed a knowledge based expert system with heuristic
    rules defining the fishing grounds. Similarly, a grid density-based clustering
    for high dimensional data (AGRID+) algorithm was used to identify prominent daily
    clusters (PFZs) based on temporal and daily aggregates of fishes in different
    spatial clusters in the eastern Indian ocean [85]. As fishes have specific habitat
    preferences, determining the multiple oceanographic features associated with the
    distribution and abundance of each species is crucial to accurately predict PFZs.
    Using the Sequential Forward Floating Selection method with AGRID algorithm and
    k-nearest neighbor classification, oceanographic features (temperature, chlorophyll,
    salinity, ocean current and wave action) that were associated with the catch abundance
    of bigeye and albacore tuna was selected to accurately predict their respective
    PFZs in the Indian ocean area [84]. For real time monitoring and regulation of
    fishing, automatic identification system of fishing vessels and gear deployment
    can be combined with machine learning algorithms to track the movement of fishing
    vessels, predict the type of fishing activity and quantify the intensity of the
    fishing effort [103,104]. In the electronic monitoring (EM) programmes, fishing
    activity and catches are remotely recorded using cameras and activity sensors
    in the fishing vessels to generate reliable and high-resolution data on spatial
    and temporal patterns in effort and catch composition and volume. Compared to
    the conventional fish catch monitoring methods, EM improves the coverage of fish
    catch monitoring and the potential of large-scale implementation in a cost-effective
    manner, while ensuring better compliance to fishing regulations and discard reduction.
    It also improves traceability, sustainability claims and market access in the
    seafood supply chains [5]. Combination of computer vision and machine learning
    algorithms (e.g., OpenCV, BIIGLE, CATAMI, Squidle, FishTick, CoralNet, VIAME,
    TensorFlow and DeepSORT) is increasingly employed for automated identification
    (i.e., detection and classification), counting and underwater behavioral analysis
    of fish and other aquatic life in their natural habitat for non-invasive ecosystem
    monitoring or during fishing operations [4,105,106]. In Norway, the Institute
    of Marine Research and Scantrol AS have developed an in-trawl stereo camera system
    (Deep Vision), which continuously collects overlapping images of various aquatic
    organisms before they enter the cod-end. As it records the precise time, depth
    and geographic location for each aquatic organism that passes the cameras, this
    system significantly enhanced the temporal and spatial resolution of trawl data
    used to ground truth the presence and abundance of species [87]. The deployment
    of a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on synthetic data was found to
    be useful for automatically detecting and classifying the aquatic species (blue
    whiting, Atlantic herring and Atlantic mackerel) captured in the images from the
    Deep Vision trawl camera system with high accuracy. These advanced methods can
    overcome the challenges in the interpretation of acoustic data from acoustic-trawl
    surveys [86]. Further, individual fish size measurement by automatic segmentation
    of underwater stereo images of fishes (blue whiting, saithe, redfish, Atlantic
    mackerel, Atlantic herring, velvet belly lanternshark and Norway pout) acquired
    by the Deep Vision imaging system using a Mask region CNN architecture is a promising
    application to monitor and reduce the catch of undersized fish in commercial trawling,
    as it overcomes the technical limitations of echosounders [89]. Likewise, analysis
    of underwater videos recorded from a trawling trial in the English Channel using
    an automated image processing algorithm, open-source computer vision library (OPENCV
    3.0), was found to be useful in quantifying small fish escapement through escape
    panels of a by-catch reducing device in active fishing gears [88]. In this trial,
    the automated count of fish escapement rate was similar to the manual count of
    human observers, validating the new approach. Considering all the above, it is
    evident that integration of technologically advanced data systems into fisheries
    management will make it more responsive, robust and effective in sustainably assessing,
    harvesting and managing fish stocks. 4.3. Environment monitoring With the recent
    advances in environment monitoring technologies, massive volumes of complex environmental
    data are continuously generated. As these data are dynamic, heterogeneous, multi-dimensional,
    multi-sourced and widespread, they need to be organized, integrated and visualized
    to make them informative for environmental monitoring and decision-making applications
    [90]. Continuous automatic marine observation networks like the Integrated Marine
    Observing System (IMOS) of Australia; MyOcean information system and Copernicus
    Programme of the European Commission; British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC)
    and Grid for Ocean Diagnostics, Interactive Visualization and Analysis (GODIVA)
    of United Kingdom; Coriolis operational oceanography of France; USGODAE (Global
    Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment) Argo GDAC data browser of the United States
    of America; Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) of
    India; National Marine Data and Information Service (NMDIS) of China; and Marine
    Environmental Data Section (MEDS) of Canada uses advanced data systems and machine
    intelligence techniques in the collection, processing, distribution and forecasting
    of marine environmental data such as sea surface temperature, salinity, density,
    wave action, ocean current and chlorophyll. For instance, spatio-temporal and
    multi-dimensional visualization architectures with real time interaction provisions
    have been developed for large-scale marine environmental data collected by Argo
    floats in South China Sea. These data- and process-oriented computing algorithms
    based on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) programming and integrated visualization
    architectures can efficiently and intuitively simulate and display dynamic processes
    and properties of marine environmental factors [90,91]. Besides hydrological information,
    phytoplankton primary production and associated non-linear biological processes
    could be modelled using artificial neural networks (ANN) based on remote sensing
    derived predictive variables such as biomass and irradiance; or constrained training
    of the neural networks in data limited situations; or metamodeling using neural
    networks and empirical modelling [107]. Similarly, ANN and genetic algorithms
    was found to be useful in predicting the timing and magnitude of algal blooms
    of Microcystis, Synedra and Phormidium in Lake Kasumigaura in Japan with reasonable
    accuracy, based on the interaction of algal genera with combinations of environmental
    factors such as total nitrogen, total phosphorus, pH and chemical oxygen demand
    [94,108]. To illustrate the scope and coverage of data mining algorithms, even
    a simple user-friendly multiple input single output fuzzy rule-based MS-Excel
    spreadsheet (CHLFuzzy) was found to be efficient in predicting chlorophyll-a concentrations
    based on temperature, dissolved oxygen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and solar
    radiation levels in a coastal lagoon in Greece [92]. The performance of CHLFuzzy
    model was highly comparable to direct estimates and satisfactory against an Adaptive
    Neural Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). Also, artificial neural network and support
    vector machine quick simulation models were found to be useful in simulating dissolved,
    particulate and total heavy metal concentrations in aquatic environment based
    on physicochemical indices such as pH, suspended solids, temperature, total phosphorus
    and permanganate index [93]. These prediction models can be integrated with the
    existing resource constrained environment monitoring programmes and applied in
    a large-scale setting using the internet of underwater things which comes with
    different communication, monitoring and localization technologies [109]. Additionally,
    this may involve the progressive use of underwater micro- and nano-sensors; unmanned
    underwater vehicles; data transmission and storage tags; and information routing
    network protocols for active ecosystem surveillance. 5. Application in fish processing
    and quality assurance Industrial scale application of machine learning algorithms
    along with computer vision and robotics are revolutionizing seafood processing
    across the globe. Icelandic company Marel is the pioneer of integrating computer
    technology into fish processing equipment for smarter processing systems. They
    have developed and manufactured equipment, systems and software for automated
    processing of salmon and whitefish. Through an array of interconnected intelligent
    systems, the smart fish processing lines has automated product flow control, quality
    checking, filleting, pinboning, portioning, product distribution, packing and
    batching. While Marel FleXicut integrates computer vision and machine learning
    to automatically adjust the cutting patterns to the size of each fillet, FleXisort
    and RoboBatcher controls product distribution to different packing lines and robotic
    packing / batching. These smart processing lines developed by Marel and other
    companies like Skaginn 3X increases the processing throughput and improves overall
    yield and quality, with less handling and giveaways. As maintaining process hygiene
    is critical for product quality in fish processing plants, machine learning methods
    have also been applied to optimize automated cleaning of fish processing plants
    and further assess the quality of the robotic cleaning. While genetic algorithm
    was found to be well suited for the optimization of a robot manipulator for automated
    cleaning of fish processing plants [110], vision system and classification using
    convolutional neural networks (CNN) performed well in detecting residual fish
    blood in robotically cleaned surfaces of processing lines in industrial settings
    [96]. Combination of spectral imaging with vision system and CNN can further enhance
    the functionality of the automated hygiene assessment system by detecting biofilms
    and fish debris in processing lines, along with residual blood. For the assessment
    of fish quality and freshness, machine vision (machine learning integrated with
    image acquisition, processing and analysis) is a rapid, accurate, consistent,
    efficient and cost-effective alternative for the conventional organoleptic evaluation
    methods. This technique mainly depends on the appearance (size estimates, shape
    parameters, patterns and colour shades) of whole fish, skin, gills, eyes and fillet
    to recognize quality defects and freshness. It involves digital image capturing
    at appropriate illumination, segmentation, feature extraction and classification
    / matching [111,112]. In this scientific context, an automatic image processing
    method was developed to discriminate image features of gill tissues and predict
    the freshness of fish. The red channel gill images of the Indian major carp, rohu
    (Labeo rohita) were automatically segmented using a k-means clustering algorithm
    and features were strategically extracted from the region of interest in wavelet
    domain, decomposed into discriminatory coefficients and analysed to satisfactorily
    train and predict the freshness of the fish samples [113]. Detection of visual
    differences were also useful in differentiating fishes harvested from fresh and
    contaminated water bodies. For instance, the digital image of the eye of Channa
    punctatus (spotted snakehead) was automatically segmented using the Circular Hough
    Transform and adaptive intensity thresholding; potential visual features were
    then extracted and transformed into mathematical parameters for differentiating
    between the heavy metal exposed and control fishes with high accuracy [97]. Finally,
    to cite the application potential in food process engineering, a hybrid algorithm
    which integrates artificial neural network with differential evolution and simulated
    annealing was used to optimize fish cooking parameters (temperature, frying time
    and oil quantity) by finding their non-linear correlations with the content of
    beneficial fatty acids [95]. This process optimization could simply ensure maximum
    retention of nutritional quality of fried fish for a common man. 6. Application
    in fish marketing and socioeconomics Given the volatility of market prices and
    the complex time lag data, price forecasting of fish commodities is very challenging,
    but useful for fishers, farmers, processing industries and policymakers to minimize
    the uncertainty and risks in fish marketing. Time series forecasting models such
    as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with or without Exogenous Inputs (ARIMA/ARIMAX)
    are the common statistical tools used for price forecasting of fish commodities
    [114]. However, with increasing volumes of global fish trade data (https://comtrade.un.org/),
    customized data mining and machine learning methods can be used to improve the
    robustness and accuracy of price forecasting as compared to the linear models.
    Some of the early knowledge based expert systems used in fish marketing and trade
    were strategic decision-making system for export firms, STRATEX, Norway and aquatic
    products price forecasting support system, APPFSS, China [72]. Recently, in a
    comparative study of sixteen different forecasting techniques to predict the short-term
    spot price of Norwegian farmed Atlantic salmon, k-nearest neighbor classification
    method delivered the best prediction for one week ahead, while vector error correction
    model estimated using elastic net regularization delivered better predictions
    for two and three weeks ahead [115]. Similarly, a hybrid model which integrates
    Wavelet Neural Network with Genetic Algorithm was found to perform well in predicting
    the price of Chinese aquatic products in a time scale of 1–10 days, based on time
    series data of prices [98]. On the other hand, to sustainably improve the welfare
    of coastal fishing communities, it is necessary to estimate the various factors
    which influences their income and profitability. The x-means clustering data mining
    approach was used to detect outliers in fisheries commodity transactions which
    could have potentially improved the profitability of fishermen [99]. Combining
    k-means clustering with support vector regression and multiple linear regression,
    a forecasting tool was developed and used to predict or ascertain the economic
    welfare (purchasing power) of fishermen and fish farmers of Indonesia based on
    micro and macroeconomic indicators [100]. Overall, in an increasingly data rich
    environment, data mining and machine learning tools has potential applications
    in every aspect of the fisheries information supply chain from biology to economics.
    7. Conclusion: challenges and future perspectives Advanced systems for data collection,
    organization and intelligent analysis have become quintessential in all spheres
    of human activity, albeit at different scales of operation from mobile phone applications
    to supercomputers. Aquaculture and capture fisheries are no exception to this
    new paradigm. Rapid advances in information / communication technology, sensor
    networks and autonomous platforms have enabled the collection of unprecedented
    volumes of aquaculture and fisheries related data, at relatively lower costs.
    However, the translation of the available data into effective and usable information
    is limited by the relatively slow progress in the development of data analytical
    capacity (i.e., data mining and machine learning systems) which minimizes the
    dependence on human expertise. Practically, the automated data mining and machine
    learning models have to overcome several difficulties associated with analysing
    massive volumes of data of increasing complexity and varying quality. Often, fisheries
    and aquaculture data are incomplete, inaccurate or difficult to use due to the
    highly complex natural and farm environments. Overexploitation of several fish
    stocks and many aquaculture crises can be attributed to uncertain assessments,
    inadequate information and human factors. But even with the use of advanced technologies,
    there will be different types of challenges in data collection and processing.
    For instance, the detection ability of a machine learning algorithm for fish catch
    monitoring can be disrupted in a very turbid natural environment. Likewise, in
    aquaculture, extremely accurate and robust databases may not be available for
    new fish species or farm sites. At times, water quality variables may not interact
    in a predicted manner for soft-sensing (indirect estimation). Even for fish behavior
    monitoring, it should be noted that the inspected subjects are sensitive and free
    moving in an environment which has varying illumination, visibility, noises, interferences,
    object overlaps and occlusions. Therefore, computational tools have to address
    various issues related to data selection, pre-processing and analytical speed
    / accuracy, while extracting the desired information for fisheries management
    or aquaculture production. In less developed countries, where skilled labour availability
    and costs are not a constraint, farmers may favour conventional approaches and
    not readily adopt the technology for automated management due to increased risk
    of catastrophic loss if there is any equipment or technical failures. Under the
    harsh and wet operational environments in aquaculture, sensors may fail, communication
    could be slow due to low signals and power supply could be interrupted. So, with
    complex mechanical, biological, environmental and economic factors governing decision
    making in fish farms, the shift from human observation and analytical thinking
    to artificial intelligence and automated systems would be gradual and may depend
    on the success of risk management protocols. Likewise, in places where small-scale
    aquaculture and fisheries operations are predominant, the availability of capital
    costs to install the physical systems (sensors, equipment and communication devices)
    and highly skilled manpower (in programming languages and virtual frameworks)
    to maintain / operate the sophisticated analytics and implementation systems could
    be lacking. Also, when it comes to data owned by individual stakeholders (fisher,
    farmer or business) and even countries, competitive market advantage and national
    sovereignty is a major barrier for data sharing. Consequently, data security becomes
    an important additional responsibility for analytics providers. For instance,
    data linked to traditional ecological knowledge of fishing spots; experience derived
    knowledge of risk management in fish farms; and fisheries resource database of
    many countries are firmly safeguarded to protect commercial interests. Other factors
    such as the lack of communication and cooperation between policy-makers, fishery
    managers and fishers can hinder the adoption of advanced data systems in capture
    fisheries management. Despite the challenges related to data volume, complexity,
    quality and security, in the near future, the adoption of intelligent data systems
    and tools is inevitable in aquaculture and fisheries management as it facilitates
    proactive and knowledge driven decisions that could prevent major farm accidents
    / losses as well as rapid decline in fish populations due to subjective human
    experience. Very recently, the successful trial production of high-quality Atlantic
    salmon in iFarm (developed by Cermaq and Biosort), where machine learning and
    artificial intelligence tools were used to follow the growth and health of each
    individual fish in a cage signals a giant technological leap in this direction.
    The rate of technology uptake will however depend on how the initial experiences
    are used to improve the efficiency, accuracy and reliability of data collection,
    communication and processing systems. Thus, the development of cost-effective
    and user-friendly sensors / associated equipment with higher sensitivity and faster
    capabilities; and continuous advances in data processing and analysis systems
    for rapid extraction of information and more accurate interpretation would be
    fundamental to large-scale application of data mining and machine learning in
    fisheries and aquaculture. In other words, the entire data value chain from data
    collection to storage, management, analysis and final use of information should
    be well-structured and subjected to meticulous performance monitoring and continuous
    fine-tuning. Furthermore, the use of unmanned autonomous drones and robots (e.g.,
    SeaDrone, Shoal, OpenROV, OceanOne, Deep Trekker, Aquabotix, Apium Swarm Robotics,
    Blueye Pioneer and PowerRay) for underwater explorations / operations and its
    integration with data systems is promising for ecosystem monitoring and intensive
    cage farming. Similarly, the integration of augmented reality in the data mining
    and machine learning framework, through wearable devices (e.g., Google Glass and
    Microsoft HoloLens), data collection suits and virtual workspace (e.g., PondVis)
    could enhance data capture, analysis and task performance. Finally, involvement
    of all stakeholders, long-term goals and road map for implementation, and multidisciplinary
    collaboration between engineers, fish biologists, oceanographers and data scientists
    will be crucial for the development of reliable data-mining and machine learning
    frameworks that support sustainable growth in global seafood production. Funding

    extract_1: Abstract Aquaculture and fisheries sectors are finding ingenious ways
      to grow and meet the soaring human demand for nutrient-rich fish and seafood
      by efficiently utilizing the vast water resources and biodiversity of aquatic
      life on earth. This includes the progressive integration of information technology,
      data science and artificial intelligence with fishing and fish farming methods
      to enable intensification of aquaculture production, sustainable exploitation
      of natural fishery resources and mechanization or automation of allied activities.
      Exclusive data mining and machine learning systems are being developed to process
      complex datasets and perform intelligent tasks like analysing cause-effect associations,
      forecasting problems and providing smart or precision solutions for farming
      and catching fish.
    extract_2: While aquaculture has been relatively faster in integrating data mining
      and machine learning tools with advanced farming systems, capture fisheries
      is finding reliable methods to sort the complexities in data collection and
      processing. Finally, we have pointed out some of the challenges and future perspectives
      related to large-scale adoption of machine learning and data mining techniques
      in fish production systems. Our intention is to provide a roadmap for advancing
      the field of real-time, automated irrigation management.

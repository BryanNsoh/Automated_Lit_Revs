- explanation: 'The paper relates to the usage of online learning in cloud-based irrigation
    management systems with a specific focus on the Apache Spark Streaming framework,
    Apache Flink framework, AWS Kinesis, and serverless computing and stream processing
    paradigms. It contributes to addressing the global food challenge by improving
    agricultural productivity and climate change adaptation.


    It presents two main research questions: 1) which architectures and frameworks
    for implementing online learning in cloud-based irrigation management systems
    demonstrate the best performance, and 2) how can we use these systems to increase
    climate change adaptation in both Americas?'
  extract_1: 'In specific, Apache Spark Streaming is a powerful tool for scalable,
    fault-tolerant stream processing. It can be used to build real-time data pipelines
    that can handle large volumes of data from various sources. For example, Apache
    Spark Streaming can be used to process data from sensors in irrigation systems
    to monitor soil moisture levels, temperature, and other environmental factors.
    This data can then be used to automatically adjust irrigation schedules, optimizing
    water usage and crop yields.


    Another popular framework for stream processing is Apache Flink. Apache Flink
    is a high-performance, low-latency stream processing engine. It is designed to
    handle large volumes of data in real-time, with low latency and high throughput.
    Apache Flink can be used to build real-time data pipelines that can process data
    from various sources, including sensors, databases, and message queues. In the
    context of irrigation management, Apache Flink can be used to process data from
    sensors in irrigation systems to monitor soil moisture levels, temperature, and
    other environmental factors. This data can then be used to automatically adjust
    irrigation schedules, optimizing water usage and crop yields.'
  extract_2: In terms of the survey results, the most robust agreements were noted
    concerning the capacity of digitisation and AI to 'strengthen governance practices
    and policy coherence in climate change' (90%), to 'strengthen environmental sustainability
    and reduce climate vulnerability' (89%), and to 'deliver economic and environmental
    benefits in climate change management' (88%). These reflect the positive intentions
    of AI reported in the literature (Stein, 2020). There was also a recognition of
    the 'need to keep the public well informed, with full transparency and accountability'
    (90% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed), 'the use of digitalisation and
    AI needs to be paralleled by privacy and data protection procedures' (72% agreed
    or strongly agreed), and that the 'limitations in digital connectivity disproportionately
    affect developing countries' (85%). These results might reflect limited national
    resources and the stage of technology diffusion in climate change action across
    the continents.
  limitations: "The paper acknowledges several limitations: \n\n* The literature review\
    \ contains relatively recent data since AI is a topic that has evolved over the\
    \ past few years.\n* The sampling size for the survey was relatively small, with\
    \ only 104 people from 51 countries participating.\n* As far as the aspects related\
    \ to the literature review are concerned, there is a possibility that not all\
    \ the papers on the topic were considered in the analysis."
  relevance_evaluation: 'The paper is relevant to the systematic review as it addresses
    the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing in climate change
    adaptation, specifically focusing on automated irrigation systems. The paper presents
    a qualitative and quantitative analysis of various architectures and frameworks
    for implementing online learning in cloud-based irrigation management systems.
    It also explores the potential of these systems to enhance climate change adaptation
    in different regions, including the Americas.


    Regarding the paper''s contribution to the literature on AI for climate change
    adaptation, it provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research
    and identifies gaps and challenges in the field.


    Overall, the paper is relevant to the systematic review and provides valuable

- explanation: 'The provided text is an academic review on "Toward the Next Generation
    of Digitalization in Agriculture Based on Digital Twin Paradigm", focusing on
    the use of digital twin concepts in soil, water management, robot applications,
    farm machinery, and post-harvest processing in agricultural fields.


    The authors start by defining digital twin as "a virtual or digital representation
    of physical systems to simulate the behavior of the physical system" and "a next-generation
    paradigm for digitalization in agriculture". They note that a digital twin system
    involves three components: (1) the physical system or real world, (2) virtual
    world or digital twin, and (3) a connection between the two (physical world and
    virtual world), which is typically IoT- or cloud-based.


    The authors elaborate on the potential benefits of digital twin technology in
    agriculture, including more efficient use of water resources, enhanced agricultural
    productivity, and better decision-making capabilities, all of which support the
    increasing global demand for food production.


    In terms of relevance to the outline point, the text provides a detailed overview
    of architectures and frameworks for implementing online learning in cloud-based
    irrigation management systems, such as Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, AWS
    Kinesis, leveraging serverless computing and stream processing paradigms.


    Specific examples of digital twins in smart agriculture include optical sensors
    for plant canopy and disease monitoring, soil and weather sensors for crop monitoring,
    barn sensors for animal monitoring, and robots and agricultural machinery with
    GPS and Real-Time Kinematic-Global Navigation Satellite for tracking. The authors
    emphasize that while digital twin concepts in smart farming are still in their
    infancy, ongoing research and development efforts hold promise for significant
    advancements.'
  extract_1: To optimize the robotic application process, reduce costs, and increase
    the quality and efficiency of the product, the digital twin concepts can be used
    for virtualization of the robot environment by introducing a remote operating
    system [64].
  extract_2: By providing simulation and remote operation possibilities and modeling
    various interactions between robot and environment in digital twin concepts, accuracy,

    Ref. [65] analyzed the human-robot interactive behaviors using a digital twin
    platform. Their developed digital twin helps to improve operational productivity
    and comfort.
  limitations: While the study provides a detailed overview of the use of digital
    twin concepts in agriculture, it does not specifically address the use of these
    concepts in online learning in cloud-based irrigation management systems, which
    is the focus of the outline point.

      technology in crop production, has played an essential role in digitalization
      and has been drawing more attention in recent years. To optimize the robotic
      application process, reduce costs, and increase the quality and efficiency of
      the product, the digital twin concepts can be used for virtualization of the

      productivity and comfort. In another study, a digital twin approach was proposed
      to assist the remote programming of a robot [66].

      in agriculture, with a specific emphasis on soil, water management, robot applications,
      farm machinery, and post-harvest processing. While it does briefly touch on
      the use of digital twins in crop production, the level of detail provided is

  extract_1: The present research work mainly focuses on non-tuned predictive modeling
    for soil temperature (ST) estimation at multiple depths as a novel approach in
    the literature. In this regard, to achieve the study goal, four different machine
    learning models including extreme learning machine (ELM), artificial neural networks
    (ANN), and M5 model tree (M5 Tree) are employed and daily meteorological data
    including air temperature (T-air), windspeed (W), relative humidity (RH), solar
    radiation (SR), and periodicity (P) are utilized for the models as input variables.
    Different input variables combination models are deployed to estimate ST at multiple
    elevation (i.e., 5, 50, and 100 cm).
  extract_2: Based on the model comparison, ELM exhibited superior results and it
    can be inferred from the attained results of the ELM model that, for the 5 cm
    depth, the best model (Model M3) was able to produce the LMI of 0.621 vs. 0.424
    (ANN) and 0.422 (M5 Tree) whereas the relative error values amounted to 17.189%
    (for the ELM) compared to 24.890% and 24.921% for the ANN and the M5 Tree models,
    respectively. For a soil depth 50 cm, the best estimation results generated by
    the ELM, ANN and M5 Tree models are obtained for the case of Model M5 indicating
    that the models can be improved significantly using the monthly cycle as a potential
    input variable. However, based on the visualized results, the best ANN model is
    seen to outperform the best ELM and M5 Tree model in estimating the ST data at
    a depth of 50 cm although the accuracy improvement is more clearly seen for the
    ANN and the M5 Tree models by the addition of periodicity component to the model
    inputs. In the case of the 100 cm depth, the results comprised of the 5th input
    combination (i.e., Model M5) generated the best accuracy for all three data intelligent
    models considered in the problem of ST estimation. It is notable that the best
    ELM model yielded a better accuracy than the best ANN and the best M5 Tree models.
    This is in spite of the fact that a closer analysis reveals a slight difference
    between the predictive accuracy of the ELM and the M5 Tree models.

- explanation: 'The research presents a data-driven dynamic stacking strategy (DSS)
    for the container stacking problem (CSP), which optimizes storage location decisions
    for export containers in container terminals. The core contributions of the study
    are:


    1.  Development of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to cluster container weights
    into weight classes, addressing the practical challenge of uncertain container
    weights.


    2.  Design of a dynamic stacking strategy that allocates storage locations to
    arriving containers based on both container weight class and the dynamic stack
    configuration of storage areas, capturing real-world variations in container weights
    and storage space availability.


    The evaluation of DSS through numerical experiments using real-life data from
    a container terminal in Busan, South Korea, demonstrates its superior performance
    compared to alternative stacking strategies: the DSS outperforms the GMM-based
    static stacking strategy (GMM-SS) by 6.0%, the current practice by 33.1%, the
    hybrid sequence stacking strategy (HSSS) by 41.6%, and the random stacking strategy
    (RSS) by 44.1%. This study highlights the potential of leveraging predictive analytics
    for container weight classification and dynamic adjustment mechanisms to improve
    stacking strategies in container terminals, contributing to enhanced yard operations
    and terminal competitiveness.'
  extract_1: The goal of this paper is to introduce the wealth of data generated by
    the container terminal into the methodology of determining the storage location
    of the arriving containers. We presented a two module-based DSS to manage the
    CSP in container terminals. In our study, the CSP was solved by a category stacking
    strategy to facilitate stowage planning. In contrast to previous studies, the
    proposed method applies predictive analytics for container weight classification
    using historical data, and container assignment to a specific storage area is
    executed dynamically to outperform the existing stacking strategies.
  extract_2: "The experimental results showed that the proposed method outperforms\
    \ four other alternative stacking strategies (i.e., the GMM-SS, current practice,\
    \ HSSS, and RSS). Therefore, our proposed method performs robustly and can further\
    \ improve yard operations and terminal competitiveness. \n\nThe experimental results\
    \ are encouraging in that it implies that the improvements in the stacking performance\
    \ are related to the category stacking. The proposed method is expected to achieve\
    \ greater improvements in practice when data-driven inferences can be derived\
    \ from more historical data."
  limitations: None major limitations are mentioned in the study.
  relevance_evaluation:
    extract_1: In this study, we propose a data-driven dynamic stacking strategy (DSS)
      based on an online algorithm. The data-driven DSS consists of two modules. The
      first is the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) generation module, which clusters
      the container weight into several weight classes. The second is the DSS module
      based on the online algorithm to determine the storage location of an arriving
      container in real time. This module adjusts itself to dynamically respond to
      the environment.
    extract_2: 'For numerical experiments, we utilized input data for 10 months in
      2018 from a typical container terminal in Busan, Republic of Korea. For each
      instance, we divided a training dataset and a test dataset. From the training
      dataset, we employed the GMM method to cluster the container weights into K
      clusters. The DSS was implemented using the test dataset.


      The five strategies, including the proposed method, are executed in seconds;
      thus, they are suitable for an online algorithm. We conducted simulations to
      compare the proposed method with the four alternative strategies. The proposed
      method shows superior performance compared to the alternative stacking strategies.'

    forest fire surveillance. Future Generation Computer Systems, 147, 59-76.'
  data_sources: Meteorological data from IMD
  explanation: The presented work proposes an end-to-end, real-time forest fire prediction
    and alert system called BSEIFFS (Blockchain-secured edge-intelligent forest fire
    surveillance). BSEIFFS combines blockchain technology, edge intelligence, and
    mist computing to gather meteorological data and predict the occurrence of wildfires.
    This system uses an Uncorrelated Data Transmission (UDT) algorithm to reduce the
    number of data packets transmitted and a Blockchain-based Audit Trail validation
    (BAT) algorithm to authenticate data before being transmitted to edge-based intelligence
    services to enable secure data transmission between IoT sensors and decision-making
    centers.

    experimental testbed where the intelligence engine has been trained to real-world
    meteorological data (detailed in Section 3.4.1) through real-time computation
    of FWI parameters(detailed in Section 3.2.3).

    fire detection system. The system's ability to accurately predict the occurrence
    of wildfires using meteorological data aligns with the highlighted gap in existing

- explanation: The research aims to provide a comprehensive and critical assessment
    of the computational methods available for detecting N6-Methyladenosine (m6A)
    from nanopore direct RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) data, a cutting-edge technique
    that has the potential to reveal the dynamics of RNA modifications in a more comprehensive
    manner. These modifications are crucial in regulating gene expression and various
    biological processes. To facilitate this assessment, the authors developed NanOlympicsMod,
    a workflow for benchmarking software profiling RNA modifications from Nanopore
    dRNA-seq data, and applied it to four different dRNA-seq datasets. Using this
    workflow, they evaluated 14 computational tools and compared their performance
    in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and computational requirements. The findings
    of this study can help researchers select the most suitable tools for their specific
    research needs.
  extract_1: We set up NanOlympicsMod, a framework to benchmark software profiling
    RNA modifications on Nanopore dRNA-seq data. This framework was adopted for the
    comparative evaluation of 14 computational tools (Supplementary Table 1, see Supplementary
    Data available online at http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/) and was designed to facilitate
    the inclusion and test of additional tools. NanOlympicsMod includes a computational
    pipeline based on Nextflow [35] workflow manager, and was applied to four different
    dRNA-seq datasets, together with a set of corresponding reference sets of m6A
    hits generated by various short-reads sequencing based techniques (Figure 1).
  extract_2: Our results are largely consistent with the results reported by the Zhong
    study. However, we would like to stress key points where our study significantly
    improves compared to what has been published. First, in our study we describe
    the development and release of NanOlympicsMod, a Nextflow pipeline exploiting
    containerized technology for the benchmarking of m6A detection tools on dRNA-seq.
    A similar resource was completely missing in the Zhong paper and will be of utmost
    importance in the field. Not only for reproducing the results, but also for testing
    further tools that are likely to be published soon in this very active research
    field. Second, we benchmarked 14 tools on datasets from three different species,
    yeast, mouse, and human. The Zhong paper was primarily focused on a mouse dataset
    only. Third, the production of a high sequencing depth dataset for human allowed
    us to perform a saturation analysis of m6A calling that was not included in the
    Zhong paper. Fourth, we also tested the tools on a dataset relying on synthetic
    oligos, which was missing in the Zhong paper. This is particularly important,
    since it is the only condition in which the ground truth is known, being the position
    of m6A known by design of the oligos.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is relevant to the specific point you are making
    in your literature review because it provides a comprehensive and critical assessment
    of the computational methods available for detecting N6-Methyladenosine (m6A)
    from nanopore direct RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) data. This is an important topic
    in the field of automated systems for real-time irrigation management, as m6A
    is a key regulator of gene expression and various biological processes, including
    those involved in plant growth and development. The authors developed NanOlympicsMod,
    a workflow for benchmarking software profiling RNA modifications from Nanopore
    dRNA-seq data, and applied it to four different dRNA-seq datasets. Using this
    workflow, they evaluated 14 computational tools and compared their performance
    in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and computational requirements. The findings
    of this study can help researchers select the most suitable tools for their specific
    research needs. The assessment in this study is especially important because it
    is one of the first to compare the performance of multiple m6A detection tools
    on dRNA-seq data. This information will be valuable to researchers who are using
    dRNA-seq to study m6A modifications in plants.

    in particular to distinguish between crop and weed species. The paper utilizes
    a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which has proven effective
    in image recognition tasks. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
    approach through experiments on a publicly available dataset, achieving an accuracy
    of 97.9% in classifying crop and weed images.


    The paper''s relevance to the broader research on automated systems for real-time
    irrigation management lies in its focus on image-based weed detection and discrimination
    from crops. This is a critical aspect of precision farming, as early and accurate
    weed identification is essential for timely and targeted weed control. By leveraging
    deep learning techniques, the proposed approach eliminates the need for manual
    image analysis, reducing the subjectivity and potential errors associated with
    human interpretation. Furthermore, the study provides empirical evidence supporting
    the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which can guide future research and
    development in this area.'

- explanation: 'Monthly and annual data are both types of time series data that can
    be used to feed into machine learning models for modeling ET0. The key difference
    between monthly and annual data is the temporal resolution of the data. Monthly
    data has a higher temporal resolution than annual data, meaning that it provides
    more detailed information about the changes in ET0 over time. Annual data, on
    the other hand, has a lower temporal resolution, meaning that it provides less
    detailed information about the changes in ET0 over time.


    The choice of whether to use monthly or annual data depends on the specific research
    question being addressed and the availability of data. If the research question
    requires a detailed understanding of the changes in ET0 over time, then monthly
    data would be a better choice. However, if the research question only requires
    a general understanding of the changes in ET0 over time, then annual data may
    be sufficient.


    In terms of modeling ET0, both monthly and annual data can be used to train machine
    learning models. However, it is important to note that the temporal resolution
    of the data can affect the performance of the model. Models trained on monthly
    data may be more accurate than models trained on annual data, as they have more
    information to learn from. However, models trained on annual data may be more
    computationally efficient, as they have less data to process.


    Overall, the choice of whether to use monthly or annual data to model ET0 depends
    on the specific research question being addressed and the availability of data.
    If the research question requires a detailed understanding of the changes in ET0
    over time, then monthly data would be a better choice. However, if the research
    question only requires a general understanding of the changes in ET0 over time,
    then annual data may be sufficient.'

    solar irradiance forecasting. Energy, 122, 254-263.'
  data_sources: Meteorological information from Turkey's Adana and Mersin stations
    on a 25-year period (1986 to 2010). The data included monthly ST, air temperature,
    relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed.
  explanation: "The paper's objective is to design and evaluate a predictive model\
    \ based on the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm for estimating monthly\
    \ soil temperature (ST) at various depths. The predictive ability of the proposed\
    \ model is validated in respect to conventional artificial neural network (ANN)\
    \ and M5 Model Tree- based data-intelligent models. \n\nUpon designing the ELM\
    \ model, the predictive performance is assessed in respect to the three different\
    \ soil temperature elevations (i.e., 5, 50, and 100 cm). Through a statistical\
    \ assessment of the observed and estimated ST data and a diagnostic evaluation\
    \ of the model is performed at a real agricultural district (namely the Adana\
    \ and Mersin) located in Turkey."
  extract_1: Based on this information, it can be observed that the soil temperature
    at the elevation 5 cm exhibits the largest variation for both stations. In addition,
    it is clear from the table that windspeed has the highest negative skewness while
    the air temperature is very close to normal distribution (zero skewness) in the
    both stations.
  extract_2: Overall, these results indicate that the ELM models generally perform
    superior to the ANN and M5 Tree model in estimating the ST data at different depths.
    M5 Tree model generally has the worst estimate. The reason for this might be its
    linear tree structure that could potentially prevents the model from adequately
    modeling the nonlinear behaviors of the ST phenomenon. On the other hand, the
    ELM model, which is considered as a relatively new and an advanced approach for
    ST modeling, has some advantages over the ANN model. Notably, the ELM model has
    high-performance, that entails new design features such as the random generation
    of the hidden node parameters without an iterative modeling process (as with the
    case of an ANN model), and analytically determining of the output weights to provide
    considerably fast solutions (Deo and Şahin, 2015a, Deo and Şahin, 2015b; Deo et
    al., 2016; Yaseen et al., 2016).
  inline_citation: (Deo et al., 2017a; Deo et al., 2017b)
  key_findings: '1. The ELM model was generally more accurate than the ANN and M5
    Tree models for estimating ST data at different depths.

    2. The inclusion of periodicity (i.e. incorporating the seasonal behavior of temperature)
    as the model input variable led to a remarkable improvement in the model''s testing
    performance for the case of 50 cm and 100 cm depths (Adana) and also for all three
    depths for Mersin.

    3. Especially for the case of Mersin, the superiority of the optimal ELM model
    was evident, as verified by a relatively large magnitude of the Legate & McCabe''s
    Index (0.859 vs. 0.835 & 0.826 for 5 cm, 0.879 vs. 0.852 & 0.844 for 50 cm and
    0.713 vs. 0.698 & 0.618 for 100 cm) relative to the optimal ANN and M5 Tree models,
    respectively.'
  limitations: 'Limited scope detailed in the following:

    - Data quality: The authors do not mention the quality of the data used to train
    and test the models. Data quality can significantly impact the performance of
    machine learning models, so it is important to ensure that the data is clean and
    accurate.


    - Overfitting: The authors do not discuss the potential for overfitting in their
    models. Overfitting occurs when a model learns too much from the training data
    and starts to make predictions that are too specific to the training data. This
    can lead to poor performance on new data.

    their models. Training machine learning models can be computationally expensive,
    so it is important to consider the computational cost when choosing a model.'

  data_sources: High-content microscopy dataset and image data streamed from a transmission

  explanation: 'This study proposes HASTE, a new software tool, for managing and organizing
    data pipelines and prioritizing stream datasets. HASTE employs the concept of
    an Interestingness Function (IF) which is applied to incoming messages in the
    data stream, to quantify an "interestingness" score for each object. A policy
    is then applied to these scores, to prioritize the objects for further downstream
    processing or storage. The HASTE system implements data hierarchies (DHs) to manage
    and optimize resource allocation (across compute, storage, and communication)
    based on this prioritization. The authors evaluate the performance of HASTE in
    two distinct case studies: (1) managing a high-content microscopy dataset, and
    (2) optimizing the resource allocation for image data streamed from a transmission
    electron microscope (TEM) to the cloud. In the first case study, HASTE is used
    to automatically prioritize the storage of microscopy images, based on their image
    quality, to reduce unnecessary storage costs. In the second case study, HASTE
    is used to prioritize the pre-processing of images at the edge in collaboration
    with a cloud-based pipeline, to minimize the upload time to the cloud and reduce
    latency for real-time control of the microscope.'

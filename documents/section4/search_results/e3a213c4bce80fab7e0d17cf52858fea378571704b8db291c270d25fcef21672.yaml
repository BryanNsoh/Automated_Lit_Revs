    Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: The Internet of
    Things (IoT) is the next era of communication. Using the IoT, physical objects
    can be empowered to create, receive, and exchange data in a seamless manner. Various
    IoT applications focus on automating different tasks and are trying to empower
    the inanimate physical objects to act without any human intervention. The existing
    and upcoming IoT applications are highly promising to increase the level of comfort,
    efficiency, and automation for the users. To be able to implement such a world
    in an ever-growing fashion requires high security, privacy, authentication, and
    recovery from attacks. In this regard, it is imperative to make the required changes
    in the architecture of the IoT applications for achieving end-to-end secure IoT
    environments. In this paper, a detailed review of the security-related challenges
    and sources of threat in the IoT applications is presented. After discussing the
    security issues, various emerging and existing technologies focused on achieving
    a high degree of trust in the IoT applications are discussed. Four different technologies,
    blockchain, fog computing, edge computing, and machine learning, to increase the
    level of security in IoT are discussed. This paper presents a detailed survey
    of IoT security. First of all the security critical IoT applications are discussed.

    connecting physical devices around us to the Internet is increasing rapidly. According
    to a recent Gartner report, there will be around 8.4 billion connected things
    worldwide in 2020. This number is expected to grow to 20.4 billion by 2022 [1].
    The use of IoT applications is increasing in all parts of the world. The major
    driving countries in this include western Europe, North America, and China [1].
    The number of machine to machine (M2M) connections is expected to grow from 5.6
    billion in 2016 to 27 billion in 2024 [1]. This leap in numbers itself declares
    IoT to be one of the major upcoming markets that could form a cornerstone of the
    expanding digital economy. The IoT industry is expected to grow in terms of revenue
    from 892billionin2018to 4 trillion by 2025 [2]. M2M connections cover a broad
    range of applications like smart cities, smart environment, smart grids, smart
    retail, smart farming, etc. [3]. Figure 1 shows the past, present and future architecture
    of IoT. In future, the devices are not only expected to be connected to the Internet
    and other local devices but are also expected to communicate with other devices
    on the Internet directly. Apart from the devices or things being connected, the
    concept of social IoT (SIoT) is also emerging. SIoT will enable different social
    networking users to be connected to the devices and users can share the devices
    over the Internet [4]. FIGURE 1. Present and future architecture of IoT. Show
    All With all this vast spectrum of IoT applications comes the issue of security
    and privacy. Without a trusted and interoperable IoT ecosystem, emerging IoT applications
    cannot reach high demand and may lose all their potential. Along with the security
    issues faced generally by the Internet, cellular networks, and WSNs, IoT also
    has its special security challenges such as privacy issues, authentication issues,
    management issues, information storage and so on. Table 1 summarizes various factors
    due to which securing IoT environment is much more challenging than securing normal
    information technology (IT) devices. Due to all these issues and vulnerabilities,
    the IoT applications create a fertile ground for different kinds of cyber threats.
    There have been various security and privacy attacks on the already deployed IoT
    applications worldwide. Mirai attack in the last quarter of 2016 was estimated
    to infect around 2.5 million devices connected to the Internet and launch distributed
    denial of service (DDoS) attack [5]. After Mirai, Hajime and Reaper are the other
    big botnet attacks launched against a large number of IoT devices [5]. IoT devices,
    being low powered and less secure, provide a gateway to the adversaries for entering
    into home and corporate networks, thereby giving easy access to the user’s data.
    Also, the domain of IoT is expanding beyond mere things or objects. There have
    been various successful attempts to implant IoT devices into the human body to
    monitor the live condition of various organs [6]. Attackers can target such devices
    to track the location of a particular individual or falsify data. Such an attack
    has not taken place yet in real life but can be highly dangerous, if such devices
    are compromised. TABLE 1 Comparison of Security of IT Devices and IoT Devices
    Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) is another area benefitting from the growth of IoT.
    In CPS physical objects in the environment are monitored, and actions are taken
    based on the physical changes. Since CPS encompass assets of critical importance
    (e.g., power grids, transportation systems), security vulnerabilities in such
    systems have serious consequences. However, security challenges for CPS have their
    unique characteristics and are outside the scope of this paper. In any IoT ecosystem
    or environment, there are four important layers. The first layer includes the
    use of various sensors and actuators to perceive the data or information to perform
    various functionalities. Based on that, in the second layer, a communication network
    is used to transmit the collected data. Most of the evolving IoT applications
    deploy the third layer, called a middleware layer, to act as a bridge between
    the network and application layer. Finally, on the fourth layer, there are various
    IoT based end-to-end applications like smart grids, smart transport, smart factories,
    etc. All of these four layers have security problems specific to them. Apart from
    these layers, various gateways connect these layers and help in the data movement.
    There are certain security threats specific to these gateways as well. In this
    paper, a detailed survey of IoT security solutions in the existing literature
    is presented. First of all, the fundamental constraints to achieve high levels
    for security in IoT applications are presented. The goal of this paper is to highlight
    the major existing and upcoming solutions for IoT security. Specifically, the
    four major classes of IoT security solutions namely: (1) blockchain based solutions;
    (2) fog computing based solutions; (3) machine learning based solutions and (4)
    edge computing based solutions are highlighted. Table 3 gives a list of acronyms
    related to IoT used in this paper. TABLE 2 Related Surveys on IoT Security TABLE
    3 List of Acronyms A. Related Surveys and Our Contributions There are various
    existing surveys on IoT security and privacy issues. Yuchen et al. [10] have summarized
    various security issues in IoT applications. Authors of [11] have discussed the
    security issues specific to location-based services in IoT. The authors target
    the particular problems related to localization and positioning of the IoT devices.
    Anne et al. in [12] focus mainly on the security issues related to IoT middleware
    and provide a detailed survey of related existing protocols and their security
    issues. M. Guizani et al. in [14] have surveyed various trust management techniques
    for IoT along with their pros and cons. Security mechanisms for IoT security such
    as software defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV)
    are discussed in [13]. In [8] the authors have compared edge computing with traditional
    cloud systems to secure IoT systems. Jie Lin et al. in [9] have discussed the
    relationship between IoT and fog computing. Some of the security issues related
    to fog computing have also been discussed. Authors of [7] have discussed vulnerabilities
    faced by IoT in brief. Table 2 summarizes the main contributions of the previous
    comprehensive surveys on IoT security. Although there are several works in this
    direction, they are specific to certain limited aspects of IoT. This calls the
    need for a detailed survey on all the existing and upcoming security challenges
    in IoT applications. This paper will help the reader to get a detailed idea of
    the state-of-the-art in IoT security and will give them a general understanding
    of the area. The main contributions of this work are as follows: A classification
    of different IoT applications and specific security and privacy issues related
    to those applications. A detailed explanation of different threat sources in different
    layers of IoT. Detailed and realistic recommendations to improve the IoT infrastructure
    to facilitate secure communications. Review on the proposed countermeasures to
    the security issues in IoT. An assessment of the open issues, challenges and future
    research directions for developing secure IoT applications. B. Organization The
    organization of the rest of the paper is as follows: Section II describes various
    application areas of IoT where high security is required. Section III discusses
    various sources of threats in an IoT environment. In section IV various constraints
    and requirements to be considered while developing a secure IoT application are
    reviewed. Four major IoT security approaches, i.e., blockchain, fog computing,
    machine learning, and edge computing are presented in Section V, VI, VII, and
    VIII, respectively. Section IX describes various open issues, challenges and upcoming
    research opportunities in IoT security and finally, Section X concludes the paper.
    SECTION II. Security Critical Application Areas of IoT Security is highly critical
    in almost all IoT applications that have already been deployed or are in the process
    of deployment. The applications of IoT are increasing very rapidly and penetrating
    most of the existing industries. Although operators support these IoT applications
    through existing networking technologies, several of these applications need more
    stringent security support from technologies they use. In this section various
    security critical IoT applications are discussed. Smart Cities: Smart cities involve
    extensive use of emerging computation and communication resources for increasing
    the overall quality of life of the people [15]. It includes smart homes, smart
    traffic management, smart disaster management, smart utilities, etc. There is
    a push to make cities smarter, and governments worldwide are encouraging their
    development through various incentives [16]. Although the use of smart applications
    is intended to improve the overall quality of life of the citizens, it comes with
    a threat to the privacy of the citizens. Smart card services tend to put the card
    details and purchase behavior of the citizens at risk. Smart mobility applications
    may leak the location traces of the users. There are applications using which
    parents can keep track of their child. However, if such applications are hacked,
    then the safety of the child can come to risk. Smart Environment: Smart environment
    includes various IoT applications such as fire detection in forests, monitoring
    the level of snow in high altitude regions, preventing landslides, early detection
    of earthquakes, pollution monitoring, etc. All these IoT applications are closely
    related to the life of human beings and animals in those areas. The government
    agencies involved in such fields will also be relying on the information from
    these IoT applications. Security breaches and vulnerability in any area related
    to such IoT applications can have serious consequences. In this context, both
    false negatives and false positives can lead to disastrous results for such IoT
    applications. For example, if the application starts detecting earthquakes falsely,
    then it will lead to monetary losses for the government and businesses. On the
    other hand, if the application is not able to predict the earthquake, then it
    will lead to the loss of both property and life. Therefore, smart environment
    applications have to be highly precise, and security breaches and data tampering
    must be avoided. Smart Metering and Smart Grids: Smart metering includes applications
    related to various measurements, monitoring, and management. The most common application
    of smart metering is smart grids, where the electricity consumption is measured
    and monitored. Smart metering may also be used to address the problem of electricity
    theft [17]. Other applications of smart metering include monitoring of water,
    oil and gas levels in storage tanks and cisterns. Smart meters are also used to
    monitor and optimize the performance of solar energy plants by dynamically changing
    the angle of solar panels to harvest the maximum possible solar energy. There
    also exist some IoT applications that use smart meters to measure the water pressure
    in water transport systems or to measure the weight of goods. However, smart metering
    systems are vulnerable to both physical and cyber-attacks as compared to analog
    meters that can be tampered only by physical attacks. Also, smart meters or advanced
    metering infrastructure (AMI) are intended to perform functions beyond generic
    energy usage recording. In a smart home area network (HAN) all electric equipment
    at home are connected to smart meters and the information collected from these
    equipments can be used for load and cost management. Intentional intrusion in
    such communication systems by the consumer or an adversary may modify the collected
    information, leading to monetary loss for the service providers or consumers [18].
    Security and Emergencies: Security and emergencies is another important area where
    various IoT applications are being deployed. It includes applications such as
    allowing only authorized people in restricted areas etc. Another application in
    this domain is the detection of leakage of hazardous gases in industrial areas
    or areas around chemical factories. Radiation levels can also be measured in the
    areas around nuclear power reactors or cellular base stations and alerts can be
    generated when the radiation level is high. There are various buildings whose
    systems have sensitive data or that house sensitive goods. Security applications
    can be deployed to protect sensitive data and goods. IoT applications that detect
    various liquids can also be used to prevent corrosion and break downs in such
    sensitive buildings. Security breaches in such applications can also have various
    serious consequences. For example, the criminals may try to enter the restricted
    areas by attacking the vulnerabilities in such applications. Also, false radiation
    level alarms can have serious immediate and long term impacts. For example, if
    infants are exposed to high levels of radiation, then it may lead to serious life
    threatening diseases in long term. Smart Retail: IoT applications are being extensively
    used in the retail sector. Various applications have been developed to monitor
    the storage conditions of the goods as they move along the supply chain. IoT is
    also being used to control the tracking of products in the warehouses so that
    restocking can be done optimally. Various intelligent shopping applications are
    also being developed for assisting the customers based on their preferences, habits,
    allergies to certain components, etc. Mechanisms to provide the experience of
    online shopping to offline retailers using augmented reality techniques have also
    been developed. Various companies in retail have faced security issues in deploying
    and using various IoT applications. Some of these companies include Apple, Home
    Depot, JP Morgan Chase and Sony [19]. Adversaries may try to compromise the IoT
    applications associated with storage conditions of the goods and may try to send
    wrong information about the products to the users in order to increase the sale.
    If security features are not implemented in smart retail, attackers may steal
    debit and credit card information, phone numbers, email-addresses, etc. of the
    customers which can lead to monetary losses for the customers and retailers. Smart
    Agriculture and Animal Farming: Smart agriculture includes monitoring soil moisture,
    controlling micro-climate conditions, selective irrigation in dry zones, and controlling
    humidity and temperature. Usage of such advanced features in agriculture can help
    in achieving high yields and can save farmers from monetary losses. Control of
    temperature and humidity levels in various grain and vegetable production can
    help in preventing fungus and other microbial contaminants. Controlling the climate
    conditions can also help in increasing the vegetable and crop yield and quality.
    Just like crop monitoring, there are IoT applications to monitor the activities
    and the health condition of farm animals by attaching sensors to the animals.
    If such applications are compromised, then it may lead to the theft of animals
    from the farm and adversaries may also damage the crops. Home Automation: Home
    automation is one of the most widely used and deployed IoT applications. This
    includes applications such as those for remotely controlling electrical appliances
    to save energy, systems deployed on windows and doors to detect intruders, etc.
    Monitoring systems are being applied to track energy and water supply consumption,
    and users are being advised to save cost and resources. Authors in [20] have proposed
    the use of logic based security algorithms to enhance security level in homes.
    Intrusions are detected by comparing the user actions at key locations of the
    home with normal behavior of the user in these locations. However, attackers may
    gain unauthorized access of the IoT devices in the home and try to harm the users.
    For instance, cases of home burglaries have increased rapidly after the deployment
    of various home automation systems [20]. There have also been various cases in
    the past where the adversaries try to analyze the type and volume of Internet
    traffic to/from the smart home for judging the behavior and presence of the residents.
    SECTION III. Sources of Security Threats in IoT Applications As discussed in Section
    I, any IoT application can be divided into four layers: (1) sensing layer; (2)
    network layer; (3) middleware layer; and (4) application layer. Each of these
    layers in an IoT application uses diverse technologies that bring a number of
    issues and security threats. Figure 2 shows various technologies, devices, and
    applications at these four layers. This section discusses various possible security
    threats in IoT applications for these four layers. Figure 3 shows the possible
    attacks on these four layers. The special security issues associated with the
    gateways that connect these layers are also discussed in this section. FIGURE
    2. Layers in IoT system. Show All FIGURE 3. Types of attacks on IoT. Show All
    A. Security Issues at Sensing Layer The sensing layer mainly deals with physical
    IoT sensors and actuators. Sensors sense the physical phenomenon happening around
    them [21]–[23]. Actuators, on the other hand, perform a certain action on the
    physical environment, based on the sensed data. There are various kinds of sensors
    for sensing different kinds of data, e.g., ultrasonic sensors, camera sensors,
    smoke detection sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, etc. There can be mechanical,
    electrical, electronic or chemical sensors used to sense the physical environment.
    Various sensing layer technologies are used in different IoT applications like
    RFID, GPS, WSNs, RSNs, etc. Major security threats that can be encountered at
    the sensing layer are as follows: Node Capturing: IoT applications comprise of
    several low power nodes such as sensors and actuators. These nodes are vulnerable
    to a variety of attacks by the adversaries. The attackers may try to capture or
    replace the node in the IoT system with a malicious node. The new node may appear
    to be the part of the system but is controlled by the attacker. This may lead
    to compromising the security of the complete IoT application [24]. Malicious Code
    Injection Attack: The attack involves the attacker injecting some malicious code
    in the memory of the node. Generally, the firmware or software of IoT nodes are
    upgraded on the air, and this gives a gateway to the attackers to inject malicious
    code. Using such malicious code, the attackers may force the nodes to perform
    some unintended functions or may even try to access the complete IoT system. False
    Data Injection Attack: Once the node is captured, the attacker may use it to inject
    erroneous data onto the IoT system. This may lead to false results and may result
    in malfunctioning of the IoT application. The attacker may also use this method
    to cause a DDoS attack. Side-Channel Attacks (SCA): Apart from direct attacks
    on the nodes, various side-channel attacks may lead to leaking of sensitive data.
    The microarchitectures of processors, electromagnetic emanation and their power
    consumption reveal sensitive information to adversaries. Side channel attacks
    may be based on power consumption, laser-based attacks, timing attacks or electromagnetic
    attacks. Modern chips take care of various countermeasures to prevent these side-channel
    attacks while implementing the cryptographic modules. Eavesdropping and Interference:
    IoT applications often consist of various nodes deployed in open environments
    [25]. As a result, such IoT applications are exposed to eavesdroppers. The attackers
    may eavesdrop and capture the data during different phases like data transmission
    or authentication. Sleep Deprivation Attacks: In such type of attacks the adversaries
    try to drain the battery of the low-powered IoT edge devices. This leads to a
    denial of service from the nodes in the IoT application due to a dead battery.
    This can be done by running infinite loops in the edge devices using malicious
    code or by artificially increasing the power consumption of the edge devices.
    Booting Attacks: The edge devices are vulnerable to various attacks during the
    boot process. This is because the inbuilt security processes are not enabled at
    that point. The attackers may take advantage of this vulnerability and try to
    attack the node devices when they are being restarted. As edge devices are typically
    low powered and at times go through sleep-wake cycles, it is thus essential to
    secure the boot process in these devices. B. Security Issues at Network Layer
    The key function of the network layer is transmitting the information received
    from the sensing layer to the computational unit for processing. The major security
    issues that are encountered at the network layer are as follows. Phishing Site
    Attack: Phishing attacks often refer to attacks where several IoT devices can
    be targeted by a minimal effort put by the attacker. The attackers expect that
    at least few of the devices will become a victim of the attack. There is a possibility
    of encountering phishing sites in the course of users visiting web pages on the
    Internet. Once the user’s account and password are compromised, the whole IoT
    environment being used by the user becomes vulnerable to cyber attacks. The network
    layer in IoT is highly vulnerable to phishing sites attacks [26]. Access Attack:
    Access attack is also referred to as advanced persistent threat (APT). This is
    a type of attack in which an unauthorized person or an adversary gains access
    to the IoT network. The attacker can continue to stay in the network undetected
    for a long duration. The purpose or intention of this kind of attack is to steal
    valuable data or information, rather than to cause damage to the network. IoT
    applications continuously receive and transfer valuable data and are therefore
    highly vulnerable to such attacks [27]. DDoS/DoS Attack: In this kind of attacks,
    the attacker floods the target servers with a large number of unwanted requests.
    This incapacitates the target server, thereby disrupting services to genuine users.
    If there are multiple sources used by the attacker to flood the target server,
    then such an attack is termed as DDoS or distributed denial of service attack.
    Such attacks are not specific to IoT applications, but due to the heterogeneity
    and complexity of IoT networks, the network layer of the IoT is prone to such
    attacks. Many IoT devices in IoT applications are not strongly configured, and
    thus become easy gateways for attackers to launch DDoS attacks on the target servers.
    The Mirai botnet attack as discussed in Section I used this vulnerability and
    blocked various servers by constantly propagating requests to the weakly configured
    IoT devices [28]. Data Transit Attacks: IoT applications deal with a lot of data
    storage and exchange. Data is valuable, and therefore it is always the target
    of hackers and other adversaries. Data that is stored in the local servers or
    the cloud has a security risk, but the data that is in transit or is moving from
    one location to another is even more vulnerable to cyber attacks. In IoT applications,
    there is a lot of data movement between sensors, actuators, cloud, etc. Different
    connection technologies are used in such data movements, and therefore IoT applications
    are susceptible to data breaches. Routing Attacks: In such attacks, malicious
    nodes in an IoT application may try to redirect the routing paths during data
    transit. Sinkhole attacks are a specific kind of routing attack in which an adversary
    advertises an artificial shortest routing path and attracts nodes to route traffic
    through it. A worm-hole attack is another attack which can become serious security
    threat if combined with other attacks such as sinkhole attacks. A warm-hole is
    an out of band connection between two nodes for fast packet transfer. An attacker
    can create a warm-hole between a compromised node and a device on the internet
    and try to bypass the basic security protocols in an IoT application. C. Security
    Issues at Middleware Layer The role of the middleware in IoT is to create an abstraction
    layer between the network layer and the application layer. Middleware can also
    provide powerful computing and storage capabilities [29]. This layer provides
    APIs to fulfill the demands of the application layer. Middleware layer includes
    brokers, persistent data stores, queuing systems, machine learning, etc. Although
    the middleware layer is useful to provide a reliable and robust IoT application,
    it is also susceptible to various attacks. These attacks can take control of the
    entire IoT application by infecting the middleware. Database security and cloud
    security are other main security challenges in the middleware layer. Various possible
    attacks in the middleware layer are discussed as follows. Man-in-the-Middle Attack:
    The MQTT protocol uses publish-subscribe model of communication between clients
    and subscribers using the MQTT broker, which effectively acts as a proxy. This
    helps in decoupling the publishing and the subscribing clients from each other
    and messages can be sent without the knowledge of the destination. If the attacker
    can control the broker and become a man-in-the-middle, then he/she can get complete
    control of all communication without any knowledge of the clients. SQL Injection
    Attack: MIddleware is also susceptible to SQL Injection (SQLi) attacks. In such
    attacks, attacker can embed malicious SQL statements in a program [30], [31].
    Then, the attackers can obtain private data of any user and can even alter records
    in the database [32]. Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has listed
    SQLi as a top threat to web security in their OWASP top 10 2018 document [33].
    Signature Wrapping Attack: In the web services used in the middleware, XML signatures
    are used [34]. In a signature wrapping attack, the attacker breaks the signature
    algorithm and can execute operations or modify eavesdropped message by exploiting
    vulnerabilities in SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) [35]. Cloud Malware Injection:
    In cloud malware injection, the attacker can obtain control, inject malicious
    code or can inject a virtual machine into the cloud. The attacker pretends to
    be a valid service by trying to create a virtual machine instance or a malicious
    service module. In this way, the attacker can obtain access to service requests
    of the victim’s service and can capture sensitive data which can be modified as
    per the instance. Flooding Attack in Cloud: This attack works almost the same
    as DoS attack in the cloud and affects the quality of service (QoS). For depleting
    cloud resources, the attackers continuously send multiple requests to a service.
    These attacks can have a big impact on cloud systems by increasing the load on
    the cloud servers. D. Security Issues at Gateways Gateway is a broad layer that
    has an important role in connecting multiple devices, people, things and cloud
    services. Gateways also help in providing hardware and software solutions for
    IoT devices. Gateways are used for decrypting and encrypting IoT data and translating
    protocols for communication between different layers [36]. IoT systems today are
    heterogeneous including LoraWan, ZigBee, Z-Wave and TCP/IP stacks with many gateways
    in between. Some of the security challenges for IoT gateway are discussed below.
    Secure On-boarding: When a new device or sensor is installed in an IoT system,
    it is imperative to protect encryption keys. Gateways act as an intermediary between
    the new devices and the managing services, and all the keys pass through the gateways.
    The gateways are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping to
    capture the encryption keys, especially during the on-boarding process. Extra
    Interfaces: Minimizing the attack surface is an important strategy that needs
    to be kept in mind while installing the IoT devices [37]. Only the necessary interfaces
    and protocols should be implemented by an IoT gateway manufacturer. Some of the
    services and functionalities should be restricted for end-users to avoid backdoor
    authentication or information breach. End-to-End Encryption: True end-to-end application
    layer security is required to ensure the confidentiality of the data [38]. The
    application should not let anyone other than the unique recipient to decrypt the
    encrypted messages. Although Zigbee and Zwave protocols support encryption, this
    is not end-to-end encryption, because, in order to translate the information from
    one protocol to another, the gateways are required to decrypt and re-encrypt the
    messages. This decryption at the gateway level makes the data susceptible to data
    breaches. Firmware updates: Most IoT devices are resource constrained, and therefore
    they do not have an user interface or the computation power to download and install
    the firmware updates. Generally, gateways are used to download and apply the firmware
    updates. The current and new version of the firmware should be recorded, and validity
    of the signatures should be checked for secure firmware updates. E. Security Issues
    at Application Layer The application layer directly deals with and provides services
    to the end users. IoT applications like smart homes, smart meters, smart cities,
    smart grids, etc. lie in this layer. This layer has specific security issues that
    are not present in other layers, such as data theft and privacy issues. The security
    issues in this layer are also specific to different applications. Many IoT applications
    also consist of a sub-layer between the network layer and application layer, usually
    termed as an application support layer or middleware layer. The support layer
    supports various business services and helps in intelligent resource allocation
    and computation. Major security issues encountered by the application layer are
    discussed below. Data Thefts: IoT applications deal with lot of critical and private
    data. The data in transit is even more vulnerable to attacks than data at rest,
    and in IoT applications, there is a lot of data movement. The users will be reluctant
    to register their private data on IoT applications if these applications are vulnerable
    to data theft attacks. Data encryption, data isolation, user and network authentication,
    privacy management, etc. are some of the techniques and protocols being used to
    secure IoT applications against data thefts. Access Control Attacks: Access control
    is authorization mechanism that allows only legitimate users or processes to access
    the data or account. Access control attack is a critical attack in IoT applications
    because once the access is compromised, then the complete IoT application becomes
    vulnerable to attacks. Service Interruption Attacks: These attacks are also referred
    to as illegal interruption attacks or DDoS attacks in existing literature. There
    have been various instances of such attacks on IoT applications. Such attacks
    deprive legitimate users from using the services of IoT applications by artificially
    making the servers or network too busy to respond. Malicious Code Injection Attacks:
    Attackers generally go for the easiest or simplest method they can use to break
    into a system or network. If the system is vulnerable to malicious scripts and
    misdirections due to insufficient code checks, then that would be the first entry
    point that an attacker would choose. Generally, attackers use XSS (cross-site
    scripting) to inject some malicious script into an otherwise trusted website.
    A successful XSS attack can result in the hijacking of an IoT account and can
    paralyze the IoT system. Sniffing Attacks: The attackers may use sniffer applications
    to monitor the network traffic in IoT applications. This may allow the attacker
    to gain access to confidential user data if there are not enough security protocols
    implemented to prevent it [39]. Reprogram Attacks: If the programming process
    is not protected, then the attackers can try to reprogram the IoT objects remotely.
    This may lead to the hijacking of the IoT network [40]. SECTION IV. Improvements
    and Enhancements Required for Upcoming IoT Applications Personal computers (PC)
    and smartphones have a number of security features built into them, e.g., firewalls,
    anti-virus softwares, address space randomization, etc. These safety shields are,
    in general, missing in various IoT devices that are already in the market. There
    are various security challenges that the IoT applications are facing currently.
    A well-defined framework and standard for an end-to-end IoT application is not
    yet available. An IoT application is not a standalone application, and it is an
    assembled product which includes work from many individuals and industries. At
    every layer starting from sensing to the application, several diverse products
    and technologies are being used. These include a large number of sensors and actuators
    at the edge nodes. There are multiple communication standards like cellular network,
    WiFi, IEEE 802.15.4, Insteon, dash7, Bluetooth, etc. A handshake mechanism is
    required between all these standards. Apart from this, various connectivity technologies
    are being used at different levels in the same IoT application like Zigbee, 6LOWPAN,
    wireless HART, Z-Wave, ISA100, Bluetooth, NFC, RFID, etc. Over and above this,
    the generic HTTP protocol cannot be used in the application layer. HTTP is not
    suitable for resource-constrained environments because it is heavy-weight and
    thus incurs a large parsing overhead. Therefore, at the application layer also
    there are many alternate protocols that have been deployed for IoT environments.
    Some of them are MQTT, SMQTT, CoAP, XMPP, AMQP, M3DA, JavascriptIoT, etc. Due
    to the intense diversity of protocols, technologies, and devices in an IoT application,
    the significant trade-offs are between cost effectiveness, security, reliability,
    privacy, coverage, latency, etc. If one metric for improvement is optimized, it
    may result in the degradation of other metric. For example, imposing too many
    security checks and protocols in all data transactions in IoT applications may
    end up increasing the cost and latency of the application, thereby, making it
    unsuitable for the users. A typical IoT application consists of a big chain of
    connected devices, technologies, domains, and geographies. Even if one of the
    device or technology or their combination is left weak, then that may be the cause
    of a security threat for the entire application. The chain is considered to be
    as strong as the weakest link. There has been a large increase in the number of
    weak links in IoT applications recently. For example, even basic IoT applications
    such as smart bulbs and smart door locks can be used as a weak link in a smart
    home IoT application to extract the user’s WiFi password [41] and [42]. The large
    number of IoT devices being deployed around the world to make it smart generates
    a large amount of environment and user-related data. A lot of private information
    can be inferred from this data, and that can be another cause of threat for an
    individual and society at large [7]. As a result, significant improvements and
    enhancements in the current IoT application structure and framework are required
    to make it reliable, secure and robust. In this regard: Rigorous penetration testing
    for IoT devices is necessary to quantify the level of risk involved in deploying
    these devices in different applications. Based on the risk involved, a priority
    list can be made and the devices can be deployed appropriately in different applications.
    Encryption techniques are being used in IoT system at different layers and protocols.
    However, there are various levels of encrypt, decrypt, and re-encrypt cycles in
    the complete system. These cycles make the system vulnerable to attacks. End to
    end encryption would be a promising solution to prevent different attacks. Authenticate-always
    protocols need to be implemented. Whenever a device wants to interact with another
    device, an authentication process should be implemented. Digital certificates
    can be a promising solution to provide seamless authentication with bound identities
    that are tied to cryptographic protocols. Any IoT security framework being implemented
    should be tested and confirmed for scalability. The security protocols should
    not be working only for a limited set of users. The real threats start coming
    only when the application becomes public and starts being used widely in the public
    domain. Therefore, proper strategy and planning are required. A mechanism based
    on encryption techniques like RSA, SHA256, or hash chains is required to secure
    the user and environment data from being captured. IoT devices need to be designed
    in a way that they can transmit the sensed data in a secure and encrypted way.
    This will help in gaining the trust of the individuals, government agencies and
    industries in IoT applications. Since the IoT devices and applications are growing
    rapidly, an approach needs to be designed to handle the cost and capacity constraints
    that are expected to be encountered shortly. A paradigm shift from a centralized
    approach to some decentralized approach might be needed, where devices can automatically
    and securely communicate with each other. This can help in reducing the cost of
    managing the applications and can reduce the issues of capacity constraints [43].
    Since most of the IoT applications use cloud services for data storage and retrieval,
    the risks caused by the cloud should also be considered. Cloud is a public platform
    used by multiple users and there may be malicious users on the cloud who can be
    the cause of threat for IoT related data. The data should be stored as ciphertext
    in the cloud and the cloud should not be allowed to decrypt any ciphertext. This
    can further enhance data security and can save us from the generic risks of using
    cloud services [44]. Apart from the challenges from outside entities, there are
    various scenarios where the sensors in an IoT application start collecting or
    sending erroneous data. These errors might be easy to handle in case of a centralized
    architecture but can become a bottleneck in case of an autonomous decentralized
    architecture. Faulty reading or transmitting of data can lead to undesirable results.
    Thus, mechanism needs to be identified to validate the data flow, especially in
    case of a distributed architecture [45]. Since the ultimate goal of all IoT applications
    is to create an autonomous system that needs minimum human interventions, the
    use of some artificial intelligence (AI) based techniques or algorithms to secure
    IoT devices might be useful. This can help in reducing the analysis and communication
    load on IoT environment [46]. There are various techniques and approaches in the
    existing literature for securing IoT environments and applications. These solutions
    may be divided into four categories: (1) blockchain based solutions; (2) fog computing
    based solutions; (3) machine learning based solutions and (4) edge computing based
    solutions. Figure 4 shows various works in different domains that have used the
    above-mentioned solutions for securing the IoT environments [47]–[97]. In the
    following sections, these solutions are described in detail. FIGURE 4. Research
    papers addressing IoT security using various security techniques. Show All SECTION
    V. IoT Security Using Blockchain Blockchain and IoT are important technologies
    that will have a high impact on the IT and communication industry. These two technologies
    focus on improving the overall transparency, visibility, level of comfort and
    level of trust for the users. The IoT devices provide real-time data from sensors
    and blockchain provides the key for data security using a distributed, decentralized
    and shared ledger [108]. The basic idea behind the blockchain is simple: it is
    a distributed ledger (also called replicated log files). The entries in the blockchain
    are chronological and time-stamped. Each entry in the ledger is tightly coupled
    with the previous entry using cryptographic hash keys. A Merkle tree is used to
    store the individual transactions and the root hash of the tree is stored in the
    blockchain. In the figure, T1,T2,T3,⋯,Tn represent the individual transactions.
    The transactions are cryptographically hashed and stored on the leaf nodes of
    the tree as Ha,Hb,Hc and so on. The hash of the child nodes are concatenated and
    a new root hash is generated. The final root hash (e.g., H1 and H2 ) is stored
    on the blockchain. Just the root hash can be verified in order to make sure that
    all the transactions associated with that root hash are secure and have not been
    tampered with. Even if a single transaction is changed, all the hash values on
    that particular side of the tree will change. The ledger maintainer or the miner
    verifies the logs or transactions and generates a key that enables the latest
    transaction to become the part of complete ledger. This process makes the latest
    entries available to all the nodes in the network. Due to the presence of cryptographic
    hash keys in each block, it is too time-consuming and difficult for the adversaries
    to tamper with the blocks [109]. The miners do not have any personal interest
    in the transactions, and they are mining just to earn their incentives. The miners
    do not know the identity of the owners of the transactions. Over and above, there
    are multiple miners working on the same set of transactions, and there is a strong
    competition between them to add the transactions to the blockchain. All these
    unique features empower the blockchain to be a strong, tamper-proof, distributed
    and open data structure for IoT data [110]. Figure 5 shows the complete flow of
    a transaction from being initialized to being committed to the distributed chain.
    There are various platforms and frameworks being developed in academia and industry
    that support the creation and maintenance of blockchain. Some examples of such
    platforms are Ethereum, Hyperledger fabric, Ripple, etc. [111]. FIGURE 5. Working
    process of blockchain. Show All A. Permissioned and Permission-Less Blockchain
    There are two types of blockchain architectures based on the type of data being
    added and the nature of application using blockchain. In permission-less blockchain,
    there is no specific permission required for a user to become the part of the
    blockchain network or to become a miner. Anyone can join or leave this network
    of permission-less blockchain. The best example of permission-less blockchains
    is Bitcoin. Although the throughput of transactions is not very high, the permission-less
    blockchains can support a large number of nodes in the network. On the other hand,
    the permissioned blockchains have a defined set of rules to participate in the
    blockchain network. The miners are also the authorized persons and the blocks
    are allowed to be added to the chain only after their validation. The blockchain
    of Ripple and Hyperledger are two prime examples of permissioned blockchain. The
    permissioned concept of blockchain improves the overall throughput of transactions
    as compared to permission-less blockchains. Figure 6 shows the sample architecture
    of a blockchain and the way every block is connected to all the previous blocks
    based on cryptographic hashing. FIGURE 6. Basic blockchain architecture. Show
    All B. Benefits of Blockchain in IoT The usage of blockchain has many advantages
    in IoT applications. Table 4 gives a summary of some specific challenges in IoT
    security and their possible solutions using blockchain. Various security issues
    faced by IoT applications have already been discussed in Section III. The key
    benefits of using blockchain in IoT applications are discussed below. Data coming
    from IoT devices can be stored in Blockchain: The IoT applications include a large
    variety of devices connected to each other. These devices are further connected
    and controlled by other devices. This setup is further connected to the cloud
    to enable IoT applications to be used from any location. Due to this large space
    for data movement, blockchain is a promising solution to store the data and prevent
    it from being misused. Irrespective of the layer in an IoT application, blockchain
    can act as a suitable solution to store and transmit data. Distributed nature
    of blockchain allowing secure data storage: Since the blockchain architecture
    is distributed in nature, it can avoid the risk of being a single point of failure
    as is faced by various IoT applications based on the cloud. Irrespective of the
    distance between the devices, the data generated by them can be easily stored
    on the blockchain in a secure manner [112]. Data encryption using the hash key
    and verified by miners: In blockchain, only the 256-bit hash key for the data
    can be stored, rather than storing the actual data. The actual data can be stored
    on the cloud and the hash key can be mapped with the original data. If there is
    any change in the data, the hash of the data will change. This makes the data
    secure and private. The size of blockchain will also not get affected by the size
    of the data as only the hash values are stored in the chain. Only the intended
    parties, who are authorized to use that data can access the data from the cloud
    using the hash of the data. Every set of data being stored on blockchain is properly
    verified by different miners in the network, and therefore the probability of
    storing corrupt data from the devices reduces by using blockchain as a solution.
    Prevention from data loss and spoofing attacks: In spoofing attacks on IoT applications,
    a new adversary node enters into the IoT network and starts imitating to be the
    part of the original network. By spoofing, the adversary can easily capture, observe
    or inject data in the network. Blockchain acts as a promising solution to prevent
    such attacks. Each legitimate user or device is registered on blockchain, and
    devices can easily identify and authenticate each other without the need for central
    brokers or certification authorities [113]. Being low powered in nature, IoT devices
    inherit the risk of losing data. There might be cases where due to some external
    environmental issues the data is lost by both the sender and the receiver. Use
    of blockchain can prevent such losses as once the block is added in the chain
    there is no way to remove it [114]. Blockchain to prevent unauthorized access:
    Many IoT applications involve a lot of frequent communication between various
    nodes. The communication in blockchain takes place using the public and private
    keys, and therefore only the intended party or node can access the data. Even
    if the unintended party is able to access the data, the contents of the data will
    be incomprehensible as the data is encrypted with keys. Therefore, the blockchain
    data structure tries to handle various security issues faced by IoT applications.
    Proxy-based architecture in blockchain for resource-constrained devices: Although
    blockchain provides various security features for a distributed environment, IoT
    has a specific challenge of resource constraints. Being highly resource-constrained,
    IoT devices cannot store large ledgers. There have been various works in this
    direction to facilitate the use of blockchain in IoT. Proxy-based architecture
    is one of the promising solutions that can help IoT devices to use blockchain.
    Proxy servers can be deployed in the network, to store the resources in an encrypted
    form. The encrypted resources can be downloaded by the client from the proxy servers
    [115]. Elimination of centralized cloud servers: Blockchain can enhance the security
    of IoT systems because it ultimately eliminates the centralized cloud servers
    and makes the network peer-to-peer. Centralized cloud servers are the prime target
    of the data thieves. Using blockchain, the data will be distributed among all
    the nodes of the network and will be encrypted using a cryptographic hash function.
    TABLE 4 Challenges in IoT and Possible Blockchain Solution C. Merkle Tree Merkle
    tree is an add-on that can be added to the blockchain data structure to enhance
    the security of IoT devices. This can also help in reducing the overall number
    of blocks being added in the chain. A Merkle tree is like a binary tree where
    every node contains two child nodes except the leaf nodes. The leaf nodes contain
    the data or transactions, and the roots are the hash values of the data on the
    leaf nodes [116]. Based on the size of the tree, multiple transactions can be
    combined to generate a single root hash. Rather than treating each transaction
    as a block, each root hash can be considered as a block in the chain. This can
    help us in reducing the number of blocks. Also, due to multiple levels of hashing,
    at every level in the tree, the security of the data is enhanced [117]. IoT devices
    involve a lot of small communications among each other and therefore using Merkle
    tree along with blockchain can be a promising solution [118]. D. IOTA IOTA is
    another upcoming and highly promising solution to secure IoT. IOTA is also a DLT
    (Distributed Ledger Technology) as blockchain. IOTA is specially designed for
    resource-constrained IoT devices. Every incoming request in the network is required
    to validate the previous two requests. Using this process of cumulative validations,
    IOTA can provide a high level of security at the device or edge level. The tip
    selection algorithm is used for request verification. A cumulative weight is created
    for all requests. Higher the weight of a device in the network, more secure the
    device is. IOTA uses a tangle data structure as compared to the chain data structure
    in blockchain [119]. SECTION VI. IoT Security Using Fog Computing A. Evolution
    of Fog From Cloud IoT and cloud computing are two independent technologies which
    have many applications. IoT has provided users with a large number of smart devices
    and applications. Similarly, a cloud provides a very effective solution to store
    and manage data which can be accessed from anywhere and is widely used by many
    organizations. IoT is generating an unprecedented amount of data, which puts a
    lot of strain on the Internet infrastructure. The integration of cloud and IoT
    has introduced an era of new opportunities and challenges for processing, storing,
    managing and securing data more effectively. Industry and research groups have
    tried to solve some issues faced by the IoT by integrating it with the cloud.
    The benefits of this integration are not enough to address all the issues faced
    by IoT. Therefore, the concept of fog computing was introduced by Cisco in 2012.
    Fog computing complements cloud computing rather than replacing it. B. Fog Computing
    Architecture The main task of fog computing is to handle the data generated by
    IoT devices locally for better management and thus requires an architecture consisting
    of different layers. It has two frameworks that are Fog-Device framework and Fog-Cloud-Device
    framework [120]. The former framework consists of device and fog layer and the
    latter framework consists of device, fog and cloud layer. The arrangement of layers
    is done based on their storing and computational powers. The communication between
    different layers is done using wired (e.g., optical fiber, Ethernet) or wireless
    communication (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.). In Fog-Device framework, the fog
    nodes provide various services to a user without involving cloud servers. However,
    in Fog-Cloud-Device framework the simple decisions are taken at the fog layer,
    whereas, the complex decisions are taken on cloud [121]. The architecture of Fog-Cloud-Device
    framework is shown in Figure 7. The authors of [122] have considered the fog computing
    architecture theoretically and mathematically while comparing the performance
    of fog computing paradigm with traditional cloud computing framework based on
    service latency and energy consumption. Fog computing reduces the data traffic
    between cloud and network edge by 90% and average response time for a user by
    20% when compared with cloud-only model [123]. Authors in [124] have discussed
    the definition and concept of fog computing in-depth, comparing it with similar
    concepts such as mobile-edge computing (MEC) and mobile cloud computing (MCC).
    Authors in [124] have also introduced some applications like real-time video analytics
    and augmented reality (AR), mobile big data analytics, and content delivery and
    caching for fog computing. FIGURE 7. Fog computing architecture. Show All C. Advantages
    of Fog Over Cloud IoT devices generate large volumes of data every day. Moving
    this data to the cloud in real-time for analysis is not feasible. Therefore, the
    concept of fog computing has been developed. Figure 7 shows the placement and
    functionality of fog layer in an IoT application. Fog computing refers to extending
    cloud computing and its services to the edge of the network. Fog computing is
    a decentralized infrastructure for analysis of data and computing and can be used
    to store and process time-sensitive data efficiently and quickly. Its main goal
    is to enhance security, prevent data thefts, minimize the data stored on the cloud
    and to increase the overall efficiency of IoT applications. The latency in fog
    computation is less than cloud computation because the fog layer is placed much
    closer to the devices than the cloud. Only the selected and important data is
    sent to the cloud for long-term storage. Fog computing applications include smart
    vehicles, smart homes, smart agriculture, health-care, smart traffic lights, smart
    retail, software-defined networks, etc. Sending the immense amount of data generated
    by IoT devices to the cloud for processing and analyzing would be costly and time-consuming.
    Along with minimizing network bandwidth requirements, fog computing also reduces
    the frequency of two-way communication between IoT devices and the cloud [125].
    In fog architecture, the data is collected at devices called fog nodes which can
    analyze 40 percent of it [126]. It offloads traffic from the core network minimizing
    the latency of IoT devices. A fog node can be any device like a router, switch,
    or a video surveillance camera which has computing, storage, and network connectivity.
    These fog nodes can be installed anywhere like on a factory floor or in a vehicle,
    provided it has a network connection. Data is directed to the fog node, aggregation
    node or cloud based on its time-sensitivity. Fog nodes make the communication
    in IoT application secure by providing cryptographic computations. Mere sensors
    and IoT devices do not always have the necessary inbuilt resources for that purpose
    [127]. D. Solutions Provided by Fog Computing to Overcome IoT Security Threats
    In regard to the attacks discussed in Section III, the solution that fog computing
    provides or can provide to overcome those security threats are discussed below.
    Man-in-the-middle attack: Fog acts as a security layer between end-user and cloud
    or IoT system. All threats or attacks on the IoT systems need to pass through
    the fog layer in between, and this layer can identify and mitigate unusual activities
    before they are passed to the system. Data transit attacks: Data storage and management
    is much better if performed on the secure fog nodes, as compared to the IoT devices.
    Data will be better protected if it is stored on the fog nodes as compared to
    storing the data on the end-user devices. Fog nodes also help in making the user
    data more available. Eavesdropping: Using fog nodes, the communication takes place
    between the end-user and the fog node only, rather than routing the information
    through the entire network. The chances of an adversary trying to eavesdrop reduces
    a lot because the traffic on the network is reduced. Resource-constraint issues:
    Most of the IoT devices are resource constrained and the attackers take advantage
    of this fact. They try to damage the edge devices and use them as the weak links
    to enter the system. Fog nodes can support the edge devices and can prevent them
    from being affected by such attacks. A nearby fog node can perform the more sophisticated
    security functions necessary for protection. Incident response services: Fog nodes
    can be programmed to provide real-time incident response services. Fog nodes can
    generate a flag to the IoT system or the end users as soon as they encounter a
    suspicious data or request. Fog computing allows for malware detection and problem
    resolution in transit. In many critical applications, it might not be possible
    to stop the entire system to resolve malware incidences. Fog nodes can help in
    such resolutions while the system is up and running. E. Security Challenges and
    Solutions in Fog Layer Although fog layer provides various features and security
    aspects for IoT applications, the movement of data and computation to fog layer
    creates new vulnerabilities [120]. Therefore, before implementing fog-assisted
    IoT applications, these security and privacy goals of fog computing are required
    to be studied. In this section, various features provided by fog layer, privacy
    and security challenges faced, and proposed solutions to overcome them are discussed.
    Table 5 summarizes these issues and proposed solutions. Real-Time Services: Fog
    computing tends to provide a near real-time service in the IoT systems by performing
    computation near the data generation points. Intrusion detection: Policy violations
    and malicious activities on fog nodes and IoT devices will not be discovered if
    no proper intrusion detection mechanism is implemented. The attacks might not
    impact the whole architecture of fog computing, but the attacker can control the
    local services. Attacks targeting local services can be detected by fog nodes
    by collaborating with their adjacent nodes. By observing program behavior and
    host file systems, the attack on the cloud can be detected [163]. Identity authentication:
    There are various entities involved in the process of offering and accessing real-time
    services like fog nodes, service providers and users. Trusting all the entities
    involved is an arduous task, and creates security challenges for IoT services
    and user’s data. Accessibility of services should be given only to authentic and
    credible users; otherwise, attackers may compromise the server and exploit services
    and user privacy. Therefore, to prevent attackers from illegitimately accessing
    services, identity authentication mechanisms are needed. To provide secure services,
    some efficient identity authentication mechanisms have been proposed in the past
    [146]–[149], [164], [165]. Transient Storage: Users can store and maintain their
    data on fog nodes temporarily with the help of transient storage. On the one hand,
    it helps in managing data easily on local storage, but on the other hand, it creates
    new challenges and security issues, especially for maintaining data privacy. Identifying
    and protecting sensitive data: Data stored in IoT devices may include social events,
    traffic conditions, personal activities, temperature and so on. Some of the data
    might be personal or sensitive while some data may be made public. Furthermore,
    for different users, the same data has different security levels. Therefore, it
    is important to identify and protect the sensitive data from the large volume
    of information. Sharing data securely: To provide security, data uploaded on fog
    nodes is first encrypted. No one other than its owner can read that data once
    it is encrypted. This creates a problem for data sharing. To overcome this challenge,
    some cryptographic techniques such as key-aggregate encryption, proxy re-encryption,
    and attribute-sharing, have been proposed in [166]. Data Dissemination: The data
    cannot be transferred to the fog node without encryption, due to security issues.
    Due to this movement of encrypted data to the fog node, many desirable features
    are sacrificed such as sharing, searching, and aggregation. Searching data securely:
    As discussed in transient storage, data is encrypted before uploading. However,
    once it is encrypted, searching or retrieving on the ciphertext becomes difficult
    for owners as well as other entities. In order to retrieve the information from
    encrypted text, search-able encryption and its privacy levels are defined in [145].
    A dynamic symmetric search-able scheme is introduced in [167]. Data aggregation:
    Fog nodes might need to aggregate the data in certain cases to prevent data leakage
    and reduce communication overhead. It is important to develop secure aggregation
    algorithms to prevent data thefts. Various homomorphic encryption schemes, such
    as BGN encryption [168] and Paillier encryption [169], have been proposed to achieve
    secure data aggregation. Decentralized Computation: The data stored on the fog
    nodes can be processed and analyzed for better results. However, such computations
    have several threats and risks associated with them. For example, attackers can
    not only control the analyzed results, but can also expose processed data. Server-aided
    computation: Tasks which cannot be executed by IoT devices themselves are computed
    with the help of fog nodes. However, this can lead to exposure of data to attackers,
    if the fog nodes which received data from IoT are already compromised. Server-aided
    computation is one such method whose aim is to provide secure computation [131].
    Verifiable computation: Users rely on the fog nodes to compute their data. There
    must be a secure mechanism to verify the computation results coming from the fog
    node. Authors in [170], [171] have proposed certain multi-user mechanisms that
    help with verifiable computation. TABLE 5 Characteristics and Solutions Provided
    by Fog Computing SECTION VII. IoT Security Using Machine Learning The area of
    machine learning (ML) has attracted significant interest over recent years. Many
    domains are using ML for their development, and it is being used for IoT security
    as well. ML appears to be a promising solution to protect IoT devices against
    cyber attacks by providing a different approach for defending against attacks
    as compared to other traditional methods. A. Solutions Provided by ML to Overcome
    Security Threats In regard to the attacks discussed in Section III, the solutions
    provided by ML to overcome these security threats are discussed below. DoS Attack:
    DoS attacks on IoT devices or originating from IoT devices are a serious concern.
    One approach to prevent such attacks is to use a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
    based protocol that secures networks against DoS attacks [172]. The authors of
    [173] have proposed a particle swarm optimization and back propagation algorithm
    to train a MLP that helps in enhancing the security of wireless networks. ML techniques
    help in increasing the deduction accuracy and securing IoT devices vulnerable
    to DoS attacks. Eavesdropping: Attackers may eavesdrop on messages during data
    transmission. To provide protection from such attacks, ML techniques such as Q-learning
    based offloading strategy [174] or non-parametric Bayesian techniques [175] can
    be used. Schemes such as Q-learning and Dyna-Q are ML techniques that may also
    be used to protect devices from eavesdropping. Evaluation of these schemes via
    experiments and reinforcement learning is presented in [176]. Spoofing: Attacks
    from spoofers can be avoided by using Q-learning [176], Dyna-Q [176], Support
    Vector Machines (SVM) [177], Deep Neural Network (DNN) model [178], incremental
    aggregated gradient (IAG) [46], and distributed FrankWolfe (dFW) [179] techniques.
    These techniques not only increase the detection accuracy and classification accuracy
    but also help in reducing the average error rate and false alarm rate. Privacy
    Leakage: Collection of personal information such as health data, location, or
    photos puts the user’s privacy at stake. Privacy-preserving scientific computations
    (PPSC) [180] should be employed for preventing privacy leakage. A commodity integrity
    detection algorithm (CIDA) which is based on the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT)
    is another technique that has been proposed to develop IoT application trust [181].
    Digital Fingerprinting: Digital fingerprinting is one of the upcoming and promising
    solutions to secure IoT systems and to help the end users gain sufficient trust
    in the applications. Fingerprints are being widely used to unlock smartphones,
    approve payments, unlock the car and home doors, etc. Due to its low cost, reliability,
    acceptability and high-security level, digital fingerprinting is emerging as a
    dominant bio-metric identification method [182]. Apart from the benefits of digital
    fingerprinting, there are various challenges to efficiently use this technique
    in IoT, such as fingerprint classification, image enhancement, feature matching,
    etc. Various machine learning based algorithms have been developed to provide
    some non-traditional solutions to overcome these challenges [183], some of which
    are discussed below. Support Vector Machine: SVM is a training algorithm for non-linear
    and linear classifications, principal component analysis, text categorization,
    speaker identification, and regression. It maximizes the gap between the decision
    boundary and training patterns. Authors of [184] have discussed the use of SVM
    in digital fingerprinting in detail. They have also compared it with other traditional
    models. A feature vector is built based on pixel values of the fingerprint, and
    it is used to train the SVM. Various patterns behind the fingerprint are analyzed,
    and then the matching of a fingerprint is done based on patterns identified. Artificial
    Neural Networks: ANN is one of the most commonly used algorithms in the machine
    learning. It offers many advantages like fault tolerance, adaptive learning, and
    generalization. In [185] a framework has been proposed for using ANN to identify
    fingerprints digitally. The digital values of various features in the fingerprint
    like minutiae, ridge ending, and bifurcation is applied as the input to the neural
    network for training purpose using back propagation algorithm of ANN. The verification
    of the fingerprint is done based on the previous experiential values stored in
    the database. The fundamental need in IoT is to secure all the systems and devices
    that are connected to the network. The role of ML is to use and train algorithms
    to detect anomalies in IoT devices or to detect any unwanted activity taking place
    in IoT system to prevent data loss or other issues. Therefore, ML provides a promising
    platform to overcome the difficulties faced in securing IoT devices. Further contributions
    in this field are required to maintain the growth of IoT. SECTION VIII. IoT Security
    Using Edge Computing Edge and fog computing are both extensions of cloud computing
    which is widely used by various organizations. Cloud, fog and edge may appear
    similar but they constitute different layers of IoT applications. The main difference
    between cloud, fog and edge computing is the location of intelligence and power
    computation. The cloud is deployed at a much larger scale that needs to process
    huge amount of data and is situated at comparatively more distance from its users
    [186]. To overcome the problems faced by cloud computing, edge computing is used
    as a solution where a small edge server is placed between the user and the cloud/fog.
    Some processing activity is performed at the edge server, rather than the cloud.
    Edge computing architecture consists of edge devices, cloud server and fog nodes
    as shown in Figure 8 [187]. FIGURE 8. Edge computing architecture. Show All In
    an edge computing framework the computation and analysis power is provided at
    the edge itself. The devices in an application can create a network among themselves
    and can cooperate among each other to compute the data [63]. Consequently, a lot
    of data can be saved from going outside the device, either to cloud or to fog
    nodes, and this can enhance the security of the IoT application. Edge computing
    also helps in providing low communication cost by preventing the need of moving
    all the data to the cloud [66]. A. Using Edge Computing to Secure and Improve
    IoT In regard to the attacks discussed in Section III, the solutions that edge
    computing provides or can provide to overcome these security threats are discussed
    below. Data Breaches: In edge computing, all the data is stored and processed
    within the device or local network. There is no movement of the data from the
    data originator to the processor. This prevents the data from being in transit
    and thereby prevents the risk of data thefts and data breaches. In fog computing
    there is some movement of data from a device to fog layer and adversaries can
    take advantage of this movement [188]. Data Compliance Issues: Many countries
    have strict regulatory acts to prevent data movement outside their boundaries,
    e.g., European Union’s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). Using edge computing,
    organizations can keep the data within their borders and ensure compliance with
    data sovereignity laws [189]. Safety Issues: With the increase in the deployment
    of cyber-physical systems, security and safety are considered as integral issues.
    If there is even a little delay in responses, then that may lead to physical safety
    issues. For example, if the sensors in a car predict that a crash is about to
    happen, then the airbags have to be deployed immediately. If the sensors completely
    rely on sending all the data to the cloud and waiting for the response from the
    cloud to perform any action, then that may be too late to prevent injuries or
    loss of life. Surveillance cameras can also be empowered using edge computing
    and they can themselves analyze the anomalies and can send the summarized and
    suspected data to the data centers to achieve faster response times. Bandwidth
    Issues: IoT application generate a lot of data at very high rate. Most of this
    data is raw and of relatively low-value. Sending all the data to the cloud involves
    a lot of bandwidth cost as well, along with the security challenges of data movement.
    If edge computing is used, then a lot of data cleaning and aggregation can be
    done at the edge nodes and only the summarized data, if required, needs to be
    sent to the cloud [190]. B. Challenges in Edge Layer Although edge computing provides
    various features to increase the security and performance of IoT applications,
    there are various challenges associate with completely relying on the edge layer
    for all computation. Edge devices include sensors, RFID devices, actuators, tags,
    and embedded devices. The edge layer is highly susceptible to attacks in an IoT
    system. If the edge layer is compromised, then the entire system may be compromised.
    MQTT and COAP are the most popular protocols for the edge layer. Both these protocols
    do not use any security layer by default. Although the option to add an optional
    security layer in the form of TLS for MQTT and DTLS for COAP is present, it creates
    additional overhead in terms of processing and bandwidth. Issues specific to edge
    devices include sleep deprivation attacks, battery draining attacks, and outage
    attacks. Edge devices are typically resource constrained, and the most important
    resource they rely upon is the battery backup. The foremost and easiest way to
    attack the edge devices is to somehow deplete the battery of an edge device. For
    example, an attacker might force the edge device to do some power hungry or infinite
    loop computation [191]. The process of striking a balance between storing and
    processing data on edge or cloud is very important. Keeping too much data on edge
    may also lead to overwhelming of the edge devices and may impact the entire application.
    SECTION IX. Open Issues, Challenges, and Future Research Directions There are
    some performance and security issues in the use of blockchain, fog computing,
    edge computing and machine learning for IoT security that are yet to be solved.
    This section discusses some of these issues. The security of blockchain depends
    on its method of implementation and the use of software and hardware in that implementation.
    Since all the transactions made by users in blockchain are public, there is a
    possibility that private information of users can be revealed. Also, as the number
    of miners increases, the size of blockchain also increases continuously. This
    increases the cost of storage and reduces the speed of distribution over the whole
    network, giving rise to issues like scalability and availability of blockchain
    [192]. Since fog computing is a nontrivial extension of cloud computing, some
    of the issues such as security and privacy will continue to persist [120]. Therefore,
    before implementing fog-assisted IoT applications, these security and privacy
    goals of fog computing are required to be studied. Some of the challenges and
    research issues on security and privacy in IoT environments and the solutions
    provided by fog computing are discussed in [127]. There are many machine learning
    algorithms in existence. Therefore, it is imperative to select a proper algorithm
    suitable for the application. Selecting a wrong algorithm would result in producing
    “garbage” output and will lead to loss of effort, effectiveness and accuracy.
    Similarly, choosing the wrong data set will lead to “garbage” input producing
    incorrect results. The success of a machine learning solution depends on these
    factors as well as diversity in selecting data. If the data is not clustered and
    classified, the prediction accuracy will be lower. Also, the historical data may
    contain many ambiguous values, outliers, missing values, and meaningless data.
    IoT applications are creating a huge amount of data, and therefore it is a difficult
    task to clean and preprocess that data accurately. Various features like attribute
    creation, linear regression, multiple regression, removing redundancies and compressing
    data are required to effectively use machine learning for securing the IoT. In
    case of edge computing, data security and user privacy are the main concerns.
    An user’s private data can be leaked and misused if a house that is deployed with
    IoT devices is subjected to cyber attacks. For example, a person’s presence or
    absence at home can be revealed simply by observing the electricity or water usage
    data. Since the data is computed at the edge of data resource (e.g., home), therefore,
    the user has to be aware of some of the measures like securing WiFi connections.
    Secondly, data at edge should be owned fully by the user, and he/she should have
    control on which data to be shared. Some of the future research directions in
    this field are: The edge devices are most resource constrained devices in the
    IoT and are therefore uniquely vulnerable to attacks. Penetration studies show
    that while it takes very little power to implement best practice security for
    the edge nodes, they are still highly vulnerable to a variety of malicious attacks.
    The gateways between different layers in the IoT system need to be secured. Gateways
    provide an easy entry point for the attackers into the IoT system. End to end
    encryption, rather than specific encryption techniques for specific protocols
    would be a promising solution to secure the data passing through the gateways.
    The data should be decrypted only at the intended destination and not at the gateways
    for protocol translation. Inter-fog sharing of resources is one of the areas where
    further work needs to be done. As of now, when the fog layer is unable to process
    the requests due to heavy load, the requests are forwarded to the cloud. There
    can be resource sharing between neighboring fog layers to prevent unwanted requests
    to be transferred to the cloud. The current blockchain architecture is highly
    limited in terms of the number of nodes in permissioned networks and in terms
    of throughput in permissionless networks. Various consensus algorithms are being
    designed to support high throughput along with a large number of nodes or users.
    Fog layer can be made more intelligent using various ML and AI techniques. Fog
    layer must be able to decide the duration for which the data in the fog should
    be retained and when the data should be discarded or shifted to the cloud for
    prolonged storage. More efficient and reliable consensus mechanisms can be designed
    to reach consensus among the nodes along with preventing rampant use of computation
    power. The current consensus algorithms are highly resource hungry and less efficient.
    The tamper-proof feature of blockchain is ending up into a collection of a lot
    of garbage data and addresses. There is a lot of invalid data that is never deleted
    like the addresses of the destructed smart contracts. This affects the performance
    of the overall application and better ways need to be designed to efficiently
    handle the garbage data in the blockchain. Data analysis in near real-time and
    in the proximity of the IoT node is crucial for successful deployment of IoT applications.
    Various ML-based algorithms can be designed to analyze the data in the node itself
    to prevent the data transit for analysis. This can further enhance the security
    of the application by preventing data movement. SECTION X. Conclusion In this
    survey, we have presented various security threats at different layers of an IoT
    application. We have covered the issues related to the sensing layer, network

    \ \n \nABSTRACT: \nAgriculture plays a significant role in increasing the economic\
    \ development of our nation. Crop production has \ngreatly affected due to changes\
    \ in weather pattern. Emerging technologies can be used to improve productivity\
    \ \nof the crops by converting traditional farming to precision farming. The new\
    \ technologies that are used include \ndata analysis and Internet of things (IOT).\
    \ The major issue yet to be resolved is cultivating precise crop at \nprecise\
    \ time. This can be done with the help machine learning algorithms which is found\
    \ to be an effective \nmethod for predicting the suitable crop. The soil parameters\
    \ such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity and pH \nare collected from the\
    \ sensors using IOT and given to Graphical User Interface (GUI). GUI gets the\

    \ \n__________________________________________________________________________________________\
    \ \n \n1. Introduction \nThe main challenge faced in agriculture sector is the\
    \ lack of knowledge about the changing variations in climate. \nEach crop has\
    \ its own suitable climatic features. This can be handled with the help of precise\
    \ farming \ntechniques. The precision farming not only maintains the productivity\
    \ of crops but also increases the yield rate \nof production. In India it is very\
    \ important to maintain sustainable agriculture to meet growing needs. Though\
    \ \nmany steps have been carried out to minimize the loss of crops, traditional\
    \ methods has its own disadvantages.  \nThese disadvantages can be overcome with\
    \ the help of precision farming. With the use of IOT and prediction \nsystem,\
    \ precision farming makes decision. The data from the field area are collected\
    \ using IOT system. The \nprediction framework is fed with the collected data\
    \ from the sensors for obtaining suggestion. Crop selection \nand changing climatic\
    \ conditions are the two major problems faced among the farmers. With the existing\
    \ \nprediction and monitoring methods we can address this problem. Though these\
    \ methods are useful, there is no \noptimum solution for the crop suggestion.\
    \ Some of the drawbacks found in the existing system are the improper \nanalysis,\
    \ choosing effective algorithms, and efficient selection of attributes all these\
    \ parameters may affect the \ncrop yield. \nThe proposed system helps in overcoming\
    \ the drawbacks found in the existing system. The methods in the \nproposed system\
    \ includes increasing the yield of crops, real-time analysis of crops using IOT,\
    \ selecting efficient \nparameters, making smarter decisions and getting better\
    \ yield. Effective algorithms need to be used for early \nprediction of crops\
    \ [2]. By choosing correct factors most useful data can be generated using ML\
    \ model by intake \nof various parameters and this generated data helps the farmers\
    \ by suggesting a right crop to be sown. To \nsuggest the precise crop for a particular\
    \ field area is the main aim of crop suggestion model. By choosing the \nsuitable\
    \ crops for the field area we can minimize the loss of crops. Suitable algorithms\
    \ with selective features \nhas to be chosen since the accuracy level of suggesting\
    \ crops may vary based on the type of algorithm chosen \nCrop Recommendation On\
    \ Analyzing Soil Using Machine Learning    \n \n__________________________________________________________________________________\
    \ \n1785 \nhas be chosen. Machine Learning is found be the most effective technology\
    \ for predicting suitable crops and its \nyield.   \n2. Related Works \nLiterature\
    \ review on nurturing technologies employed in agriculture was carried out. Here,\
    \ glimpse on IOT, \ndeep learning, sensing technologies deployed in agriculture\
    \ were provided. \nAruul Mozhi Varman S et al proposed an IOT and deep learning\
    \ based smart agriculture systems. This system \nmonitors and collects the soil\
    \ parameters from the field with the help of a wireless sensor network. The collected\
    \ \ndata is then uploaded in the cloud. Finally, the systems suggest best irrigation\
    \ practices to the farmers by \npredicting the crop to be sown for next crop rotation.\
    \ This information will be sent as an SMS to the farmers. \nThe parameters include\
    \ soil temperature, atmospheric temperature, and humidity [3]. This system suggests\
    \ \nfurther improving the effectiveness by predicting the suitable time for applying\
    \ pesticides, fertilizer, and \nmanures [4]. \nSmart farming system based on sensing\
    \ technology was proposed by Radhika  et al [5] . Their system basically \nuses\
    \ sensors such as pH, temperature, moisture, and sensor to measure the intensity\
    \ of light. The sensors are \npositioned in such a way in which it effectively\
    \ senses about the environmental conditions. This system simply \ncollects the\
    \ data from the environment without any processing. Hence it is suggested to apply\
    \ the collected data \ninto the algorithm for better crop production. \nSuhas\
    \ Athani et al [1] proposed IoT enabled soil moisture monitoring for predicting\
    \ the future harvest. This \nsystem detects soil moisture level for obtaining\
    \ good plant growth. Initially, soil samples are given as an input to \nthe sensors\
    \ then the respective pH content, salinity content and moisture content is measured\
    \ using Wi-Fi \nshield[6]. From the database, the moisture reading can be fetched\
    \ for Neural Network processing. In the final \nmodule, the generated correction\
    \ factor is given as an input and the result produced by the neural network will\
    \ \nget displayed in the form of mobile application. This work suggests neural\
    \ network can be used for predictions \nbased on seasonal variations. \nKumar\
    \ et al [7]  in their study proposed a prediction framework for farming which\
    \ includes sensors that sense \nthe agricultural characteristics with the help\
    \ of IoT framework hence the farmers will be given advice. These \nsensors such\
    \ as soil moisture temperature and PH are deployed in the agricultural field and\
    \ it uses Radio \nFrequency communication to transfer the data [8] [9]. The transferred\
    \ data are given as an input to the Decision \nSupport System (DSS). The DSS will\
    \ receive the input and give suggestion to the farmers about the detail of \n\
    crop such as fertilizer usage, time for usage and time for irrigation etc. This\
    \ information reaches the farmers \nwith the help of an android application [17].\
    \ \n3. Methodology \nThe invention of new technologies has made everything possible.\
    \ The new technologies include the use of \nInternet of Things (IOT) and Machine\
    \ Learning. The real time data from the field area can be collected using \nIOT\
    \ system [10]. The collected data from the field area is fed to the trained model.\
    \ The trained model then \nmakes the predictions using the data. The result produced\
    \ by the model greatly helps is sowing the suitable \ncrops in the particular\
    \ field area.  \n3.1 Implementation \nImplementation includes data collection\
    \ from IOT, ML model designing, preprocessing the data and training, \nmodel testing\
    \ and minimizing the error and improving the accuracy [18][19].  \n3.2 Architecture:\
    \ \nThe architecture contains collecting real-time data and building the prediction\
    \ model and then creating a user \ninterface for giving inputs. Initially data\
    \ preprocessing is done. Once the preprocessing is done, using ML \nTurkish Journal\

    \ model is generated for prediction. The test data is given to the generated model\
    \ for prediction [11]. \nThe model is tested against random input values based\
    \ on accuracy rate and error produced while predicting \nduring testing. Until\
    \ the error value is reduced and accuracy rate is improved this process is repeated\
    \ [12]. In \norder to gather the input from the IOT sensors and the user, GUI\
    \ is used. The inputs collected are given to the \ncrop prediction model for predicting\
    \ the precise crops. \n \nFigure 1: Block diagram of Crop Suggestion System \n\
    3.3 Iot For Data Collection: \nFirstly It Involves Collecting Data From The Field\
    \ Area. The Parameters Such As Moisture, Temperature, \nHumidity And Ph Are Collected\
    \ From The Particular Field Area. The Collected Data Is Then Stored And Given\
    \ \nAs Input To GUI. The Water Content In The Soil Is Measured Using Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensor [13][14]. This Is \nVery Important Parameter Which Is The Basis For Providing\
    \ Nutrients To The Soil. LM35 Temperature Sensor \nIs Used To Measure The Temperature\
    \ Of The Soil. DHT22 Humidity Sensor Is Used To Measure Air \nTemperature And\
    \ Moisture. Ph Meter Is Used To Measure The Ph Level Of The Soil And It Should\
    \ Be \nConstantly Maintained [15][16]. To Collect The Information From The Sensors\
    \ Arduino Microcontroller Is \nUsed Which Is Responsible For Collecting Information\
    \ From The Sensors. The Collected Information From \nThe Sensor Is Stored In The\
    \ Excel Sheet Using Wi-Fi. \n \nFigure 2: IOT System Design \nCrop Recommendation\

    \ \n1787 \n4. Feature Description \nThe key feature for plant growth is nutrients.\
    \ The soil contains different types of nutrients. Soil helps in \nretaining water.\
    \ This will help in proper nutrient supply to the plant growth [20]. Using moisture\
    \ sensor, the \nfeature soil moisture is measured from respective soil. This helps\
    \ us in understanding the need of moisture \ncontent for the particular soil.\
    \ Using temperature sensor, the temperature of the soil can be measured which\
    \ \nindicates the optimal temperature for plant growth. Moisture level in the\
    \ air is measured with humidity which is \nmeasured using humidity sensor[21].\
    \ The readings measured from the sensors are measured and used for \nprocessing.\
    \  The pH of the soil is an important feature as it affects the plant growth in\
    \ several ways. The optimal \npH range for the soil is 5.5-7.0. The soil should\
    \ be in the prescribed pH range to maintain the plant growth.  \n5. Data Preprocessing\
    \ \nThe dataset collected from open source has to be cleaned. Since the machine\
    \ learning algorithm cannot handle \nnoisy, incompatible and incomplete data the\
    \ data has to be cleaned [22]. The data with outliers and errors is \nreferred\
    \ here as noisy data. Any difference in features is referred as incompatible or\
    \ inconsistent data. The lack \nfeatures or attributes in the dataset is referred\
    \ to as incomplete data. Data cleaning, data integration, data \ntransformation\
    \ and data reduction are the basic steps involved in data preprocessing.  \n5.1\
    \ Encoding Categorical Data Using Label Encoding: \nThe dataset can be divided\
    \ into two categories numerical and categorical data. The data in numeric format\
    \ is \nnumerical data and the data in the form of strings is categorical data.\
    \ The categorical data should be converted \ninto numerical values since python\
    \ does not deal with categorical data. LabelEncoder( ) class helps in \nconverting\
    \ categorical data into numerical data. This can be used where priority is needed\
    \ in the features. \n5.2 Encoding Categorical Data Using One Hot Encoding: \n\
    The encoder will assume that 1>0 and 2>0 during label encoding. This means that\
    \ higher priority will be given \nto label 1 than label 0 and higher priority\
    \ will be given to label 2 than label 1 and label 0. But we cannot apply \nthis\
    \ encoding to all types of features. Hence we can overcome this problem with the\
    \ help of OneHotEncoder( ) \nclass . It encodes the column to be encoded by splitting\
    \ across multiple columns and thereby replacing it with 0 \nand 1.  \n5.3 Numerical\
    \ And Categorical Data Preprocessing:  \nData cleaning is done to preprocess these\
    \ kind of data.. Handling missing values is the key feature of data \ncleaning.\
    \ The result drawn from the dataset will get affected if the missing values in\
    \ the dataset are not handled \nproperly. These values can be handles using three\
    \ different methods. These methods involve deleting the entire \nrow, calculating\
    \ mean, median or mode, and filling missing values by zero. Missing values can\
    \ be handled using \nthree different methods that include deleting the entire\
    \ row, calculating mean, median or mode, and filling \nmissing value by zero.\
    \ Filling those missing values with zeros would the best method for handling missing\
    \ \nvalues. This method does not contain any null value which in turn prevents\
    \ data loss and hence it is an effective \nmethod. When compared to other methods\
    \ this method will produce a better prediction.  \n6. Feature Scaling:  \nThe\
    \ various features in dataset are standardized using feature scaling. The range\
    \ of the feature can be limited \nusing feature scaling. This is usually done\
    \ in data preprocessing and it is also known as normalization.  \nNormalization\
    \ comes under data transformation. Feature rescaling is one of the methods involved\
    \ in feature \nscaling. This feature rescaling is also known as min-max scaling\
    \ or min-max normalization. This is one of the \nsimplest methods. This can be\
    \ used to handle numerical features. The range of the features can be determined\
    \ \nbased on the nature of the dataset. The range of the features has to be minimized\
    \  as it may result in inaccurate \npredictions. In order to avoid this problem\
    \ rescaling can be done which scales all the features in the same range. \nIn\
    \ order to scale all the features in the range of 0 and 1, minmaxscaler() can\
    \ be used. It is provided by scikit \nlearn library. The formula for minmaxscaler\
    \ is,  \nTurkish Journal of Computer and Mathematics Education \n__________________________________________________________________________________\
    \ \n1788 \n  \n  \nResearch Article \n  \nVol.12 No.6 (2021), 1784-1791 \nx =\
    \ x – min(x) / max(x) – min(x) \nwhere,  x is the normalized data value.  \nx\
    \ is the original value to be normalized. \nmin(x) is the minimal value of the\
    \ feature to be normalized. \nmax(x) is the maximum value of the feature.  \n\
    For the feature scaled value binarization can be applied to convert numerical\
    \ feature value into a Boolean value. \n7. Machine Learning For Building Prediction\
    \ Model: \n7.1 Random Forest: \nRandom forest is a supervised learning technique.\
    \ It is a popular machine learning algorithm. It can be used for \nboth Classification\
    \ and Regression problems in Machine Learning. It is based on the process of combining\
    \ \nmultiple classifiers to solve a complex problem and to improve the performance\
    \ of the model. This concept is \ncalled ensemble learning. Random forest contains\
    \ a number of decision trees. In order to improve the accuracy \nof the dataset\
    \ predicted average is taken. Random forest takes the prediction from each tree\
    \ rather than relying \non one decision tree. Based on majority votes of predictions,\
    \ it predicts the final output. The main advantage of \nRandom forest is that\
    \ it can handle large datasets with high dimensionality. It prevents over fitting\
    \ issue by \nenhancing the accuracy of the model.  \n7.2 Naïve Bayes: \nNaïve\
    \ Bayes algorithm is a type of supervised learning algorithm. It is based on Bayes\
    \ theorm . It is used for \nsolving classification problems. Text classification\
    \ involves using Naïve Bayes which includes high-\ndimensional training dataset.\
    \ It is one of the simple and most effective algorithm for classification. It\
    \ also helps \nin building fast machine learning models that can make quick predictions.\
    \ It is used to predict on the basis of \nprobability of an object. Hence it is\
    \ known as probabilistic classifier. It is called so because it assumes the \n\
    occurrence of a certain feature is independent of the occurrence of other features.\
    \ For example if a fruit is \nidentified on the bases of colour, shape and taste,\
    \ then red, spherical and sweet fruit is recognised as apple. So \nhere each feature\
    \ is individually used to identify that it is an apple independently. Since it\
    \ depends on the \nprinciple of Bayes theorem it is called as Bayes. Naïve Bayes\
    \ can also be used for binary and Multi-class \nClassifications.  \nBayes' Theorem:\
    \ \n➢ Bayes' theorem is used to determine the probability of hypothesis with prior\
    \ knowledge and it is also \nknown as Bayes’ Rule or Bayes’ law. It depends on\
    \ the conditional probability. \n➢ The formula foe Bayes’ theorem is, \n \nWhere,\
    \ \nP(A|B) is the Posterior probability.  \nP(B|A) is  the Likelihood probability.\
    \ \nP(A) is  the Prior Probability.  \nP(B) is the Marginal Probability. \nCrop\
    \ Recommendation On Analyzing Soil Using Machine Learning    \n \n__________________________________________________________________________________\
    \ \n1789 \n8. Model Design By Machine Learning: \nNow-a-days for various data\
    \ science projects, an open source python distribution anaconda is used. For \n\
    predictive analytics spyder and jupyter can be used which are available on the\
    \ navigator. To run a whole \nprogram in a partitioned manner jupyter can be used.\
    \ For powerful editing, visualization, debugging and \nanalysis option spyder\
    \ can be used.  \n8.1 Package Description: \nUsing command prompt the packages\
    \ are installed. Packages such as matplotlib, numpy, pandas and scikit-learn \n\
    should also be installed. The various types of graphs such as histogram, scatter\
    \ plot, two-dimensional plots etc., \nare plotted using matplotlib. The different\
    \ operations on multidimensional array and to store resultant value is \ndone\
    \ using numpy. In order to work with labelled data and to perform data manipulation\
    \ pandas package is \nused. The function based on scikit-learn is sklearn-preprocessing.\
    \ This function supports the splitting a dataset \nfor training and testing. It\
    \ is also used to preprocess the data using label encoder which is MinMaxScaler.\
    \ \n8.2 Training The Model: \nThe dataset is read once the packages are imported.\
    \ Then it is subjected to data preprocessing. Data encoding, \nfilling the missing\
    \ values and feature scaling are some of the data preprocessing methods. Once\
    \ the data \npreprocessing is done, the dataset is divided into train and test\
    \ dataset. The train data is around 80% of the data \nand the test data is around\
    \ 20% of the dataset.  \n8.3 Learning Rate: \nTo train the model, learning rate\
    \ should be mentioned. To train the model, the learning rate should be given low.\
    \ \nThe model gets trained incorrectly if the learning rate is high. When the\
    \ number of epochs increases, the loss \ndecreases for a good learning rate. The\
    \ loss increases for a very high learning rate. The loss decreases for low \n\
    learning rate. Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to measure loss. If the learning\
    \ rate is low, then the training \nwill be reliable. Initially we can choose a\
    \ large value and then we can reduce the value with a hundred epochs. \n8.4 Gradient\
    \ Descent: \nFor training the model, gradient descent technique is used. A gradient\
    \ descent tries to minimize the loss function \nby improving the prediction accuracy.\
    \ The gradient is a measure that tells about the change in error. While \ntraining\
    \ it is found that there is a difference in the actual and predicted output this\
    \ refers there is an increase in \nerror rate. In such cases, with the help of\
    \ gradient descent finds out the minimum error. Hence at final, the \naccuracy\
    \ is improved to be around 97%. \n9. Crop Suggestion User Interface: \nWith third\
    \ party software such as Ot Designer, spyder can also be used. Qt designer is\
    \ a software which is used \nas a tool for building Graphical User Interface (GUI).\
    \ Interactive GUI can be created using PyQt5 package \nwhich is available in anaconda.\
    \ With the help of this package we can run the GUI generate by Qt designer. The\
    \ \nGUI fetches data such as moisture, temperature, humidity and pH from IOT database\
    \ using Qt designer. The \ndata collected from the field area is stored in IOT\
    \ database.  \nThe GUI database contains the features entered in the GUI. This\
    \ is given to the crop prediction model for crop \nprediction. The output from\
    \ the trained model is given to crop suggestion interface. Then the suitable crop\
    \ will \nbe suggested by GUI. The predicted result greatly helps the farmers to\
    \ choose the precise crops. Hence precision \ndecision is made by the farmers\
    \ with the help of the predicted result. \nTurkish Journal of Computer and Mathematics\

    Internet of Things (IoT) technologies can greatly benefit from machine learning
    techniques and Artificial Neural Networks for data mining and vice versa. In the
    agricultural field, this convergence could result in the development of smart
    farming systems suitable for use as decision support systems by peasant farmers.
    This work presents the design of a smart farming system for crop production, which
    is based on low-cost IoT sensors and popular data storage services and data analytics
    services on the Cloud. Moreover, a new data mining method exploiting climate data
    along with crop production data is proposed for the prediction of production volume
    from heterogeneous data sources. This method was initially validated using traditional
    machine learning techniques and open historical data of the northeast region of
    the state of Puebla, Mexico, which were collected from data sources from the National
    Water Commission and the Agri-food Information Service of the Mexican Government.

    Copy Abstract Agricultural Big Data is a set of technologies that allows responding
    to the challenges of the new data era. In conjunction with machine learning, farmers
    can use data to address different problems such as farmers'' decision-making,
    crops, weeds, animal research, land, food availability and security, weather,
    and climate change. The purpose of this paper is to synthesize the evidence regarding
    the challenges involved in implementing machine learning in Agricultural Big Data.
    We conducted a Systematic Literature Review applying the PRISMA protocol. This
    review includes 30 papers, published from 2015 to 2020. We develop a framework
    that summarizes the main challenges encountered, the use of machine learning techniques,
    as well as the main technologies used. A major challenge is the design of Agricultural
    Big Data architectures, due to the need to modify the set of technologies adapting
    the machine learning techniques, as the volume of data increases. Keywords big

    Communications and Sensing for 6G and Beyond: A Comprehensive Review Wei Jiang
    and 14 more April 04, 2024 Next-generation cellular technologies, commonly referred
    to as the sixth generation (6G), are envisioned to support a higher system capacity,
    better performance, and network sensing capabilities. The terahertz (THz) band
    is one potential enabler to this end due to the large unused frequency bands and
    the high spatial resolution enabled by the short signal wavelength and large bandwidth.
    Different from earlier surveys, this paper presents a comprehensive treatment
    and technology survey on THz communications and sensing in terms of advantages,
    Rapid Feasibility Assessment of Energy Unit Integration in Distribution Networks
    Sicheng Gong and 2 more April 03, 2024 In contemporary heavy-load distribution
    networks, preceding feasibility assessment is imperative before incorporating
    additional energy units. However, the feasibility examination for massive combined
    operational scenarios of relevant units is computationally intensive with repetitive
    power flow calculations. To this end, this paper proposes a rapid assessment framework,
    the kernel of which is to learn from formerly examined scenarios, thus forming
    expansive feasible/infeasible regions to geometrically rule in/out subsequent
    scenarios. Without running the power flow computation in most scenarios, we accelerate
    the assessment process. Moreover, enlightened by heuristic hypersurface search,
    such prechecking efficiency can be further boosted. In a risk-averse manner, this
    framework can be conceptualized using the exact grid model. Especially, evidenced
    by testing on a 10.5kV distribution grid, the framework shows a significant assessment
    efficiency improvement and strict accuracy guarantee, where we observe at least
    76.13% assessment time reduction and zero accuracy loss in all testing cases.
    We anticipate this work to be a starting point for more sophisticated geometry-accelerating
    feasibility assessment methods. Improving Molecular De Novo Drug Design with Transformers
    Dhaval Soni and 7 more April 03, 2024 Drug design is undergoing a transformation
    as we challenge conventional methods by integrating state-of-the-art artificial
    intelligence with the intricate domain of molecular biology. At the heart of our
    endeavor lies a significant challenge: the scarcity of datasets containing active
    compounds for emerging target proteins. To confront this obstacle, we''re pioneering
    an innovative approach. We''re merging the advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer
    (GPT) architecture with the nuanced capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    networks, with the aim of generating Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System
    (SMILES) strings to unveil novel therapeutic pathways. Additionally, we''re employing
    a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pretraining strategy
    to enrich our model with comprehensive molecular data, including amino acid sequences
    and molecular SMILES datasets. Through meticulous fine-tuning on a meticulously
    curated protein-ligand complex dataset, we''re achieving precise conditional generation
    via autoregressive supervised learning. Our research introduces a groundbreaking
    method to assess molecular affinity, validated against established proteins, showcasing
    superior binding affinities compared to certain FDA-approved drugs in docking
    experiments. By pushing the boundaries of generative algorithms and establishing
    a robust framework for evaluating molecular affinity, we''re driving forward the
    field of de novo drug design, offering promising therapeutic avenues and enabling
    deeper exploration of the chemical landscape. Formalising a Gateway-based Blockchain
    Interoperability Solution with Event-B Guzmán Llambías and 2 more April 03, 2024
    A document by Guzman Llambias . Click on the document to view its contents. Magnetic
    Behavior of NO Fe-Si Sheets under Tensile and Compressive Stress Carlo Appino
    and 6 more April 03, 2024 The stress dependence of the magnetic properties of
    non-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets has been investigated by measurement and analysis
    of hysteresis loop, magnetization curve, and energy losses taken at different
    peak polarization values Jp (0.5 T – 1.5 T) between DC and f = 400 Hz. The salient
    feature of the material response to the stress lies in the monotonic deterioration
    of the soft magnetic properties, across the whole (Jp - f) domain, on passing
    from the maximum tensile stress (σ = +30 MPa) to the maximum compression (σ =
    -30 MPa). This is understood in terms of stress-induced redistribution of the
    domains between easy axes, making magnetic hardening by compression directly related
    to unfavorably directed domains and 90° domain-wallmediated magnetization transitions.
    The loss decomposition is carried out across the whole investigated frequency
    range, taking into account the skin effect at the highest frequencies. Quasi-static
    and dynamic losses follow a same trend with σ, both monotonically increasing on
    passing from the tensile to the compressive stress limits, according to the theoretically
    expected relationship existing between the hysteresis and the excess loss components.
    The latter is shown to identify the correlation regions where the magnetization
    is reversed of size comparable with the average grain size and loosely following
    the dependence of the loss figure on the applied stress. A bio-inspired hardware
    implementation of an analog spike-based hippocampus memory mo... Daniel Casanueva-Morato
    and 4 more April 03, 2024 The need for processing at the edge the increasing amount
    of data that is being produced by multitudes of sensors has led to the demand
    for mode power efficient computational systems, by exploring alternative computing
    paradigms and technologies. Neuromorphic engineering is a promising approach that
    can address this need by developing electronic systems that faithfully emulate
    the computational properties of animal brains. In particular, the hippocampus
    stands out as one of the most relevant brain region for implementing auto associative
    memories capable of learning large amounts of information quickly and recalling
    it efficiently. In this work, we present a computational spike-based memory model
    inspired by the hippocampus that takes advantage of the features of analog electronic
    circuits: energy efficiency, compactness, and real-time operation. This model
    can learn memories, recall them from a partial fragment and forget. It has been
    implemented as a Spiking Neural Networks directly on a mixed-signal neuromorphic
    chip. We describe the details of the hardware implementation and demonstrate its
    operation via a series of benchmark experiments, showing how this research prototype
    paves the way for the development of future robust and low-power mixed-signal
    neuromorphic processing systems. Exploratory Study of oneM2M-based Interoperability
    Architectures for IoT: A Smart Cit... VJS Pranavasri and 6 more April 03, 2024
    The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in transformative possibilities
    for smart cities, with the potential to revolutionize urban living through enhanced
    connectivity and data-driven decision-making. However, the effective realization
    of IoT in smart cities hinges upon the seamless interoperability of diverse devices
    and systems. To address this critical need, the oneM2M standards initiative has
    emerged as a foundational framework for IoT interoperability. In this research
    paper, we perform an exploratory analysis of three prominent open-source oneM2M
    based interoperability systems-Mobius, OM2M, and ACME. We leverage an existing
    large-scale system provided by our Smart City Living Lab deployed at IIIT Hyderabad,
    sprawling a 66-acre campus featuring over 370 nodes across eight verticals. We
    investigate the architectural characteristics of each solution, considering their
    strengths and limitations in facilitating IoT interoperability. Through this analysis,
    our paper aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to implement
    IoT interoperability solutions in the context of smart cities. By evaluating the
    strengths and limitations of Mobius, OM2M, and ACME, we seek to offer guidance
    for selecting the most suitable solution. Our analysis reveals that the optimal
    framework choice depends on specific quality constraints: Mobius excels in performance,
    while ACME offers advantages in ease of setup for smaller-scale implementations.
    Comparing Concepts of Service Blocking Queues in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems
    Tobias Konheiser and 3 more April 03, 2024 ZF is developing an autonomous driving
    system, which requires extensive testing of the developed devices and software
    on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems. Therefore, a robust and high-performing
    HIL system is essential. The purpose of a HIL system is to replay recorded data
    to the device-undertest. Recordings are loaded, processed and streamed to the
    deviceunder-test with real-time requirements. This streaming chain includes processing
    nodes and queues. This requires careful management of queue configurations. An
    overflow in the queue will result in packet loss, while an underflow may violate
    the real-time constraint. This study aims to develop and evaluate concepts for
    service blocking queues. These concepts block or pause the incoming service to
    a queue when necessary to avoid queue overflows and associated data loss. However,
    an out-of-the-box solution is not available and different approaches affect the
    behaviour and performance of the system. Therefore, the developed concepts are
    evaluated against each other and against the existing system based on selected
    performance parameters in specific scenarios. The scenarios cover a wide range
    of situations, reflecting standard input data with varying numbers of parallel
    streams and bottleneck scenarios forcing queue overflows or blockages. The developed
    service blocking queue concepts eliminate data loss in all scenarios, but introduce
    overhead, resulting in reduced system performance. However, the service blocking
    queue concept using a modified token-bucket approach proved to be the best solution,
    as the elimination of data loss justifies the additional overhead. This concept
    is proposed for implementation and deployment on the HIL system. Generative AI-Based
    Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and 7 more
    April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that uses neural
    networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually relevant
    text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The models are
    trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and learn complex
    concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases, and styles. FlowDep
    - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle detection for aut...
    Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection is crucial for the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles such as palm-sized drones,
    it is a challenge to implement traditional methods like Lidar due to high costs
    and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning approaches, while accurate,
    are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles. To address this issue, we introduce
    Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm inspired by the low-resolution but
    efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects. Flowdep combines optic flow
    and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the depth of every image pixel.
    We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial neural network (Flowdep-ANN).
    Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are 5.8 to 114.7 times faster than
    the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN on a small
    autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing platform, and both models
    successfully performed real-time object detection. The present work demonstrates
    the potential of using optical flow as an efficient approach to estimate depth
    and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles. Misinformative Data
    Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April 03, 2024 Sports are
    data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics and teams leverage
    data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which is created by media
    outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating narratives about
    the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data in the sports world,
    data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape. These data visualizations,
    while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers, can be misinformative;
    media creators often have incentives to present specific narratives which don''t
    always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing misinformative data
    visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to understand the techniques
    and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations in all domains,
    not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols Drew Scott
    April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are ubiquitous
    in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual authentication
    between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level communications.
    This is because tags should not share secret information with unknown parties
    and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication protocols
    designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate for
    RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy, small
    memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and practical
    authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID systems became
    prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols. The Effect of
    Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more April
    03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,
    2024 Hodge conjecture is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory based
    on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications

    model that can create videos based on simple user prompts. The model promises
    to revolutionize the way content is created. When SORA is released to the general
    public, it may transform a wide array of industries but also pose significant
    challenges and risks. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding
    of SORA''s opportunities, challenges, and implications. It explores its potential
    applications in film-making, education, gaming, advertising, accessibility, healthcare,
    and social media content creation. Additionally, it delves into its potential
    challenges and risks, including misinformation, privacy concerns, bias, regulatory
    complexities, and dependence on technology. This research provides important recommendations
    to promote responsible deployment of the AI model. Advancements and Challenges

    Abstract: Smart solutions for monitoring water pollution are becoming increasingly\
    \ prominent nowa-\ndays with the advance in the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors,\
    \ and communication technologies. IoT\nenables connections among different devices\
    \ with the capability to gather and exchange information.\nAdditionally, IoT extends\
    \ its ability to address environmental issues along with the automation\nindustry.\
    \ As water is essential for human survival, it is necessary to integrate some\
    \ mechanisms for\nmonitoring water quality. Water quality monitoring (WQM) is\
    \ an efﬁcient and cost-effective system\nintended to monitor the quality of drinking\
    \ water that exploits IoT techniques. Therefore, this study\ndeveloped a new smart\
    \ water quality prediction using atom search optimization with the fuzzy deep\n\
    convolution network (WQP-ASOFDCN) technique in the IoT environment. The WQP-ASOFDCN\n\
    technique seamlessly monitors the water quality parameters using IoT devices for\
    \ data collection\npurposes. Data pre-processing is carried out at the initial\
    \ stage to make the input data compatible\nfor further processing. For water quality\
    \ prediction, the F-DCN model was utilized in this study.\nFurthermore, the prediction\
    \ performance of the F-DCN approach was improved by using the ASO\nalgorithm for\
    \ the optimal hyperparameter tuning process. A sequence of simulations was applied\n\
    to validate the enhanced water quality prediction outcomes of the WQP-ASOFDCN\
    \ method. The\nexperimental values denote the better performance of the WQP-ASOFDCN\
    \ approach over other\napproaches in terms of different measures.\nKeywords: water\

    \ all forms of technological\nlandscapes, namely, irrigation management, monitoring,\
    \ agriculture, security, and health\ncare. An IoT structure with cloud-centric\
    \ memory and processing could evaluate the data\nthrough different sensors with\
    \ decision-support networking nodes [1–3]. The IoT environ-\nment will assist\
    \ intellectually applicable technology, rendering solutions that can be fruitful\n\
    and helpful in smart dimensional irrigations of the agricultural environment [4].\

    2 of 18\nmachine learning (ML) methods [5,6]. IoT solutions for water quality\
    \ (WQ) management\nand assessment have become signiﬁcant with the advances in\
    \ information and commu-\nnication technology [7]. WQ can be generally examined\
    \ using chemical, biological, and\nphysical properties. The IoT-based WQ evaluation\
    \ mechanism conducts WQ parameter\nchecks to identify the risks of deviation and\
    \ the continual degradation of WQ with the help\nof the real-time analysis of\
    \ accumulated data to recommend the most suitable remedial\naction [8,9]. Reporting\
    \ is now becoming feasible because of the IoT advancements in WQ\nmanaging applications.\n\
    Using IoT and wireless sensor networks (WSNs), a low-cost, real-time surveillance\n\
    system will promptly send alerts through email and SMS [10,11]. However, several\
    \ tech-\nniques have been formulated for assessing and monitoring WQ worldwide,\
    \ which include\nfuzzy inference, the water quality index (WQI), and multivariate\
    \ statistical methods [12].\nTo assess the WQ, even though many WQ variables have\
    \ been observed as per the pro-\ncedures described in the appropriate standards,\
    \ the parameter selection process plays a\nvital role [6,13,14]. Today, with the\
    \ advancements in ML algorithms, many researchers\nhave faith that a huge volume\
    \ of data are analyzed and captured successfully to address\nthe large-scale and\
    \ complex WQ assessment necessities [15]. In ML, a branch of artiﬁcial\nintelligence\
    \ (AI) techniques can be employed for analyzing data and endeavors to extract\n\
    effective patterns in the data to predict novel data. ML has been broadly used\
    \ in various do-\nmains due to its ﬂexible customization, convenient extensibility,\
    \ and high precision [16,17].\nComplicated nonlinear relational data are easily\
    \ managed with ML, simplifying the detec-\ntion of the underlying systems. The\
    \ incredible adaptability of ML has shown its potential\nin the environmental\
    \ science and engineering domains in recent times [18]. Thus, highly\nprecise\
    \ assessment outcomes are expected in spite of the complexity of utilizing ML\
    \ for\nWQ evaluation and analysis.\nThis study developed a new smart water quality\
    \ prediction using atom search opti-\nmization with a fuzzy deep convolution network\
    \ (WQP-ASOFDCN) technique in the IoT\nenvironment. Data pre-processing was carried\
    \ out at the initial stage to make the input data\ncompatible for further processing.\
    \ For water quality prediction, the F-DCN method was\nutilized in this study.\
    \ Furthermore, the prediction performance of the F-DCN algorithm\ncould be improved\
    \ by using the ASO algorithm for the optimal hyperparameter tuning\nprocess. A\
    \ sequence of simulations was conducted to validate the enhanced WQ prediction\n\
    outcomes of the WQP-ASOFDCN method.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.\
    \ Section 2 provides the literature re-\nview, and Section 3 introduces the proposed\
    \ model. Later, Section 4 offers experimental\nvalidation, and Section 5 concludes\
    \ the study.\n2. Literature Review\nIn [19], a DL-based BiLSTM technique (DLBL-WQA)\
    \ was established to predict the\nWQ features of the Yamuna River, India. The\
    \ presented techniques did not execute missing\nvalue imputation and only concentrated\
    \ on the learning method without comprising a loss\nfunction applied to the trained\
    \ errors. The presented technique demonstrated an original\napproach that comprises\
    \ the missing value imputation during the ﬁrst step, the second step\nmakes the\
    \ feature mapping in the offered input data, the third step comprises a BiLSTM\n\
    infrastructure to increase the learning system, and ﬁnally, an optimization loss\
    \ function can\nbe implemented to decrease the trained errors. Pant et al. [20]\
    \ examined the automated\nIoT-based WQ observing method. Different sensors were\
    \ employed to monitor several\nparameters of water. The entire method contained\
    \ an Arduino interfacing the sensor and\nGSM element to remotely observe the data.\
    \ This whole method was solar-powered, and\nthe device helped access the WQ and\
    \ monitor the distinct water bodies in real-time.\nBhardwaj et al. [21] proposed\
    \ an IoT-based real-time infrastructure for performing\nWQ monitoring, management,\
    \ and alerts to take action depending upon the contamination\nand toxic parameter\
    \ levels, gadgets, and application efficiency as the primary part of the\npresented\
    \ technique. ML techniques were used to examine the WQ trends and device\nSustainability\
    \ 2022, 14, 16465\n3 of 18\nobservation and management structure. Prasad et al.\
    \ [22] discovered the suitability of\nimplementing AutoDL for WQA by learning\
    \ a comparative betwixt AutoDL and convention\ntechniques and study to predict\
    \ the WQ, a suitable class dependent upon the WQ index\nseparating water bodies\
    \ as various classes. In [23], two new hybrid DT-based ML algo-\nrithms were presented\
    \ to achieve further accurate short-term WQ predictive outcomes. The\nfundamental\
    \ techniques of the two-hybrid approaches of the two hybrid approaches were\n\
    XGBoost and RF, which correspondingly existed as an advanced data denoising method—\n\
    complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN).\n\
    Liu et al. [24] concentrated on a WQ predictive system that needed higher-quality\n\
    data. During this procedure of the creation and function of smart WQ observing\
    \ methods\ndependent upon IoT, big data were created even more often at the maximum\
    \ speed,\ndeveloping WQ data difﬁculties. In order to beneﬁt from the optimum\
    \ efﬁciency of\nLSTM and DNNs from the predictive time-series, a drinking-WQ technique\
    \ was planned\nand introduced to predict WQ big data with the use of a recent\
    \ DL model in this work.\nSaravanan et al. [25] examined a novel supervisory control\
    \ and data acquisition (SCADA)\nmethod that was combined with IoT for real-time\
    \ WQ observation. Its purpose was to\ndetermine the contamination of water, leakage\
    \ in pipelines, and even automatic measure of\nparameters (e.g., color, temperature,\
    \ and ﬂow sensors) in real-time by utilizing an Arduino\nAtmega 368 and employing\
    \ a Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) element.\nIn [26], the authors\
    \ established an IoT-based intelligent ﬁsh tracking and farming\ncontrol method\
    \ containing a predicting approach that allowed for automatic WQ manage-\nment\
    \ and assisted in following the breeding and selling of freshwater ﬁshes. The\
    \ authors\nalso presented a group of WQ indicator-predicting approaches to a ﬁshpond\
    \ intelligent\nmanagement element that primarily identiﬁed and removed abnormal\
    \ data by utilizing\nthe local outlier factor (LOF) system related to DBSCAN.\
    \ Zhou et al. [27] examined a WQ\npredictive system dependent upon a multi-source\
    \ TL to the water environment IoT method\nto efﬁciently utilize the WQ data of\
    \ nearby monitoring points to improve the predictive\naccuracy. Initially, a WQ\
    \ predictive structure dependent upon multi-source TL was gener-\nated. In detail,\
    \ the general features in the WQ instances of several neighboring and target\n\
    monitoring points were extracted after being aligned. Lopez et al. [28] introduced\
    \ a system\ndependent upon ML and IoT, which measured and predicted future WQ\
    \ parameters. The\nday-to-day WQ data were obtained in the Muvattupuzha River\
    \ in Kerala and the LSTM-NN\nwas utilized to bring out the time series form in\
    \ the data.\nAlthough several WQ prediction models are available, the development\
    \ of accurate\nWQ prediction models is still necessary. The existing approaches\
    \ do not focus on the\nhyperparameter selection process, which mainly inﬂuences\
    \ the classiﬁcation model’s per-\nformance. The hyperparameters such as epoch\
    \ count, batch size, and learning rate selection\nare essential to attain effectual\
    \ outcomes. Since the trial and error method for hyperparame-\nter tuning is tedious\
    \ and erroneous, metaheuristic algorithms can be applied. Therefore, in\nthis\
    \ work, we employed the ASO algorithm for the parameter selection of the FDCN\
    \ model.\n3. The Proposed Model\nIn this study, a new WQP-ASOFDCN approach was\
    \ formulated for a smart water\nquality monitoring system in the IoT platform.\
    \ The presented WQP-ASOFDCN technique\nseamlessly monitors the water quality parameters\
    \ using IoT devices for data collection pur-\nposes. In the presented WQP-ASOFDCN\
    \ technique, a series of subprocesses are performed:\ndata collection, data preprocessing,\
    \ F-DCN-based water quality prediction, and ASO-based\nhyperparameter tuning.\
    \ Figure 1 demonstrates the working process of the proposed model.\nSustainability\
    \ 2022, 14, 16465\n4 of 18\nFigure 1. Working principle of the proposed model.\n\
    3.1. Data Collection and Data Pre-Processing\nThe water quality parameter is primarily\
    \ gathered using IoT sensor devices in the\nsensor node from different places\
    \ such as drinking water, irrigation, river, etc. [29], and the\nmathematical\
    \ expression is given in Equation (1):\nDs = D1, D2, . . . , Dm\n(1)\nwhere Ds\
    \ indicates the dataset, and Dm denotes the m-number of sensor dataset D. The\n\
    information gathered modules consist of different devices such as an analogue\
    \ to digital con-\nverter, a WQ sensor array, a Raspberry Pi 4 microprocessor,\
    \ a real-time database (ﬁrebase), a\n5 V lithium-ion battery (power supply), and\
    \ a GSM element. The WQ sensor array includes\nthe following: the pH sensor SEN0161\
    \ determines the existence of acidity or alkalinity\nof any solution on a logarithmic\
    \ scale; the digital temperature sensor DFR0198 provides\naccurate readings between\
    \ −55 and 125 ◦C; the analogue sensor DFR0300 was utilized\nto measure the water\
    \ sample’s electrical conductivity; the turbidity sensor SEN0189 was\nused in\
    \ the design to detect the presence of suspended particles by using light. WQ-sensed\n\
    information was transformed from analogue-to-digital forms and sent to the Raspberry\n\
    Pi 4, which transmits the WQ-sensed information to a real-time database (ﬁrebase)\
    \ via\nthe MQTT protocol. The presented method exploits a data-cleaning procedure\
    \ to manage\nmissing values and outliers. The percentage of missing values in\
    \ the data can be slightly\nhigh; thus, the proposed method used the mean method\
    \ to ﬁll in the missing values.\nSustainability 2022, 14, 16465\n5 of 18\nThe\
    \ water quality classiﬁcation performance of the WQP-ASOFDCN method was\nstudied\
    \ by utilizing a water quality dataset. The dataset contained 3000 samples with\
    \ three\nclasses, as depicted in Table 1. The data samples were classiﬁed into\
    \ three types based\non turbidity. It is known that the turbidity for drinking\
    \ water should ideally be less than\n1 NTU and should not be more than 5NTU. Beyond\
    \ this limit, the sample was rejected.\nThe proposed approach predicted the turbidity\
    \ of water into three classiﬁcation groups:\n‘Acceptable’, ‘Permissible’, and\
    \ ‘Rejected’.\nTable 1. The dataset details.\nClass\nNo. of Instances\nAcceptable\n\

    \ Water Quality Prediction Module\nIn this study, the pre-processed data were\
    \ forwarded into the F-DCN method to per-\nform the prediction process. A deep\
    \ convolution network (DCN) refers to a deep network\ncomprising multi-layers\
    \ of convolution, and the CNN relevant to traditional LeNet is the\nwidely employed\
    \ DCN [30]. The CNN is constructed by stacking more than one layer and\ncomprises\
    \ fully connected, pooling, nonlinear conversion, and successive convolutional\
    \ lay-\ners along with the input and output, resulting in a sequence of breakthroughs\
    \ for predictive\ntasks. Convolution can be undertaken at the convolution layer\
    \ to extract features from local\nneighborhoods on the feature map in the preceding\
    \ layer. Next, the outcome incorporated\nwith additive bias was passed onto the\
    \ following layer via a nonlinear activation function.\nFor the convolution process,\
    \ the values of the unit in ith feature maps in the lth layers,\nrepresented by\
    \ 0i, was measured using Equation (2):\n0(l)\ni\n= w(l)\ni x(l) + b(l)\ni\n(2)\n\
    where wi and bi indicate the weight and bias for the i-th feature maps of l-th\
    \ layers in the\nCNN module, correspondingly, and χ denotes an input of l-th layers\
    \ in the CNN module.\nThe nonlinear conversion can be carried out using the activation\
    \ function:\n(yd)(l)\ni\n= g\n\x10\n0(l)\ni\n\x11\n(3)\nFrom the expression,\n\
    g indicates the activation function,\nviz.,\nReLU with\ng(x) = max(0, x). Deep\
    \ networks incorporate the hierarchical feature, and several pre-\ndiction tasks\
    \ have also been advantaged by deep models due to the importance of depth.\nHowever,\
    \ the complication of the network having additional layers is that the gradient\n\
    vanishing initially hinders convergence. This solution speciﬁes that a deep method\
    \ must\ngenerate no high training errors compared to the original counterpart.\
    \ The presented\nF-DCN method for predicting water quality depends on the F-DCN\
    \ module. The F-DCN\nmodels consist of the predictor, the input, the DCN, the\
    \ fuzzy network (FN), and fusion.\nFirst, the input dataset ﬂows over the following\
    \ two channels: DCN for neural representa-\ntion and FN for fuzzy representation.\
    \ Afterward, both modules process the dataset and the\noutcomes of every epoch\
    \ from DCN and FN are combined with the fusion model. Currently,\nthe node in\
    \ the fusion model might implement two operational modes: up–down and\ndown–up\
    \ transmissions. First, it must further transfer the fusion outcome to the predictor\n\
    and then evaluate the values of the loss function to tune the parameter in the\
    \ following\nstage. In the training stage of F-DCN, the model parameters can be\
    \ repeatedly upgraded\nby minimalizing the values of the loss function. When the\
    \ model is trained, the forecasted\noutcome is attained by inputting the dataset\
    \ into the models.\nSustainability 2022, 14, 16465\n6 of 18\nThe architecture\
    \ of FDCN is demonstrated in Figure 2. Every node in the input layers is\ninterconnected\
    \ to the fuzziﬁcation layers and utilizes the membership function to calculate\n\
    the degree that the input nodes belong to a speciﬁc fuzzy set.\nui = e−(xi−µi)2/σ2\n\
    i , ∀i,\n(4)\nFigure 2. Structure of the FDCN.\nIn Equation (2), µi represents\
    \ the mean, and σ2\ni indicates the variance. During the\nAND/OR operation, AND\
    \ is a widely employed fuzzy operation, given below:\n(y f )(1)\ni\n=\nΠ\n∏\n\
    j=1\nuj = min {u1, u2 . . . un},\n(5)\nIn Equation (3), n indicates the node count\
    \ on (l − 1)th fuzzy layer, which connects\nto the i-th nodes. The OR operation\
    \ performs equivalent fuzzy logic rules through the\nconnections among nodes.\
    \ The resultant fusion layer node can be incorporated into the\noutcomes of the\
    \ DCN part to adaptively adjust the fuzzy rule.\nDuring DCN, the deep residual\
    \ architecture is utilized since the training efﬁciency\ncan be subjected to the\
    \ depth of the DCN method. It should be noted that the fuzzy DNN\nuses the DNN\
    \ architecture to classify datasets. In the presented method, the deeper model\n\
    with the residual network structure was utilized for the predictive task, since\
    \ it was shown\nto be effective enough to train deeper networks. The main concept\
    \ of residual learning is\nto study the additive remaining function g regarding\
    \ the input of the k-th residual units\n(ResU) X(k):\nX(k+1) = X(k) + g\n\x10\n\
    X(k)\x11\n,\n(6)\nIn Equation (4), X(k) and X(k+1) represent the input and output\
    \ of the kth remaining\nunits, correspondingly, and g indicates the remaining\
    \ function. The DCN architecture with\nthe residual unit has dual nonlinear transformations\
    \ and dual two-convolutions.\nSustainability 2022, 14, 16465\n7 of 18\nAn input\
    \ might be a long series of observations for spatiotemporal predictive problems\n\
    where the spatiotemporal property is difﬁcult to learn. In this work, one convolution\
    \ layer\ncould clearly deﬁne nearby dependency in a spatial region, and a stack\
    \ of convolution layers\ncould substantially capture higher spatial dependency.\
    \ Therefore, the presented F-DCN\nmethod explored the water quality’s spatial\
    \ and temporal properties for accurate prediction.\n3.3. Training Process of F-DCN\
    \ Model\nDuring the training procedure of the F-DCN model, the ASO algorithm was\
    \ exploited\nin the presented method. The molecular dynamics simulates the mathematical\
    \ modeling of\nthe ASO approach [31]. In this work, the location of each atom\
    \ from the search space can\nbe affected by the mass, which implies the solution.\
    \ ASO begins optimizing by arbitrarily\nmaking a collection of particles from\
    \ N-dimension space. Then, the solution of each atom\nis evaluated according to\
    \ the key functions. The atom upgrades the velocity and location\nfrom each iteration,\
    \ and the location of an optimal atom is upgraded from each iteration.\nThe velocity\
    \ of a particle is a function of the acceleration, and the acceleration of the\
    \ atom\nis evaluated according to Newton’s Second Law based on the ratio of force\
    \ implemented to\na particle’s mass. The mass of an ith atom in t iteration ,\
    \ mi(t), was calculated using the\nsucceeding equation:\nMi(t) = e\nFiti(t)−FitBest(t)\n\
    FitBest(t)−FitWorst\n(7)\nmi(t) =\nMi(t)\n∑N\nj=1 Mj(t)\n(8)\nFrom the expression,\
    \ FitBest(t) and FitWorst indicate atoms with the optimal and worst\nvalues from\
    \ the the tth iteration, and Fiti(t) correspondingly denotes the value of the\
    \ ith\natom main function from the Tth iterations. Regarding the problem reduction,\
    \ FitBest and\nFitWorst can be considered according to the following expression:\n\
    FitBest(t) = min (Fiti(t)), i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N}\n(9)\nFitWorst(t) = max (Fiti(t)),\
    \ i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N}\n(10)\nIn each period, the neighbor count of each atom\
    \ that interacts is determined as follows:\nK(t) = N − (N − 2) ×\n\x14 T\nT\n\x15\
    \n(11)\nwhere T describes the whole quantity of iterations, or in other words,\
    \ the life of the\nsystem. Note that the variable K is a function of time, gradually\
    \ decreasing the iteration.\nThe force implemented in each particle contains two\
    \ types: communication force and\ninternal constraint force. The Lennard-Jones\
    \ potential approach deﬁnes the interaction\nforces, and the internal constraint\
    \ force, interconnected to bond length potential and varies\naccording to the\
    \ distance between each atom and the optimal atom, was calculated using\nthe following\
    \ expression.\nFd\ni (t) = ∑\nj∈KBest\nrandjFij(t)d\n(12)\nFij(t) = −α(1 − t −\

    best(t) − xd\ni (t)\n\x11\n, λ(t) = βe\n\x12\n−20T\nT\n\x13\n(13)\nwhere F and\
    \ G describe the interaction and internal constraint forces; randj denotes an\n\
    arbitrary value within [0, 1]; and KBest represents the set of atom populations\
    \ encompass-\ning K atoms with the optimal main function value. Additionally,\
    \ xd\nbest(t) illustrates the\nposition of an optimum atom from the tth iteration\
    \ from d dimension space, λ(t) demon-\nSustainability 2022, 14, 16465\n8 of 18\n\

    \ the\nweight coefﬁcient.\nThe subsequent expression evaluated the acceleration\
    \ of i-th particles from the d\ndimension space and τ period:\nad\ni (t) = Fd\n\
    i (t)\nmd\ni (t) + Gd\ni (t)\nmd\ni (t) =\n−α(1·e(−20 T\nT ) ×\n∑\nj∈Kbest\nri[2×((hij(t))13−hij(t))7]\n\

    best(t)−Xd\ni (t))\nmi(t)\n(14)\nThe ﬁnal step in each iteration is to upgrade\
    \ the location and velocity of the particles,\nwhich is accomplished in the following\
    \ formula:\nvd\ni (t + 1) = randd\ni vd\ni (t) + ad\ni (t)\n(15)\nxd\ni (t + 1)\
    \ = xd\ni (t) + vd\ni (t + 1)\n(16)\nEach upgrade and computation were continuously\
    \ implemented until the ending\ncriteria were satisﬁed. Finally, the value and\

    \ for a smart wa-\nter quality monitoring system in the IoT environment. The presented\
    \ WQP-ASOFDCN\ntechnique seamlessly monitors the water quality parameters using\
    \ IoT devices for data\ncollection purposes. In the presented WQP-ASOFDCN technique,\
    \ a series of subprocesses\nare performed: data collection, data preprocessing,\
    \ F-DCN-based water quality prediction,\nand ASO-based hyperparameter tuning.\
    \ In the WQP-ASOFDCN model, the prediction\nperformance of the F-DCN model was\
    \ improved by using the ASO algorithm for the\noptimal hyperparameter tuning process.\
    \ To validate the enhanced water quality prediction\noutcomes of the WQP-ASOFDCN\
    \ method, a sequence of experiments was conducted.\nThe simulation values denoted\
    \ the betterment of the WQP-ASOFDCN model over other\napproaches in terms of the\
    \ different measures. In the future, hybrid metaheuristic optimiz-\ners can be\
    \ applied to foster the predictive outcomes of the F-DCN method. In addition,\n\
    the computational complexity of the proposed model will be examined in the future\
    \ and\nfeature selection approaches can be designed to improve the accuracy and\
    \ decrease the\ncomputation complexity.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    • Places the Phase Change Material in the indoor building structure. • The DTs
    model of the Phase Change Wall (PCW) structure is constructed. • The PCW structure
    is used to build a thermal energy storage. Abstract The purpose of this work is
    to explore the role of the safe and optimal scheduling of thermal energy storage
    systems in intelligent buildings in promoting sustainable economic development
    under Digital Twins (DTs) technology. Phase Change Material (PCM) has high energy
    density, constant temperature storage, small footprint, and long service life.
    Here, PCM is first placed in the indoor building structure, and the DTs technology
    is introduced. In the development of intelligent buildings, the data generated
    by the energy storage system of intelligent buildings in the real space can be
    mapped to the virtual space in real time for simultaneous analysis. In addition,
    the PCM wall structure and thermal network DTs model are designed for the intelligent
    building. In addition, the PCW structure is used to build a thermal energy storage
    and dispatch model of the smart thermoelectric building based on DTs. Finally,
    the model is evaluated and analyzed experimentally. The analysis of system optimization
    power under different schemes indicates that the scheduling operation strategy
    of thermal energy storage of building walls can avoid overcharging or over-discharging
    batteries in the microgrid and reduce battery power consumption. Besides, the
    building wall energy storage capacity is always in the range of 0.2 ∼ 0.8 on the
    all-weather scale. Moreover, the model constructed here achieves significantly
    lower economic costs, environmental costs, and energy costs and a better energy-saving
    effect than the existing model. The model built here can serve as experimental
    reference for further digital energy storage in intelligent buildings and comprehensive
    energy utilization because of its superior safety performance and lower consumption.

    twinsPhase change materialIntelligent buildingMicrogrid 1. Introduction With the
    rapid development of information technology, various advanced are even more broadly
    applied, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Digital Twins
    (DTs), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). For example, Cheng et al. (2022) proposed
    an energy-efficient multilayer virtual traffic scheduling algorithm regarding
    smart city construction that can effectively provide directions for smart city
    development and construction [1]. These techniques have also promoted the transformation
    of the construction industry from traditional construction and management methods
    to digital and intelligent transformation, which is one of the pillar industries
    of China''s real economy [2]. The building provides housing and keeps the cold
    out. Therefore, the design of the wall''s heat preservation performance is extremely
    essential. The heat insulation and thermal energy storage function of the building
    makes the whole indoor environment warm in winter and cool in summer, reflecting
    the energy saving, improving the living environment, and functions of using the
    construction [3]. Therefore, the application of IoT, Cloud Computing, AI, and
    other technologies to building insulation and thermal energy storage security
    has become the focus of scholars in related fields. Currently, the building industry
    is in the process of intelligent development. Its overall design usually adopts
    the integrated design-manufacturing-construction method for bidding to ensure
    the integrity and integration of the overall building [4]. In the traditional
    building construction process, high requirements are put forward for information
    sharing, interaction, and collaboration among the design unit, manufacturer, and
    construction unit. However, there are still cases of conflicting nodes of building
    components in the construction process of actual engineering projects, such as
    nodes of columns and beams or nodes of wall panels and concealed columns. The
    problem of heat insulation and thermal energy storage during the construction
    of buildings is prominently important [5]. Jiang et al. (2021) formulated and
    fabricated a new self-reinforced composite phase change material for thermal energy
    storage using continuous hot-melt extrusion. They aimed to address the mismatch
    between energy production and demand under deep renewable energy penetration scenarios
    and address climate change challenges [6]. Wang et al. (2022) designed and constructed
    a novel medium to high temperature packed-bed latent heat storage material for
    thermal energy storage studies in buildings [7]. After understanding the performance
    of thermal energy storage materials designed in the above-mentioned traditional
    building construction, AI technology is introduced to analyze the digital construction
    of intelligent buildings. The construction of buildings develops intellectually
    with the application of various technologies, such as IoT, Cloud Computing, DTs,
    and AI. Spiking neural networks in machine learning are thought to boost the precision
    and durability of spike-based meta-learning by Yang & Tan et al. (2022) [8] and
    Yang & Linares-Barranco (2022) [9]. The self-adaptive multicompartment algorithm
    has been presented by Yang and Gao et al. (2022) as a means to create efficient
    adaptive neuromorphic computing systems for use in domains ranging from robotics
    to edge computing [10]. For example, the high-efficiency collaboration of the
    integration of project design, construction production, and operation and maintenance
    services of building insulation and thermal energy storage engineering driven
    by digital chain can be realized through digital modeling, visual cognition and
    interaction, high performance computing of relevant data, and intelligent decision
    making [11], [12]. DTs technology can simulate and describe the state and behavior
    of entities in physical space through high-fidelity dynamic virtual models and
    preview or simulate all activities of physical entities in virtual space in advance
    or in real-time [13]. For instance, Lv et al. (2022) combined DTs and AI to predict
    traffic accidents. The result showed that the prediction accuracy is high, which
    can provide a reference for the prevention of traffic congestion [14]. Introducing
    DTs technology into the construction process of intelligent building insulation
    and thermal energy storage systems can effectively improve the efficiency of construction
    projects and reduces the incidence of errors, and improve construction quality.
    It also improves the informatization and intelligence of the construction process
    of building insulation and thermal energy storage projects, promoting the digital
    development of thermal insulation and thermal energy storage systems in smart
    buildings. Of course, the operation of thermal insulation and thermal energy storage
    systems in smart buildings is inseparable from the support of the power system.
    Microgrids utilize decentralized local energy sources for distributed generation
    and apply them to the distributed thermal energy storage systems in buildings
    [15]. Swaminathan et al. (2020) developed an optimal sizing and scheduling model
    for microgrids with model predictive control. They found that building-level microgrids
    for medium-sized commercial buildings can save initial and operational costs [16].
    Ramli & Jabbar (2022) proposed a solar-powered portable water pump for IoT-enabled
    smart irrigation system. Tests of the developed solar water pump confirmed its
    effectiveness. It has successfully conserved energy and cut down on running expenses
    [17]. The heat pump is connected to the microgrid when the building is constructed.
    The thermal energy storage system and heat pump can flexibly adjust the power
    according to the real-time electricity price and renewable energy generation under
    the premise of ensuring the appropriate indoor temperature of the building [18].
    If the electricity meets the customer''s electricity demand, the surplus electricity
    will be converted into heat energy by the heat pump and stored in the intelligent
    building heat storage system. Suppose the local decentralized energy generation
    is insufficient. In that case, the intelligent building thermal storage system
    can release thermal energy into the microgrid, and users only need a small amount
    of purchased electricity to meet their power needs. In summary, exploring the
    safe dispatch and sustainable development of thermal energy storage systems in
    intelligent buildings is of theoretical significance to the green development
    of the social economy and the improvement of social and economic benefits. Therefore,
    this work innovatively introduces DTs technology into intelligent buildings and
    places the Phase Change Material (PCM) in the interior building structure. Additionally,
    a DTs-based thermal energy storage and safety scheduling model for thermoelectric
    smart buildings is constructed using the PCM wall. Measurements of its effectiveness
    obtained through experimentation. This work provides experimental support for
    the rational modernization of the construction industry and contributes to the
    long-term health of the economy. The structure of this work is as follows. Section
    1 introduces the research background, motivation, purpose, innovation, and contribution.
    Section 2 expounds on the research of scholars in related fields and analyzes
    its advantages and disadvantages, which makes the value of this research prominent.
    Section 3 introduces the DTs technology and designs the PCW structure of the intelligent
    building. On this basis, a DTs-based thermal energy storage and scheduling model
    is constructed for thermoelectric smart buildings. Finally, the model performance
    is experimentally evaluated. Section 4 comparatively compares the model constructed
    here with different schemes proposed by scholars in related fields. Section 5
    briefly outlines the research results and explains the limitations and prospects.
    2. Related work 2.1. Analysis of the application status of DTs in the field of
    construction DTs technology is the digital representation of a physical process,
    person, place, system, or device. It can promote the intelligent building to realize
    the information fusion and interaction between virtual space and physical space.
    Many scholars have conducted research on the application of DTs in architecture.
    Li et al. (2020) proposed a DTs-driven sustainability evaluation information architecture
    for the dynamic evolution of the entire life cycle in intelligent manufacturing,
    aimed at the challenges faced by the conventional manufacturing industry. Finally,
    they verified the effectiveness of the DTs dynamic information architecture and
    sustainability evaluation method [19]. White et al. (2021) found that the combination
    of increasingly large and accurate Building Information Models (BIMs) in smart
    cities and big data generated by IoT sensors makes a large amount of data in smart
    cities even more accurate and transparent. Meanwhile, a public and open DTs model
    makes the planning of the smart city industrialization process increasingly accurate
    [20]. Chen et al. (2021) proposed an embodied carbon estimation method in buildings
    based on DTs technology and life cycle assessment. They applied the model to automatic
    data communication between BIM databases. The comparative analysis result suggested
    that this embodied carbon estimation method outperformed others [21]. 2.2. Analysis
    on the current situation of research on optimal scheduling of Cooling, Heating,
    and power in intelligent buildings When modeling smart buildings, many scholars
    have studied the performance related to the optimal operation and dispatch of
    combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) microgrids and energy storage systems
    of a smart building. Cybersecurity concerns with running Virtual Power Plants
    and microgrids powered by renewable energy sources were highlighted in a study
    by Ravi et al. (2022). Security and operational scenarios for the new ecosystem
    are also outlined [22], with an emphasis on the interoperability, security, and
    integration of Distributed Energy Resources. Antoniadou-Plytaria et al. (2020)
    proposed an energy management system model for smart building microgrids based
    on battery energy storage. They proved that the framework could accurately estimate
    building operating costs and improve the overall performance of batteries as flexible
    resources in building microgrids through simulation [23]. Cui et al. (2020) constructed
    a nonlinear partial load ratio model for gas turbines, boilers, and coolers and
    proposed a piecewise least squares linearization method. The results showed that
    the optimal operation effect of optimal scheduling for different objectives is
    significantly better than the constant efficiency model. Besides, the choice of
    gas turbine, heat recovery steam generator, and electric chiller models for both
    models greatly impact the system operation results [24]. Ren et al. (2021) evaluated
    two different systems using solar energy. In system A, solar energy was converted
    into heat and electricity by solar thermal collectors and photovoltaic (PV) panels,
    respectively. Solar energy was converted into heat and electricity through PV
    thermal collectors in system B. It was found that when system A operates under
    the following electric load strategy, it can bring many benefits to the three
    buildings and construct a system with a configuration and component size that
    are closely related to the building type [25]. Dong et al. (2022) presented an
    optimization strategy based on robust model predictive control to deal with multiple
    uncertainties in source loads. Under uncertain scenarios of renewable energy generation
    and load consumption, the optimization model was transformed into a tractable
    form for robust dispatch that minimizes operating costs. The authors confirmed
    that under uncertain scenarios, the optimal dispatching model of their intelligent
    building CCHP system reduces the operating cost by 11.5% compared with the traditional
    model predictive control strategy [26]. Lin et al. (2022) proposed a new thermoelectric
    powered wireless sensor network platform for low-cost environmental sensing in
    building envelopes through thermoelectric energy harvesting and ultra-low power
    management. The result suggested that the system can offer unique and innovative
    advantages in terms of self-powered system architecture, thermally optimized internals,
    and milliwatt power management [27]. 2.3. Summarization Based on an analysis of
    the relevant research conducted by the aforementioned experts, it has been determined
    that the digital twin technology was initially applied to intelligent buildings.
    The research on the modeling of the medium thermal energy storage system is overly
    simplistic, and the thermal network''s construction is not refined. In practical
    operation, the thermal side of the structure may pose a safety risk if it is out
    of control. In order to improve the building''s intelligence and the stability
    and safety of its thermal system, this study implements digital twin technology
    so that the data generated by the smart building''s energy storage system in the
    real world can be mapped to the virtual space in real time and analyzed in synchrony.
    More research is needed to develop and test the fine thermal network DTs model
    of phase-change thermal storage wall structure and thermal energy storage in intelligent
    buildings. This model is useful for building smart buildings and keeping the economy
    growing in a sustainable way. 3. DTs-based thermal energy storage system for smart
    buildings and its scheduling strategy security 3.1. Application of DTs technology
    in intelligent buildings The first task is to create a DTs model of the construction
    application to integrate the DTs technology with the practical construction field.
    This work expands the 3D model, adds two dimensions of DTs Data (DTD) and Connection
    (CN), and constructs a five-dimensional DTs model [28], as shown in Fig. 1. Download

    Energy conversion diagram for Scheme 1. The model developed during this study
    is referred to as scheme 1. It transfers the heat energy from the building''s
    walls into electrical energy for power generation using a generator. The spinning
    reserve capacity of the wind/solar/storage grids is provided by the battery system''s
    comprehensive utilization. Fig. 1 displays the energy conversion diagram for Scheme
    1. The five-dimensional DTs model in Fig. 1 mainly includes five parts: the Physical
    Entity (PE), Virtual Entity (VE), Service System (SS), DTD, and CN between each
    part. The five elements complement each other and form the DTs of the intelligent
    building [29]. Ma et al. (2022) designed a DTs-driven operational mechanism and
    a general framework for big data cleaning and integration to explain and illustrate
    sustainable smart manufacturing in smart buildings [30]. In the intelligent building
    DTs, the PE is a physical product that the user can operate. In addition to completing
    the normal function output, it is necessary to collect the parameters required
    by the environment and the building''s own operating system to drive the VE model
    of the information domain.; VE is the mapping of the PE and the basis for building
    a five-dimensional DTs model. It can characterize and describe the PE of intelligent
    buildings from multiple dimensions, multiple spatial scales, and multiple time
    scales. SS is a newly added dimension and is the main driver of the DTs model.
    It relies on the virtual space algorithm library, model library, database, and
    expert knowledge base to make decisions on the operation scenario and status of
    the intelligent building energy storage system to realize the scheduling of thermal
    network clusters [31]. DTD is the data that exists and operates according to the
    rules defined by the system in the DTs model. It mainly studies and analyzes the
    operation and data flow processing of the DTs system of intelligent buildings.
    CN can complete the interconnection and intercommunication between the various
    components. PE, VE, and SS are regarded as structural points. The topology of
    the DTs model of the intelligent building can be formed through the connection
    between the structural issues. Fig. 2 reveals the DTs model of an intelligent
    building based on the five-dimensional DTs system. Download : Download high-res

    for Scheme 2. Scheme 2 combines the energy storage effect of the wall with other
    equipment such as wind turbines, photovoltaic panels, and battery energy storage
    systems and only uses the battery energy storage system as a spinning backup.
    Fig. 2 shows the energy conversion diagram for Scheme 2. Fig. 2 depicts the evolution
    of the DTs intelligent building model. First, identify the physical entity, i.e.,
    the component of the intelligent building, and provide the pertinent physical
    entity specification. Second, develop a virtual entity, abstract the spatial structure
    of the intelligent building, and evaluate simulations using the relevant model.
    Third, design data; determine the data that must be collected when the smart building
    is in operation, as well as the equipment required for data collection. Fourth,
    establish a connection; clarify the connection between the physical entity and
    the virtual entity of the smart building, as well as the connection protocol used.
    Fifth, test the smart building. Sixth, validate the smart building. Fifth, realize
    the service aimed at the intelligent building''s practical issues, enhance the
    traditional scheduling process, and develop a platform to present the intelligent
    building''s DTs data. The user tests and evaluates the developed intelligent building
    model, makes specific improvement suggestions, and enriches and refines software
    requirements, such as adding vision and physical entity models, making suggestions
    for improving traditional scheduling algorithms, and adding other new requirements.
    Naturally, the developer will use this information to enhance the software until
    the user''s approval and satisfaction are obtained, after which the software will
    be fully implemented, tested, and maintained. 3.2. Analysis of PCW structure material
    and the thermal network DTs model of intelligent buildings During the construction
    of the building, the materials used in the PCW structure are the basis of the
    thermal energy storage system. A PCM transforms its physical properties and absorbs
    or releases a large amount of heat as the temperature changes [32]. At present,
    PCMs commonly used in building materials usually exist in the form of solid–liquid
    mixed storage. They have the advantages of low price, high energy density, constant
    temperature storage, small occupied volume, and long service life and have been
    widely concerned by scholars in related fields. If the PCM is filled in the building,
    the PCM wall can be formed [33]. Liu et al. (2020) designed shape-stabilized PCMs
    with desirable latent enthalpies and found that these materials had satisfactory
    shape stability as well as excellent thermal energy management [34]. Here, the
    PCM is placed in the indoor building structure. The DTs technology is introduced
    to establish a DTs model of the PCW material and its thermal network in an intelligent
    building, as presented in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (198KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Energy conversion diagram for Scheme 3. In
    Scheme 3, the cooling or heating used by the user end adopts the conventional
    power grid''s maximum output operation mode and only uses the microgrid battery
    energy storage system as a rotating backup. Fig. 3 presents the energy conversion
    diagram for Scheme 3. As shown in Fig. 3, the PE data of the intelligent building
    wall is mapped into the virtual space through DTs technology after collection.
    It is assumed that the three sides of the virtual wall of the intelligent building
    (including the PCW) face the shade, and the other side is subject to solar radiation
    (named wall No. 1). Besides, the convective heat exchange between the air gap
    of the PCM wall and the room air is enhanced by installing a forced air circulation
    system in the phase change wall. At the same time, the thermodynamic model takes
    into account the heat leakage of the PCM to the indoor and outdoor environments,
    which contributes to the thermal balance between the nodes of the intelligent
    building. In this thermal network model, solar radiation is expressed as g i ;
    the input variables include the ambient temperature T am t and the temperature
    T P t of the PCM; the controllable variable is the circulating air velocity m
    t ; the state variables include the indoor air temperature T R t , the PCM wall
    air gap air temperature T ag t , and the internal and external surface temperature
    of the structure T k t , k ∈ N , where N = 4 represents the number of walls. Take
    the cooling mode of the intelligent building thermal network in summer and the
    heating mode in winter as an example. According to the law of thermodynamics,
    the uncontrollable heat leakage of PCM at time t includes indicators such as Q
    Leak t , Q o - a t , Q i - p rt , Q i - a t , and Q i - p rt [35]. Q Leak t refers
    to the total amount of uncontrollable heat leakage from PCM to the inside and
    outside of the building; Q o - a t and Q i - p rt represent the heat leaked from
    PCM to the outer wall of the building phase change wall through conduction and
    radiation; Q i - a t and Q i - p rt indicate the heat leaked from PCM to the building
    phase change wall through conduction and radiation of the inner wall. The details
    are shown in Equations (1)∼(5): (1) Q Leak t = Q o - a t + Q o - p rt + Q i -
    a t + Q i - p rt (2) Q o - a t = h o A o T o t - T ag t (3) Q o - p rt = h o r
    A o T o t - T P t (4) Q i - a t = h i A i T i t - T ag t (5) Q i - p rt = h o
    r A i T i t - T P t In Equations (1) ∼ (5), h o , h i , h o r , and h o r represent
    the heat conduction and heat radiation coefficients of the PCM and the outer wall
    and inner wall; A o and A i refer to the contact area between the outer and inner
    layers of the wall and the air gap of the phase change layer, respectively; T
    o t and T i t denote the nodal temperature of the outer and inner walls of the
    PCW. The controllable heat transfer Q Ctrl t of the forced air circulation at
    time t is calculated as the enthalpy change difference between the air inlet and
    outlet of the PCW, as shown in Equation (6). (6) Q Ctrl t = m t C A T R t - T
    P t In Equation (6), C A indicates the specific heat capacity of air; T R t denotes
    the indoor air temperature; m t refers to the circulating air flow rate, which
    at any moment t is bounded by the maximum air flow rate m max , expressed as 0
    ⩽ m t ⩽ m max . Equation (6) is a bilinear expression multiplying the controllable
    variable circulating air flow rate m t and the state variable room air temperature
    T R t . The transformation of Equation (6) is briefly discussed. If the circulating
    air flow rate m t ≠ 0 , the optimization of indoor air temperature T R t should
    be kept at the upper limit of human comfort temperature T R max under the summer
    cooling release mode working condition. Otherwise, the circulating air flow rate
    m t in the indoor circulation air can be further reduced to reduce the energy
    loss of the thermal energy storage system. If the circulating air flow rate mt
    = 0, the controlled heat transfer Q Ctrl t in Equation (6) is always 0 under any
    T R t [36], [37]. Therefore, the constant human comfort temperature upper limit
    T R max can be replaced by the variable indoor air temperature T R t . Equation
    (6) can be transformed into the linear formula shown in Equation (7). (7) Q Ctrl
    t = m t C A T R max - T P t Therefore, after the comprehensive analysis of Equations
    (1) ∼ (7), the total heat load P TL t of the building is expressed as the total
    energy of controllable heat transfer and uncontrollable heat leakage, as presented
    in Equation (8). (8) P TL t = Q Ctrl t + Q Leak t In addition, the thermal balance
    correlation of intelligent buildings can be further analyzed according to the
    above equations. Equation (9) indicates the PCM heat balance. (9) Q Ctrl t + Q
    o - a t + Q i - a t = Q a - p t In Equation (9), Q a - p t refers to the heat
    flow from the air gap of PCW to PCM at time t. The heat flow from the external
    environment to the outer PCW is equal to the heat transfer between the outer PCW
    and the air gap or between PCM and other building walls. Thus, the heat balance
    of the outer PCW can be expressed as Equation (10). (10) Q o t = Q am - o t =
    Q o - a t + Q o - p rt + Q o - Δ t In Equation (10), Q o t and Q am - o t refer
    to the heat loss of the outer PCW and the heat flow from the external environment
    to the outer PCW at time t, respectively; Q o - Δ t represents the heat flow from
    the remaining walls of the building to the outer PCW at time t. The heat exchange
    between the room air and the inner surface of the other walls to the phase change
    interior wall is equal to the heat exchange between the phase change interior
    wall and the air gap, PCM, and the inner surface of the other walls. Hence, the
    heat balance of the inner PCW can be written as Equation (11). (11) Q R - i t
    + ∑ j = 1 N Q j - i rt = Q i - a t + Q i - p rt + Q i - Δ t In Equation (11),
    Q i - Δ t signifies the heat flow from the rest of the building walls to the inner
    PCW at time t; Q j - i rt refers to the heat flow of the envelope j to the inner
    PCW at time t, Q R - i t denotes the heat flow from the room air to the inner
    PCW at time t. Equations (12) ∼ (14) express the heat balance of each wall of
    the building [38]. (12) Q k t = Q am - k t + Q am - k rt + Q Δ - k t k = 2 (13)
    Q k t = Q am - k t + Q Δ - k t k ≠ 2 , k ∈ N (14) Q k t = Q k - R t + ∑ j = 1
    , j ≠ k N Q k - j t k ∈ N Equations (12), (13) represent the thermal balance relationship
    between each building wall and the outside world. Equation (14) indicates the
    thermal balance relationship between each building wall and indoor air and other
    walls. Q k t refers to the heat loss of the enclosure structure k at time t; Q
    Δ - k t represents the heat flow from the remaining walls of the building to the
    enclosure structure k at time t; Q am - k t denotes the radiation heat transfer
    from the external environment to the enclosure structure k at time t; Q k - R
    t signifies the heat flow from the enclosure structure k to the room at time t;
    Q k - j t stands for the heat flow from the envelope structure k to the envelope
    structure j at time t. The heat exchange of the solar radiation wall (Wall 1)
    of the building is marked as Q am - k rt , as shown in Equation (15). (15) Q am
    - k rt = α sw g t k = 2 In Equation (15), α sw refers to the radiation heat transfer
    coefficient. The heat exchange from room air to the PCM and the inner PCW is equal
    to the heat exchange between the other walls except for the PCW and the room air.

    phase change materials and explains the thermodynamic content of phase change
    materials when applied to intelligent buildings. The findings provide the foundation
    for the following thermodynamic energy storage and dispatching models for intelligent
    buildings. 3.3. Analysis of the thermal energy storage and dispatch model based
    on DTs of intelligent buildings Because the building has a certain heat capacity,
    when the thermal power changes, the indoor temperature changes relatively lag,
    but the human body has a certain range of comfortable temperatures. The energy
    storage characteristics of PCMs can meet the indoor cooling/heating needs of buildings.

    based on DTs for intelligent buildings. In Fig. 4, the physical space is a complex,
    dynamic architectural environment consisting of the data collection layer, the
    data analysis layer, and the network perception layer. The five major elements
    of the data collection layer are construction personnel, mechanical equipment,
    materials, work methods, and the environment. It collects the most original data
    sources related to intelligent buildings. Then, the data analysis layer processes
    the acquired data sources to form economic cost data, environmental cost data,
    energy cost data, and construction safety data, respectively. The model transmits
    the multi-source heterogeneous data obtained from the analysis and processing
    layers to the virtual space and simultaneously receives instructions from the
    virtual space, and reacts accordingly. The network perception layer is responsible
    for the perception and collection of data and the transmission of data to the
    virtual space. The model uploads real-time data of construction activities into
    the virtual space by establishing a set of standard data interfaces and communication
    protocols in the network module to achieve uniform conversion and transmission
    of data from different sources. The thermal energy storage and distribution of
    intelligent buildings in this model rely heavily on PCM phase change walls. There
    is no need to transform light energy and local scattered energy into heat energy
    for building walls when generating electricity. The thermal energy of the building
    wall is converted into electrical energy for the user end by the generator, and
    the battery system provides the rotating reserve capacity for the wind/solar/storage
    grid. Following is a description of the relevant thermal energy scheduling mechanism
    involved. Here, Q d refers to the heat dissipation power of the building (kW);
    T out represents the outdoor temperature (℃); T in signifies the indoor temperature
    (℃); C A refers to the specific heat capacity of the air, and the unit is kJ/(kg·K).
    From the two working conditions of heating in winter and cooling in summer, the
    relationship between the heat inside and outside the building and the temperature
    is expressed as Equations (17), (18). (17) Q H - Q d = C A × ρ × V × d T out -
    T in dt (18) Q d - Q AC = C A × ρ × V × d T in - T out dt Equations (17), (18)
    represent the two working conditions of heating in winter and cooling in summer,
    respectively. ρ stands for the air density (kg/m 3); Q H refers to the heating
    power in winter (kW); Q AC signifies the cooling power (kW) in summer; V refers
    to the volume capacity of the building. Assume that the heat dissipation power
    of the building is unchanged during the heat release and heat storage process.
    Then, the maximum charge and discharge energy E max (kW) provided by the building
    energy storage can be expressed as Equation (19). (19) E max = ∫ t max t min Q
    H - Q d d t = 2.7778 × 10 - 4 C A ρ V T in | T max T min The indoor temperature
    of a building is a response to a combination of factors, such as outdoor temperature,
    solar radiation, and indoor heat sources. To simplify the calculation, the external
    wall of the building is conducted as one-dimensional heat output according to
    the relevant thermodynamic knowledge. According to the law of energy conservation,
    the heat balance of the indoor temperature node is established as Equation (20).
    (20) C A ρ V d T in d τ = h in A w T out - T in + Q cov + Q c + Q in + C A ρ V
    N V / 3600 + k win A win T out - T in In Equation (20), h in refers to the convective
    heat transfer coefficient of the interior wall surface; A w denotes the surface
    area of the external wall; k win stands for the thermal conductivity of the window;
    A win refers to the area of the window; d τ stands for the interval time period;
    Q cov represents the convective heat transfer of the indoor heat source; N V refers
    to the number of air changes; Q c indicates the solar heat gained through windows;
    Q in refers to the indoor heat source radiating heat. Further, the multiobjective
    operation optimization modeling is carried out on the thermal energy storage and
    scheduling model of intelligent buildings. Its objective function is analyzed
    in terms of economic cost, environmental cost, and energy cost, respectively.
    The financial cost mainly includes the fuel cost of power generation by the system,
    the power purchase cost of the system from the grid, and the cost of equipment
    maintenance. The fuel cost F fluel generated by the consumption of natural gas
    by the micro gas turbine is calculated according to Equation (21). (21) F fluel
    = C gas V gas In Equation (21), C gas refers to the unit price of natural gas,
    and V gas represents the unit volume of natural gas. The power purchase cost F
    pur of the system is expressed as Equation (22). (22) F pur = C b t ∑ t T P grid
    t Δ t - ∑ t = 1 T C c t P excess t Δ t In Equation (22), T refers to a dispatch
    cycle; P grid t represents the power purchased from the microgrid to the grid
    in the t period; P excess t stands for the power sold by the microgrid to the
    grid in the t period (kW); C b t refers to the electricity purchase price in the
    t period; C c t signifies the point-of-sale electricity price from the microgrid
    to the larger grid in period t. The maintenance cost F om of the system can be
    expressed as Equation (23). (23) F om = P WT t C WT , o m + P PV t C PV , o m
    + P bt t · C bt , o m + P MT t C MT , o m + P WH t C WH , o m + γ MT P MT t C
    AC , o m In Equation (23), P WT t , P PV t , and P bt t refer to the fan output,
    PV output, and battery charge and discharge power, respectively (positive when
    charging and negative when discharging); C WT , o m , C PV , o m , C bt , o m
    C MT , o m , C WH , o m , and C AC , o m represent the maintenance costs of fans,
    PVs, batteries, micro gas turbines, waste heat boilers, and absorption chillers,
    respectively. Therefore, the minimum objective function of economic cost is written
    as Equation (24). (24) min f 1 = F fluel + F pur + F om Environmental costs mainly
    consider carbon dioxide emissions. The system uses natural gas as fuel. The combustion
    of natural gas produces carbon dioxide and water. The power purchased by the system
    from the grid is also derived from the electricity generated by thermal power
    plants, which also produce carbon dioxide. Thus, the environmental cost is represented
    by the carbon dioxide conversion coefficient [39]. The objective function for
    the minimum carbon dioxide emission of the system is: (25) min f 2 = k f ∑ t T
    P MT t η c L gas + k g ∑ t T P grid t where k f and k g refer to the carbon dioxide
    conversion coefficient of natural gas and electric energy, respectively. Energy
    cost is the amount of energy consumed. As primary energy, natural gas belongs
    to non-renewable energy. Now, fossil energy has been exhausted day by day [40],
    [41]. The objective function for minimizing energy consumption and energy waste
    is written as Equation (26). (26) min f 3 = ∑ t T C t + ∑ t T H t + ∑ t T E t
    In Equation (26), C t refers to the daily cooling capacity of the microgrid in
    the smart building thermal energy storage and dispatch model; H t represents the
    daily heat supply produced by the microgrid in the model; E t denotes the daily
    power generation of the microgrid in the system. 3.4. Experimental performance
    evaluation A case study is performed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness
    of the proposed thermal energy storage and scheduling model based on DTs of smart
    buildings. This section selects a typical photovoltaic-integrated smart building
    group as the research object. The specific environment and parameter settings
    are as follows. The total installed capacity of rooftop photovoltaics in the smart
    building group is 1500 kW, and the total number of rooms equipped with phase-change
    material energy storage systems is 400. The size of the room is 4500 × 4500 ×
    3400 mm, and the mass of phase change material configured on the wall of each
    room is 600 kg. A 3 kW heat pump and a circulation fan with a maximum air velocity
    of 5 kg/s are installed. In this experiment, the hardware and software configurations
    are as follows. In the software, the operating system is Linux 64bit, the Python
    version is Python 3.6.1, and the development platform is PyCharm; in the hardware,
    the CPU is an Intel core i7-7700@4. 2 GHz 8-core, the memory is Kingston ddr4
    2400 MHz 16G, and the GPU is an Nvidia GeForce 1060 8G. For the sake of focus
    and hypothesis analysis, this work assumes that all rooms have the same comfort
    temperature interval and uses a centralized control strategy of the energy management
    system. The energy dispatch center sends dispatching commands to the building
    thermal energy storage system in each house to control the heat pump power and
    circulating air flow rate of the building thermal energy storage system in each
    house. The model developed during this study is referred to as scheme 1. It transfers
    the heat energy from the building''s walls into electrical energy for power generation
    using a generator. The spinning reserve capacity of the wind/solar/storage grids
    is provided by the battery system''s comprehensive utilization. As evidence of
    the superiority of the proposed technique, the following two plans are presented
    for comparison. Scheme 2 combines the energy storage effect of the wall with other
    equipment such as wind turbines, photovoltaic panels, and battery energy storage
    systems and only uses the battery energy storage system as a spinning backup.
    In Scheme 3, the cooling or heating used by the user end adopts the conventional
    power grid''s maximum output operation mode and only uses the microgrid battery
    energy storage system as a rotating backup. 4. Results and discussion 4.1. System
    optimization power under different schemes Fig. 5 compares the three schemes mentioned
    above to explore the optimal power of the system. In Fig. 5, the power station
    output represents the electric energy generated by the microgrid power station;
    the battery output represents the electric energy generated by the microgrid battery
    energy storage system; the net load power is the sum of the power station output
    and the battery output power. Download : Download high-res image (325KB) Download

    under different schemes (a. Scheme 1; b. Scheme 2; c. Scheme 3). It can be seen
    from Fig. 5 that under the three schemes, the net load is negative from 1:00 to
    4:00; the output of wind power and PVs is greater than the conventional grid load.
    Scheme 3 adopts the maximum output operation mode to maintain a high output; Scheme
    1 and Scheme 2 consider the dynamic energy storage characteristics of the building
    wall energy storage, avoiding battery overcharge to dissipate a large amount of
    surplus renewable energy and consuming less. At 21:00, when the net load is in
    the peak period, the wind power and PV output cannot meet the normal load demand.
    Users of Scheme 1 and Scheme 2 need to purchase electricity from the power station
    to run at close to full power generation power, avoiding the need for the battery
    to meet a large number of loads. It can effectively reduce the peak-to-valley
    difference of the equivalent load of the microgrid and play the role of shifting
    peaks and filling valleys. The above analysis demonstrates that the scheduling
    and operation strategy of the building wall energy storage with dynamic energy
    storage characteristics is considered in this scheme with a great degree of flexibility.
    It can avoid the overcharge or over-discharge of the battery in the microgrid,
    reduce the power consumption of the battery, and extend the service life of the
    battery to a certain extent. Fig. 6 reveals the deterministic dispatch under the
    conditions of electricity-thermal uncertainty under the three scenarios, deterministic
    dispatch power consumption and day-ahead sale and purchase power of sea island
    microgrid PV power, heat pump power of the building energy storage system, and
    energy storage capacity of PCW. Download : Download high-res image (264KB) Download

    and day-ahead power consumption under different schemes (a. Scheme 2; b. Scheme
    3; c. Scheme 1). According to Fig. 6, under different schemes, the PV power generation
    is not enough to meet the user''s electricity demand during the period of 1:00–6:00,
    13:00–14:00, and 19:00–24:00 every day. Therefore, smart building micro-grid users
    meet the demand for conventional electrical loads by purchasing the right amount
    of electricity from the grid. Then, the remaining electricity is converted into
    thermal energy by the heat pump and delivered to the building phase change energy
    storage system to meet the heat demand of island residents. During the hours of
    7:00–13:00 and 15:00–18:00 when the PV power is generated, the island intelligent
    building micro-grid does not purchase electricity from outside or sell electricity
    in small amounts at a fixed price. Moreover, the surplus electricity of the island
    micro-grid is converted into thermal energy of the building phase change energy
    storage system for storage. Besides, the energy is released through the phase
    change material and forced air circulation system in the intelligent building
    to directly meet the thermal demand of the island residents. Scheme 1 can convert
    the thermal energy of the building wall into electric energy for the user end
    through the generator and comprehensively utilize the battery system to provide
    the rotating reserve capacity of the wind/solar/storage grid. Therefore, the power
    purchase required in Scheme 1 is significantly less than that in Scheme 2 and
    Scheme 3, while the electricity sold is obviously larger than that in Scheme 2
    and Scheme 3. In addition, the analysis of the PCW energy storage system for intelligent
    buildings in the three schemes indicates that the capacity of Scheme 1 is always
    in the range of 0.2 ∼ 0.8 on the all-weather scale; the capacities of Scheme 2
    and Scheme 3 are smaller than Scheme 1. The result suggests that the DTs-based
    intelligent building thermal energy storage and dispatching model constructed
    here has no thermal energy loss exhaustion or inflow overflow and realizes long-term
    peak-shaving and valley-filling of large power grid loads. The PV-integrated buildings
    reported here are compared with traditional residential buildings and office buildings
    in terms of electrical load and indoor heat source values, as shown in Fig. 7.

    different types of buildings (a. electric load; b. indoor heat source value).
    Fig. 7 compares the electrical load and indoor heat source values for different
    types of buildings. It can be seen from the Fig. 7 that the electric load value
    consumed by office buildings is the largest and the indoor heat source value is
    higher. The photovoltaic integrated buildings constructed in this study can have
    a higher indoor heat source while maintaining a lower electrical load value. Therefore,
    the PV-integrated buildings constructed here have a better wall energy storage
    effect and lower power consumption compared with residential and office buildings.
    4.2. Cost consumption under different schemes The thermal energy storage and dispatch
    model of smart buildings based on DTs reported here is compared with the models
    proposed by Antoniadou-Plytaria et al. (2020), Cui et al. (2020), Ren et al. (2021),
    and Dong et al. (2022) The algorithm under different risk indicators (0, 0.05,
    0.1, 0.15, 0.2) from the perspectives of economic cost, environmental cost, and
    energy cost. Fig. 8 provides the results. Download : Download high-res image (582KB)

    cost, and energy cost with the increase of risk indicators under different models
    (a. economic cost; b. environmental cost; c. energy cost). Fig. 8a shows that
    with the increase of risk indicators, the economic cost required by each model
    algorithm increases sequentially, and the cost required by the model reported
    here is significantly lower than that of other model algorithms. In Fig. 8b, as
    the risk index increases, the environmental cost required by each model algorithm
    increases sequentially. The cost of the research model is significantly lower
    than other model algorithms. In Fig. 8c, as the risk index increases, the energy
    cost required by each model algorithm increases sequentially. The cost of the
    research model is significantly lower than other model algorithms. The model reported
    here achieves functional regulation and reduces the consumption of economic costs,
    environmental costs, and energy costs. Therefore, the thermal energy storage and
    dispatching model of intelligent buildings based on DTs constructed here can enhance
    the energy storage effects of buildings, cut down economic costs, environmental
    costs, and energy costs, and enhance safety performance. 5. Discussion The comparability
    and verification of the smart building thermal energy storage and dispatching
    model based on DTs'' viability and efficiency. First, three schemes were used
    to conduct a system-optimized power analysis. It was discovered that the thermal
    energy dispatching mechanism described in this study can extend the battery''s
    service life to some degree. Simultaneously, analyses of the deterministic scheduling
    power consumption and day-ahead trading power under distinct strategies. The DTs-based
    intelligent building thermal energy storage and scheduling model developed here
    lacks both thermal energy loss exhaustion and inflow overflow. This may be because
    this research model avoids over-discharge of the battery to meet a large number
    of load demands, which can effectively reduce the peak-to-valley difference of
    the equivalent load of the microgrid and play the role of shifting peaks and filling
    valleys to realize long-term maintenance of large power grid loads. This is consistent
    with the views put forward by Pekárová et al. (2022) [42] and Zhao et al. (2022)
    [43]. This work is compared with the research of scholars in related fields in
    terms of economic cost, environmental cost, and energy cost. It can be found that
    with the increase of risk indicators, the economic cost, environmental cost, and
    energy cost required by each model algorithm increase in turn. And, the cost of
    the model reported here is significantly lower than other model algorithms. This
    may be because DTs technology can digitally interact with the construction status
    and information of the building complex when building photovoltaic integrated
    buildings, make quick decisions about problems that come up during construction
    and the operating status of equipment and components, and then control functions.
    This is consistent with the view put forward by Odukomaiya et al. (2021) [44].
    Finally, it shows that the thermal energy storage and scheduling model of intelligent
    building based on DTs built here can provide experimental basis and development
    direction for the intelligent development and sustainable economic development
    in the follow-up construction field. 6. Conclusion In the era of rapid development
    of information technology, the construction sector is also developing in the intellectual
    direction. The innovation and contribution of this work lie in the incorporation
    of DTs technology into the design of intelligent buildings so that the data generated
    by the energy storage systems of intelligent buildings in the real world can be
    mapped to the virtual world for simultaneous analysis in real time. Simultaneously,
    the PCM wall construction and thermal energy storage and distribution model of
    the thermoelectric intelligent building are built. When power generation is required,
    the thermal energy scheduling mode used here transfers building wall thermal energy
    through a generator into electrical energy for user-end usage. Experimental evaluations
    show that the energy storage capacity of building walls consistently remains in
    the range of 0.2 ∼ 0.8 on an all-weather scale. From the perspective of cost consumption,
    the economic cost, environmental cost, and energy cost of the model reported are
    significantly lower than the existing model. This work contributes to the subsequent
    intelligent development of the building field and sustainable economic development.
    However, there are some deficiencies in this work. For the convenience of modeling
    and calculation, this work did not consider the impact of numerous other secondary
    factors, such as temperature fluctuations in the environment, PV cell temperature
    variations, and wind speed, on building wall energy storage scheduling. Therefore,
    follow-up research will improve the environmental factors and uncertainties in
    the building construction process to explore the effect of the robust dispatching
    strategy of the building microgrid. In addition, different residents'' preferences
    for temperature were not taken into account. It is also an added factor in the
    improvement of the energy storage system of the subsequent intelligent building
    to put the system into practice against time. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    Communications and Sensing for 6G and Beyond: A Comprehensive Review Wei Jiang
    and 14 more April 04, 2024 Next-generation cellular technologies, commonly referred
    to as the sixth generation (6G), are envisioned to support a higher system capacity,
    better performance, and network sensing capabilities. The terahertz (THz) band
    is one potential enabler to this end due to the large unused frequency bands and
    the high spatial resolution enabled by the short signal wavelength and large bandwidth.
    Different from earlier surveys, this paper presents a comprehensive treatment
    and technology survey on THz communications and sensing in terms of advantages,
    Rapid Feasibility Assessment of Energy Unit Integration in Distribution Networks
    Sicheng Gong and 2 more April 03, 2024 In contemporary heavy-load distribution
    networks, preceding feasibility assessment is imperative before incorporating
    additional energy units. However, the feasibility examination for massive combined
    operational scenarios of relevant units is computationally intensive with repetitive
    power flow calculations. To this end, this paper proposes a rapid assessment framework,
    the kernel of which is to learn from formerly examined scenarios, thus forming
    expansive feasible/infeasible regions to geometrically rule in/out subsequent
    scenarios. Without running the power flow computation in most scenarios, we accelerate
    the assessment process. Moreover, enlightened by heuristic hypersurface search,
    such prechecking efficiency can be further boosted. In a risk-averse manner, this
    framework can be conceptualized using the exact grid model. Especially, evidenced
    by testing on a 10.5kV distribution grid, the framework shows a significant assessment
    efficiency improvement and strict accuracy guarantee, where we observe at least
    76.13% assessment time reduction and zero accuracy loss in all testing cases.
    We anticipate this work to be a starting point for more sophisticated geometry-accelerating
    feasibility assessment methods. Improving Molecular De Novo Drug Design with Transformers
    Dhaval Soni and 7 more April 03, 2024 Drug design is undergoing a transformation
    as we challenge conventional methods by integrating state-of-the-art artificial
    intelligence with the intricate domain of molecular biology. At the heart of our
    endeavor lies a significant challenge: the scarcity of datasets containing active
    compounds for emerging target proteins. To confront this obstacle, we''re pioneering
    an innovative approach. We''re merging the advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer
    (GPT) architecture with the nuanced capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    networks, with the aim of generating Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System
    (SMILES) strings to unveil novel therapeutic pathways. Additionally, we''re employing
    a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pretraining strategy
    to enrich our model with comprehensive molecular data, including amino acid sequences
    and molecular SMILES datasets. Through meticulous fine-tuning on a meticulously
    curated protein-ligand complex dataset, we''re achieving precise conditional generation
    via autoregressive supervised learning. Our research introduces a groundbreaking
    method to assess molecular affinity, validated against established proteins, showcasing
    superior binding affinities compared to certain FDA-approved drugs in docking
    experiments. By pushing the boundaries of generative algorithms and establishing
    a robust framework for evaluating molecular affinity, we''re driving forward the
    field of de novo drug design, offering promising therapeutic avenues and enabling
    deeper exploration of the chemical landscape. Formalising a Gateway-based Blockchain

    Behavior of NO Fe-Si Sheets under Tensile and Compressive Stress Carlo Appino
    and 6 more April 03, 2024 The stress dependence of the magnetic properties of
    non-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets has been investigated by measurement and analysis
    of hysteresis loop, magnetization curve, and energy losses taken at different
    peak polarization values Jp (0.5 T – 1.5 T) between DC and f = 400 Hz. The salient
    feature of the material response to the stress lies in the monotonic deterioration
    of the soft magnetic properties, across the whole (Jp - f) domain, on passing
    from the maximum tensile stress (σ = +30 MPa) to the maximum compression (σ =
    -30 MPa). This is understood in terms of stress-induced redistribution of the
    domains between easy axes, making magnetic hardening by compression directly related
    to unfavorably directed domains and 90° domain-wallmediated magnetization transitions.
    The loss decomposition is carried out across the whole investigated frequency
    range, taking into account the skin effect at the highest frequencies. Quasi-static
    and dynamic losses follow a same trend with σ, both monotonically increasing on
    passing from the tensile to the compressive stress limits, according to the theoretically
    expected relationship existing between the hysteresis and the excess loss components.
    The latter is shown to identify the correlation regions where the magnetization
    is reversed of size comparable with the average grain size and loosely following
    the dependence of the loss figure on the applied stress. A bio-inspired hardware
    implementation of an analog spike-based hippocampus memory mo... Daniel Casanueva-Morato
    and 4 more April 03, 2024 The need for processing at the edge the increasing amount
    of data that is being produced by multitudes of sensors has led to the demand
    for mode power efficient computational systems, by exploring alternative computing
    paradigms and technologies. Neuromorphic engineering is a promising approach that
    can address this need by developing electronic systems that faithfully emulate
    the computational properties of animal brains. In particular, the hippocampus
    stands out as one of the most relevant brain region for implementing auto associative
    memories capable of learning large amounts of information quickly and recalling
    it efficiently. In this work, we present a computational spike-based memory model
    inspired by the hippocampus that takes advantage of the features of analog electronic
    circuits: energy efficiency, compactness, and real-time operation. This model
    can learn memories, recall them from a partial fragment and forget. It has been
    implemented as a Spiking Neural Networks directly on a mixed-signal neuromorphic
    chip. We describe the details of the hardware implementation and demonstrate its
    operation via a series of benchmark experiments, showing how this research prototype
    paves the way for the development of future robust and low-power mixed-signal
    neuromorphic processing systems. Exploratory Study of oneM2M-based Interoperability
    Architectures for IoT: A Smart Cit... VJS Pranavasri and 6 more April 03, 2024
    The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in transformative possibilities
    for smart cities, with the potential to revolutionize urban living through enhanced
    connectivity and data-driven decision-making. However, the effective realization
    of IoT in smart cities hinges upon the seamless interoperability of diverse devices
    and systems. To address this critical need, the oneM2M standards initiative has
    emerged as a foundational framework for IoT interoperability. In this research
    paper, we perform an exploratory analysis of three prominent open-source oneM2M
    based interoperability systems-Mobius, OM2M, and ACME. We leverage an existing
    large-scale system provided by our Smart City Living Lab deployed at IIIT Hyderabad,
    sprawling a 66-acre campus featuring over 370 nodes across eight verticals. We
    investigate the architectural characteristics of each solution, considering their
    strengths and limitations in facilitating IoT interoperability. Through this analysis,
    our paper aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to implement
    IoT interoperability solutions in the context of smart cities. By evaluating the
    strengths and limitations of Mobius, OM2M, and ACME, we seek to offer guidance
    for selecting the most suitable solution. Our analysis reveals that the optimal
    framework choice depends on specific quality constraints: Mobius excels in performance,
    while ACME offers advantages in ease of setup for smaller-scale implementations.
    Comparing Concepts of Service Blocking Queues in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems
    Tobias Konheiser and 3 more April 03, 2024 ZF is developing an autonomous driving
    system, which requires extensive testing of the developed devices and software
    on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems. Therefore, a robust and high-performing
    HIL system is essential. The purpose of a HIL system is to replay recorded data
    to the device-undertest. Recordings are loaded, processed and streamed to the
    deviceunder-test with real-time requirements. This streaming chain includes processing
    nodes and queues. This requires careful management of queue configurations. An
    overflow in the queue will result in packet loss, while an underflow may violate
    the real-time constraint. This study aims to develop and evaluate concepts for
    service blocking queues. These concepts block or pause the incoming service to
    a queue when necessary to avoid queue overflows and associated data loss. However,
    an out-of-the-box solution is not available and different approaches affect the
    behaviour and performance of the system. Therefore, the developed concepts are
    evaluated against each other and against the existing system based on selected
    performance parameters in specific scenarios. The scenarios cover a wide range
    of situations, reflecting standard input data with varying numbers of parallel
    streams and bottleneck scenarios forcing queue overflows or blockages. The developed
    service blocking queue concepts eliminate data loss in all scenarios, but introduce
    overhead, resulting in reduced system performance. However, the service blocking
    queue concept using a modified token-bucket approach proved to be the best solution,
    as the elimination of data loss justifies the additional overhead. This concept
    is proposed for implementation and deployment on the HIL system. Generative AI-Based
    Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and 7 more
    April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that uses neural
    networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually relevant
    text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The models are
    trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and learn complex
    concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases, and styles. FlowDep
    - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle detection for aut...
    Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection is crucial for the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles such as palm-sized drones,
    it is a challenge to implement traditional methods like Lidar due to high costs
    and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning approaches, while accurate,
    are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles. To address this issue, we introduce
    Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm inspired by the low-resolution but
    efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects. Flowdep combines optic flow
    and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the depth of every image pixel.
    We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial neural network (Flowdep-ANN).
    Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are 5.8 to 114.7 times faster than
    the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN on a small
    autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing platform, and both models
    successfully performed real-time object detection. The present work demonstrates
    the potential of using optical flow as an efficient approach to estimate depth
    and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles. Misinformative Data
    Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April 03, 2024 Sports are
    data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics and teams leverage
    data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which is created by media
    outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating narratives about
    the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data in the sports world,
    data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape. These data visualizations,
    while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers, can be misinformative;
    media creators often have incentives to present specific narratives which don''t
    always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing misinformative data
    visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to understand the techniques
    and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations in all domains,
    not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols Drew Scott
    April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are ubiquitous
    in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual authentication
    between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level communications.
    This is because tags should not share secret information with unknown parties
    and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication protocols
    designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate for
    RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy, small
    memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and practical
    authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID systems became
    prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols. The Effect of
    Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more April
    03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,
    2024 Hodge conjecture is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory based
    on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications

    model that can create videos based on simple user prompts. The model promises
    to revolutionize the way content is created. When SORA is released to the general
    public, it may transform a wide array of industries but also pose significant
    challenges and risks. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding
    of SORA''s opportunities, challenges, and implications. It explores its potential
    applications in film-making, education, gaming, advertising, accessibility, healthcare,
    and social media content creation. Additionally, it delves into its potential
    challenges and risks, including misinformation, privacy concerns, bias, regulatory
    complexities, and dependence on technology. This research provides important recommendations
    to promote responsible deployment of the AI model. Advancements and Challenges
    in Robot Grasping and Manipulation for Aspiring Researche... Claudio Zito April
    02, 2024 Robot grasping and manipulation represent pivotal aspects of robotics
    research with profound implications for the future of autonomous systems. This
    report delves into the intricacies of designing robotic hands, the hurdles in
    creating robust manipulation actions, and the advancements in the field that poised
    to catalyze a new era of autonomy. Drawing inspiration from science fiction''s

    product solution, with global revenues of up to US $ 5.9 billion by 2021. Six
    main factors drive the technology: light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, sensors,
    control, analytics, and intelligence. The Internet of things (IoT) concept with
    the end device, platform, and application layer plays an essential role in optimizing
    the advantages of LED lighting in the emergence of smart lighting. The ultimate
    aim of smart lighting research is to introduce low energy efficiency and high
    user comfort, where the latter is still in the infancy stage. This paper presents
    a systematic literature review (SLR) from a bird’s eye view covering full-length
    research topics on smart lighting, including issues, implementation targets, technological
    solutions, and prospects. In addition to that, this paper also provides a detailed
    and extensive overview of emerging machine learning techniques as a key solution
    to overcome complex problems in smart lighting. A comprehensive review of improving
    user comfort is also presented, such as the methodology and taxonomy of activity
    recognition as a promising solution and user comfort metrics, including light
    utilization ratio, unmet comfort ratio, light to comfort ratio, power reduction
    rate, flickering perception, Kruithof’s comfort curve, correlated color temperature,
    and relative mean square error. Finally, we discuss in-depth open issues and future
    challenges in increasing user comfort in smart lighting using activity recognition.

    I. Introduction Smart lighting is an innovation whose products are already on
    the market. A smart lighting product can be a Wi-Fi bulb connected to the Internet.
    This bulb connects to a downloadable application on a smartphone and a smart home
    hub such as Google Nest or Amazon Alexa. Turning the lights on or off can be done
    from the app or based on voice commands via Google Nest. Other commands and features
    provided by the product are dimming the lamp and changing the lamp’s color. The
    application has features such as setting schedules to when the lights should turn
    on or off. The main direction of smart lighting research is energy saving. The
    cause is the large proportion of energy consumption coming from lighting systems.
    In some cases, lighting in buildings can contribute up to 40% of energy consumption.
    Several strategic options allow energy savings in smart lighting, where an example
    strategy is to apply light sensors to the lighting system. It gives the ability
    to dim automatically when natural light is sufficient for lighting needs, providing
    efficiency compared to baseline consumption of up to 25%. Moreover, user complaints
    can occur when energy efficiency strategies run on targeted systems due to poor
    lighting quality [1]. It is understandable because in the rule of energy saving,
    the more often the lights dim, the better. This phenomenon contradicts the human
    need for adequate lighting. Some offices maintain a minimum light intensity standard
    (usually in lux units) to ensure employees’ productivity [2]. It even becomes
    a finding in audit when a violation of lux standard occurs. Hence, the need for
    user comfort and energy efficiency simultaneously becomes a complex matter. Machine
    learning is a method that deals with complex problems and automatically generates
    a solution in the form of a model. Several smart lighting systems have applied
    machine learning techniques. For example, Advanced smart lighting control uses
    the convolutional neural network (CNN) for computer vision. K-means, a clustering
    method, is frequently used to detect lighting levels that users find helpful.
    Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) method, an
    unsupervised learning method, can be used to find anomalies in lighting systems.
    Smart lighting systems that practice recognition, predictive control, and intelligent
    control use several supervised learning methods. Then reinforcement learning methods
    are adaptive and can be used for optimization problems. Furthermore, after considering
    the mentioned examples, it is possible that machine learning can be a solution
    to the complex problem of maintaining user comfort and energy efficiency. To our
    knowledge, no survey paper has thoroughly discussed all the machine learning techniques
    used in smart lighting research to achieve user comfort. A novel comprehensive
    survey paper can find the right solution from the available machine learning options
    to increase user comfort. Suppose user comfort options have existed in previous
    research. In that case, a research gap can become a future research opportunity
    to implement smart lighting that applies machine learning to achieve user comfort
    with a significant contribution. A. Market Trends of Smart Lighting This Section
    discusses the current state of the smart lighting market. We intend to increase
    awareness and understanding of the actual condition of smart lighting currently
    on the market. Smart lighting is by no means wishful thinking. The products are
    on the shelves, ready to purchase, and have developed since a few years ago. Brands
    are diverse, while customers can find them in shopping search machines via e-commerce
    applications. Based on Gartner’s statement in 2015, smart lighting could bring
    savings of up to 90% [3]. There are six main driving factors in smart lighting:
    1. light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, 2. sensors, 3. controls, 4. connectivity,
    5. analytics, 6. intelligence. In 2016, in the Gartner Hype Cycle for IoT, smart
    lighting has been running for two years and is in the Trough of Disillusionment
    position. In 2020, Gartner released six trends in the Hype Cycle for the Digital
    Workplace. One of them is to “bring your own things” (BYOT). The BYOT trend will
    shift towards IoT because IoT products will be more personal, including smart
    lighting. The others are smart bands, voice assistants, virtual reality (VR) devices,
    and smart earbuds. According to the Smart Home and Lighting Report 2021 issued
    by Statista, the scope of the report includes smart lighting products that have
    sensors and actuators and have computer network connectivity [4]. According to
    predictions, the Global Revenue of smart lighting in 2025 will be US $ 15.4 billion.
    This figure will more than double in 2021, which is US $ 5.9 billion. The United
    States (US) has the highest revenue forecast, but China has the highest forecast
    of compound annual growth rate (CAGR) globally. The products that dominate the
    smart lighting market are Philips Hue, TP-Link, Lifi Labs, and IKEA Tradfi. From
    the same report from Statista, smart lighting is a market entry for customers
    who want to try IoT products, especially smart home products; the reason is that
    smart lighting is cheap and easy to install. Customers will buy this product first
    before trying to buy other similar products. Figure 1 shows that the penetration
    rate forecast of smart lighting is higher than other smart products. In terms
    of penetration rate, Australia has the highest penetration rate for smart lighting
    globally, with a value of 13%. FIGURE 1. A line chart comparison that shows the
    growth and projection of four smart home products from 2019 to 2025 and displays
    that the smart lighting penetration rate is higher than other products. Show All
    B. Related Survey Papers Many survey papers have discussed smart lighting, but
    none have prioritized the comprehensive discussion of artificial intelligence
    and machine learning methods applied in smart lighting also the applications of
    each machine learning method. Table 1 shows the survey paper’s comparison. Füchtenhans
    et al. [5] focuses on smart lighting as a promising technology in the order picking
    process in the warehouse. Then this paper maps each smart lighting theme to its
    relevance in the order picking stages. Finally, this paper relates smart lighting
    to managerial issues. Chew et al. [6] discusses smart lighting products that are
    already on the market. This paper also examines the field of communication and
    visible light communication (VLC) in smart lighting. Finally, this paper concludes
    that the direction of smart lighting is a combination of several methods to increase
    efficiency in smart lighting. Mora et al. [7] discusses the use of multimedia
    data generated from cameras installed in the city for smart cities. This paper
    compares image-based smart lighting with other smart lighting concepts such as
    motion sensor-based and Wi-Fi connections-based smart lighting. Finally, the report
    evaluates how well each architecture layer processes data in implementing the
    proposed scheme. Wagiman et al. [8] discusses smart lighting papers in general.
    First, this paper categorizes existing smart lighting studies. Then an analysis
    is carried out on what techniques dominate in smart lighting compared to other
    methods. The survey results stated that future research should improve the optimization
    technique for visual comfort. In 2019, there has been a study of machine learning
    methods but more generally on smart buildings, not in the field of smart lighting.
    Qolomany et al. [9] discusses machine learning and also big data in the smart
    building because it considers there is a vast amount of data in the system and
    data mining is a promising solution. This survey paper discusses products in smart
    buildings already on the market. This paper also discusses machine learning methods,
    categorization of these methods, advantages, disadvantages, and their potential
    application in a smart building. Cui et al. [10] discusses machine learning, but
    in the field of IoT, not in the field of smart lighting. Some of the specific
    things discussed were the application of machine learning in IoT security, edge
    computing, software-defined network (SDN), and the deployment of machine learning-based
    IoT. TABLE 1 Related Paper Survey Comparisons C. Contribution and Organization
    To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first paper that thoroughly discusses all
    the machine learning techniques used in smart lighting research. The main contributions
    of this paper are: The mapping of all machine learning methods in smart lighting
    research since 2014. The grouping of machine learning applications in smart lighting.
    The discussion of machine learning topics in smart lighting to increase user comfort.
    The identification of research gaps in the application of machine learning in
    smart lighting related to increasing user comfort. The following arrangement of
    the paper is as follows: Chapter II explains the systematic literature review
    (SLR) methodology. Chapter III covers smart lighting topics in related research,
    starting from initial research to the latest research. Then Chapter IV discusses
    machine learning methods in smart lighting research and the applications of machine
    learning methods in smart lighting. Chapter V addresses topics about increasing
    user comfort in smart lighting. Chapter VI conveys research gaps and opportunities
    in increasing user comfort in smart lighting using machine learning. Chapter VII
    is the conclusion. For the reader’s convenience, we create a table containing
    a long list of important terms related to smart lighting and machine learning
    in Table 2. TABLE 2 Abbreviations for Smart Lighting and Machine Learning SECTION
    II. Systematic Literature Review Methodology This chapter explains the methodology
    for conducting the paper survey. This paper uses a systematic literature review
    (SLR) methodology, which goes through several stages [11], [12]. The stages are:
    determining the research question, conducting search strategy and selection, then
    performing data extraction and synthesis. A. Research Question The first step
    in conducting SLR is to form research questions (RQ). RQ is the essential part
    of the introduction and motivates in doing SLR [13]. There are three RQs formed
    to start the search, which includes the following: RQ1: What are the topics discussed
    in smart lighting papers? RQ2: What smart lighting papers have applied machine
    learning? RQ3: What smart lighting papers implement machine learning to improve
    user comfort? B. Search Strategy and Selection There are two criteria in paper
    selection: inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria set boundaries
    in research and help future researchers determine gaps for further SLRs [14].
    Inclusion criteria follow the following points: String: The string “smart lighting,”
    “machine learning,” “user comfort,” and “activity recognition” are in the title.
    Language: English, Indonesian. Year: 1993 until 2021. Publication type: Journal,
    thesis, dissertation, and conference. Accessibility: Documents available in Google
    Scholar. Document type: PDF, HTML. All topics searched for and not related to
    RQ should be excluded [15]. The exclusion criteria are inaccessible papers, all
    downloaded documents whose publication type does not match the inclusion criteria,
    all papers with incomplete content, and all papers whose content does not match
    the theme of the research question. C. Data Extraction and Synthesis After collecting
    papers through inclusion and exclusion criteria, the next step is to perform data
    extraction. Data extraction has two stages: collecting paper information based
    on a data extraction form and the second is to dig deeper through quality assessment
    (QA). In data extraction, the author will usually fill out a form to collect data
    that has been extracted from a paper [16]. Table 3 shows the elements in each
    data extraction form. TABLE 3 Data Extraction Form After extracting each paper
    using the data extraction form, the next step is to do a more in-depth extraction
    through QA. QA is important because it evaluates the quality of the paper sought
    [17]. In QA, each paper contains background information, problems, objectives,
    methodologies, and results, with research gaps or future works. Table 4 shows
    the points in QA. TABLE 4 Quality Assessment List D. Literature Demographics We
    conducted a survey on 332 papers regarding smart lighting based on the inclusion
    and exclusion criteria mentioned in the previous sub-chapter. Figure 2 shows the
    number of smart lighting papers along with the trend line. There is an increasing
    trend where 59% of the publication year is within the range of 2019 – 2021. This
    increase in number shows that smart lighting is increasingly relevant and indicates
    the developing diversity of topics covered, especially in the increasingly attractive
    application of machine learning in smart lighting. FIGURE 2. A combination chart
    consisting a bar chart that displays the smart lighting publications growth per
    year and a line chart that displays the cumulative growth from 2011 to 2021. Show
    All We studied further the topic of each paper we collected. The topic classification
    of smart lighting paper is carried out based on issues, targets for implementing
    smart lighting, and technology. Issues are what motivate researchers to research
    smart lighting. The target for implementing smart lighting answers the question,
    “where will the smart lighting be implemented?”. Technology is a solution proposed
    by smart lighting researchers. Classification based on the three sets is done
    based on the keywords. Some papers do not have keywords, so the keywords need
    to be extracted from the title first. Furthermore, we conduct a simple text mining
    method to summarize important keywords. The steps in the pre-processing stage
    include tokenization, case folding, data cleaning, removing stop words, and stemming.
    Then the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) method is used to
    see which keywords are the most important among the existing keywords. Then we
    search for the top keywords of each title and sum up each keyword. Finally, we
    carry out data visualization and reporting. Based on the keyword search on the
    issue, there are four main issues when people conduct smart lighting research:
    energy efficiency, computer network performance, control performance, and user
    comfort. The four main implementation targets obtained through keyword searches
    are street lighting, building and office, home, and city. We found six leading
    technologies through keyword searches in technology: IoT, sensors, LED lights,
    intelligence, renewable energy, and energy harvesting. By looking at issues, implementation
    targets, and technology as a set, and looking at each keyword from each set as
    an element, if a Cartesian product calculates these three sets, there can be 80
    combinations of title classes, where several titles can occur within each class.
    This review aims to look at the branches of research in smart lighting and assess
    the state-of-the-art of each field and the technology used. After conducting the
    analysis, the most exciting topic in smart lighting is energy, with 44 papers,
    compared to other topics. Interestingly, more smart lighting topics discuss street
    lighting than other places. The IoT is a dominant topic in smart lighting. It
    can be understood because smart lighting uses IoT architecture. Six papers discuss
    comfort in smart lighting. Figure 3 shows the bar chart comparing the number of
    topics in smart lighting. FIGURE 3. A bar chart that shows the number of publications
    on three main topics of smart lighting where each topic is divided into subtopics
    of interest. Show All SECTION III. Smart Lighting Topics This section answers
    the first research question of the survey paper, which explains topics discussed
    in related smart lighting research. An exhaustive explanation starts with some
    initial research, goes through general topics, and ends with broad and recent
    topics related to smart lighting. General topics are then divided further into
    three categories, including the problem of the research, the implementation target,
    and the provided solution to each problem. A. History and Definitions 1993 was
    the first time there was research on smart lighting [18]. The paper did not explicitly
    define smart lighting. Still, the paper proposes smart lighting as a system connected
    to a microcontroller where the microcontroller helps make the lamp functional
    more optimal. Then, 2003 is the following time an article discusses smart lighting
    is [19]. The study used MEMS in the lighting system. The paper defines the smart
    lighting problem as to how to use smart lighting to facilitate building management
    and whether smart lighting sensor data can be processed into analytics and used
    for more efficient lighting. Even so, the solutions offered did not yet connect
    to the Internet. Another critical research in the field of smart lighting was
    in 2010 [20]. The concept provided by the paper is a clear separation between
    sensors, control units, and actuators. The paper defines that the target of smart
    lighting is lighting that is adaptive based on context and preferences. However,
    the solution does not involve an Internet connection. Only in 2011 did the same
    author propose separation between the sensor-actuator (referred to as the end
    device) and the controller connected to the Internet connection [21]. The paper
    is arguably the Internet’s first implementation of smart lighting. The paper defines
    smart lighting as a system with sensors and actuators connected in a network that
    works together to achieve user needs. The first implementation of IoT in smart
    lighting was a paper in 2014 [22]. In the proposal, a smart lighting system applies
    the complete architectural layers in the IoT, including the application layer.
    Users can directly monitor and control the system through a dashboard. Similar
    to the previous paper, this paper defines smart lighting as having sensors and
    actuators to control the lighting system. In the same year, Guo et al. [23] applies
    machine learning to smart lighting, namely AdaBoost learning on sensor data for
    intelligent control. However, the solution did implement IoT, which means that
    there is no IoT-machine learning convergence yet. In 2020, Soheilian et al. [24]
    defines smart lighting as a system consisting of LED lighting, internet connectivity,
    and optionally sensors to achieve optimal lighting with a control system. Chew
    et al. [6] add to the definition that in the future smart lighting will combine
    intelligent algorithms with IoT. Then according to Gartner, five essential components
    in smart lighting are LED lighting, sensors and actuators, connectivity, analytics,
    and intelligence. So it can be said that smart lighting is a lighting system with
    a control system, sensors, and actuators connected to the Internet and can rely
    on artificial intelligence and data science. Then it can be added in the definition
    that smart lighting aims to optimize lighting for user needs and get energy savings.
    B. Smart Lighting Issues 1) Energy Efficiency Energy efficiency is not a recent
    issue. Based on a statement in a study by Kolomiets [25], the issue of energy
    efficiency first emerged in the 1970s, when the oil economic crisis began to emerge.
    At that time, Western countries started to incorporate energy efficiency into
    government programs for the first time. Outdated and inefficient systems can also
    play a role in wasting energy [26]. With the proposed government program, the
    savings achieved are 2 to 2.5 times. Europe carried out programs to replace fossil-based
    energy sources with alternative energy sources. Soheilian et al. [27] stated that
    from 1993 to 2009, there was an increase in electricity consumption in housing
    by 32%. The problem stems from lamps with a low lifespan compared to office buildings
    and inefficient electricity use. The nature of home energy utilization is the
    low energy investment cost. Ironically, This can result in increased operational
    costs. The proportion of lighting waste to the total electricity consumption waste
    can vary according to the area and its use. According to Martirano [28], in Europe,
    lighting can contribute up to 40% of energy consumption in medium and large buildings.
    A political campaign responded to this in the EU regarding energy saving. This
    figure can change based on the case, as in Indonesia, the portion of lamps in
    its energy consumption is 30%. The problem of electricity waste is also dynamic,
    considering that the electricity waste faced today is different from the pain
    of electricity waste 30 years ago. According to Castillo et al., [29] in addition
    to saving, the trend of waste and energy demand due to smart lighting is also
    increasing. Due to the rapidly growing urban life, it will reach 2/3 of the population
    in 2050. The growth will cause the need for lighting in public areas, increasing
    electricity consumption and light pollution. The increase in the greenhouse effect
    puts pressure on the private and public sectors to find more sustainable solutions.
    According to Brown et al. [30], in California in 2020, there is a bill that requires
    that energy savings must be doubled by 2030. The solution is to reduce energy
    consumption while increasing the performance of the building management system
    and its supporting infrastructure. Technology is key in achieving this target.
    Outdated technology becomes a gap that makes it challenging to achieve this goal.
    The current system does not have the communication and intelligence capabilities
    to collect and process the required information, such as the status and usage
    of lights. Castro et al. [31] say that energy efficiency is the first goal in
    achieving sustainability. Sustainability itself is a target to be gained from
    a smart city, especially in industry, buildings, and residents [32]. The impact
    of achieving 40% energy efficiency in lighting is reducing half of the energy
    waste that the world produces. Many countries have taken serious actions against
    the greenhouse effect and global warming. González-Amarillo et al. [33] state
    that a building’s energy consumption can reach almost zero. Implementing the European
    Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) to achieve this target is necessary.
    EPBD is the main instrument of the EU legislature to improve energy performance
    in buildings over its community. The Kyoto Protocol inspired the policy, which
    made EU members commit to reducing energy emissions in buildings with binding
    targets. The Kyoto Protocol is an international treaty approved by 192 parties
    regarding commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 2) Smart Lighting Control
    The basic of smart lighting is automatic light control. The complexity of a problem
    in smart lighting affects the proposed control solution. According to Hsia et
    al. [34] there are two types of control in smart lighting, namely manual control
    and automatic control. Automatic control can apply simple control using a passive
    infrared (PIR) sensor to detect motion. Meanwhile, complex controls such as multi-color
    lighting control need intelligent methods such as artificial neural networks (ANN).
    The ANN method was also in use in a complex problem of the research by Seyedolhosseini
    et al. [35]. The ANN method controls luminaire dimming with system faults and
    daylight variation detection without increasing complexity. Apart from ANN, Karyono
    et al. [36] also mentions other methods to improve control of smart lighting,
    for example, using reinforcement learning methods to increase knowledge of schedule-based
    control as well as occupancy-based control. The complex control based on schedule
    information can control room lighting based on various conditions such as lighting
    and blinds simultaneously with satisfying performance. Several control techniques
    have been introduced in smart lighting, for example, detecting a linear relationship
    between the light sensor and the dimming level. A more complex system appears
    when the workplace is large with several controlled lights, then the position
    of the light sensor is also a consideration [37]. Adams et al. [38] reveals that
    lighting control capabilities need to be more sophisticated to achieve the net-zero
    energy building (NZEB) target. A more sophisticated control can use camera-based
    or digital sensing. The microcontroller also makes control easier because it implements
    digital solutions. Aspects that are advanced include design time, dimension, and
    price. Gagliardi et al. [39] say that lighting control is essential in reducing
    energy consumption. Even though a smart lighting system applies IoT, it must focus
    locally on lighting control. Control strategies should focus on light intensity
    based on related context. For example, smart lighting control for streetlights
    should consider traffic conditions. 3) Smart Lighting Network Several choices
    and options are applicable for a smart lighting network. For example, choosing
    between wired or wireless communication in a system brings consequences. According
    to Krasniqi and Vershevci [40], choosing the proper communication protocol for
    smart lighting is difficult because each protocol has its advantages and disadvantages.
    Besides, smart lighting in the market is available with predefined communication
    protocols. In an example case, the Z-Wave Protocol is a low-power protocol but
    is not IP-based, so networks that use this protocol may not necessarily be able
    to connect to the Internet. Even so, this protocol makes it easy to control smart
    home devices. Prittinen et al. [41] explains that recent technologies are still
    bound to current communication protocols for smart lightings, such as the Digital
    Addressable Lighting Interface (DALI) and KNX, which are standards for building
    automation. The limitations are the wired nature of the protocols, the limited
    network size, and the redundant infrastructure. These weaknesses restrict the
    protocols’ adaptability in handling the needs of an advanced smart lighting system.
    The use of the DALI protocol can enhance communication networks on smart lighting.
    Bellido-Outeiri no et al. [42] proposed a lighting network system with the combination
    of IEEE 802.15.4 wireless standard and DALI protocol. The benefits of the proposed
    system are installation efficiency provided by the wireless protocol and an effective
    bidirectional control served by the DALI protocol. Ordaz-García et al. [43] proposed
    shifting the DALI protocol on microcontrollers from software to hardware using
    a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). This shift results in a low-latency, power-efficient
    solution. Communication range is also an issue in smart lighting networks. Sutil
    and Cano-Ortega [44] created a bibliographical review on the available wireless
    technologies for smart lighting. Results show that some smart lighting technologies
    still do not depend on wireless technology. Other research uses wireless technologies
    such as Wi-Fi, GSM, low-powered wide-area network (LPWAN), Zigbee, and WiMAX.
    LPWAN is a generic term encompassing all protocols that focus on long-range, low-powered,
    and low-bitrate communications. The long-range (LoRa) network is an example protocol
    considered as LPWAN. The development of LoRa is interesting because of the openness
    of its higher-level protocol, LoRaWAN. LoRA also provides a range of low price
    devices. Zigbee is a wireless personal area network (WPAN) communication group
    that is power-efficient and cost-effective. Leccese [45] proposed Zigbee as a
    communication protocol in a street lighting system with remote control capabilities.
    Zigbee can resend packet verifications with a reliability level of 99.87% to 100%
    in various scenarios. Some new paradigms emerge in cloud computing solutions on
    smart lighting networks. According to Mijuskovic et al. [46], cloud computing
    for smart lighting has advantages. Still, when dealing with large data sizes,
    cloud computing has limitations, such as location and delay. The concept of fog
    computing is applicable to overcome the limitations of cloud computing. Light
    is a form of wave and, like radio frequency (RF) waves, can be used as a communication
    medium. Ajithkumar et al. [47] explains that visual light communication (VLC)
    still works like the very first form of wireless communication using fire and
    smoke signals. As human history advanced, the method developed into a signal lamp,
    using visual signaling for optical communication. VLC works just like signal lamps
    but with an ultra-higher speed, where its bitrate can make up to 800 THz. Vu et
    al. [48] mention that visible light has the potential to be used as communication
    in smart lighting. The concept is that LED lights and dimming control act as the
    message sender. A light sensor acts as the recipient of the message. The Institute
    of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.15.7 and its amendments are
    standards for VLC. One of the most critical requirements for VLC is to exhibit
    no flickering to the human eye. Like VLC, smart lighting power line communication
    (PLC) is significant, especially for street lights. Kiedrowski [49] explained
    that since its introduction as the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
    Standardization Sector (ITU-T), PLC has succeeded in increasing the bitrate in
    smart lighting communications. Nevertheless, the drawback of PLC is its reliability.
    Several cyber security issues also need to be faced by PLC, with smart grid vulnerabilities
    as a risk. The spread spectrum nature of PLC makes PLC suitable for using the
    orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) transmission technique. Digital
    modulation methods such as binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) and quadrature phase-shift
    keying (QPSK) can be used over OFDM on PLC [50]. 4) User Comfort Several cases
    can illustrate the importance of user comfort in smart lighting. In a study made
    by Cheng et al. [51], smart lighting works in subway trains where the number of
    passengers is small. Turning on all the lights with a dimming level of 100% would
    be a waste. Nevertheless, on the other hand, if the lights become dim, passengers
    will feel insecure and uncomfortable. Thus, user comfort will be disturbed. Park
    et al. [52] also stated that in railway lighting, user comfort is one of the essential
    aspects besides security, promptness, and convenience. The proportion of lighting
    in the railway system energy consumption is very high. Given the importance of
    the two issues, producing technology to increase train lighting energy efficiency
    should not sacrifice user comfort. Some researchers say that user comfort comes
    from technological sophistication. For the home environment, according to Soheilian
    et al. [53], smart lighting is part of a smart home that provides comfort, convenience,
    and security and satisfies residents’ needs. The two most common goals for smart
    lighting are energy savings and visual comfort. However, current research still
    focuses on the technical achievement of a proposed system without properly addressing
    well-being and comfort issues. User comfort becomes a research opportunity in
    the field of smart residential lighting. Kumar et al. [54] explain that visual
    comfort can increase by using an Android App. Android comes with a powerful interface
    that allows a person to adjust the lights, either automatically or manually. The
    ideal smart lighting control must adapt according to the conditions of the occupants
    and environmental conditions. User comfort, in several ways, is related to efficiency.
    Wang et al. [55] says that by adjusting the lighting level based on existing natural
    light, the intensity of light in an environment can be kept constant. The adjustment
    can increase savings and convenience. Maharani et al. [56] said that there is
    a contradiction when the lights turn off. On the one hand, it saves energy, but
    on the other hand, the light intensity decreases. So that the smart lighting function
    increases, not only looking for lamp savings but also looking for a balance between
    minimum energy and maximum lighting. Another aspect of user comfort apart from
    visual needs and technological sophistication is sleep comfort. Takemura et al.
    [57] say that poor sleep quality can be affected by lighting that is too bright.
    On the other hand, too low lighting can also reduce the quality of life (QOL),
    so softer lighting should not reduce QOL. On the other hand, but still related,
    Akbar et al. [58] underlines that one of the causes of wasting electricity is
    the use of lights when people are asleep. If a system exists where the artificial
    lights can turn off automatically when people fall asleep, then the benefits are
    two-fold: energy savings and improved sleep quality. Several parameters can measure
    user comfort, both subjective and objective. Kwon and Lim [59] uses a parameter
    called Kruithof’s comfort curve to evaluate the performance of its smart lighting.
    Kruithof’s comfort curve can determine the user’s comfort area in a plot between
    light intensity and color temperature. Some today’s smart lights only rely on
    motion sensors limited to human motion, not human presence. It causes the possibility
    that when someone is under artificial light, the light remains off. To not disturb
    the user, the lamp should predict the user’s activity pattern first and then decide
    on the status of the light on or off. C. Implementation Target 1) Street Smart
    Lighting Like each smart lighting installation target, street lighting has its
    unique problems. Mahoor et al. [60] said that the problems surrounding street
    lighting are reliability, resilience, energy costs reduction, and environmental
    issue management. The unique property of street light is that it is ubiquitous.
    Omar et al. [61] revealed that because street lamps are a necessary facility of
    a city, the consumption of streetlamps will also affect the economic condition
    of a country. Adjusting the street light is tricky because if it is too dim, it
    will affect the safety of road users. As with general smart lighting problems,
    energy efficiency is also a problem with street lighting. According to Martinek
    et al. [62], street lighting contributes 15% of national energy consumption. The
    current street lighting is still very inefficient. For example, the lamp will
    illuminate with maximum illumination even though no one uses the road. Data from
    Qaisar et al. [63] shows that street lamps worldwide have an energy consumption
    of 8760 Giga Watt-hour (GWh). That is to assume that there are 100 million street
    lamps globally. Based on data from Dwiyaniti et al. [64], outdoor lighting in
    the United States (US), which mostly comes from roads and parking lots, consumes
    120 hours of energy. The same amount of energy could be used to power the whole
    of New York for two years. While according to Tomczuk et al. [65], in Europe,
    1.3% of total energy consumption comes from roads. Then two-thirds of the existing
    lights do not meet the standard that they should. There are several causes of
    wasted electricity in street lights. Gupta and Gupta [66] state that the existing
    lighting technology does not reflect the progress of other technologies in the
    world. Waste that occurs and comes from lights can occur for simple reasons such
    as street light management forgetting to turn off the lights when it is morning.
    Paschalis et al. [67] explains that some of the causes of wasted street lamps
    include a low lifespan, turning on and off not based on actual conditions, conventional
    malfunction detection, and soft lighting quality. Several deployed street lighting
    solutions have implemented technology, although they are not yet the latest technology.
    Smys et al. [68] revealed that currently available technologies for street lighting
    are timers, nightfall sensors, and astronomical clocks. These technologies can
    still be improved to increase the energy efficiency obtained from street lights.
    Meanwhile, according to Galatanu [69], using the astronomical clock to turn the
    lights on and off will cause problems. The article states that special events
    such as clouds or rain do not include in the method’s calculation. In addition,
    Petrioli et al. [70] directly compare astronomical clock systems with systems
    that employ dimming capabilities based on the information on average traffic flow
    rate. The dimming capability brought by the proposed system allows for energy
    efficiency. In addition to the points already mentioned, there are many other
    considerations in smart lighting for street lights. Among others, Mohit et al.
    [71] argue that street lighting must be more sophisticated because roads are a
    strategic interest of every state. Roads keep the country’s supply chain safe
    by bringing logistics such as equipment, materials, and essential goods. 2) Office
    and Building Smart Lighting Lighting in office buildings provides a proportion
    of waste that varies between cases. According to Acosta et al., [72], lighting
    energy consumption in the building is 15% to 30%. Cihan and Güğül [73] adds that
    energy consumption in commercial buildings in the US is up to 25%, and in Turkey,
    it is up to 9%. The primary strategy for energy savings in the lighting sector
    is to utilize daylight. Besides LED lighting, dimming capability is also important
    in achieving energy efficiency. In addition, another solution is by reducing the
    illumination time. Neardy et al. [74] say dimming can provide efficiency up to
    40% and increase visual comfort. Smart lighting in the office is unique because
    the office is a place to work. Hajjaj et al. [75] explains that apart from energy
    consumption, office lighting can also affect work productivity. Intelligent lighting
    applications in the office can even customize lighting based on individual needs.
    Li et al. [76] said that the suitability of indoor illumination was also a topic.
    Sakaci et al. [77] said that the consumption of electrical energy from office
    lighting has a correlation with the workload in the office and will increase during
    peak hours. In addition to this, the lighting system needs monitoring. If the
    workload exceeds the limit, the electricity will drop, fatal to the network whose
    performance comes from its uptime. 3) Smart Home Smart lighting at home becomes
    part of a larger smart home system. A smart home is typical building automation
    for residential. The particularity of a smart home compared to a smart building
    is that the arrangement is not massive. Andramu no et al. [78] argue that home
    automation combines automation technology, computing, and computer networks. The
    benefits provided by home automation are in the areas of convenience, security,
    and energy savings. Ayan and Turkay [79] add in the definition that those who
    control remotely can be smartphones, laptops, or other items connected via the
    Internet. Rajarajeswari et al. [80] revealed that one of the causes of electricity
    wastage is the failure of householders to turn off electronic devices when not
    in use. Automation becomes paramount in the provision of smart homes. Because
    the application is at home, several technologies can be added to the smart home,
    for example, a smart home combined with renewable energy such as solar panels.
    According to Martin et al. [81], in the era of renewable energy, energy consumption
    strategies at home need to be regulated. For example, it should be heavily consuming
    when renewable energy increases and sparingly when not made. 4) Smart City In
    applying smart lighting in smart cities, urbanization is often a source of problems.
    Yang et al. [82] reveal that 50% of the world’s population lives in cities. Pasolini
    et al. [83] state that because a large number of people live in cities, urban
    development must be sustainable. Because cities account for 75% of the world’s
    energy consumption, one of the factors in sustainability is how to save electricity
    consumption. Gagliardi et al. [84] adds that the increase in energy consumption
    will focus on big cities, not small cities. 80% of the total energy generated
    will flow to the smart city grid. In addition to urbanization, the hallmark of
    a smart city is the ubiquity of connected devices. The number of smart devices
    embedded in each human being added to the number of smart devices embedded in
    the infrastructure causes a considerable amount of data to be used, among others,
    for smart lighting. Smart city lighting is not only about energy saving. Still
    related to sustainability, smart lighting in cities is also associated with urban
    design. Braw [85] says that smart lighting in cities not only turns on when people
    need it and turns off when people do not need it but can also change color to
    adjust the atmosphere to what the residents want. Smart lighting in such a way
    will be a sustainable and fun solution. D. Smart Lighting Technologies 1) LED
    Lighting In October 2012, Phillips Hue, a lighting product from Phillips that
    implemented LED lighting, was first launched. Since LED lighting began to market
    to replace fluorescent lamps, various conveniences and improvements in lighting
    quality have emerged. Wu et al. [86] said that the optical efficacy of LED lighting
    had reached 72 lm/W. This figure means that LED lighting is 75% more efficient
    than mercury lighting, which widely exists for street lamps. Then Hui et al. [87]
    adds that LED lighting has a longer lifespan, which is up to 80,000 hours. The
    advancements brought by LED lighting are multidimensional. LED lighting already
    brings significant efficiency improvements over conventional lighting without
    intelligence and computing. Askola et al. [88] revealed that LED lighting had
    become an essential driver in the industry in recent years. There is a massive
    potential for savings when replacing conventional exterior lights with LED lights.
    In Germany, the savings obtained by replacing lamps with LED lamps is 400 million
    euros. Not only efficiency, compared to conventional lamps, LED lighting is easier
    to control for light intensity and color. According to Kim et al. [89], LED lighting
    is also a driving force in customized interior-lighting design. Compared to conventional
    lamps, the advantages of LED lighting are that it is efficient, has a longer life,
    has the freedom to adjust color, and freedom to adjust light intensity. Bagheri-Sanjareh
    et al. [90] say that to control LED dimming, there are several approaches. Ways
    to control LED dimming include analog dimming and pulse width modulation (PWM)
    [91] dimming. Abdurohman et al. [92] explains that the dimming capability of LED
    lighting can add to the savings already obtained from manually turning on and
    off settings. Measurements need to prove that LED lighting can deliver savings.
    Strategies in measurement and comparison, benchmarks, and standards need to emerge.
    Ahmed et al. [93] say that there are several ways to measure LEDs. Measurements
    to calculate the energy consumption of LEDs can occur for one year. The size of
    light intensity can use simulation with tools. Jha and Kumar [94] said that in
    LED development, there is a standard, namely EC 61000-3-2 Class C. Meeting these
    standards involves developing several intelligent solutions. 2) Smart Lighting
    Sensors and Actuators The sensors commonly used in smart lighting are motion sensors,
    occupancy sensors, and light sensors [95]. The light sensor is for efficiency,
    while the motion sensor is for user comfort. Ciabattoni et al. [96] reveals that
    in monitoring smart lighting, several sensors need to operate at once. In addition
    to motion sensors and photosensors, temperature sensors can also become part of
    the system. Hoang et al. [97] add that the performance of smart lighting control
    depends on the light sensor. Therefore, making a reliable light sensor is very
    important. In smart lighting, each sensor has its way of working. Tan et al. [98]
    say that a sophisticated lighting control system involves an occupancy sensor
    and a light sensor to control the light based on natural light and achieve efficiency.
    These sensors become feedback in a control system design. Afshari and Mishra [99]
    reveal that color sensors can also be part of smart lighting. Color sensors are
    used for decentralized control and optimizing setpoint targets. One of the smart
    lighting strategies is to use human presence to control the on/off status of the
    lights. Chun and Lee [100] in their research said that ultrasonic sensors and
    PIR sensors estimate human location and function to turn on or turn off lights
    in smart lighting. It is because people’s light needs to change depending on their
    activities. Tetervenoks et al. [101] adds that there are two kinds of motion sensors:
    active motion sensors and passive motion sensors. Active motion sensors, such
    as radar, continuously emit waves to detect movement. In detecting motion, cameras
    are also sensors that are pretty common in smart lighting besides motion sensors.
    Movement can be seen from images via cameras with the implementation of computer
    vision. In addition to the sensors already mentioned, other sensors have also
    been part of the system, namely the current sensor, temperature sensor, and gas
    sensor. The actuator controls the lights. The two primary actuators used in smart
    lighting are the relay which turns the lights on or off, and the dimmer which
    dims the lights. Other actuators that are not directly connected to the lighting
    system but add other functionalities are buzzers, LCD screens, and servo motors.
    3) Internet of Things Smart lighting and IoT are two different technologies. However,
    IoT is arguably the main driver of smart lighting. Figure 4 shows an example implementation
    of smart lighting. A lighting system will communicate with dimmers and sensors
    via the access point. Then there is the user application, where the example in
    the picture is a desktop that can show the performance monitoring of the lighting
    system. Communication between each entity uses Wi-Fi, locally or via Internet
    [102]. FIGURE 4. An illustration that shows an example of the layout of a complete
    smart lighting system applicable to a corporation where the solution connects
    to a cloud computing environment, extensive connectivity, and diverse user role
    management. Show All A typical IoT architecture for smart lighting looks like
    Figure 5. The IoT architecture consists of 3 layers: the end device, platform,
    and application. The end device layer consists of four main parts, namely sensors,
    microcontrollers, communication network modules, and actuators [103]. Common sensors
    in smart lighting are motion sensors and light sensors. Then each architecture
    is supported by the internet communication protocol as a liaison for each layer.
    FIGURE 5. A typical IoT architecture for smart lighting with three main layers:
    end device layer, platform layer, and application layer, supported by communications
    to connect all layers. Show All Several microcontrollers and mini personal computers
    (PCs) can build the end device layer in IoT smart lighting, where examples are
    BeagleBone, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and NodeMCU. Arduino is a microcontroller board
    with the ability to input, output sensors and actuators, both analog and digital
    [104]. However, Arduino cannot connect to the Internet, either wired or wireless
    [105]. So to communicate with the Internet to form an IoT platform, Arduino can
    be combined with NodeMCU [106]. NodeMCU has a Wi-Fi module built into its chip
    and can expand to Arduino’s Integrated Development Environment (IDE) [107]. However,
    NodeMCU’s hardware capabilities are not as good as Arduino’s, so its use is usually
    combined with Arduino and communicates with I2C. The most widely used type of
    Arduino is the Arduino Uno which uses the ATmega328P chip with the AVR architecture.
    The Raspberry Pi (Raspi) can be a member of the mini PC category because it has
    a high-level input-output and can connect to devices such as a monitor, keyboard,
    and mouse [108]. However, the Raspberry Pi cannot be a microcontroller because,
    although it has a general-purpose input/output (GPIO) to connect with digital
    sensors, it does not have an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to read analog
    sensors. Usually, the Raspberry Pi will add modules such as Arduino. The Raspberry
    Pi processor uses the ARM architecture, suitable for single-board computers because
    it is cheap, small, but compact. The most popular Raspberry Pi is the Raspi 3B+
    with its most known characteristics, among others are 4 USB sockets and a full
    HDMI socket. BeagleBone has capabilities like the Raspberry Pi, in terms of its
    microcontroller has an ARM architecture. In addition, BeagleBone also can communicate
    via Ethernet. Plus, BeagleBone also has a sound input-output as a microcontroller,
    but when compared to Arduino, BeagleBone has a relatively higher price. Xbee is
    a microcontroller with Zigbee communication capabilities, but Xbee usually uses
    an additional module in Arduino. IoT involves machine-to-machine communication
    and human-to-machine communication. The task of the IoT platform layer is to make
    everything connected, including contact from the microcontroller and also the
    web service for the user [109]. ThingSpeak is a form of an open data platform
    for IoT [110]. ThingSpeak is a cloud service that can monitor sensor data and
    provide a web service so that data can be accessed remotely [111]. ThingSpeak
    also has an interface to communicate with the MQTT Protocol. Another platform
    is Node-Red, which is an IoT platform based on Node.js. Node-Red has scalability
    and can be used to connect web services with IoT devices [112]. Besides ThingSpeak
    and Node-Red, there is also Thinger.io. Thinger.io can be used as a cloud service
    like ThingSpeak and can also be downloaded and installed to form a private server
    like Node-red [113]. In the application layer, the technical option is to access
    the system on a mobile or desktop device. Blynk is an open-source smartphone tool
    that can easily create mobile applications for communication with smart things
    [114]. With Blynk, programmers can choose features for the user interface such
    as buttons, sliders, or gauge [115]. Blynk can do monitoring functions and also
    control functions [116]. In addition to Blynk, programmers can also develop their
    web or take advantage of web services from the IoT platform, which usually already
    has a good user interface. Web services can connect to web browsers owned by every
    device and operating system to be accessed easily. Website development can use
    JavaScript-based Bootstrap. Socket IO is also another JavaScript-based framework
    option where its server-side runs on Node.js. Communication plays an important
    role in connecting each layer. Zigbee is a wireless communication model that has
    a short distance and has small bandwidth, making it suitable for implementing
    IoT [117]. However, Zigbee devices, usually Xbee, have a relatively high price.
    Bluetooth, like Zigbee, has a short communication range. Compared to Zigbee, Bluetooth
    has greater bandwidth, so its power consumption is also greater. Bluetooth modules
    have a relatively low price and can pair with Arduino. Long Range (LoRA) protocol
    is communication with a small bandwidth and has a long communication distance
    [118]. Wi-Fi is a common standard for local communication with large bandwidth.
    The common Wi-Fi communication module in IoT is the NodeMCU which has a relatively
    low price. After setting up, the Blynk App can then control and monitor smart
    things. Wired communication options are not much vast in smart lighting, being
    PLC and DALI among them [119]. DALI can function as a transceiver between smart
    lighting and their external devices. Information that enters and leaves the system
    includes current sensor data and lamp control data [120]. DALI is an interface
    that provides interoperability in controlling lights from various products [121].
    End device nodes, if used on a large scale, can form a wireless sensor network
    (WSN) [122]. Topology options in WSN such as grid and tree can optimize WSN network
    performance [123]. Extensive WSN communications can rely on a multi-hop routing.
    Thus, a routing protocol that has high compatibility and extensibility is needed,
    such as IPv6 over low-power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) [124]. A
    comparison of recent IoT architecture for smart lighting conducted from various
    research shows in Table 5. Various options of the end devices, platform, and application
    layers can build a complete smart lighting IoT architecture. TABLE 5 Recent IoT
    Architecture for Smart Lighting Comparison 4) Smart Lighting Intelligence Some
    particular problems in smart lighting have met their solution by applying intelligence.
    According to Kim and Park [142], intelligent smart lighting is smart lighting
    that uses AI combined with Internet functions and sensors. Zhang et al. [143]
    applies intelligence to study the lighting connection patterns between light sources
    and workspace surfaces. While intelligence in the research of Hao et al. [144]
    is using traffic information from lighting. The presented information includes
    queue length, car speed, and length of the delay. Intelligence can also play a
    role in system management, reducing manual operations. The emergence of LED lighting
    with dimming capabilities and color selection is also fueling the growth of intelligence
    in lighting. Juntunen et al. [145] implements smart street lighting based on movement.
    LED lighting is an important part of human-centric lighting (HCL), which improves
    efficiency and convenience. Kwon et al. [146] revealed that AI is one of the important
    elements besides IoT, big data, and cloud technology in the Industry 4.0 emergence.
    In addition, big companies such as Apple and Facebook are acquiring LED lighting
    companies and changing their business model in the face of this phenomenon. Karyono
    et al. [36] applies intelligence that focuses on lighting predictions that prioritize
    comfort in multifunctional rooms. Some multifunctional rooms in the homes of the
    millennial generation are narrow but practical. As the name suggests, a multifunctional
    room is a room for various activities where each activity requires a different
    level of lighting, so it requires intelligence for adaptive lighting. Intelligent
    systems are also proven to provide better performance in achieving targets than
    systems without intelligence. The research produced by Bouzid et al. [147] shows
    that with intelligence, the savings obtained are 77% more significant than without
    intelligence. Intelligent smart lighting systems can also support larger intelligent
    systems. Lyubov et al. [148] designs intelligent smart lighting that is a part
    of a smart campus. Intelligence can also enhance controls in smart lighting. Diaconu
    [149] says that with the advent of intelligence, manual control is no longer needed.
    Control via a switch must be replaceable by voice control or control via a smartphone.
    Kachane [150] reveals that complex rules are needed to regulate lighting by considering
    several things at once, including presence and lighting. The complexity in question
    further expands by providing case examples, such as movements that can occur during
    the day. In contrast, when lighting becomes highly required in the nighttime,
    special conditions occur when there is no movement. The mentioned schemes cause
    decision-making errors from a smart lighting system that only relies on a simple
    rule-based algorithm. 5) Renewable Energy and Energy Harvesting The issue of renewable
    energy as a solution arises because fueled energy is increasingly limited. Muhammad
    and Ali [151] said that renewable energy is essential because energy sources are
    increasingly limited while demand is increasing. Renewable energy can be a part
    of street lights because of the giant electricity requirements of street lamps.
    One of the implementations of renewable energy in smart lighting is to use solar
    panels. Solar panels can convert light into electrical energy. The use of a switching
    circuit can stabilize electricity. In addition to solar panels, wind turbines
    can also be used for renewable energy, as done by Kiyaki et al. [152]. Each module
    has different characteristics, but if analyzed properly, the combination of the
    two systems can produce up to 500 W of power. LED lamps are more efficient than
    conventional lamps, but the savings can increase with the addition of renewable
    energy solutions. Arianti et al. [153] adds a solar panel solution so that less
    privileged people can use it by making folk lamps. This folk lamp uses a plastic
    bottle filled with water mixed with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). Installing the
    bottle in a hole in the ceiling enables natural light to penetrate the hole and
    propagate through the room. E. Broader and More Recent Topics Related to Smart
    Lighting 1) Security Advanced smart lighting systems connected to the Internet
    make them vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks. Hofer and Russo [154] analyzes
    the possibility of cyber attacks on a smart lighting system. The result of the
    analysis is a list of threats and vulnerabilities. The main goal of a cyber attack
    on smart lighting is the system’s failure. A conceptual tree displays a comprehensive
    attack taxonomy in which the attack targets include communication, sensing, computing,
    actuation, and feedback. Examples of attacks on communication are message spoofing
    and Sybil attacks. Every vulnerability and security gap needs to address some
    form of protection. Research conducted by Rajarajeswari et al. [155] is an example
    of an effort to implement security in smart lighting. If used in smart lighting,
    man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks can occur on the MQTT communication protocol.
    Security is used at several network layers to prevent the attack from happening.
    Transport layer security (TLS) becomes a security option at the transport layer.
    In addition, the MQTT layer uses Quality of Service (QoS) level 0, which is the
    QoS with the fastest service, and there is no guaranteed delivery. When unpacking
    marshaled data from MQTT, an anomaly check is carried out on the data to filter
    suspicious data. The data goes through an encryption process to secure the system
    from sniffing attacks on the local area network (LAN). 2) Sustainability Sustainability
    is a significant factor today. Some circles consider sustainability an ongoing
    issue and continue to experience management and attention. For businesses, sustainability
    is vital for environmental factors and affects their core business. Sustainable
    development goals (SDGs) are 17 global targets proposed by the United Nations
    (UN) to achieve a better and sustainable future. In the 17 SDG targets, smart
    lighting is related to the 7th SDG, namely “affordable and clean energy.” Every
    agency can play a role in sustainability. Mansur et al. [156] consider that higher
    education institutes can play a more significant role in promoting energy efficiency
    and sustainability by implementing a smart campus. The implementation target of
    the smart lighting in the smart campus is in the toilets, where fifty-eight motion
    sensors are present in 30 different toilets, with a production efficiency of up
    to 77.5%. The contribution of this research to sustainability is the conversion
    of efficiency to carbon consumption. The resulting efficiency is equivalent to
    a decrease in gas C O 2 worth 6508 kg. Besides being applied in cities, buildings,
    houses, and streets, smart lighting can also become available in warehouses. A
    warehouse is a strategic place for the implementation of smart lighting because,
    in the warehouse, lighting energy consumption can reach 65% of the warehouse’s
    total energy consumption. Füchtenhans et al. [157] stated that by implementing
    smart lighting in the warehouse, warehouse emissions decline, and by lowering
    warehouse emissions, environmental sustainability can take place. Since sustainability
    involves a large scale, such as urban development, its implementation and planning
    also need to be provided on a large scale. Pardo-Bosch et al. [158] made a holistic
    analysis in the form of a value creation ecosystem (VCE) and a city model canvas
    (CMC) applied to the city of San Sebastian, Spain. The analysis contains the effectiveness,
    efficiency, and feasibility of any municipality that implements smart lighting
    for its street light network. A CMC resembles a business model canvas (BMC), including
    key partnerships, key activities, and value propositions. VCE maps stakeholders
    as entities, and the flow explains the benefits obtained by each stakeholder consisting
    of services and cash flow. Dankan Gowda et al. [159] explains more deeply how
    smart cities, smart lighting, and sustainability are all related to one another.
    Smart cities are referred to by many as a technology-driven solution, only attractive
    to technology companies and neglecting the needs of governments, municipalities,
    and residents. On the other hand, sustainability is concerned with how a city’s
    environment is considered a resource. Sustainability is within reach by finding
    solutions where the consumption of these resources is in balance with the production
    of their resources. Pollution of a city must not damage an environment more than
    the city’s ability to supply the environment. When combined, a smart, sustainable
    city will be born. The key to merging the two is IoT, where the implementation
    consists of various things related to smart cities and sustainable cities, one
    of which is smart lighting. An ideal solution will not be accepted if the idea
    can not provide tangible benefits. This fact becomes a paradox: these benefits
    can only happen after implementing the solution idea. To not become a paradox,
    the proof needs to be done by forecasting. Bachanek et al. [160] forecast the
    implementation of smart lighting to see the benefits of implementing smart lighting.
    Forecasting looks at the trend of energy consumption. This trend compares countries
    that do not implement smart lighting with countries that implement smart lighting.
    Forecasting results show that energy consumption will increase exponentially without
    implementing smart lighting. On the other hand, sustainability will occur if smart
    lighting operates. Hence further proving the linkage of smart lighting with sustainability.
    3) LED Development in Color and Brightness With the presence of LED lighting,
    users can easily control the intensity and color of the lighting. While computer
    scientists solve algorithms that effectively and efficiently regulate light intensity
    and color, physicists think about low-level solutions. Recent research on smart
    lighting has begun to enter the realm of colorimetry, which is the study of human
    perception of color. Zandi et al. [161] say that it is related to the circadian
    effectiveness of smart lighting. The circadian cycle or circadian rhythm is a
    cycle of human activity within 24 hours a day. Circadian lighting is an essential
    concept in HCL. Lighting based on this circadian cycle refers to its melanopic
    value. By controlling the light spectrum at a given color, the illuminance can
    increase by otherwise increasing efficiency. It can take advantage of the non-visual
    light of the metamer spectra. Still related to the color of LED lighting, Wang
    et al. [162] expanded the tribo-induced color tuning to evoke purple and pink
    colors. A wireless-based color activation signal is the concept, and the signal
    transmits via a smartphone. The resulting prototype can work in seawater monitoring,
    wind speed monitoring, and speed monitoring between passing vehicles while proposing
    a novel Triboelectronic nanogenerator (TENG). TENG is a nanoscale electric generator
    obtained by separating one substance from another. The proposed tribo-induced
    color tuner has a color inversion plate of (Sr,Ca)AlSi N 3 :Eu phosphor, a tribo-induced
    liquid lens with chemical formula Ti O 2 , and a rotary freestanding sliding TENG.
    The proposed research can provide a self-powered wireless sensor while providing
    smart lighting with color-tuning capabilities. The white light from LEDs comes
    from the excitation of ultraviolet (UV) light or blue light on the surface of
    the phosphor in the epoxy resin. However, the weakness of phosphor is that it
    is easily messed up due to heat and can reduce the quality of LED light. Compared
    to other components in LED lamps, phosphorus has a low thermal conductivity, reducing
    the life of the LED. Lin et al. [163] proposes KNN based lead-free, transparent
    glass-ceramic to replace phosphor. The complete chemical formula of KNN is ( K
    0.5 N a 0.5 Nb O 3 ) . Lead-free ceramic has good thermal stability and high efficiency
    against heat conduction, so it is a good proposal to replace phosphor. 4) VLC
    and Smart Lighting Convergence LED technology expands the boundaries of smart
    lighting because it has dimming and color-changing capabilities. Because of the
    flexibility of LED lighting, dimming can occur in the order of microseconds. With
    this speed coupled with the speed of light propagation, LEDs can become a wireless
    communication technology. The technology is called VLC or light fidelity (Li-Fi).
    The proposal of Katz et al. [164] is to bring convergence between smart lighting
    and VLC. The similarities between smart lighting and VLC are dimming and color
    control. The difference is the order of time. Because smart lighting is for human
    convenience, the control of dimming is above the order of seconds or hours, where
    humans can detect the change. While VLC is communication between lights, communication
    can be faster. Control for both systems can occur at the same time. Then convergence
    occurs. In addition, it can include human-light interaction (HLI), which is a
    light version of human-computer interaction (HCI), or visual communication, the
    communication between humans and lights, for example, in the form of visual signals.
    Humans can still catch the signal if it occurs in the order between VLC communication
    speed and smart lighting communication speed. Light has a higher frequency than
    radio. So that if used for communication, light has a bandwidth greater than radio
    bandwidth. Therefore VLC is used as a 5G communication technology where the bitrate
    can reach the order of gigabits per second (Gbit/s). In addition, light has other
    advantages over radio, namely being free of radiation and free of electromagnetic
    interference. Hu et al. [165] uses 443-nm GaN-based superluminescent diode (SLD),
    discrete-multiple-tone (DMT) modulation, and 256-QAM technology and gets speeds
    of up to 3.8 Gbit/s. These results make VLC technology more effective for smart
    lighting. The survey paper of Mir et al. [166] presents some exciting challenges
    about VLC related to smart lighting. The first challenge was the idea of a self-contained
    power supply called simultaneous information and power transfer (SLIPT). The wired
    power supply is impractical, while the battery power supply requires replacements
    and adds to the hazardous waste. SLIPT can send information as well as energy
    harvesting as the needed energy. In addition, deployment becomes more concise
    and more accessible. However, this is related to the next challenge, namely the
    need for high power for the receiver so that the received data does not become
    noisy. Another option is to lose the noise while keeping the receiver low in energy.
    The last challenge is how to obtain directionality if one wants to apply VLC and
    smart lighting for indoor positioning systems. Lastly is how to remove the field
    of view (FOV) problem in VLC. With LED as the technology base, smart lighting
    and VLC are usable together. There are several places where smart lighting would
    be difficult to implement using radio-based Wi-Fi, including gas stations, hospitals,
    and ships. So VLC is the proper substitute in smart lighting systems for these
    locations. It would be even better if VLC’s capabilities were further enhanced.
    Ali et al. [167] offers the concept of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) in VLC.
    MIMO is a technology for radio technology such as Wi-Fi, WiMAX, and LTE. Its application
    is in the physical layer by increasing the number of receiving and sending antennas.
    In addition to increasing speed, MIMO can also expand the range and provide redundancy
    in delivery to make communication more secure. 5) Commercialization and Economic
    Aspects Smart lighting as a technology is still in the proof of concept stage.
    Zissis et al. [168] puts out a hype cycle like Gartner. VLC, smart lighting, and
    HCL are still in the technology trigger stage in this hype cycle. IoT and connected
    light are at the peak of inflated expectations. No technology related to smart
    lighting is in the trough of disillusionment. OLED is on the slope of enlightenment.
    Technologies already on a plateau of productivity are LED technology, sensor technology,
    and ICT technology. Smart lighting and other fields that are still in trigger
    technology will experience various problems and obstacles in terms of commercialization
    to reach a plateau in productivity. As already explained, smart lighting is in
    the early stage or the technology trigger stage in the hype cycle. Several sub-fields
    of smart lighting have developed at different times in this phase, as explained
    in the research of Sun [169]. From 1993 to 2005, research still focused on comparing
    natural light and artificial light. Research in the years 2005 to 2011 discussed
    the quality of artificial light. The discussion from 2009 to 2014 is on how to
    optimize brightness. From 2012 to 2014, the correlated color temperature (CCT)
    value became an important value in smart lighting, while the discussion was on
    optimizing the CCT value. In 2016, the issue was the application of a context-based
    lighting system. Various demands are directed to smart lighting to show the technology’s
    worthiness to be diffused in society and become a prospective and successful business.
    Baharudin et al. [170] conducted a review showing several comparisons between
    smart lighting and the existing building management system (BMS). Smart lighting
    shows some disadvantages but also some advantages compared to BMS. The benefits
    of existing BMS are low cost, while smart lighting has a high price. In addition,
    because the BMS does not connect to the Internet, it is more secure against cyber
    attacks. However, in other aspects, smart lighting is superior to BMS. Its advantages
    include low energy consumption, automatic operation, easy monitoring, and error
    detection without human intervention. The prospect of the smart lighting business
    in attracting corporates needs demonstration with an objective and short return
    on investment (ROI). Shankar et al. [171] explains the economic analysis in more
    detail by comparing the cost of smart lighting plus photovoltaic (PV), aka solar
    panels, with conventional electricity from the grid. Initially, smart lighting
    + PV will be more expensive than the grid because of the investment spent on smart
    lighting, PV, and products installation. Nevertheless, gradually, the cost of
    smart lighting + PV will decrease. The results are from PV having a surplus of
    electricity to cover the expenses incurred to pay for the grid. At some point,
    there is no electricity expenditure at all, which is called zero net energy. On
    the other hand, the initial cost of the grid is low because there is no investment.
    However, grid costs will constantly increase due to routine electricity expenditures.
    At some point, the initial lower cost of the grid will outweigh the smart lighting
    + PV. That point will occur within five years. Further on, smart lighting + PV
    produces 47.89 GWh in 25 years and reduces greenhouse gas by 46941 Kg from the
    environment. In research commercialization, technology acceptance is a crucial
    element to research. Kim et al. [172] analyzed the technology adaptation of the
    elderly to smart lighting. This research aims to understand the lighting conditions
    needed by the elderly and environmental issues related to lighting faced by the
    elderly. The survey conducts on 57 respondents who are members of a nursing home
    with an average age of 83.74 years with an average mobility awareness and good
    health. The results show that, on average, they think that lighting lacks areas
    for activities such as reading, writing, watching TV, and other hobbies. The cause
    conveyed was the wrong lamp placement and poor lamp control ability. The survey
    results concluded that the technology needed for respondents was smart lighting,
    smart curtain, and activity recognition. SECTION IV. Machine Learning in Smart
    Lighting This Section answers the second research question of the paper survey,
    which explores smart lighting papers that apply one or more machine learning methods
    in solving smart lighting problems. The discussion revolves around what methods
    are involved, how machine learning categorizes these methods, and how each method
    can help smart lighting. Zantalis et al. [173] said that the more IoT devices
    installed, the more data related to sensors emerge. With more and more data, many
    applications have sprung up to draw correlations between data and make decisions.
    This case led to the emergence of AI and machine learning in smart lighting. There
    are many methods in machine learning, each with a different purpose, and the results
    of the survey paper show that there have been many studies on smart lighting that
    apply various machine learning methods. A. Machine Learning Methods Figure 6 shows
    the smart lighting research taxonomy concerning the machine learning method used.
    Implementable strategies are the second leaf from the tip. There are four main
    machine learning types: classical learning, reinforcement learning, ensemble learning,
    and deep learning. Deep learning is a subset method of machine learning where
    a model already includes feature extraction and selection [174]. Deep learning’s
    ability to perform its feature extraction and selection is called feature learning
    [175]. The sub-categories of deep learning include deep neural network (DNN),
    convolutional neural network (CNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN). One of
    the RNN methods is long short-term memory (LSTM). Classical learning is all methods
    outside the deep learning subset, which it divides into two large families: supervised
    learning and unsupervised learning. The supervised learning method divides into
    classification and regression, where classification methods include Nave Bayes,
    support vector machine (SVM), KNN, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree. Then
    regression methods include linear regression, support vector regression (SVR),
    and ANN regression. Unsupervised learning is used, among others, for clustering
    and dimension reduction. The clustering methods include k-means and DBSCAN. FIGURE
    6. A mind map that explains the categories of each machine learning method and
    reference papers related to each machine learning method. Show All In comparison,
    dimension reduction methods include principal component analysis (PCA). Reinforcement
    learning methods include Q-learning, deep Q-learning network (DQN), genetic algorithm
    (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Ensemble learning can be divided
    into bootstrap aggregating (bagging) and boosting. Bagging methods include random
    forest, while boosting methods include adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) and XGBoost.
    1) Supervised Learning Sepponen et al. [176] explain that supervised learning
    is a learning model where the expected output of each input has a term. The termed
    result is usually called a label or class. The class can be categorical or numerical,
    furtherly dividing the supervised method into classification and regression methods
    [177]. In supervised learning, the classification method is a method of categorizing
    a data set into several classes. Examples of classification methods in supervised
    learning are ANN classification [29], decision tree, SVM, KNN, naïve Bayes, and
    logistic regression. ANN emulates the structural, biological, and functional features
    of a biological neural network (BNN) [178]. ANN consists of various neurons that
    optimally connect the inputs and outputs in a dataset by several calculations.
    Each neuron node has an input and output process. The input and output processes
    act upon the following formula An ANN model containing a series of artificial
    neurons results from a training process. ANN training regulates the weight of
    each neuron in the ANN model iteratively until the model becomes optimum. The
    following is the Weight formula in each training iteration W ji (n+1)= W ji (n)+δ
    W ji (n) (1) View Source where W is the weight, i is the source neuron index,
    j is the destination neuron index, and n is the iteration number. The way to measure
    the optimum level of an ANN model is to calculate the error. The error is the
    difference between the predicted and actual values. The formula for calculating
    the error in each iteration n is as follows E(n)= 1 2 ∑ j=1 M e j (n ) 2 (2) View
    Source where E(n) is the error in n iteration, M is the number of output neurons,
    and e j (n) is the difference between the output and actual values. In the training
    process, several metrics need to be considered, namely epoch, learning rate, and
    momentum [179]. In addition, the number of neurons in the input layer, the number
    of hidden layers, and the number of neurons in each hidden layer can also vary
    to obtain the optimum model [180]. Regarding the application of ANN in smart lighting,
    Mohandas et al. [181] uses the ANN method with fuzzy logic for decision-making
    in smart lighting control. This study collected data through light, motion, and
    PIR sensors. By applying ANN as decision-making, unwanted lighting can reduce
    by 34% and the savings obtained are 13.5%. Decision Tree is a decision-making
    model that resembles a tree, where the tree is formed from the result of training
    [182]. Several methods are available to construct a decision tree, including iterative
    dichotomiser 3 (ID3) and classification and regression tree (CART) [183]. ID3
    can only be used for classification, while CART can also be used for regression
    [184]. In ID3, tree formation goes through several stages, some of which calculate
    entropy and the information gain. The formula to obtain the entropy, E(S) , is
    as follows E(S)= ∑ j=1 k − p j lo g 2 p j (3) View Source where S is the dataset,
    k is the number of classes, and p j is the probability of occurrence of class
    j . Then the gain formula is as follows Gain(A)=E(S)− ∑ i=1 k | S i | |S| ×E(
    S i ) (4) View Source where A is the class, k is the number of categories in the
    class, and S i is the occurrence probability of category i in the class. SVM is
    a margin-based classification method [185]. The classification method is to train
    a hyperplane that can separate data. In making the hyperplane, several available
    kernels include radial basis function (RBF), polynomial, sigmoid, and linear [186].
    In a kernel polynomial of degree- d , the formula is as follows K(x, x i )=( x
    i x+1 ) d (5) View Source where x and x i are vectors in the input space. Then
    the classification function, f(x) , is by the following formula f(x)= ∑ i=0 n
    a i y i K(x, x i )+b (6) View Source where a i is the value of the Lagrange multiplier,
    y i is the y value of x i , and b is the intercept. KNN is an algorithm that performs
    classification by looking at the similarity of the data, for example, with Euclidean
    distance [187]. The similarity of the data in question calculates the distance
    from a data to other datasets in the database. The following formula calculates
    the distance Distance(x,y)= ∑ k=1 n ( x k − y k ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − √ (7)
    View Source where x is the classified data, y is the training data, and n is the
    number of dimensions or features. Naïve Bayes is a classification based on the
    Bayes theorem. It is a theorem that looks at a new event’s hypothesis probability
    [188]. It is efficient because it takes the assumption that attributes are independent
    [189]. The naive Bayes classification formula is as follows P(c|x)= P(x|c)P(c)
    p(x) (8) View Source where x is the data with an unknown class, c is the hypothetical
    data of a particular class, and P(c|x) is the posterior probability c based on
    x [190]. Research on SVM and naïve Bayes are present in smart lighting. Xu et
    al. [191] used and compared SVM and naïve Bayes to classify street light conditions
    using the light sensor on a smartphone. Three different light attributes were
    present in the study, where from each attribute, its mean and standard deviation
    emerge from extraction. In addition to the methods already mentioned, logistic
    regression is also a method available for classification. Logistic regression
    is a type of regression method, but it is handy to analyze the binary or categorical
    relationship between several factors that influence each other [192]. Regression
    is a method in machine learning that is applicable to predict a continuous relationship
    of the dependent variable to the independent target variable [193]. Among the
    existing regression analysis methods, the simplest and most commonly used way
    is linear regression [194]. The formula for linear regression is as follows Y=
    β 0 = β 1 = β 0 + β 1 X i (∑y)(∑ x 2 )−(∑x)(∑xy) n(∑ x 2 )−(∑ x 2 ) n(∑xy)−(∑x)(∑y)
    n(∑ x 2 )−(∑ x 2 ) (9) (10) (11) View Source where Y is the dependent value, X
    i is the independent value, β 0 is the intercept, β 1 is the slope, i is the member
    of the independent variable, and n is the size of the dataset [195]. Modifications
    of the classification methods are also applicable for regression. Instead of using
    voting to choose the suitable class, KNN regression uses local average [196] calculations.
    Then the name of the regression method of SVM is SVR. ANN regression is like ANN
    classification, but instead of categorical, the output is numeric dependent [197].
    Regression is present in recent research on smart lighting. Vikash et al. [198]
    compares KNN regression, SVR, and linear regression to predict the set point of
    smart lighting control. Boter-Valencia et al. [199] uses ANN regression to replace
    the role of spectral power distribution (SPD) to measure light quality at a low
    price. Beccali et al. [200] uses ANN Regression to map the luminaries measured
    on the sensor, i.e., on the ceiling, against the luminaries on the workbench.
    2) Unsupervised Learning The main difference between unsupervised learning and
    its counterpart is that it does not require any predefined labels in the training
    [201]. With these differences, the task of unsupervised learning diverges from
    classification and regression. Because it does not make predictions on labels
    or outputs, unsupervised learning is more directed to find patterns between the
    training data [202]. Hence, unsupervised learning tasks include clustering and
    dimensionality reduction. Clustering is finding natural grouping in a data set
    [203]. Clustering can also be called automatic classification, wherein in the
    classical classification, a label must be present if, in clustering, the label
    can be created by itself [204]. K-means and DBSCAN are two examples of clustering
    methods. K-means is a distance-based clustering technique [205]. The purpose of
    using distance for clustering is to reduce data variance. Before the clustering
    process begins, the value of K or the number of clusters must be determined first.
    Then the centroids are randomly assigned according to the value of K. The next
    process is to calculate the distance of another point to each centroid point using
    equation (7). Clustering will gather the points to the nearest centroid. The process
    is repeated continuously with the new centroid obtained by calculating the mean
    of each cluster. The repetition will stop after convergence occurs. That is, there
    is no change in the mean. The whole process repeats with the initiation of a new
    centroid. Then each process is compared. The selected process is the process with
    the smallest amount of variance. Here is the formula to find the variance of a
    process Variance= 1 m k ∑ i=1 m k || x i − μ k | | 2 (12) View Source where k
    is the cluster index, m k is the number of data in cluster k , x i is the i th
    data in the cluster, μ k is the average of k clusters [206]. Like k-means, DBSCAN
    is also a distance-based clustering method. The difference is that the weakness
    of k-means is that it is susceptible to noise in the data, while DBSCAN has a
    way to detect noise [207]. DBSCAN is present in recent smart lighting research.
    Ravi et al. [208] uses DBSCAN to cluster the pixel values of a camera to get the
    lux value of each cluster. The curse of dimensionality is a problem where a dataset
    has too many features. In other words, it has high dimensionality. Such datasets
    can experience various issues, as they cannot be reasoned and analyzed by humans
    who are used to dealing with 3-dimensional space [209]. Dimension reduction is
    a method to reduce the number of dimensions or the number of data features with
    high dimensionality while maintaining the valuable properties of the original
    data [210]. One of the dimension reduction methods is principal component analysis
    (PCA). Suppose there is a data table with size nxp , where n is the number of
    rows, while p is the number of columns, then PCA considers it as matrix X [211].
    Next, PCA creates a new feature with notation t by multiplying the line x (i)
    of X by weight w and size l , where l is a smaller number than p [212]. The PCA
    formula is as follows t k(i) = x i ⋅ w k (13) View Source where i=1,…,n , and
    k=1,…,l . The value of w is set so that the PCA results have a variance not distant
    from the X matrix. 3) Reinforcement Learning If supervised learning and unsupervised
    learning are analogous to “learning by reading,” then reinforcement learning is
    equivalent to “learning by doing” [213]. The five main reinforcement learning
    components are agent, environment, action, reward, and state, where an agent interacts
    with the environment by performing actions. The action will change the state of
    the environment. A reward measures the quality of the state change. The reward
    will determine the following action of the agent [214]. One implementation of
    reinforcement learning is Q-learning. Q-learning takes action based on a policy
    that utilizes the Markov Decision Process (MDP) [215]. MDP is an extension of
    the Markov chain, where the difference is that in MDP, there are actions, and
    their state changes by a policy function that determines which action will be
    chosen by a state in the transition to the next state [216]. While the policy
    function will change based on the reward of the state transition. The optimal
    policy function is as follows π ∗ (a|s)={ 1, 0, ifa=argma x a∈A q ∗ (s,a), otherwise,
    (14) View Source where π ∗ (a|s) is the optimal policy function, a is the action,
    A is the action set, s is the state, and q ∗ (s,a) is called the optimal action-value
    function. The formula for the optimal action-value function is as follows q ∗
    (s,a)= q π (s,a)= ma x π q π (s,a) R s a + ∑ s ′ ∈S P a s s ′ ∑ a∈A π( a ′ | s
    ′ ) q π ( s ′ , a ′ ) (15) (16) View Source where q π (s,a) is the action-value
    function, R s a is the reward on state s and action a , s ′ is the next state
    P a s s ′ is the state transition probability matrix, and a ′ is the next action.
    There have been studies using reinforcement learning in smart lighting. Yu et
    al. [217] uses a reinforcement learning method called deep deterministic policy
    gradient (DDPG) to find the optimum decision based on several parameters that
    have uncertainty. DDPG is a method that combines operation over continuous action
    space from the deterministic policy gradient (DPG) method with experience replay
    and slow learning target network from the deep Q-network method (DQN). 4) Ensemble
    Learning Ensemble learning combines several machine learning methods into one,
    where usually, the performance results will be better than any of its ensemble
    members used alone. This method is considered a state-of-the-art method in the
    field of machine learning [218]. However, the drawback of ensemble learning is
    that by combining several methods, the algorithm will be more complex and become
    more computationally heavy [219]. The two main sub-categories in ensemble learning
    are bagging and boosting. Bagging stands for bootstrap aggregating, which is the
    two main stages of bagging itself. An example of a method that uses bagging is
    random forest [220]. Bootstrap is a method of replicating multiple datasets from
    the main dataset using a sampling method [221]. Furthermore, the method creates
    a weak classification method for each dataset. A process similar to voting for
    the final classification runs on several weak models. Namely, the aggregating
    method [222]. Random forest is an ensemble learning method that utilizes many
    weak decision trees with the bagging method. The random forest can solve the decision
    tree problem, namely overfitting. Overfitting usually occurs if the resulting
    tree has a too large depth, traditionally characterized by a significant variance.
    In a random forest, by maintaining a small depth but increasing the number of
    trees, the random forest can reduce the variance while maintaining the bias [223].
    The random forest method is present in recent smart lighting research. Zekic-Susac
    et al. [224] implements a random forest on the smart lighting system using big
    data from the system. Data from the big data system that becomes features for
    the classification process are geospatial attributes, construction attributes,
    heating attributes, temperature attributes, and occupational attributes. The predicted
    output is energy consumption. If bagging can reduce variance, then boosting is
    an ensemble learning that can reduce bias [225]. While bagging is parallel because
    it creates many classifiers at the same time, boosting is serial because every
    weak classifier will be affected by the previous weak classifier [226]. The way
    boosting works is by increasing the weight of the miss-classified data in the
    previous classifier to the next classifier and then reclassifying the data [227].
    The final classifier is a linear combination of the previous classifiers [228].
    One of the boosting methods is AdaBoost. AdaBoost is also an ensemble learning
    method that can be applied to the decision tree and is used to overcome the class
    imbalance in the decision tree with the concept of boosting [229]. The AdaBoost
    formula is as follows F T (x)= ∑ t=1 T f t (x) (17) View Source where x is the
    input data, F T (x) is the final classifier, T is the number of estimators or
    the number of weak classifiers, and f t (x) is the tth decision tree. 5) Deep
    Learning In classical learning, to perform classification, datasets usually experience
    dimensionality problems and must go through the feature extraction and feature
    selection stages first [230]. The difference with deep learning is that it already
    conducts these stages in its model. The stage is called feature learning, or representation
    learning [231]. Sub-categories of deep learning that exist in recent smart lighting
    research are deep neural network (DNN), CNN, and recurrent neural network (RNN).
    DNN is an ANN that has more than one hidden layer [232]. DNN can be used to predict
    complex non-linear functions better than traditional methods and techniques [233].
    When compared to ANN, the more data there is, the better the performance of DNN,
    while ANN will reach saturation point faster with less data [234]. CNN is a deep
    learning method that is often used for object detection in computer vision [235].
    In training a CNN model for an image, gradient descent is applicable to find the
    local minimum of the loss function [236]. The convolution and spooling functions
    in CNN are what make CNN superior in image processing because it pays attention
    to the locality of reference problems that other neural network methods do not
    do [237]. Thus causing other neural network methods to experience the curse of
    dimensionality problem [238]. RNN is deep learning that can deal with temporal
    sequences because RNN has an internal state (memory) that can store information
    from the current input to deal with future inputs recursively [239]. Due to the
    temporal nature of the sequence, RNN is suitable for handwriting recognition or
    speech recognition. [240]. Two examples of RNN methods are long short-term memory
    (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRU). What makes LSTM distinctive from other
    RNN methods is that this method has special units. The special units are cell,
    input gate, output gate, and forget gate [241]. The three gates can control the
    cell’s contents to forget which information, add new information, and output what
    information. Thus, the LSTM does not just use memory to remember the previous
    state like a standard RNN. B. Machine Learning Applications in Smart Lighting
    After discussing the categories and machine learning methods present in recent
    smart lighting research, the following subsection discusses applications of machine
    learning methods in smart lighting. Some machine learning applications in smart
    lighting are more common than others. They are discussed individually in this
    section. Because this paper directs the discussion on smart lighting that can
    increase user comfort, we also carry out a critical review on which application
    is suitable for increasing user comfort. Table 6 shows the extraction results
    of machine learning application topics in smart lighting. TABLE 6 Machine Learning
    Applications in Recent Smart Lighting Research 1) Predictive Control Predictive
    control is one of the control methods applied in industrial engineering [270].
    Predictive control or model predictive control (MPC) is a sophisticated control
    that can predict the performance of a process based on the future horizon [271].
    The prediction horizon is the extent to which a model can predict the future [272].
    The model is used to predict the future based on training data and then take control
    to deal with predicted future events [273]. The autoregressive integrated moving
    average (ARIMA) and LSTM are methods that are applicable in predictive control
    [274]. Predictive control is one of the machine learning applications present
    in recent smart lighting research. Yang et al. [275] utilizes predictive control
    in controlling smart lighting, air conditioning, ventilation, and shading in an
    integrated manner. Two test areas were ready to test the system, one where the
    proposed method was present and one room with the old system. Two metrics predicted
    in this system are visual comfort and lighting power. Predictive control can also
    predict maintenance time for street lighting, as done by Gălăţanu et al. [276].
    2) Intelligent Control Intelligent control is the use of AI techniques or machine
    learning in traditional control systems to deal with more complex problems [277].
    For example, a control system has inputs such as temperature, humidity, light
    level, and carbon dioxide level sensors. Then they combine with outputs of fans,
    coolers, heaters, and lights. Methods such as ANN can be applied to predict the
    proper control for each actuator based on various values of input sensors [278].
    Intelligent control is one of the machine learning applications present in recent
    smart lighting research. Intelligent control in the research of Shnayder et al.
    [279] uses lighting sensors, motion sensors, and traffic intensity sensors to
    control street lighting. Chew et al. [280] defines the target of smart lighting
    control, namely brightness, gain, hysteresis, timeout, and sampling period—the
    output control results from the combination of the user presence and brightness
    targets. As for Sakaci et al. [281], the intelligent control of the proposed smart
    lighting uses fuzzy logic. 3) Gesture Recognition for Control Gesture recognition
    is a computer science technique to detect human gestures with mathematical algorithms
    [282]. Gesture recognition usually includes emotion recognition involving face
    and hand gesture recognition [283]. Hand gesture recognition usually involves
    a wearable type sensor. An inertia measurement unit (IMU) sensor is applicable
    because it has the function of an accelerometer and a gyroscope [284]. Hand gesture
    recognition is usable as an advanced control in a non-haptic human-machine interface
    (HMI) where users no longer need to use switches or conventional remote controls
    [285]. Hand gesture recognition is one of the machine learning applications applied
    to smart lighting. Park et al. [286] said that hand gesture recognition is vital
    in smart lighting to get the full functionality of the proposed system. Mohammed
    et al. [287] utilizes smart clothing, namely wearable sensors attached to clothes,
    as a medium for executing gesture recognition. Pham et al. [288] also propose
    hand gesture detection, but it depends on cameras, not wearable sensors. Chen
    et al. [289] also use a camera to detect hand gestures. In addition, this study
    utilizes the SVM classification on the history of gradient (HOG) features to determine
    the type of gesture to form a figure of eight or show five fingers. 4) Clustering
    Clustering is an unsupervised learning method to form classes based on adjacent
    data. Clustering is a machine learning application present in recent smart lighting
    research. Hoque et al. [290] uses K-Means clustering to classify the characteristics
    of energy consumption by smart lighting users. The results show two main clusters
    in energy consumers by optimizing the number of clusters. Three main features
    separate the two clusters, namely total energy, energy in the ironing room, and
    energy in outdoor lighting. Borile et al. [291] uses clustering to reduce the
    number of datasets. The problem is in the proposed method, namely regression with
    weighted least squares. Each processing of new data requires the formation of
    a new matrix, where the complexity and computational time will increase with the
    presence of a new matrix. So the k-means++ method is used to reduce the number
    of datasets. This method can reduce the risk of overfitting. 5) Activity Recognition
    The primary process of activity recognition is to detect high-level user activity
    from raw sensors [292]. The implementation of activity recognition is diverse,
    including in the fields of smart home, sports, billing automation, elderly monitoring,
    security, and gaming [293]. For example, in the healthcare sector, activity recognition
    is used for the care of the elderly or the maintenance of physically impaired
    patients [294]. In the field of security, activity recognition is applicable to
    determine the desired level of home security [295]. Activity recognition is one
    of the machine learning applications present in recent smart lighting research.
    Kookmin et al. [296] implements smart lighting that performs control based on
    the user’s location in a room. The implementation of a location-aware lighting
    system is to increase user satisfaction. Juntunen et al. [297] issues lighting
    controls based on the movement of people in the room captured from Kinect. The
    system built can control the intensity of light and the type of color based on
    user preferences. 6) Anomaly Detection Anomaly detection is the detection of rare
    data whose presence raises suspicion because the data is very different from the
    usual data [298]. Anomaly detection is implementable in intrusion detection systems
    (IDS), fraud detection, medical anomaly detection, industrial anomaly detection,
    or time-series anomaly data [299]. Some types of machine learning are usable in
    anomaly detection. Unsupervised learning is used by clustering all normal data
    into one cluster. Data that are not inside the cluster are labeled as an anomaly
    [300]. Anomaly detection with supervised learning treats anomaly problems like
    binary classification, where the first class is normal data, and the second class
    is anomaly data [301]. Anomaly detection is one of the machine learning applications
    employed in smart lighting. Gao et al. [302] uses anomaly detection to detect
    suspicious movements captured in surveillance cameras. This research adopts AdaBoost
    to classify anomalous actions and non-anomaly actions. The camera is pointed at
    the stairs to monitor going up and down activities at the stairs. In the future,
    lighting will be implementable in the system for mitigation. 7) Optimization When
    dealing with non-linear objective functions, advanced methods need to be applied.
    Optimization is a method of finding the best results based on an objective function
    and several restrictions to get valid results [303]. Optimization applications
    include smart grids, logistics, and WSN. Several machine learning methods that
    are usable as optimization methods are Bayesian network, reinforcement learning,
    and Q-learning [304]. Optimization is one of the machine learning applications
    implemented in machine learning. Ndzana et al. [305] uses GA to optimize between
    getting the maximum light intensity with primary colors and getting the maximum
    savings. The result is that the intensity complies with standards, while the most
    significant savings come from red’s primary color. Ngo et al. [306] compares GA
    with an exhaustive search in finding the most optimal lighting in a room. The
    result is that with the same level of savings, GA can find optimal lighting faster
    than an exhaustive search. 8) Computer Vision Computer vision is a technique for
    obtaining a high-level understanding of the [307] image or video. The advantage
    of using computer vision in smart lighting is that advanced control of smart lighting
    can take advantage of CCTV cameras which are usually already installed in an area
    [308]. The stages in computer vision can include object acquisition, feature extraction,
    classification and analysis, and disseminating results [309]. Several methods
    in feature extraction that are applicable include Gaussian filter and RGB color
    extraction [310]. Computer vision is one of the machine learning applications
    in smart lighting implemented. Cho et al. [311] uses deep learning utilizing services
    from IBM Watson to understand what kind of food an occupant is eating in a smart
    lighting system. The camera used is a Raspberry Pi camera placed above the dining
    area. The lighting will adjust to the type of food the occupant is eating. Mortadha
    et al. [312] controls the lights based on face detection implemented on the camera.
    Maciel et al. [313] implements PCA in Eigenface face recognition as authentication
    in smart lighting. The concept of “space of face” and PCA are usable in Eigenface
    face recognition. 9) Elderly Management With the increasing number of older adults
    in the world, more technology is needed for elderly care [314]. Some of the applications
    of these technologies are fall detection, localization, and health status monitoring.
    The role of smart lighting is to make life easier for the elderly whose movement
    is increasingly limited [315]. Several environmental sensors play a role in this
    aspect, including magnetic switches, PIR sensors, and floor sensors [316]. Davis
    et al. [317] implements SVM-HMM to adjust the color and intensity of the lights
    based on the detected elderly activity. The length of the elderly activity influences
    the lamp’s intensity, and the type of activity affects the lamp’s color. There
    are six activities detected, namely walk, up, down, sit, stand, and lay [318].
    The accuracy result of the proposed system is 99.7%. SECTION V. Topics in Increasing
    User Comfort This section answers the third research question of the paper survey,
    which selects and explores machine learning implementations that are promising
    in achieving user comfort. The discussion includes examining activity recognition
    as an encouraging method in increasing user comfort and delving into user comfort
    parameters from related papers. A. Implementation of Activity Recognition Adnan
    et al. [319] say that insufficient lighting can interfere with health, and lighting
    must be adjusted based on activity. Kookmin et al. [296] state that there are
    two reasons for smart lighting, energy efficiency and comfortable lighting. For
    the second reason, lighting awareness of activities becomes a requirement. In
    the activity recognition method, machine learning plays a role in extracting activities
    from raw data obtained from [320] sensors. Several processes must run to transform
    raw data into activity types, namely feature extraction and classification. The
    activities types can be categorized based on their complexity levels. The whole
    activity recognition process, starting from sensing to activity classification,
    can be seen in Fig. 7. The following is a complete explanation of the activity
    recognition stages. FIGURE 7. The integration of a smart lighting system and machine
    learning-based activity recognition that promotes intelligent user behavior control
    while potentially increasing user comfort. Show All Within the sensor types used
    to collect sensor data, there is a taxonomy [321]. Firstly, sensing is divided
    by video-based or sensor-based technology [322]. Kushwaha et al. [323] combines
    discrete wavelet transform (DWT), local binary pattern (LBP), and histogram of
    gradients (HOG) in video-based activity recognition. The video dataset comes from
    five different sources: Weizmann, IXMAS, UT Interaction, HMDB51, and UCF101. Besides
    being implemented on publicly available datasets, the methods also run on real-time
    datasets. The real-time dataset originates from a Bollywood movie. Sensor-based
    types split up into environment-based, wearable-based, and smartphone-based. Environment-based
    activity recognition uses ambient sensors placed in the room, as is done by Guan
    et al. [324] which uses a PIR sensor. PIR sensors can only detect motion with
    the concept of infrared radiation changes (IRC). However, activity patterns show
    by changing the feature-specific sensitivity. Feature-specific sensitivity can
    increase by changing the visibility modulation on the geometric sensing layer.
    There are two types of mounting used during deployment: a ceiling mount and a
    tripod mount. In the simulation, one ceiling mount locates in the middle of the
    room, with three tripod mounts on the sides of the room. Wearable-based activity
    recognition is a method in which the sensor used comes from a device attached
    to the user’s body, for example, a smartwatch that takes data from the wrist,
    as done by Mekruksavanich et al. [325]. The smartwatch used is an Android smartwatch
    with LG G Watch and Android Wear 1.5 operating system. Embedded in the smartwatch
    are accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. The smartwatch dataset comes from the
    public benchmark, namely WISDM, obtained from the UCI Repository. The dataset
    contains tri-axial accelerometer data and tri-axial gyroscope data with a sampling
    rate of 20 Hz. The data subjects were 51 people with an age range of 18 to 25
    years and 18 types of activities that have been pre-labeled. Smartphone-based
    activity recognition is on sensors provided in smartphones. Voicu et al. [326]
    researched activity recognition utilizing existing sensors on smartphones such
    as accelerometer, gyroscope, and gravity sensor. Two datasets in use were: the
    internal dataset and the external dataset. The internal dataset came from a self-made
    application designed for the research, and the external dataset came from a dataset
    from another research. The user first selects the activities before the data recording
    in the self-made application. The choice is between walking, running, sitting,
    standing, and going upstairs or downstairs. In addition, the measurement interval
    and sampling rate are also adjustable. Users can choose which sensors to activate
    for measurement as an additional option. A complete taxonomy of sensor types in
    activity recognition shows in Figure 8. FIGURE 8. Activity recognition taxonomy
    based on sensors. Show All Information about human activities is usually hidden
    in sensor data, so a feature extraction [327] process is required. Lupion et al.
    [328] developed environmental sensors-based activity recognition and implemented
    a sliding window to combine multiple sensor sources at once. Of the values in
    each window, the extracted features are the minimum, maximum, and average values.
    Ferrari et al. [329] first performs a peak centered segment of the time-series
    data from the accelerometer sensor and then performs a feature extraction. Eighteen
    features were extracted, including minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard
    deviation. The 18 features reduce into two features with PCA. After performing
    feature extraction, these features go through a training process to form an activity
    prediction model. Jung and Chi [330] uses the ANN model to predict activity based
    on sound sensor data. Dewi and Chen [331] compares random forest, SVM, KNN, and
    linear discriminant analysis (LDA) methods for the activity classification. The
    results of this study indicate that random forest is superior to other methods.
    In addition to applying a combination of feature extraction and classification,
    deep learning methods can be used and already cover both steps. Xia et al. [332]
    compares three deep learning methods, namely LSTM, CNN, and a combination of LSTM
    and CNN. Predictions run on three different datasets with six movement classes.
    The results showed that the combined LSTM-CNN was better than the other two methods.
    In a survey paper on activity recognition, Demrozi et al. [333] revealed that
    there is a taxonomy related to detectable activities. Detectable activities consist
    of simple and complex activities. Simple activities such as walking, running,
    sitting, and getting up, as in the research of Zheng et al. [334]. Complex activities
    are washing dishes, watching TV, eating, and cooking, as classified by [335].
    Table 7 compares the latest research related to activity recognition in the field
    of smart lighting. The similarity of each study is that they have applied activity
    recognition to smart lighting, whether using video-based, environment-based, or
    wearable-based sensors. However, each research show contradiction in the performance
    and accuracy. Some research shows high performance in predicting activity recognition.
    However, require high-cost devices for recognition. On the other hand, other research
    that uses low-cost tools can provide only sub-optimal results. TABLE 7 Comparison
    of Activity Recognition in Recent Smart Lighting Research The research of Dai
    et al. [338] proposes a video-based activity recognition for smart lighting that
    has a high level of accuracy. Nevertheless, on the other hand, in terms of hardware,
    the use of the camera is very extensive. Five cameras from different angles are
    needed to get such accuracy. On the other hand, Ramadhan et al. [337] also has
    an accuracy above 90% but not as good as Dai et al. However, the solution is not
    extensive and uses a WSN where each node uses a low price PIR sensor. Zhao et
    al. [344] proposes wearable-based smart lighting that uses Google Glasses for
    sensing. The research is not feasible from the solution considering the price
    of google glass and the inefficient implementation. However, camera-based and
    environment-based smart lighting are possible methods for smart lighting. One
    of the classification methods in activity recognition for smart lighting is the
    hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM) method proposed by Ramadhan et al. [337].
    HHMM is an extension of the hidden Markov model (HMM). Figure 9 shows an example
    of an HHMM model that can run on a smart lighting system. A conventional HMM model
    consists of 3 layers, where the first layer is the initial state. The initial
    state gives the initial probability for each hidden layer. The second layer is
    the hidden state, which are states that are not observable. It is necessary to
    go through the observable states to discover the present hidden state. State transitions
    between hidden states show the probability of state changes from one period to
    another. In HHMM, there can be more than one hidden state. The higher hidden layer
    needs to be observable to discover deeper hidden layers. In the implementation
    of smart lighting, the observable state is the sensor value, hidden state 2 is
    the activity, and hidden state 1 is the lamp status. FIGURE 9. An example of a
    HHMM model in activity recognition for smart lighting. Show All Furthermore, the
    Viterbi algorithm determines the hidden state from the observable state. Viterbi
    algorithm formula for the first prediction and the following predictions are different.
    The formula that describes Viterbi’s algorithm for the first prediction is as
    follows V 1,k =P( y 1 |k)⋅ π k (18) View Source where k is the number of hidden
    states, π k is the value for the initial state transition probability to hidden
    state k , P( y 1 |k) represents the probability from hidden state k to the first
    observable state, and V 1,k represents the Viterbi value for k . The formula that
    describes Viterbi’s algorithm for subsequent predictions is as follows V t,k =
    max x∈S P( y t |k)⋅ a (x,k) ⋅ v t−1,x (19) View Source where V t,k represents
    the tth Viterbi value for k hidden states, v t−1,x represents the highest previous
    Viterbi value, max x∈S P( y t |k) describes the highest transition value from
    hidden state which is the previous highest Viterbi value to hidden state k , a
    x,k is the value from hidden state k to observable state t . B. User Comfort Metrics
    Table 8 shows the latest research on smart lighting that discusses user comfort.
    The similarity of each study is that they pay attention to at least one aspect
    of user comfort in using smart lighting. However, each research is contradictory
    in how to measure user comfort. Because user comfort is related to humans, some
    measurements are subjective. That is, they are calculated based on user opinions.
    In addition, other metrics are objective measurements that focus on technical
    aspects of smart lighting comfort. TABLE 8 User Comfort Test Parameters in Recent
    Smart Lighting Research Plorer et al. [356] say that control strategies in smart
    lighting usually focus on user comfort or energy efficiency. So there are two
    parameters in implementing smart lighting: energy efficiency and user comfort.
    Measuring energy efficiency can be done by calculating the energy consumption
    of a smart lighting system. The equation is as follows Energy(Wh)=Power(W)×Time(h)
    (20) View Source So that the greater the power of the electrical equipment used
    and the longer the electrical equipment is in use, the greater the energy spent.
    In calculating user comfort, Light Utilization Ratio (LUR), Unmet Comfort Ratio
    (UNC), and Light to Comfort Ratio (LCR) are applicable. The LUR formula is as
    follows LUR= TimeWithLightsOn OccupiedTime (21) View Source From the formula above,
    the optimal LUR value is 1. If it is more than 1, it concludes that the lights
    are on longer than they should be. Meanwhile, if the value is between 0 and 1,
    it can be supposed that the lights are on less than they should. While the UNC
    formula is as follows UNC= TimeinUncomfortableCondition OccupiedTime (22) View
    Source The range of UNC value is 0 to 1. The closer to 0, the better the smart
    lighting performance. Then the LCR formula is as follows LCR= 1 n ∑ t=1 n Score(t)
    (23) View Source where n is the number of tests and Score(t) is obtained from
    the definitions as follows Score(t)= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ 0, 0.5, 1, ifuserisuncomfortable, ifuserisunsure,
    ifuseriscomfortable. (24) View Source The LCR value is the sum of each person’s
    Score(t) results, then averaged by the total amount of tests. Each person can
    give response multiple times. The range of Score(t) values is 0 to 1. The closer
    to 1, the better the smart lighting performance. From existing research, user
    comfort can be grouped based on the measurement object and its measurement type.
    The user comfort parameter can be divided based on control and lighting quality
    based on the measurement object. Measurements based on control quality observe
    whether the control decisions in determining the on/off state of smart lighting
    interfere with user comfort. Measurements based on lighting quality see whether
    the brightness or the color of the light interferes with user comfort or not.
    LUR is an example of user comfort measurement based on control quality because
    the measure refers to the ratio of the time the lights are on with the time the
    lights are used [347]. Flickering perception is an example of user comfort, which
    is calculated based on the lighting quality [351]. User comfort parameters divide
    into objective and subjective parameters based on the measurement type. LUR, Power
    reduction ratio (PRR), and CCT are three objective parameters because they result
    from measurements. PRR is calculated based on the value of the power to be reduced
    [350]. CCT is a measurement of the color temperature of a light [353]. CCT correlates
    with the subjective value of user comfort, which is mapped based on a Gaussian
    function. It makes CCT a good objective measurement method to predict user comfort
    based on lighting quality. LCR is an example of a subjective parameter because
    it comes from a questionnaire. SECTION VI. Open Issues and Future Work This Section
    contains a critical review of discussed papers in answering the three research
    questions of the survey paper. The result is the discovery of research gaps for
    opportunities in future works. Based on the reviewed studies, smart lighting started
    in 1993, starting from lighting combined with a microcontroller to applying machine
    learning in smart lighting. Several survey papers have discussed smart lighting,
    but none have comprehensively addressed the application of machine learning to
    smart lighting. Based on the survey, several studies have implemented machine
    learning in smart lighting, including the topic of intelligent control, gesture
    recognition for lighting control, and clustering for optimizing sensor placement
    in WSN smart lighting. Activity recognition is a suitable method to increase user
    comfort because it pays attention to user activities in light control. Discussions
    about research gaps are possible in the state-of-the-art (SOTA) papers studied.
    A. Cost and Effectiveness Activity recognition is a suitable method to increase
    user comfort because it pays attention to user activities in light control. Several
    studies regarding activity recognition in smart lighting are present. Among the
    existing studies, several solutions provide high activity prediction accuracy
    but, on the contrary, have extensive and expensive hardware specifications. On
    the other hand, researchers that provide a low price solution report limited movement
    prediction accuracy. The key to a successful IoT project is the initial cost and
    scalability [357]. An affordable price is essential to widely spread an IoT solution
    in the market. Several studies have proven that combining a low-price device with
    a good performance algorithm can optimize the solution. Abate et al. [358] uses
    a cheap current sensor, namely a shunt resistor, combined with the Goertzel algorithm,
    which has good accuracy on smart grids. Nawandar and Satpute [359] use soil moisture,
    temperature, and humidity sensors and a controller with a total cost of US $ 13
    combined with the ANN method for a smart irrigation solution. Sunny et al. [360]
    said that solutions in nuclear waste monitoring are usually expensive, then offer
    a cheap solution using gas sensors and AI for decision making and has good performance.
    The research gap is how to produce an activity recognition solution for smart
    lighting that is not extensive and low in price but has high activity prediction
    accuracy by utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. B. Optimizing
    the Machine Learning Method In choosing the machine learning method with the best
    performance, comparisons are considerable. Each machine learning method has its
    advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, each technique has a different implementation
    area. A comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of machine learning methods
    shows in Table 9. TABLE 9 Comparison of Machine Learning Techniques in Smart Lighting
    Machine learning methods have advantages and disadvantages and can excel in different
    studies. Naïve Bayes can excel if used in the field of sentiment analysis or web
    crawling [412], [413]. Meanwhile, if used for classification based on sensor values,
    SVM and decision trees can be superior to naïve Bayes. Dimension reduction methods
    such as PCA can improve classification performance by enhancing features. Omuya
    et al. [414] prove that by comparing four different scenarios, data that has gone
    through the PCA process has the best performance. Apart from improving performance,
    PCA can also shorten training time and reduce memory usage. Research from Ma and
    Yuan [415] shows that with PCA, training time can reduce from 1300 s to 100 s,
    and memory usage can decrease from 6133 MB to 1000 MB. The use of ensemble learning
    can also solve various problems in machine learning. Random forests can improve
    classification performance while reducing overfitting problems. The research of
    Dogru and Subasi [416] shows that the performance of random forest classification
    is better than SVM and ANN. The use of AdaBoost can overcome the problem of data
    imbalance. Taherkhani et al. [417] prove that the performance of the AdaBoost-CNN
    classification model on the imbalance dataset is better than using ResTNet. Several
    advantages of deep learning are useful in activity recognition for smart lighting.
    Complex human activities have a hierarchical structure that can take advantage
    of the multiple layers in deep learning. Chen et al. [418] reveals that deep models
    can learn descriptive features from complex sensor data. In addition, automatic
    feature extraction in deep learning has a better performance than manual feature
    extraction. Shaheen et al. [419] have specifically tested the comparison of automatic
    feature extraction and manual feature extraction, and the results show that classification
    with automatic feature extraction leads to better performance. By applying and
    comparing various classification methods, combining several methods with ensemble
    methods, or using unsupervised learning methods for pre-processing, novel activity
    recognition methods with significantly higher performance in smart lighting applications
    can emerge. C. Time Constraint and Delay Measurements Because the smart lighting
    system is a real-time system, there is a time constraint in its implementation
    [420]. The application of machine learning can improve system performance in predicting
    efficiency and user comfort. However, the delay caused by the algorithm’s complexity
    must still be suitable. Jobanputra et al. [421], in research on activity recognition,
    said that generally, simple algorithms have a short runtime but poor performance.
    In contrast, complex algorithms have a long runtime but better performance. The
    random forest can improve accuracy, but the algorithm’s complexity also increases
    because it uses many classifiers. Tests conducted by Garcia and Korhonen [422]
    prove that as the number of estimators in the random forest model increases, the
    runtime also increases exponentially. AdaBoost has even a higher complexity than
    random forest. Toghani and Allen [423] shows that the AdaBoost runtime is more
    elevated than random forest in all 13 datasets used for testing. The number of
    estimators must be optimum, i.e., where the performance increases but with a minimum
    number of estimators. Deep learning methods such as CNN can make it easier to
    improve feature performance through the initial layers but, on the other hand,
    increase complexity with heavy algorithms. Arif et al. [424] prove that with a
    similar performance in computer vision, CNN has a higher time delay compared to
    simple methods such as Haar-Cascade. Reinforcement learning methods may be engaging
    because they are adaptive and can find the optimum solution or achieve convergence.
    However, the weakness of reinforcement learning is that it is challenging to earn
    optimal rewards when the rewards are sparse. There can be a long lag before the
    user gets the optimum reward if applied in smart lighting. Research conducted
    by Zhong et al. [425] shows that deep learning can reach convergence in 30 episodes
    while reinforcement learning reaches convergence in more than 150 episodes. Each
    real-time system has a different time constraint. Suppose an effective but complex
    method has a higher runtime than other methods. The method is still acceptable
    if it falls within the time constraint, especially if the comparison method has
    unacceptable performance. D. Sensor Selection and Coordination If activity recognition
    with one type of sensor may experience performance limitations, an option to consider
    is to use multiple sensors at once. Considering the cost, this is still feasible
    by combining several inexpensive sensors at once. Combining several sensors simultaneously
    to get better detection results is known as sensor fusion. Aguileta et al. [426]
    through the survey paper on sensor fusion, revealed that combining several different
    sensors has better performance than combining several of the same sensors. Environment-based
    sensor fusion has never been applied to smart lighting and could become a research
    opportunity. In environment-based recognition, achieving activity measurements
    from one sensor to one user with good performance are already challenging, all
    the more if the implementation is in one room with several sensors and several
    users. Li et al. [427] divides activity recognition into single-user activity
    recognition (SAR) and multi-user activity recognition (MAR). SAR has made some
    advancements in its research. However, research in MAR is still at a very young
    age. MAR with environment-based sensors is challenging because the detected activities
    are very complex. In a multi-sensor environment, activity detection becomes challenging
    because the user’s movement from one sensor range to another can be difficult
    to detect. E. Anomaly Detection on Faulty Sensors and Rams Analysis If implemented
    on a large scale, wherein one large room can be installed with up to 80 smart
    lighting devices, and each tool performs sensing, it is likely that some tools
    have poor performance due to faulty sensors. Detection of poor tooling must occur
    at the manufacturing stage to prevent user complaints during installation. Faulty
    sensor detection is a current research trend in the IoT field. Van et al. [428]
    uses anomaly detection to find faulty sensors in connected and automated vehicles
    (CAVs) in the build phase. Anomaly detection on the faulty sensor can also occur
    during installation, namely after manufacturing goods. Zhang and Li [429] applies
    anomaly detection to faulty sensors in urban sensing at the installation stage
    with the assumption that damage can occur due to external factors from the environment.
    Keipour et al. [430] detects measurement errors on the automated aerial vehicle
    (AAV) during air travel, assuming the aircraft can be landed in an emergency when
    there is early detection in the air. Ellefsen et al. [431] detects anomalies in
    an autonomous ferry machine prognostic and health management (PHM), which detects
    odd occurrences to the ship’s engine. Salem et al. [432] detects an anomaly in
    the health monitoring wireless body sensor network (WBSN) by measuring the RMSE
    between the measured sensor value and the forecasted sensor value. Despite anomaly
    detection in faulty sensors in various IoT fields, we have not found any research
    implementation on smart lighting. It can become a research opportunity for future
    work. Petrioli et al. [433] implemented reliability, availability, maintainability,
    and safety (RAMS) analysis in reducing the possibility of excessive spare parts
    procurement for up-scaling a smart street lighting system. The study exercises
    two methods: reliability analysis and failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis
    (FMECA). Our exhaustive study of machine learning techniques can lead to a more
    efficient solution for RAMS analysis. Brandl et al. [434] provide an example use
    of embedding sensitivity analysis into avionic virtual sensors with the use of
    neural networks. However, a machine learning solution for similar cases on smart
    lighting is still a research gap. F. Objective and Subjective Measures in User
    Comfort There is room for expansion of user comfort measurement parameters in
    smart lighting. The most significant characteristic of smart lighting compared
    to artificial lighting, in general, is carrying out controls that automatically
    turn on and off lights. Where user comfort in artificial lighting generally only
    detects the quality of light, both in intensity and color. Park et al. [347] admits
    that the comfort measurement in their research is limited to illuminance and should
    expand towards glare, color rendering index, light color, and flicker. Nagy et
    al. [349] say that the limitations of the test sample can reduce the quality of
    the conclusions drawn from user comfort. User comfort testing should also be carried
    out within a year because different seasons will provide other lighting qualities.
    According to Wang et al. [353], Kruitoff’s Curve is only a quantitative assessment
    of user comfort and is not accurate. Some of Kruitoff’s Curve’s review of illuminance
    does not match the applied retest. Illuminance has a low multiple analysis of
    variance (MANOVA) value on user comfort, so it is not usable as a performance
    measure. Although there is a strong correlation between CCT and user comfort,
    it turns out that user comfort in several countries is different and needs further
    evaluation. In addition, user comfort based on other locations, for example, at
    home, office, and factory, needs to be studied further. An objective measurement
    with a high correlation to its subjective measurement counterpart can result in
    an effective tool for predicting user comfort. The research of Park et al. [347]
    has used both objective and subjective parameters for user comfort measurement
    based on lighting control in their research. However, it did not map the correlation
    between the two. In addition, Wang et al. [353] concluded that CCT is a good tool
    to predict user comfort but only in the field of lighting quality. There is still
    a gap to find objective measurements for predicting user comfort based on lighting
    controls. There is no existing research on activity recognition smart lighting
    that measures user comfort. They can become a research gap for further research.
    Using user comfort measurement, the significance of implementing activity recognition
    in smart lighting compared to legacy methods can become visible. Research on smart
    lighting that measures user comfort has also left a research gap for future works.
    SECTION VII. Conclusion This study provides a comprehensive survey on smart lighting
    and proposes SLR to discuss the application of machine learning in smart lighting
    to increase user comfort. Machine learning as part of artificial intelligence
    provides key solutions in overcoming complex problems in smart lighting. These
    include predictive control, intelligent control, hand-gesture recognition for
    lighting control, clustering, anomaly detection, calibration, optimization, computer
    vision, and activity recognition. An exhaustive review of improving user comfort
    covers discussions, such as the methodology and taxonomy of activity recognition
    as a promising solution and user comfort metrics, including light utilization
    ratio, unmet comfort ratio, light to comfort ratio, power reduction rate, flickering
    perception, Kruithof ’s comfort curve, correlated color temperature, and relative
    mean square error. Finally, we discuss open issues and future challenges in increasing
    user comfort in smart lighting using activity recognition. We have discussed the
    challenges in increasing user comfort with smart lighting with activity recognition
    where low-price and extensive solutions differ significantly in prediction performance.
    An affordable price is essential to widely spread an IoT solution in the market.
    The optimum solution can combine a low-price device with a good performance algorithm.
    The optimum machine learning algorithm can be achievable by comparing various
    classification methods, combining several methods with ensemble methods, or applying
    unsupervised learning methods for pre-processing. Another challenge discussed
    in this paper is the concern of time constraints in a real-time system, where
    effective but complex methods have higher runtime than simple methods with several
    limitations. In addition, existing user comfort metrics applied to smart lighting
    research can be used in the novel activity recognition method to prove the significance
    of contribution. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank their colleagues,

    20, 7163. Copy Abstract Research has shown the multitude of applications that
    IoT, cloud computing and forecast technologies present in every sector. In agriculture,
    one application is the monitoring of factors that influence crop development to
    assist in making crop management decisions. Research on the application of such
    technologies in agriculture has been mainly conducted at small experimental sites
    or under controlled conditions. This research has provided relevant insights and
    guidelines for the use of different types of sensors, application of a multitude
    of algorithms to forecast relevant parameters as well as architectural approaches
    of IoT platforms. However, research on the implementation of IoT platforms at
    the commercial scale is needed to identify platform requirements to properly function
    under such conditions. This article evaluates an IoT platform (IRRISENS) based
    on fully replicable microservices used to sense soil, crop and atmosphere parameters,
    interact with third party cloud services, planning and scheduling irrigation as
    well as control of irrigation water control devices. The proposed IoT platform
    was evaluated during one growing season at four commercial scale farms on two
    different broadacre irrigated crops with very different water management requirements
    (rice and cotton). Five main requirements for IoT platforms to be used in agriculture
    at commercial scale were identified from implementing IRRISENS in rice and cotton
    production: scalability, flexibility, heterogeneity, robustness to failure and
    security. The platform addressed all these requirements. The results showed that
    the microservice approach followed in the platform is robust against both intermittent
    and critical failures in the field that could occur in any of the monitored sites.
    Further, processing or storage overload caused for any reason at one farm did
    not affect the performance of the platform regarding the other monitored farms.
    This paper also discusses how the microservice approach can address the data heterogeneity
    issue when crops with different management requirements are monitored. Since there
    are no shared microservices among farms, the IoT platform proposed here also provides
    data isolation maintaining data confidentiality for each user, which is relevant
    in a commercial farm scenario. Keywords IoT platform; microservice; smart agriculture;

    Communications and Sensing for 6G and Beyond: A Comprehensive Review Wei Jiang
    and 14 more April 04, 2024 Next-generation cellular technologies, commonly referred
    to as the sixth generation (6G), are envisioned to support a higher system capacity,
    better performance, and network sensing capabilities. The terahertz (THz) band
    is one potential enabler to this end due to the large unused frequency bands and
    the high spatial resolution enabled by the short signal wavelength and large bandwidth.
    Different from earlier surveys, this paper presents a comprehensive treatment
    and technology survey on THz communications and sensing in terms of advantages,
    Rapid Feasibility Assessment of Energy Unit Integration in Distribution Networks
    Sicheng Gong and 2 more April 03, 2024 In contemporary heavy-load distribution
    networks, preceding feasibility assessment is imperative before incorporating
    additional energy units. However, the feasibility examination for massive combined
    operational scenarios of relevant units is computationally intensive with repetitive
    power flow calculations. To this end, this paper proposes a rapid assessment framework,
    the kernel of which is to learn from formerly examined scenarios, thus forming
    expansive feasible/infeasible regions to geometrically rule in/out subsequent
    scenarios. Without running the power flow computation in most scenarios, we accelerate
    the assessment process. Moreover, enlightened by heuristic hypersurface search,
    such prechecking efficiency can be further boosted. In a risk-averse manner, this
    framework can be conceptualized using the exact grid model. Especially, evidenced
    by testing on a 10.5kV distribution grid, the framework shows a significant assessment
    efficiency improvement and strict accuracy guarantee, where we observe at least
    76.13% assessment time reduction and zero accuracy loss in all testing cases.
    We anticipate this work to be a starting point for more sophisticated geometry-accelerating
    feasibility assessment methods. Improving Molecular De Novo Drug Design with Transformers
    Dhaval Soni and 7 more April 03, 2024 Drug design is undergoing a transformation
    as we challenge conventional methods by integrating state-of-the-art artificial
    intelligence with the intricate domain of molecular biology. At the heart of our
    endeavor lies a significant challenge: the scarcity of datasets containing active
    compounds for emerging target proteins. To confront this obstacle, we''re pioneering
    an innovative approach. We''re merging the advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer
    (GPT) architecture with the nuanced capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    networks, with the aim of generating Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System
    (SMILES) strings to unveil novel therapeutic pathways. Additionally, we''re employing
    a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pretraining strategy
    to enrich our model with comprehensive molecular data, including amino acid sequences
    and molecular SMILES datasets. Through meticulous fine-tuning on a meticulously
    curated protein-ligand complex dataset, we''re achieving precise conditional generation
    via autoregressive supervised learning. Our research introduces a groundbreaking
    method to assess molecular affinity, validated against established proteins, showcasing
    superior binding affinities compared to certain FDA-approved drugs in docking
    experiments. By pushing the boundaries of generative algorithms and establishing
    a robust framework for evaluating molecular affinity, we''re driving forward the
    field of de novo drug design, offering promising therapeutic avenues and enabling
    deeper exploration of the chemical landscape. Formalising a Gateway-based Blockchain

    A document by Guzman Llambias . Click on the document to view its contents. Magnetic
    Behavior of NO Fe-Si Sheets under Tensile and Compressive Stress Carlo Appino
    and 6 more April 03, 2024 The stress dependence of the magnetic properties of
    non-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets has been investigated by measurement and analysis
    of hysteresis loop, magnetization curve, and energy losses taken at different
    peak polarization values Jp (0.5 T – 1.5 T) between DC and f = 400 Hz. The salient
    feature of the material response to the stress lies in the monotonic deterioration
    of the soft magnetic properties, across the whole (Jp - f) domain, on passing
    from the maximum tensile stress (σ = +30 MPa) to the maximum compression (σ =
    -30 MPa). This is understood in terms of stress-induced redistribution of the
    domains between easy axes, making magnetic hardening by compression directly related
    to unfavorably directed domains and 90° domain-wallmediated magnetization transitions.
    The loss decomposition is carried out across the whole investigated frequency
    range, taking into account the skin effect at the highest frequencies. Quasi-static
    and dynamic losses follow a same trend with σ, both monotonically increasing on
    passing from the tensile to the compressive stress limits, according to the theoretically
    expected relationship existing between the hysteresis and the excess loss components.
    The latter is shown to identify the correlation regions where the magnetization
    is reversed of size comparable with the average grain size and loosely following
    the dependence of the loss figure on the applied stress. A bio-inspired hardware
    implementation of an analog spike-based hippocampus memory mo... Daniel Casanueva-Morato
    and 4 more April 03, 2024 The need for processing at the edge the increasing amount
    of data that is being produced by multitudes of sensors has led to the demand
    for mode power efficient computational systems, by exploring alternative computing
    paradigms and technologies. Neuromorphic engineering is a promising approach that
    can address this need by developing electronic systems that faithfully emulate
    the computational properties of animal brains. In particular, the hippocampus
    stands out as one of the most relevant brain region for implementing auto associative
    memories capable of learning large amounts of information quickly and recalling
    it efficiently. In this work, we present a computational spike-based memory model
    inspired by the hippocampus that takes advantage of the features of analog electronic
    circuits: energy efficiency, compactness, and real-time operation. This model
    can learn memories, recall them from a partial fragment and forget. It has been
    implemented as a Spiking Neural Networks directly on a mixed-signal neuromorphic
    chip. We describe the details of the hardware implementation and demonstrate its
    operation via a series of benchmark experiments, showing how this research prototype
    paves the way for the development of future robust and low-power mixed-signal
    neuromorphic processing systems. Exploratory Study of oneM2M-based Interoperability
    Architectures for IoT: A Smart Cit... VJS Pranavasri and 6 more April 03, 2024
    The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in transformative possibilities
    for smart cities, with the potential to revolutionize urban living through enhanced
    connectivity and data-driven decision-making. However, the effective realization
    of IoT in smart cities hinges upon the seamless interoperability of diverse devices
    and systems. To address this critical need, the oneM2M standards initiative has
    emerged as a foundational framework for IoT interoperability. In this research
    paper, we perform an exploratory analysis of three prominent open-source oneM2M
    based interoperability systems-Mobius, OM2M, and ACME. We leverage an existing
    large-scale system provided by our Smart City Living Lab deployed at IIIT Hyderabad,
    sprawling a 66-acre campus featuring over 370 nodes across eight verticals. We
    investigate the architectural characteristics of each solution, considering their
    strengths and limitations in facilitating IoT interoperability. Through this analysis,
    our paper aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to implement
    IoT interoperability solutions in the context of smart cities. By evaluating the
    strengths and limitations of Mobius, OM2M, and ACME, we seek to offer guidance
    for selecting the most suitable solution. Our analysis reveals that the optimal
    framework choice depends on specific quality constraints: Mobius excels in performance,
    while ACME offers advantages in ease of setup for smaller-scale implementations.
    Comparing Concepts of Service Blocking Queues in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems
    Tobias Konheiser and 3 more April 03, 2024 ZF is developing an autonomous driving
    system, which requires extensive testing of the developed devices and software
    on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems. Therefore, a robust and high-performing
    HIL system is essential. The purpose of a HIL system is to replay recorded data
    to the device-undertest. Recordings are loaded, processed and streamed to the
    deviceunder-test with real-time requirements. This streaming chain includes processing
    nodes and queues. This requires careful management of queue configurations. An
    overflow in the queue will result in packet loss, while an underflow may violate
    the real-time constraint. This study aims to develop and evaluate concepts for
    service blocking queues. These concepts block or pause the incoming service to
    a queue when necessary to avoid queue overflows and associated data loss. However,
    an out-of-the-box solution is not available and different approaches affect the
    behaviour and performance of the system. Therefore, the developed concepts are
    evaluated against each other and against the existing system based on selected
    performance parameters in specific scenarios. The scenarios cover a wide range
    of situations, reflecting standard input data with varying numbers of parallel
    streams and bottleneck scenarios forcing queue overflows or blockages. The developed
    service blocking queue concepts eliminate data loss in all scenarios, but introduce
    overhead, resulting in reduced system performance. However, the service blocking
    queue concept using a modified token-bucket approach proved to be the best solution,
    as the elimination of data loss justifies the additional overhead. This concept
    is proposed for implementation and deployment on the HIL system. Generative AI-Based
    Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and 7 more
    April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that uses neural
    networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually relevant
    text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The models are
    trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and learn complex
    concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases, and styles. FlowDep
    - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle detection for aut...
    Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection is crucial for the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles such as palm-sized drones,
    it is a challenge to implement traditional methods like Lidar due to high costs
    and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning approaches, while accurate,
    are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles. To address this issue, we introduce
    Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm inspired by the low-resolution but
    efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects. Flowdep combines optic flow
    and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the depth of every image pixel.
    We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial neural network (Flowdep-ANN).
    Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are 5.8 to 114.7 times faster than
    the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN on a small
    autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing platform, and both models
    successfully performed real-time object detection. The present work demonstrates
    the potential of using optical flow as an efficient approach to estimate depth
    and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles. Misinformative Data
    Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April 03, 2024 Sports are
    data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics and teams leverage
    data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which is created by media
    outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating narratives about
    the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data in the sports world,
    data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape. These data visualizations,
    while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers, can be misinformative;
    media creators often have incentives to present specific narratives which don''t
    always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing misinformative data
    visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to understand the techniques
    and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations in all domains,
    not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols Drew Scott
    April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are ubiquitous
    in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual authentication
    between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level communications.
    This is because tags should not share secret information with unknown parties
    and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication protocols
    designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate for
    RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy, small
    memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and practical
    authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID systems became
    prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols. The Effect of
    Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more April
    03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,
    2024 Hodge conjecture is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory based
    on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications

    \ is detecting energy consumption anomalies\nbased on intelligent device status\
    \ data. The building field is plagued by energy consumption\nanomalies caused\
    \ by a number of factors, many of which are associated with one another in\napparent\
    \ temporal relationships. For the detection of abnormalities, most traditional\
    \ detec-\ntion methods rely solely on a single variable of energy consumption\
    \ data and its time series\nchanges. Therefore, they are unable to examine the\
    \ correlation between the multiple char-\nacteristic factors that affect energy\
    \ consumption anomalies and their relationship in time.\nThe outcomes of anomaly\
    \ detection are one-sided. To address the above problems, this\npaper proposes\
    \ an anomaly detection method based on multivariate time series. Firstly, in\n\
    order to extract the correlation between different feature variables affecting\
    \ energy con-\nsumption, this paper introduces a graph convolutional network to\
    \ build an anomaly detection\nframework. Secondly, as different feature variables\
    \ have different influences on each other,\nthe framework is enhanced by a graph\
    \ attention mechanism so that time series features\nwith higher influence on energy\
    \ consumption are given more attention weights, resulting in\nbetter anomaly detection\
    \ of building energy consumption. Finally, the effectiveness of this\npaper’s\
    \ method and existing methods for detecting energy consumption anomalies in smart\n\
    buildings are compared using standard data sets. The experimental results show\
    \ that the\nmodel has better detection accuracy.\nIntroduction\nDue to the widespread\
    \ use of intelligent devices, it is now feasible to gather a lot of information\n\
    on how well they are functioning and evaluate this information to determine whether\
    \ a build-\ning’s energy usage is abnormal. This has become a crucial part of\
    \ maintaining intelligent build-\ning control. Data might be skewed when users\
    \ fail to turn off their devices after using them or\nwhen devices malfunction\
    \ without their knowledge. The operational status of intelligent build-\ning equipment\
    \ may be accurately sensed by detecting these aberrant data, and the problem of\n\
    anomaly detection has grown in importance.\nPLOS ONE\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286770\n\

    \ methods for anomaly detection included\nthe use of histogram-based statistical\
    \ methods [1,2] and density-based statistical methods\n[3,4]. However, these traditional\
    \ methods are deficient in detecting in the case of complex data\nand high data\
    \ dimensionality [5]. An increasingly popular research subject is the issue of\n\
    energy consumption anomaly detection in the building industry. The literature\
    \ has undergone\na systematic, thorough, and technical study of techniques for\
    \ anomaly detection of energy\nusage in buildings [6]. At the same time there\
    \ are many practical applications in terms of\nenergy consumption, such as the\
    \ research work related to the estimation of charging demand\nfor electric vehicles\
    \ presented in the literature [7]. Some researchers have used artificial intelli-\n\
    gence algorithms for anomaly identification in light of the ongoing proposal of\
    \ machine learn-\ning-related algorithms. Numerous scholars have learned and mined\
    \ pertinent features and\npatterns in the temporal dimension of data using machine\
    \ learning techniques like neural net-\nworks. Pan H et al [8] proposed a deep\
    \ learning based high-dimensional energy consumption\nanomaly detection method\
    \ (HDEC-AD), which uses high-dimensional energy consumption\nrelated data to predict\
    \ customer electricity consumption in real time and perform anomaly\ndetection.\
    \ lei L et al [9] proposed a building energy consumption data dynamic anomaly\
    \ detec-\ntion algorithm (BECMP), which implements dynamic detection of point\
    \ anomalies and collec-\ntive anomalies. Shrestha R et al [10] proposed a long\
    \ short-term neural network (LSTM) based\nanomaly detection (ADLA-FED) which has\
    \ a framework for implementing auto encoder in\nsmart grid.A suitable method of\
    \ detecting building energy anomalies helps to minimize the\npower consumption\
    \ of the home while maintaining the comfort of the end user, Atalla S et al\n\
    [11] proposed a system architecture for improving energy efficiency in residential\
    \ buildings to\npromote energy reduction behavior in residential buildings.\n\
    Most of the data collected by building smart devices are based on time series\
    \ [12,13], and\ntime series anomaly detection as one of the problems aims to detect\
    \ abnormal events from the\ntime series recorded in various regions. A number\
    \ of researchers have investigated anomaly\ndetection methods based on univariate\
    \ time series; Chahla et al [14] proposed an anomaly\ndetection method based on\
    \ long short-term memory and Zhiwei Ji et al [15] proposed an\nLSTM-based anomaly\
    \ detection method (LSTMAD), both for identifying anomalous subse-\nquences from\
    \ univariate time series. Most unsupervised anomaly detection techniques such\
    \ as\nclustering, one-class classification, and dimensionality reduction, such\
    \ as single-class SVM\n(OCSVM) algorithms, can only detect one type of energy\
    \ usage anomaly, and in the smart\nbuilding domain, these univariate time-series\
    \ anomaly detection methods only analyze energy\nconsumption data without considering\
    \ other relevant factors that affect energy usage [6].\nAmong them, Copiaco A\
    \ et al [16] did the most exhaustive work by analyzing building energy\ndata for\
    \ anomaly detection. Their innovation in using energy time series images to detect\n\
    energy consumption anomalies was done by converting 1D energy time series into\
    \ 2D images,\nusing pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models as feature\
    \ extractors, and\nusing support vector machines (SVM) to accomplish anomaly classification.\
    \ The effect of\nusing the hyperparametric variation model as a feature extractor\
    \ and classifier is also investi-\ngated according to the time and resource requirements,\
    \ and high accuracy is achieved.\nHowever, a significant amount of multivariate\
    \ time series data is continuously produced by\na large number of IoT sensors\
    \ in numerous practical smart building situations [17–21]. Multi-\nvariate time\
    \ series are formed in smart building energy monitoring systems with multiple\
    \ sens-\ning measurements, such as room temperature and humidity sensors, water\
    \ detection sensors,\nflow meters, etc. As can be seen, univariate time series\
    \ anomaly detection algorithms are able\nto detect anomalies in individual metrics\
    \ but do not represent the overall state of the smart\nbuilding system well [18,22].\
    \ It can be seen that in practical application scenarios, building\nenergy consumption\
    \ anomalies are not only related to time series but also depend on the\nPLOS ONE\n\

    \ characteristic variables. In recent years, deep learning-enabled\nanomaly detection\
    \ (i.e., deep anomaly detection) has emerged as a key direction. Most deep\nlearning-based\
    \ anomaly detection methods are robust to noise, and such methods can model\n\
    complex patterns across domains by scaling to higher dimensions. However, they\
    \ do not have\nsufficient ability to dig deeper into potential correlations from\
    \ multivariate time series, which\nleads to lower detection accuracy and recall.\
    \ Many researchers have used machine learning\nmethods such as neural networks\
    \ to learn and mine relevant features and patterns in the tem-\nporal dimension\
    \ of data. Su Y et al [23] proposed OmniAnomaly, a stochastic recurrent neural\n\
    network for multivariate time series anomaly detection that works well robustly\
    \ for various\ndevices. Li D et al [24] proposed Multivariate Anomaly Detection\
    \ with GAN (MAD-GAN)\nframework considers the entire variable set concurrently\
    \ to capture the latent interactions\namongst the variables. Park D et al [25]\
    \ proposed a long short-term memory-based variational\nautoencoder (LSTM-VAE)\
    \ that fuses signals and reconstructs their expected distribution by\nintroducing\
    \ a progress-based varying prior. However, these methods do not easily detect\
    \ small\nanomalies in the data, while paying less attention to the analysis and\
    \ mining of correlations\nbetween different variable dimensions [26], do not explicitly\
    \ address the problem of capturing\nthe correlation of multivariate time series,\
    \ and there is still room for improvement in properly\nmining the relationships\
    \ between different time series.\nIn real-world application settings, energy consumption\
    \ anomalies are determined by the cor-\nrelation between numerous features and\
    \ the time series. In this scenario, just taking into account\nsingle time series\
    \ to identify anomalies across the board is biased; instead, it is best to start\
    \ by tak-\ning into account multiple time series feature correlations. In this\
    \ study, the key research question\nis how to mix time series and multivariate\
    \ characteristics in the anomaly detection problem. As a\nresult, the method for\
    \ multivariate time series anomaly identification proposed in this research\n\
    concentrates on mining the correlation between various multiple time series and\
    \ on the detection\nof anomalies in the overall state. Firstly, a graph convolutional\
    \ network is introduced to model\nthe topological relationships between feature\
    \ variables by taking multiple time series variables as\ninput and extracting\
    \ feature correlations between multiple feature variables. Secondly, a graph\n\
    attention mechanism is introduced to improve the detection framework in order\
    \ to prioritize cer-\ntain variables with considerable potential interrelationships\
    \ between time series. Anomaly detec-\ntion models are constructed by extracting\
    \ correlations between individual time series of\nmultivariate features and weighting\
    \ the sum of features with the graph attention mechanism to\nmodel complex time\
    \ series data. This method is tested with existing anomaly detection methods\n\
    using an open standard dataset, and the experimental findings demonstrate that\
    \ the model has\nsuperior detection accuracy than existing anomaly detection methods.\n\
    The contributions of our paper are summarized as follows:\n1. we propose a multivariate\
    \ time series anomaly detection method based on multivariate\ntime series, considering\
    \ multiple factors that lead to anomalies in building energy con-\nsumption. A\

    \ of\nbuilding energy consumption by calculating the attention coefficients between\
    \ different\ntime series features and assigning greater attention weights to the\
    \ time series features with\ngreater influence on energy consumption.\n3. The\

    June 8, 2023\n4 / 23\nRelated definitions\nA time series is a collection of observations\
    \ that are continuously measured over time to track\nchanges. Observations are\
    \ typically made at evenly spaced time intervals\nT ¼ ðtd\n0; td\n1; . . . . .\
    \ .td\nt Þ; d 2 Nþ; t 2 N;\nð3Þ\nwhere d indicates how dimensional the time series\
    \ is. There are two different types of time\nseries based on the characteristics\
    \ of the observations, and time series often assume that the\ntime intervals are\
    \ equal. On the one hand, a time series is a univariate time series if its observa-\n\
    tions are scalar values. On the other hand, the time series is a multivariate\
    \ time series if the\nobservations are multidimensional vectors.\nDefinition 1\
    \ Multivariate time series:\nThis paper focuses on multivariate time series where\
    \ each variable depends not only on its\npast values but also on other variables.\
    \ For example, the multivariate time series data in this\npaper is denoted as:\n\

    \ Exception:\nUsers forget to turn off their devices after use or some devices\
    \ fail without knowing it,\nwhich can lead to deviations in the data, and these\
    \ deviated data are called anomalous data.\nAnomalous data is distinctly different\
    \ from the overall distribution of data. The set of anoma-\nlous data constitutes\
    \ a very small part of the data set. The horizontal coordinate is the building\n\
    id, and the vertical coordinate is the energy consumption information for each\
    \ building id, as\nillustrated in Fig 2 anomalies. The figure shows red for aberrant\

    \ edge denotes\nthe relationship between two corresponding features. The graph\
    \ structure is shown in Fig 4.\nThis paper uses a graph convolutional network\
    \ to extract correlations between different fea-\nture variables.\nThe multivariate\
    \ time series data (data collected by sensors carrying a large amount of envi-\n\
    ronmental information) affecting the building energy consumption anomalies are\
    \ constructed\nas a graph model, and the different types of environmental information\

    \ different dimensions of data is repre-\nsented by node-to-node edges. This graph-based\
    \ approach is more suitable for using graph\nconvolutional neural networks. The\
    \ graph convolution layer aggregates neighboring nodes to\nenable the transfer\
    \ of neighborhood relationships and propagates between layers, and uses the\n\
    information of edges to aggregate node information to generate a new node representation.\n\
    GCN provides a method to model the relationship between sensors by representing\
    \ the corre-\nlation between nodes to obtain an embedded representation between\

    \ https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286770\nJune 8, 2023\n6 / 23\nBecause\
    \ of its inherent properties, it is ideal for depicting the interactions between\
    \ different\nnodes. Graph neural networks, on the other hand, require a specific\
    \ graph structure in the\ndata and are not ideal for dealing with anomaly detection\
    \ problems in time-series data.\nPrevious multivariate time series anomaly detection\
    \ tends to ignore the correlation between\nfeatures and idiosyncratic evidence,\
    \ for multivariate time series, the correlation between differ-\nent feature variables\
    \ is important. Different variables have different importance, i.e., different\n\
    weights for the points to be measured. The information in the feature dimension\
    \ is critical for\nanomaly detection, but previous models did not pay attention\
    \ to this dimension. In the process\nof applying GCN we found that there are still\
    \ shortcomings, mainly that the GCN method cap-\ntures features with fixed edge\
    \ weights when neighboring nodes are featured, i.e., the degree of\ninfluence\
    \ of different dimensions of environmental information is considered uniform.\
    \ How-\never, in practice different environmental factors have different degrees\
    \ of influence on energy\nconsumption, so the edge weights should not be fixed.\
    \ This problem needs to be taken into\naccount by introducing the graph attention\
    \ mechanism (GAT), which can highlight the contri-\nbution of different neighbor\
    \ nodes to the central node in the aggregated graph convolution\ninformation and\
    \ can assign greater attention weights to the factors with greater influence on\n\
    energy consumption, which is conducive to better anomaly detection. To make full\
    \ use of the\ninformation about the importance of each variable in the feature\
    \ dimension, we apply the\nGraph Attention Network(GAT) to the feature dimension\
    \ in this paper, which is why we\nchoose GAT.\nThe core of GAT first creates a\
    \ graph structure with multiple feature variable nodes, learns\nthe importance\
    \ of each feature element from the sequence to obtain the weight corresponding\n\
    to each feature node, and merges the elements in accordance with the importance.\
    \ The weight\nparameter is a coefficient that the graph attention mechanism assigns\
    \ to the elements. The\nGCN layer gains a hidden self-attention (self-attention)\
    \ from GAT. With the self-attention\nlayer overlaid, different nodes in the neighborhood\
    \ are given varying degrees of priority dur-\ning the convolution process while\
    \ dealing with neighborhoods of various sizes. This study\nemploys GAT to compute\
    \ the correlation between nodes in this model in order to determine\nthe potential\
    \ relationship between variables, and its structure is shown in Fig 5. The GAT\
    \ layer\nis used to calculate the correlation between nodes, and the output is\
    \ hi, i2(0, k).\nMethod design and implementation\nModel framework.\nIn the building\
    \ sector, there are frequently many sensors collecting\ndata and complicated topological\
    \ links between them. The entire system may be thought of as\na graph structure,\
    \ with each sensor acting as a particular node inside the graph.\nFig 4. Feature\

    \ in graph\nconvolution with an attention mechanism [29] and is one of the most\
    \ popular graph neural\nnetworks. The graph is represented as G = (V, E), where\
    \ V denotes the set of nodes and E is\nthe set of edges. The number of nodes is\

    \ time series data collected by different sensors in the system are interde-\n\
    pendent, where the dependencies between different sensors can be modeled as graph\
    \ struc-\ntured data.\nThe multivariate time series are viewed as a complete graph,\
    \ where each node is a specific\nfeature and each edge denotes the relationship\
    \ between two related features, in order to mine\nthe feature relationships between\
    \ the multivariate time series. GAT is used in this manner to\nsystematically\

    \ n is the total number of timestamps, k is the total number of multivariate features,\
    \ and\nm represents the number of buildings, i.e., the total number of time series\
    \ collected by each\nfeature node. Since the influence of different neighbors\
    \ on the central node is different, GAT is\nintroduced to automatically learn\
    \ this weight parameter by paying attention, thus improving\nthe characterization\
    \ ability. The input of GAT is the set of node feature vectors, denoted as:\n\

    \ data is a situation in which data are incomplete for some reason during data\
    \ collec-\ntion, transmission, and processing. The presence of missing values\
    \ can cause problems in the\nstatistics of the data, and certain data analysis\
    \ models cannot directly deal with datasets with\nmissing values [30]. If further\
    \ statistics and analysis of this data are to be performed, the first\nstep is\
    \ to deal with the missing values.\n(ii) Eliminate irrelevant features\nIt is\
    \ unknown which features are effective for a particular learning algorithm. Therefore,\n\
    the relevant features that are beneficial for the learning algorithm need to be\
    \ selected from all\nthe features. Moreover, in practical applications, the problem\
    \ of dimensional catastrophe often\narises. If only some of all the features are\
    \ selected to build the model, the running time of the\nlearning algorithm can\
    \ be greatly reduced and the interpretability of the model can be\nincreased.\n\
    (iii) Data normalization\nTo improve the robustness of the model, data normalization\
    \ and cleaning are performed\nfor each individual time series. Data normalization\
    \ is applied to both the training and test sets.\n~x ¼\nx \0 minðXtrainÞ\nmaxðXtrainÞ\

    \ minimum values of the training set,\nrespectively.\nData missing value processing,\
    \ elimination of irrelevant features, and data normalization\noperations were\
    \ performed on the dataset in turn. For the processing of data missing values,\n\

    \ is\ngenerally higher. It can be seen that these traditional methods are deficient\
    \ in detecting the\neffect in the case of complex data and high data dimensionality.\
    \ In addition, current advanced\nmethods (e.g., OmniAnomaly, MAD-GAN, LSTM-VAE,\
    \ GDN) improve F1-scores and recall\nrates over classical methods while maintaining\
    \ high accuracy, and it is clear that learning and\nmining relevant features and\
    \ patterns in the temporal dimension of the data using machine\nlearning methods\
    \ such as neural networks is beneficial for improving anomaly detection meth-\n\
    ods accuracy. Recent GDNs have achieved better performance than other baselines.\
    \ However,\nGDN is not good at obtaining temporal features from time series.\n\
    GDN is an unsupervised anomaly detection method that uses the graph attention\
    \ mecha-\nnism to learn structure in multivariate time series and explains the\
    \ detected anomalies by\nattention weights. The experimental results demonstrate\
    \ that GDN has a better advantage of\nusing the graph attention mechanism to learn\
    \ correlations between sensors, and the experi-\nmental results F1-score of 0.852\
    \ are higher than those of univariate time series-based anomaly\ndetection methods,\
    \ and for multivariate time series-based anomaly detection methods\n(OmniAnomaly,\
    \ MAD-GAN, LSTM-VAE), GDN outperformed the experimental results of\nthe above\
    \ methods, indicating that the graph attention mechanism plays an important role\
    \ in\nthe anomaly detection process. However, the method in this paper outperforms\
    \ GDN in\nF1-score and Precision, which indicates that the combined performance\
    \ of GCN and GAT is\nbetter than that of using GAT only. And the GDN method is\
    \ not good at obtaining temporal\nfeatures from time series.\nAmong them, LOF,\
    \ MCD, and CBLOF these anomaly detection methods can only identify\nenergy consumption\
    \ outliers based on the analyzed energy consumption level, but cannot\ndetect\
    \ other anomalies, which has certain limitations, so the experimental results\
    \ are not satis-\nfactory. Feature Bagging is one of the common methods used in\
    \ integration methods, where\nmultiple datasets are obtained by resampling the\
    \ features of a sample, and then a set of models\nare used to train on these datasets.\
    \ Isolation Forest is advantageous in handling large datasets\nbecause of the\
    \ time efficiency of this algorithm, but it is not applicable to ultra-high dimen-\n\
    sional data. The advantages of the KNN algorithm for detecting outliers in time-series\
    \ data are\nshort training time, no assumptions on the data, and high accuracy;\
    \ the disadvantages are high\ncomputational effort, low accuracy for rare categories,\
    \ and poor interpretability. HBOS is a\ncombination of univariate methods that\

    \ above methods do not show good\nperformance in dealing with multivariate time\

    \ model in this\npaper. Based on this, the graph attention mechanism is used to\
    \ make the model less sensitive\nto the sliding window size.\nAblation experiments\n\
    To illustrate the necessity and effectiveness of the core components, an ablation\
    \ study was con-\nducted on the dataset to verify the time dependence of GRU learning,\
    \ the dependence between\nmultivariate time series features of GCN and GAT learning,\
    \ and the role of the prediction\nmodule, which contributes to the improved results\
    \ of the proposed model. On the dataset, the\nF1-scores of the model after removing\
    \ each principal component were observed to measure its\nimpact on the model.\n\
    First, name the model without the different components as follows:\n1. w/o time:\

    \ GAT module and remove the feature dependencies.\nFig 11. F1-scores of different\

    \ Prediction: remove the prediction module and remove the prediction-based detection\n\
    method\nAs shown in Table 4, when the GRU module is removed, the F1-score is reduced\
    \ by about\n2.6%, indicating that the model in this paper works well using the\
    \ GRU module, taking into\naccount the time series correlation. In the absence\
    \ of the GAT module, the F1-score is reduced\nby 1.6% on average. This suggests\
    \ that adding the GAT module provides a correlation between\nmultiple feature\
    \ variables and that it is useful to accurately capture this correlation for better\n\
    anomaly detection. Removing the prediction-based detection method reduces the\
    \ F1-score by\nan average of 3.1%. The prediction-based model predicts the actual\
    \ value of the next time-\nstamp in a deterministic manner, which is sensitive\
    \ to capture the randomness of the time\nseries and better for anomaly detection,\
    \ thus allowing for a stable improvement in model\nperformance.\nOverhead analysis\n\
    The computational performance of the models in this paper is presented by comparing\
    \ them\nwith the classical methods OmniAnomaly and MAD-GAN baseline models. Table\
    \ 5 shows the\naverage training time in seconds for all models on the dataset.\n\
    To ensure fairness in the experimental comparisons, we set the batch size and\
    \ sequence\nlength to be the same for all models. In general, models with LSTM\
    \ or GRU require a longer\ntraining time. The MAD-GAN model uses a long-short-term\
    \ memory recurrent neural net-\nwork as the base model in the GAN framework to\
    \ capture the temporal correlation of the time\nseries distribution, resulting\
    \ in a huge time overhead. As can be seen from Table 5, the model\nin this paper\
    \ outperforms the OmniAnomaly, MAD-GAN model in terms of time overhead.\nConclusions\n\
    In this paper, the following two key contributions are made. First, a multivariate\
    \ time series\nanomaly detection method based on multivariate time series is proposed\
    \ to consider multiple\nfactors that lead to anomalies in building energy consumption.\
    \ The anomaly detection frame-\nwork is constructed using graph convolutional\
    \ networks to extract feature correlations among\nmultiple feature variables.\
    \ Second, this paper introduces a graph attention mechanism to better\nachieve\
    \ anomaly detection of building energy consumption by calculating the attention\
    \ coeffi-\ncients between different time series features and assigning greater\
    \ attention weights to time\nseries features with greater influence on energy\
    \ consumption, which achieves better\nTable 4. F1-score under the model without\

    \ \nKeywords: Internet-of-Things (IoT), machine learning, deep learning, cyber-security,\
    \ intrusion detection, malware, \nbig data \nReceived: January 27, 2023 \nThe\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) has become more popular in the last 15 years as it\
    \ has significantly \nimproved and gained control in multiple fields. We are nowadays\
    \ surrounded by billions of IoT devices \nthat directly integrate with our lives,\
    \ some of them are at the center of our homes, and others control \nsensitive\
    \ data such as military fields, healthcare, and datacenters, among others. This\
    \ popularity makes \nfactories and companies compete to produce and develop many\
    \ types of those devices without caring \nabout how secure they are. On the other\
    \ hand, IoT is considered a good insecure environment for cyber \nthefts. Machine\
    \ Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) also gained more importance in the last\
    \ 15 \nyears; they achieved success in the networking security field too. IoT\
    \ has some similar security \nrequirements such as traditional networks, but with\
    \ some differences according to its characteristics, \nsome specific security\
    \ features, and environmental limitations, some differences are made such as low\
    \ \nenergy resources, limited computational capability, and small memory. These\
    \ limitations inspire some \nresearchers to search for the perfect and lightweight\
    \ security ways which strike a balance between \nperformance and security. This\
    \ survey provides a comprehensive discussion about using machine \nlearning and\
    \ deep learning in IoT devices within the last five years. It also lists the challenges\
    \ faced by \neach model and algorithm. In addition, this survey shows some of\
    \ the current solutions and other future \ndirections and suggestions. It also\
    \ focuses on the research that took the IoT environment limitations into \nconsideration.\
    \ \n \nPovzetek: Podan je pregled uporabe strojnega in globokega učenja v IoT\
    \ napravah ter izzivov, rešitev in \nprihodnjih smeri raziskav.\n1 Introduction\
    \ \nPervasive growth and use of the Internet and mobile \napplications have expanded\
    \ cyberspace [1]. The huge \ndistribution of smart sensors and devices around\
    \ us as an \nimportant part related to our lives makes researchers \nfocus on\
    \ the security and performance of the Internet of \nThings (henceforth IoT). IoT\
    \ refers to a type of network \nthat allows any object to be connected to each\
    \ other using \ncommunication protocols [2]. The term IoT was invented \nby Kevin\
    \ Ashton in 1999 while he was developing supply \nchain optimization at Proctor\
    \ & Gamble, and according \nto a recent statistical study released in 2019, there\
    \ were a \ntotal of 22 billion IoT devices connected worldwide in \n2018. It also\
    \ projects that the number will be increased to \n38.6 billion in 2025 and 50\
    \ billion in 2030 [3]. Smart \nobjects are called ‘smart’ because these objects\
    \ are \nintelligent, and they can communicate with each other \nand with human\
    \ beings. These objects became powerful \nas they have embedded chips with small\
    \ processors,  \nequipped with power sources, sensors, and data \ntransmitters\
    \ and receivers [4].  \nThe IoT shares some security needs with traditional \n\
    networks, but also has some unique security measures  \nbased on its own characteristics\
    \ and limitations which  \n \nmake some differences between it and traditional\
    \ \nnetworks. Peoples and individuals daily store huge data \nin the cloud, which\
    \ makes it a challenge to secure this \ndata and the back-and-forth connections,\
    \ especially \nsensitive and private information. All information should \nbe\
    \ encrypted before transfers over the connections; on the \nother side, the authorized\
    \ users will have the key to \ndecrypt the data when arrived.  \nIoT technologies\
    \ have been employed broadly in many \nsectors, such as telecommunications, transportation,\
    \ \nmanufacturing, water and power management, healthcare, \neducation, finance,\
    \ government, and even entertainment \n[5]. IoT is not an innovation: it is an\
    \ evolution. IoT is the \ncombination of technologies, including sensors, advanced\
    \ \nautomation systems, networking, data collection, data \nanalysis, and small\
    \ processing devices embedded into \nobjects [4]. Most of the IoT and cyber–physical\
    \ system \n(CPS) devices are comprised of physical objects, such as \nsmart vehicles,\
    \ drones, smart appliances, and other \nmachines/machinery, which are embedded\
    \ with sensors \nfor either a single specific application or multiple \napplications\
    \ [6]. The wide variety of IoT devices comes \nwith security and privacy problems\
    \ [3]. It is not only \nprivacy as people rely more on technology for different\
    \ \nactivities such as shopping, banking, doing business, and \n2 \nInformatica\
    \ 47 (2023) 1–54 \nk. Harahsheh et al. \nonline studying. The proliferation of\
    \ IoT was expected to \nreach 29 billion connected devices by 2022, and the IoT\
    \ \nmarket size was anticipated to reach U.S. $54 billion by \n2022 [7]. We believe\
    \ those numbers increased because of \nCovid-19 where more people started using\
    \ online \nshopping and online studying more than any time before. \nSome IoT\
    \ devices are embedded in public areas and use \nshared networks, and this makes\
    \ them vulnerable and \neasy to attack. \nThe IoT facilitates integration between\
    \ the physical \nworld and computer communication networks and \napplications\
    \ (apps) such as infrastructure management \nand environmental monitoring make\
    \ privacy and security \ntechniques critical for future IoT systems [8]. The IoT\
    \ \necosystem \nis \nlikely \nto \nbe \nconfronted \nwith \nnonconventional \n\
    security \nchallenges. \nBesides, \nthe \nsecurity vulnerabilities that the IoT\
    \ faces due to the \nheterogeneity and resource limitations of the IoT devices,\
    \ \nthe interactions among the IoT, and fog and cloud layers, \nmake room for\
    \ additional vulnerabilities [9]. \nThere exist several ways IoT nodes connect\
    \ to the \nInternet, and this includes communication protocols such \nas the Transmission\
    \ Control Protocol and the Internet \nProtocol (TCP/IP) using Message Queue Telemetry\
    \ \nTransport (MQTT), Modbus TCP, Cellular, and Long-\nRange Radio Wide Area Network\
    \ (LoRaWAN), among \nothers [10]. Theft of sensitive data or network \ndisruptions,\
    \ such as Brute Force, Port Scanning, Denial \nof Service (DoS), Distributed denial\
    \ of service (DDoS), \nMan in the middle (MITM), Remote to Local (R2L), \nProbing\
    \ (Probe), User to Root (U2R) and operating \nsystem attacks are all examples\
    \ of IoT attacks [11]. \nThe volume of audit data surges rapidly when the \nnetwork\
    \ size is enlarged. This makes manual detection \ndifficult or even impossible\
    \ [5], due to the increasing \nquantities of data transmitted over the Internet\
    \ which led \nto the introduction of new networking paradigms (e.g., \nthe Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and \nfog/edge computing, and complex inference\
    \ models (e.g., \ndeep learning (DL)) [12]. The concept of machine \nlearning\
    \ emerged in the middle of the 20th century; \nnevertheless, it was not until\
    \ the 1990s that the \napplication took off [2]. \nIoT devices are generally limited\
    \ in computational \ncapability and so are often unable to incorporate or \nemploy\
    \ the various security mechanisms and protocols \nused by more powerful systems\
    \ [13]. Intrusion detection \nsystems (IDSs) first collect and process data, and\
    \ then \napply a detection mechanism to raise alarms which are \nsent to a human\
    \ network analyst for further screening \n[12]. This survey focuses on ML and\
    \ DL techniques used \nin the last five years to secure the IoT environment. It\
    \ \nalso considers the devices’ limitations and lists the most \nimportant open\
    \ challenges and future works for hundreds \nof studies that help other researchers\
    \ to improve IoT \nsecurity. \n \n1.1 \nAbout the survey goal \nA lot of previous\
    \ surveys tackled security using \nmachine learning and deep learning for regular\
    \ computers \nand servers, many of them took IoT security into count \nbecause\
    \ IoT has special characteristics that make \nsecuring it different from regular\
    \ systems. ML and DL \ntechniques have transformed security in IoT systems in\
    \ \nrecent years. Several researchers have conducted surveys \non security methods\
    \ integrating machine learning on IoT \nnetworks to give a practical guide to\
    \ existing solutions \n[2]. The aim of this survey is to list the largest possible\
    \ \nnumber of challenges faced by researchers in the field of \nsecuring IoT devices\
    \ using ML and DL. Listing the \nchallenges may help us and other researchers\
    \ to directly \nfind problems, try to solve them, and draw a roadmap for \nfuture\
    \ work. The survey also helps compare several ML \nand DL techniques and algorithms\
    \ to finally get the best \nperformance depending on its accuracy, precision,\
    \ recall, \nand other results. \nThis survey mainly covers everything related\
    \ to IoT \nsecurity using machine learning methods and takes into \naccount the\
    \ environment limitations of such devices. This \nmarks the difference between\
    \ the current survey and \nother existing survives, where we cover ML techniques\
    \ \nand IoT security, get lightweight in the count, list \nchallenges, and list\
    \ a group of the current solutions. The \nmain contributions of this work include:\
    \ \n• Comparing existing surveys and the current one as \nthis comparison provides\
    \ a detailed explanation of \nML-based security solutions for IoT environments\
    \ \nand domains. \n• Highlighting lightweight ML techniques and IOT \nenvironment\
    \ limitations which makes us stand out \nfrom other surveys. \n• Filling the gap\
    \ between IoT limitations and \ncharacteristics and the strength of DL and ML\
    \ to \ncover the security challenges caused by IoT \nlimitations. \n• Focusing\
    \ on IoT security using ML in the last five \nyears from 2018 to 2023. We chose\
    \ only the recent \nfive years because ML and IoT are changing and \ndeveloping\
    \ very quickly like other fields of \ntechnology. \n• Focusing on detection systems\
    \ such as malware \ndetection, intrusion detection, and attack detection \nbecause\
    \ IoT security has different steps and \nmethods, and we exclude prevention and\
    \ response \nsystems.   \n• Presenting an in-depth review of different research\
    \ \nchallenges related to the application of ML and DL \ntechniques in IoT that\
    \ need to be addressed [22], in \naddition to listing all future directions that\
    \ may be \npossible to solve the challenges. \nThis survey analyzed the most important\
    \ machine \nlearning techniques used in cyber security and identified \nthe growing\
    \ trend of applying these approaches to secure \nIoT environments. In this survey,\
    \ we have given a brief \ndeep overview of machine learning and deep learning\
    \ \ntechniques and how they may be used to identify and \ncategorize threats.\

    \ and the…                                                  Informatica 47 (2023)\
    \ 1–54 \n3 \ntechniques for cyber security, including intrusion \ndetection, spam\
    \ detection, and malware detection on IoT \nsystems in the last five years, our\
    \ survey provided a \ncomprehensive overview of the challenges that ML and \n\
    DL techniques used in protecting cyberspace against \nattacks \nin \nIoT \nenvironments\
    \ \nmust \novercome. \nAdditionally, it offered concise explanations of each ML\
    \ \ntechnique, frequently used security datasets, necessary \nML tools, and evaluation\
    \ metrics for model evaluation. \nThe difficulties of using AI approaches to IoT\
    \ security \nare also covered. This article presents the most recent \ncomprehensive\
    \ bibliography as well as the most recent \ndevelopments in ML and DL in IoT security.\
    \ \n \n1.2 \nPaper structure \nFigure 1 below shows the survey organization and\
    \ \nstructure. Section II discusses the related work and \nprovides a clear comparison\
    \ with existing surveys. It also \nhighlights the major differences between our\
    \ survey and \nthe other ones which tackled IoT security using ML \nsolutions.\
    \ A quick overview of cybersecurity in general \nand vulnerabilities is provided\
    \ in section III, followed by \na detailed IoT discussion from history to the\
    \ present \nfound in Section IV. Moreover, Section V discusses IoT \nsecurity\
    \ and clears the most common vulnerabilities and \nthreads in such areas. In Section\
    \ VI, the top IoT security \ndatasets are listed, focusing on the steps and pre-\n\
    processing steps used to deal with datasets. Section VII \nprovides the most work\
    \ of our survey where we deeply \ndiscuss ML, DL, and how they were used to secure\
    \ IoT \nsystems. This section also contains different comparison \ntables and\
    \ graphs with a brief description of ML \ntechniques, and how those techniques\
    \ are used to detect \ndifferent types of cyberattacks in many IoT domains. We\
    \ \nalso prepared ten tables that list and compare 152 papers \nin the same field.\
    \ Finally, all IoT security challenges \nwere listed which were found in the papers\
    \ written in the \nlast five years, in addition to some of the current \nsolutions\
    \ and future directions in Section VIII. Finally, \nSection IX draws the conclusions\
    \ from this survey. \nFigure 2 views a visual representation of the process \n\
    used to select papers for this survey. Our entire search \nwas done in IEEE Xplore\
    \ for the years 2018 to 2023. \nWhen we used the terms “machine learning” and\
    \ “cyber \nsecurity” as keywords to search for in the five years, we \nfound 1066\
    \ different papers about using machine learning \nin cybersecurity, but when we\
    \ specified our search for \nIoT systems, the number of papers reduced to 643.\
    \ In this \nsurvey, we focus on detection methods and ignore \nanything related\
    \ to prevention or response, so when we \nadded “detection” to the previous search\
    \ terms, the \nnumber of papers became 321, and after deleting any \nduplicated\
    \ ideas, we finally selected 235 papers for this \nsurvey, and they are divided\
    \ as follows:  \n- \nPrevious surveys= 22 \n- \nMalware detection= 16 \n- \nAnomaly\

    \ \n2  \nRelated work \nDifferent surveys about using ML and DL in \ncybersecurity\
    \ have been published to provide a deep \ndiscussion about using ML in cybersecurity,\
    \ especially in \nIoT environments. In this section, a summary of many \nexisting\
    \ surveys published in the last five years on IEEE \nXplore is presented. This\
    \ summary covers different ML \nand DL algorithms and techniques applied to IoT\
    \ systems \nas a security solution. The main comparison between our \nsurvey and\
    \ others is about the two ideas of this survey, \nmainly challenges, the IoT limitations,\
    \ and the solutions \nsuch as the works conducted by R. Zhao et al. [14], S. \n\
    Zaman et al. [23], and F. Hussain et al. [15]. IoT devices \nusually have different\
    \ limitations which give them special \ncharacteristics and differentiate them\
    \ from regular \ndevices. Those limitations inspire researchers to search \nmore\
    \ for lightweight method when they deal with IoT \ndevices, and some of those\
    \ limitations are low computing \ncapabilities, low power sources, limited storage,\
    \ among \nothers. Table II  \nTable 1: List of acronyms \nAcronym \nDefinition\

    \ \n5 \nrepresents the difference between the present survey and \nthe other existing\
    \ surveys from the last five years. \nMoreover, we include some useful surveys\
    \ that talk \nabout ML security solutions in general, not IoT only. K. \nShaukat\
    \ et al. [1] and other references such as [12], [18], \nand [30] provided an extensive\
    \ review of different ML \nand DL applications and systems for securing regular\
    \ \ndevices and networks.   \nThose surveys provide a comprehensive overview of\
    \ \nthe challenges that ML techniques face in protecting \ncyberspace against\
    \ attacks by presenting literature on ML \ntechniques \nfor \ncybersecurity \n\
    including \nintrusion \ndetection, spam detection, and malware detection on \n\
    computer networks and mobile networks in the last \ndecade [1]. In parallel, other\
    \ surveys provide a \ncomprehensive review of using ML methods in IoT \nsecurity\
    \ with or without taking care of environment \nlimitations. However, most existing\
    \ security solutions \ngenerate a heavy computation and communication load \n\
    for IoT devices and outdoor IoT devices such as cheap \nsensors with lightweight\
    \ security protections are usually \nmore vulnerable to attacks than computer\
    \ systems [8]. \nThis survey includes full and deep details about ML in \nIoT\
    \ security with respect to its characteristics. It also lists \nall challenges\
    \ faced by the researchers from 2018 to \n2023, in addition to all current solutions\
    \ and future \ndirections. This helps the researchers to field the best \nsolutions\
    \ for those challenges, and it draws a road map \nfor future work. Topics in F.\
    \ Hussain et al. [15] are the \nmost likely to what we cover in our survey, but\
    \ we \nenhanced our work when we covered all challenges we \nfound in the last\
    \ five years, in addition to all possible \nsolutions, where [15] covers a part\
    \ of them as shown in \nTABLE II. \nSeveral surveys covering various facets of\
    \ IoT security \nhave been released. We outline the research on IoT \nnetwork\
    \ threats, machine learning algorithms used to \ncounter them, and more specifically,\
    \ ML-based security \nsolutions in this section. Table 2 provides a summary of\
    \ \nall these surveys. K. Shaukat et al. [1] provide a \ncomprehensive overview\
    \ of the challenges that ML \ntechniques face in protecting cyberspace against\
    \ attacks \nby presenting literature on ML techniques for cyber \nsecurity including\
    \ intrusion detection, spam detection, \nand malware detection on the computer\
    \ and mobile \nnetworks in the last decade. Surveys [1] and [19] focus \nmore\
    \ on regular mobile and wireless networks and \ndevices. On the other hand, the\
    \ IoT environment is more \nchallenging to secure, but machine learning techniques,\
    \ \nespecially the lightweight ones, help more in such \nenvironmental limitations\
    \ as mentioned in surveys [5], \n[14], and the present survey. A comprehensive\
    \ overview \nof ML approaches to enable more effective and less \ndetectable attacks\
    \ is discussed in survey [2].  \nMoreover, several criteria for the role of AI\
    \ in wireless \nnetworking for CPS and IoT are discussed. For example, \nthey\
    \ are discussed briefly in the comprehensive survey \nconducted by B. Salau et\
    \ al. [6] where authors focus on \nML paradigms, such as transfer learning (TL),\
    \ distributed \nlearning, and federated learning that have evolved as \nbuilding\
    \ blocks for the utilization of large data for \nlearning, adaptation, and predictions\
    \ in CPS and IoT \nsystems that leverage wireless networking. Furthermore, \n\
    they also highlight challenges faced by current and future \nwireless networks\
    \ pertaining to CPS/IoT. \nSome open challenges and possible solutions to \nsecurity\
    \ problems in IoT environments have been \nproposed in surveys [1], [2], [14],\
    \ [15], [16], [17], [19], \n[21], [22], [23], [25], and [28]. E. Rodríguez et\
    \ al. [16] \ndiscuss the challenges of using DL methods in each \ncybersecurity\
    \ threat or attack, and for each contribution, \nwe \nreview \nthe \nimplementation\
    \ \ndetails \nand \nthe \nperformance of the solution. F. Hussain et al. [15]\
    \ discuss \nthoroughly the existing ML and DL solutions for \naddressing different\
    \ security problems in IoT networks. \nWe also discuss several future research\
    \ directions for \nML- and DL-based IoT security.  \nDue to the specific characteristics\
    \ of each layer of the \nIoT system, IoT security threats that are related to\
    \ \ninherent or newly introduced threats are presented, and \nvarious potential\
    \ IoT system attack surfaces and the \npossible threats related to each surface\
    \ were mentioned in \nsurvey \n[17]. \nSeveral \nauthors \nhave \nproposed \n\
    a \nclassification of possible anomaly attacks. These \nanomalies can be identified\
    \ using the techniques of \nanomaly detection (AD). There are many ways to detect\
    \ \nanomalies such as classification, nearest neighbor, \nclustering, statistical,\
    \ spectral, information-theoretic, and \ngraph, survey [18] provides an overview\
    \ of such different \nAnomaly Detection Techniques (ADT). \nSeveral existing surveys,\
    \ as indicated in the table \nabove, either exhibit applications in a particular\
    \ domain \nor failure to provide the fundamental knowledge that a \nnew researcher\
    \ needs to enter or comprehend. However, \nthe majority of survey articles primarily\
    \ cover specific \nnetwork dangers and assaults. As we searched on IEEE \nXplore,\
    \ we discovered that the majority of studies were \nconducted on common networks\
    \ and devices, including \nservers, laptops, and computers. These devices have\
    \ solid \ninfrastructures that provide them with the resources they \nrequire\
    \ for ML and DL processing. IoT, on the other \nhand, consists of unique devices\
    \ with numerous resource \nlimits, which present a significant security concern.\
    \ We \nhave concentrated on important aspects of IoT cyber \nsecurity, \nincluding\
    \ \nspam \nclassification, \nmalware \ndetection, \nand \nintrusion \ndetection\
    \ \non \nnetworked \ncomputers and mobile devices. We are also one of the \nfew\
    \ that discuss the use of simple ML and DL \napproaches to protect the IoT while\
    \ taking resource \nconstraints into consideration. \nThe dataset is essential\
    \ for developing and testing ML \nmodels. In Table 7, we have provided a description\
    \ of \nfrequently used security datasets. Finally, in comparison \nto other surveys\
    \ that have been published in the field, our \nsurvey is comprehensive and distinctive\
    \ in that it offers \nthe following elements: popular ML and DL tools, \nevaluation\
    \ metrics, a focus on IoT security, a list of \nrecent datasets used in IoT security,\
    \ and current \nchallenges and recent solutions. \n \n6 \nInformatica 47 (2023)\

    \ in our life depends on \ntechnology, such as work, online studying, online \n\
    banking, online shopping, smart homes, and smart cities. \nThese old and new technologies\
    \ help us make life easier, \nbut on the other hand, it surrounds us with millions\
    \ of \nthreats and vulnerabilities which present a real danger \nand raise cybercrimes.\
    \ A cyberattack is a planned attack \nbetween \ncomputers \nthat \ninterrupts,\
    \ \nincapacitates, \ndestroys, or seizes control of a computer system, and \n\
    damages or steals the data it houses. Cyberattacks can be \ncarried out in a variety\
    \ of ways, such as by infecting \nnetworks and computers with harmful codes (such\
    \ as \nviruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other malware), \nexploiting spyware\
    \ to find security holes or steal data, or \nscrolling down the window in the\
    \ left of the MS Word \nFormatting toolbar [227]. The simple meaning of \ncybersecurity\
    \ is how to protect devices, networks, and \ndata from electronic and cyberattacks\
    \ which may be done \nby hackers, attackers, spammers, and cyber theft. A \ncybercrime\
    \ refers to all the unauthorized activities in \nsystems, devices, networks, and\
    \ data that cause harm to \nothers. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\
    \ \n(FBI), there are tens of online cybercrimes, and here are \nthe most common\
    \ five cybercrimes in the United States \n[208]: \n• \nBusiness email compromise\
    \ (BEC) scams exploit \nthe fact that so many of us rely on email to conduct \n\
    business—both personal and professional—and it is \none of the most financially\
    \ damaging online crimes. \n• \nIdentity theft happens when someone steals your\
    \ \npersonal information, e.g., your Social Security \nnumber, and uses it to\
    \ commit theft or fraud. \n• \nRansomware is a type of malicious software or \n\
    malware that prevents you from accessing your \ncomputer files, systems, or networks\
    \ and demands \nyou pay a ransom for their return. \n• \nSpoofing and phishing\
    \ are schemes aimed at \ntricking \nyou \ninto \nproviding \nthe \nsensitive \n\
    information to scammers. \n• \nOnline predators are a growing threat to young\
    \ \npeople. \n• \nAccording to the Kaspersky Lab report, cybercrime \nwill cost\
    \ the business more when it takes longer \ntime to notice; Small and Medium Business\
    \ \nSolutions SMBs estimate a cost to their business of \n$28k, rising to $105k\
    \ if undetected for more than a \nweek. For enterprises, where a detection system\
    \ is \nin place, the estimated financial damage is still \n$393k, increasing to\
    \ over $1m if it remains \nundetected for over seven days [32]. \n \nScams usually\
    \ increase during natural disasters, and \nthe Covid-19 pandemic had the same\
    \ effect. Scam emails \nwere sent to millions about government pay-outs and \n\
    relief efforts, surveys about the virus, fake donations \nwebsites, and more,\
    \ where all of them were full of \nmalicious codes and links. Hackers take the\
    \ advantage of \nhot news to make new crimes, such as the earthquakes in \nJapan\
    \ and Ecuador in 2016, bush fires in Australia in \n2020, and Michael Jackson's\
    \ tragic death in 2009. Spam \nemails claiming to know the specifics of incidents\
    \ were \ncirculated online within a mere eight hours after his \ndemise [12].\
    \ Table III below presents a summary of the \nworst cyberattacks in history that\
    \ tend to the loss of \nbillions of dollars, damages, and destruction of a huge\
    \ \nnumber of computers. These cyberattacks are not limited \nto Melissa, ILOVEYOU,\
    \ MyDoom, Zeus, Stuxnet, \nCryptoLocker, and Wannacry, but they are still counting\

    \ cyberattacks in history \n[50]. \n \nAccording to the Cisco annual report for\
    \ 2022 [34], \nsecurity ranked first in product revenue (see Table IV), \nand\
    \ the End-to-End Security product category increased \nby 9% or $317 million in\
    \ 2022, compared to 2021, and it \nalso increased by 7% or $224 million in 2021,\
    \ compared \nwith 2020. This was primarily driven by the growth in the \nZero\
    \ Trust portfolio, Network Security, Unified Threat \nManagement, and Security\
    \ Endpoint offerings. The \nCovid-19 pandemic started in 2020 when stores, \n\
    education, banking, and different areas continued their \nwork online. This brings\
    \ a huge of new cyber threats in \nvarious ways as it changed digital life and\
    \ affected both \ncompanies and individuals.  \nBack to the Cisco annual report,\
    \ the numbers show \nhow companies spends many millions in the security \nsection\
    \ in the last year. The Secure, Agile Networks \nproduct category represents Cisco’s\
    \ core networking \nofferings related to switching, enterprise routing, \nwireless,\
    \ and computing. Secure, Agile Networks \nrevenue increased by 5% or $1.1 billion,\
    \ with growth \nacross the portfolio except enterprise routing in 2022, \ncompared\
    \ with 2021.  \nTable 4: Presents product revenue by category (in \nmillions,\
    \ except percentages) (source: cisco [34]). \n \nSocial engineering (SE) is one\
    \ of the most common \nsecurity threats that emerged during Covid-19. It is the\
    \ \nact of tricking someone to gain private information, \naccess, or valuables\
    \ through human interactions without \nbreaking the law. SE did not need to have\
    \ good \nexperience in coding or technology, but it is just about \nhow to gain\
    \ others’ trust by speaking elegantly, wearing \nelegant clothes, and being confident.\
    \ According to a \nCyberEdge report, “the number of organizations hit with \n\
    at least one successful social engineering attack per year \nis around 79%.” Similarly,\
    \ 99% of cyber threats were \nobserved and executed through human interactions\
    \ and \ndone with the assistance of social engineering approach \n[6]. \nAn IoT\
    \ botnet can be utilized to launch DDoS attacks, \nsend spam, mine cryptocurrency,\
    \ and exploit other \nweakly configured devices [7]. IoT systems need to \nprotect\
    \ data privacy and address security issues such as \nspoofing attacks, intrusions,\
    \ DoS attacks, distributed DoS \n(DDoS) attacks, jamming, eavesdropping, and malware\
    \ \n[8]. Therefore, there is a pressing need to come up with \neffective intrusion\
    \ detection and prevention solutions that \nhelp protect the IoT ecosystem from\
    \ these increasing \nattacks and threats [9]. \n3.2 \nCIA \nCIA is a fundamental\
    \ security model designed to \nprotect data and develop information security.\
    \ It consists \nof three parts: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.\
    \ \nCIA combines and integrates three means for interacting \nwith data security.\
    \  \n \nFigure 4: CIA components. \nThe first one, i.e., Confidentiality, refers\
    \ to the \nauthorized persons who can access the data within the \nsystem. The\
    \ data will be private unless the person is \nauthorized to see it, and this is\
    \ important not only for \nmilitary or government sensitive data but also in every\
    \ \nother system since users’ privacy is crucial in both \nsensitive and insensitive\
    \ data. The second one, i.e., \nIntegrity, is the way to keep data clean. This\
    \ means while \nuploading, downloading, and storing data, authorized \nusers only\
    \ can modify the data. Accidentally, altered data \ncost companies too much, not\
    \ only in time and money but \nalso in lacking customers’ confidence. The last\
    \ one is \nAvailability which means that data must be available and \naccessible\
    \ whenever and wherever the user needs it.  \nSometimes, \npeople \nare \nconfused\
    \ \nbetween \nConfidentiality and Availability. While Confidentiality is \nto\
    \ make sure only authorized users can access data, \nAvailability refers to making\
    \ sure authorized users can \naccess the data anytime and from everywhere. This\
    \ \nincludes checking the availability of the network and \nhardware which host\
    \ the data, in addition to checking the \napplications and security protocols\
    \ that are running \ncorrectly. The combination of these three words creates \n\
    the main guidelines for protecting and securing \ninformation. \n8 \nInformatica\

    \ \nshould be demonstrated, and this depends on the \nbusiness’s needs to work\
    \ properly and the level of data \nsensitivity. For example, imagine that we are\
    \ talking \nabout a data center that has many servers that host \nmilitary information.\
    \ Admins and managers are the only \nones who can access this server (Confidentiality).\
    \ \nSometimes, managers need to access the data on the \nweekend from their homes\
    \ using the Virtual private \nnetwork VPN (Availability). The admins added a policy\
    \ \nto each user, where some of them can see data – read-\nonly – and others can\
    \ modify it (Integrity). \n \n3.3 \nVulnerability VS Attack VS Threat \nA threat\
    \ is any potential occurrence, whether it is \nharmful or not, that may badly\
    \ affect the system, \nnetwork, application, data, and devices, among others.\
    \ \nThreats can be either intentional or unintentional. They \ncould be also natural\
    \ threats, which are called natural \nhazards. This includes fires, floods, and\
    \ earthquakes. \nVulnerability is a gap or weakness in any part of the \nsystem\
    \ that makes a threat possible to badly affect, for \nexample, open ports and\
    \ off firewalls. The Vulnerability \noccurs due to different reasons such as unprotected\
    \ \ndesigns, users’ mistakes, employees’ misunderstanding, \nmistakes in configuration,\
    \ insecure coding, and any other \nreasons that make the organization open to\
    \ cyberattacks. \nVulnerability can be either intentional or unintentional. \n\
    Finally, an attack is when a bad guise that uses \nvulnerability enacts a threat,\
    \ so it refers to the cybercrime \nitself and the action to do this crime, and\
    \ it is always \nintentional. \n4  \nInternet of Things IOT \nIn simple words,\
    \ the Internet of things (IoT) is related \nto any physical devices connected\
    \ wirelessly to each \nother via the Internet or any other communication \nnetworks.\
    \ Different IoT applications, such as smart grids, \nhealthcare, transportation\
    \ system, city, supply chain, \nfarming, retail, wearable, environment, manufacturing,\
    \ \nhome, security, and emergencies are generally referred to \nas the IoT system.\
    \ The IoT ecosystem aims at referring to \nall IoT applications as mentioned [35].\
    \  \nIoT devices are controlled remotely using a center \ndevice which usually\
    \ communicates useful data from the \nsurrounding environment. It is similar to\
    \ an umbrella of \ndevices “things” that exchange data using the Internet. \n\
    IoT devices became more popular in the last 15 years and \nare increasingly used\
    \ in our lives and other areas such as \nindustry, healthcare, military, smart\
    \ homes, and smart \ncities. According to Cisco, by 2030, the number of \nconnected\
    \ devices is expected to exceed 500 billion [2]. \nTable V has a list of IoT areas\
    \ found in the papers studied \nin this survey.    \n4.1 \nBasic IoT \nIoT devices\
    \ are most likely similar in the way of \nprocessing and have the same main standard\
    \ of work, but \nthey vary in their functionality. The main idea of IoT \ndevices\
    \ is to sense and record data from the physical \nworld and shares it with connected\
    \ devices through a \ncommunication network. In terms of hardware, they are \n\
    similar too as they have a build-in CPU and network \nadapter to connect to a\
    \ Dynamic Host Configuration \nProtocol (DHCP) which supports the devices with\
    \ IP \naddresses to work. The whole devices and data are \nmanaged through a web\
    \ service or software application in \na central device.  \nA Survey of Using\

    \ and \nvehicles. They are often called connected or smart \ndevices as they can\
    \ communicate through a process \nknown as machine-to-machine (M2M) communication\
    \ \n[36]. \nMachine learning became popular in processing IoT \ndata which may\
    \ be integrated into the same IoT device or \nin the cloud, and this also depends\
    \ on the data amount \nwhich increases day by day. Below is a list of IoT smart\
    \ \nenvironments: \n- Smart Object: They are also called intelligent objects,\
    \ \nand they are devices that have the ability to communicate \nwith other devices\
    \ through a network. Smart objects can \ncollect, store, and process data with\
    \ other devices to do a \nspecific automated decision, and they are also known\
    \ as \nIoT devices. \n- Smart environment: It refers to the situation where there\
    \ \nare many IoT devices and applications that control or do \nthe main jobs in\
    \ the environment. \n- Smart home: The capacity to regulate domestic \nappliances\
    \ using the electronic control. Internet-\nconnected devices are known as smart\
    \ home automation. \nComplex heating and lighting systems, alarms, and home \n\
    security controls may all be programmed in advance, \nconnected to a central hub,\
    \ and operated remotely by a \nsmartphone app. \n- Smart car/ Autonomous vehicle:\
    \ Those vehicles use a \ncompletely automated driving system. This type of \n\
    vehicle requires little human input to move safely and \nsense its environment.\
    \ Self-driving cars use a range of \nsensors to gather information about their\
    \ environment. \nDifferent sensors are essential to self-driving cars. IoT is\
    \ \nessential to the operation of self-driving cars as IoT \nenables all kinds\
    \ of devices to be connected to the \nInternet for information sharing and value-added\
    \ \nfunctions. \n- Smart transportation: By giving a precise Electronic \nTravel\
    \ Authorization (ETA) for trains and buses as well \nas by leveraging traffic\
    \ data to optimize bus transit \nroutes, IoT technology can enhance public transportation.\
    \ \nIoT also makes traffic management more effective. Smart \ntraffic lights and\
    \ sensors powered by IoT can detect \nheavy traffic volumes automatically and\
    \ change the \nduration of the traffic lights as necessary to relieve \ncongestion.\
    \ Moreover, IoT sensors can be used by cities \nto monitor which parking spaces\
    \ are unoccupied around \nthe city. The tracking of busy and unoccupied locations\
    \ \nusing this data will allow parks to be optimized for \nmaximum effectiveness.\
    \ \n- Smart buildings: By integrating building operations \nwith the IoT, functions\
    \ like managing the temperature of \na building, security, fire detection, water\
    \ monitoring, \nmaintenance, and more can be made simpler and smarter \nusing\
    \ computers and mobile devices. \n- Smart healthcare: A health service system\
    \ known as \n\"smart healthcare\" uses technology such as wearables IoT \ndevices\
    \ which use mobile internet to dynamically access \ninformation and connect individuals,\
    \ resources, and \ninstitutions involved in healthcare, and then actively \nmanage\
    \ and intelligently respond to the needs of the \nmedical ecosystem. \n- Smart\
    \ cities: To provide linked solutions for the public, \nsmart cities combine the\
    \ IoT with a range of software, \nuser interfaces, and communication networks.\
    \ Smart city \nsensors for sound and air quality monitoring, water and \nwaste\
    \ management, and parking management are made \npossible by IoT. \n- Smart metering\
    \ and smart grids: The most common \napplication of smart metering is smart grids,\
    \ where the \nelectricity consumption is measured and monitored. \nSmart metering\
    \ may also be used to address the problem \nof electricity theft [37]. \n- Smart\
    \ security and emergencies: IoT technologies \nenable organizations and individual\
    \ consumers to \nremotely control and monitor their home security. If the \ndoors\
    \ have smart locks, these systems can control the \nmonitoring inside and outside\
    \ the house as well as who \nhas access to them. \n- Smart retail: The usage of\
    \ IoT in the retail sector is \nclosely linked to GPS and RFID technology, which\
    \ \nassists firms in tracking products along the supply chain. \nIt provides retailers\
    \ with the visibility they need to keep \nan eye on goods movement, conditions,\
    \ and location \nwhile also being able to pinpoint a delivery date. \n- Smart\
    \ agriculture and animal farming: Monitoring soil \nmoisture and condition can\
    \ also be done with IoT \ntechnologies. It is possible to monitor the growth of\
    \ \nplants plot by plot using technology like drones. With all \nof this knowledge,\
    \ decisions regarding irrigation or \nfertilization are made fully informed. Grain\
    \ and vegetable \nproduction can be avoided by controlling the temperature \n\
    and \nhumidity \nlevels \nduring \ndifferent \nprocesses.  \nIncreasing the yield\
    \ and quality of vegetables and crops \ncan also benefit from climate control.\
    \ Similar to crop \nmonitoring, there are IoT applications that use sensors \n\
    attached to farm animals to track their movements or \nstolen from farms and general\
    \ health.  \nJust like having many different areas to use IoT, \nthere are many\
    \ connectivity options, and this produces \nmany attacks and different new vulnerabilities\
    \ in this \nenvironment. Let us first consider the communicative \nways which\
    \ have many protocols such as MQTT, CoAP, \n10 \nInformatica 47 (2023) 1–54 \n\
    k. Harahsheh et al. \nDDS, AMQP, and DTLS, and other wireless protocols \nsuch\
    \ as Zigbee, LPWAN, Bluetooth Low Energy, IPv6, \nNFC, RFID, and Z-Wave. Some\
    \ other networks used in \ndifferent scenarios include regular Wi-Fi networks,\
    \ \nsatellite, Cellular, and Ethernet. Which one to choose? \nThe answer depends\
    \ on the scenario and the function of \nthis environment. Each of the previous\
    \ networks and \nprotocols has its characteristics which were affected by \nrange,\
    \ bandwidth, power consumptions, and the object of \nthe project. \nChoosing \n\
    the \nbest \ncommunication \nway \nor \nconnectivity protocol depends on the IoT\
    \ application, and \nbelow are some popular ones: \n• Consumer IoT applications:\
    \ This type is commonly \nused in smart homes or smart personal devices. \n• Commercial\
    \ IoT applications: They are mainly \nused in businesses such as smart organizations,\
    \ smart \nmarkets, and healthcare.  \n• Military Things (IoMT) applications: They\
    \ support \nand advance technologies in the military such as \ndrones, robots,\
    \ and every monitoring system. \n• Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications:\
    \ \nThey are used in the manufacturing and industrial \nfields. \n• Infrastructure\
    \ IoT applications: They are primarily \nused in smart cities.  \n4.2 \nTraditional\
    \ networks VS IoT networks \nThe devices used in traditional networks mostly are\
    \ \nmore complicated than the ones used in IoT networks. \nIoT systems depend\
    \ mainly on small sensor nodes which \ncollect data and store it somewhere in\
    \ the cloud. IoT \nnodes have some limitations which will be discussed \nbelow\
    \ such as low power, small memory, less \ncomputational process, and few capacities.\
    \ On the other \nhand, the devices in traditional networks are connected to \n\
    a fixed infrastructure that supports them with stable \npower, alternate power\
    \ supply, servers, and storage \ndevices, among others. \nThe second difference\
    \ concerns security as IoT devices \nuse less secure wireless protocols, such\
    \ as ZigBee, \n802.15.4e, SigFox, LoRa, and 802.11x, which are used \nby IoT devices\
    \ to connect with the gateway or the \nInternet, which result in data leakage\
    \ and privacy issues \n[35], while the traditional network administrators use\
    \ \nfirewalls and other strong encryption protocols for both \nwired and wireless\
    \ networks. In addition, the operation \nsystems OS used in network devices are\
    \ more stable and \nsecure than the OS used in IoT devices.  \n4.3 \nIOT characteristics\
    \ \nIoT devices have different characteristics which give \nthem a kind of distinction\
    \ and difference from the usual \nsystems and regular devices. IoT has some security\
    \ \nrequirements similar to traditional networks, but because \nof its characteristics,\
    \ it also has some unique security \nfeatures. IoT has speeded devices connected\
    \ remotely \nusing the Internet where organizations and individuals \ndaily collect\
    \ records through them and store huge \namounts of data in the cloud. This makes\
    \ it a challenge to \nsecure sensitive and private information through back-\n\
    and-forth connections. IoT devices, in general, lack \nstrong security measures\
    \ to protect themselves from \nsecurity attacks. Furthermore, security patches\
    \ might not \nbe updated regularly due to the irregular software release \nor\
    \ the lack of awareness and expertise of the IoT device \nusers [38]. The ways\
    \ in which those devices work \ntogether give the network and IoT systems special\
    \ \ncharacteristics as follows:  \n- \nScalability: Every day, more and more objects\
    \ are \nbeing connected to IoT. It is speculated that billions \nof devices are\
    \ connected with each other and through \nthe Internet will likely surpass the\
    \ capabilities of the \ncurrent \nInternet \n[15]. \nScalability \nshould \nbe\
    \ \nconsidered while designing your system because of \nthe Internet of Things\
    \ rising ubiquity. The ability of \na \nsystem \nto \nexpand \nwithout \nimpacting\
    \ \nits \nperformance is frequently used to define scalability. \nThis can be\
    \ done by enhancing an existing system \nwith greater hardware resources or by\
    \ introducing \nnew software layers. In other words, the system can \naccommodate\
    \ more users and data without suffering \nfrom performance degradation. IoT is\
    \ a new \ntechnology that is completely changing the way we \nlive and work. IoT\
    \ can be used in numerous ways. \nScaling it to fit your business is one approach.\
    \ \n- \nConnectivity: \nIoT \nhas \nmade \npossible \nthe \ninterconnectivity\
    \ of Physical and Virtual things with \nthe help of the Internet and global communication\
    \ \ninfrastructure that is built using wired and wireless \ntechnologies [39].\
    \ Connectivity is the capacity of \ntwo or more devices to exchange information\
    \ and \ncommunicate with one another. In other words, it \nenables \nthe \ncommunication\
    \ \nbetween \ndevices. \nBusinesses have a ton of opportunities to develop \n\
    new goods and services as a result of this \nconnectedness. Everything is now\
    \ connected to IoT \nwhich creates endless opportunities for the future. \n- \n\
    Safety and security: They are the main issues \neveryone searching for, especially\
    \ when personal \ninformation \nis \ngathered \nand \nshared \nwithout \npermission.\
    \ Data privacy is a major problem with \nIoT devices. IoT expanding exponentially\
    \ and more \nand more products and appliances are being \nconnected to it, and\
    \ this increases the number of \ncyber-attacks on these appliances and devices.\
    \ Some \nIoT devices are embedded in public areas and use \nshared networks, and\
    \ this makes them vulnerable and \neasy to attack. \n- \nSelf-Adapting: Because\
    \ of the IoT’s fast growth over \nthe past several years and because it is an\
    \ essential \naspect of many systems, self-adapting, and dynamic \ntechniques\
    \ are required for IoT designs to better \nhandle these changes. A self-adaptive\
    \ system adapts \nits behavior while it is used in response to changes in \nthe\
    \ system or its surroundings. IoT devices and \nsystems may be able to dynamically\
    \ adapt to \nchanging contexts and take appropriate action.  \n- \nSelf-organization/\
    \ self-healing: Self-healing methods \nallow a system to operate on its own and\
    \ resolve \nproblems. These are necessary for urgent and \nA Survey of Using Machine\
    \ Learning in IoT Security and the…                                          \
    \        Informatica 47 (2023) 1–54 \n11 \nmodern IoT communication, including\
    \ emergency or \ndisaster scenarios. Because relying on the network \ninfrastructure\
    \ in these critical systems is not an \noption, \nself-organizing \nnetworks \n\
    should \nbe \nimplemented.  \n- \nIntelligence: The intelligence that goes into\
    \ the IoT \ndetermines how useful it is. The ability of IoT \ndevices to sense\
    \ data, communicates with one \nanother, and gathers enormous amounts of data\
    \ for \nanalysis constitutes their intelligence. To link IoT \ndevices to networks\
    \ and process the data from \nmillions of data nodes, sophisticated software,\
    \ \nalgorithms, and protocols are employed. They should \nbe always updated with\
    \ the newest software and \nfirmware if you want your IOT to be intelligent. \n\
    - \nSensing: The main idea of IoT systems is sensing \nwithout sensors. IoT would\
    \ not be able to detect or \nmeasure environmental changes to produce data that\
    \ \nmay be used to report on their condition, decision \nmaking, or even interact\
    \ with the environment. \n- \nHeterogeneity: One of the major aspects of IoT is\
    \ \nheterogeneity. IoT devices can communicate with \nother devices or service\
    \ platforms across various \nnetworks and are built on different hardware \nplatforms\
    \ and networks. Direct network connectivity \nbetween \nheterogeneous \nnetworks\
    \ \nshould \nbe \nsupported by IoT networks. \n- \nCommunication: When there are\
    \ so many IoT \ndevices in our lives, it is critical to be able to connect \n\
    with them in order to ensure effective operation. \nWith these devices, you can\
    \ connect in a few \ndifferent ways.  The first way is called cloud service, \n\
    which is a kind of software that enables the \nconnection of the device to the\
    \ Internet. Another \nmethod involves using a gateway that is linked to \nother\
    \ devices and enables the communication \nbetween them. One IoT device can connect\
    \ \nseparately to the Internet even though the second \ndevice is not connected\
    \ to a network. \n- \nLow power/ Low cost: IoT devices need very low \npower and\
    \ low-cost solutions to work properly. ML \nalgorithms focus most of the time\
    \ on the \neffectiveness of the attack which has been configured \nin a specific\
    \ way. However, it could be interesting to \nevaluate \nother \nparameters \n\
    such \nas \nenergy \nconsumption from an attacker’s point of view or the \noptimal\
    \ distance from its victim to carry out an \nattack [2]. \n- \nData: IoT is made\
    \ up of linked devices that monitor, \nsense, gather, record, and exchange data.\
    \ IoT devices \nand system performance and efficiency can be \nenhanced with the\
    \ help of the data they collect. The \ndata is useless without analyzing the collected\
    \ data \nusing software and tools that transform the records \ninto useful reports\
    \ or help in decision-making.  \n- \nArchitecture: Many manufacturers and companies\
    \ in \nthe IoT industry are utilizing the architecture to \npower their devices.\
    \ The architecture is primarily in \ncharge of ensuring that the devices cooperate\
    \ and \ninteract with one another. It also plays a crucial role \nin preventing\
    \ cross-interference between the devices. \n4.4 \nIOT limitations and challenges\
    \ \nIoT devices have power, processor, and memory \nrestrictions such as low-computing\
    \ capabilities, low \npower sources, limited storage, or limited memory \ncapacity.\
    \ Those limitations cause the IoT devices to not \nbe always handled with the\
    \ sophisticated security \nprotocols they require; they are more likely to be\
    \ attacked \nor experience flaws. Because of this, the hardware's \ndesign must\
    \ be expandable in order to provide higher \nsecurity. \nIoT limitation and challenges\
    \ have different types such \nas hardware challenges or limitations, software,\
    \ network, \nand security. All those limitations and challenges should \nbe taken\
    \ in account before developing any systems and \nsecurity solutions. The most\
    \ critical weakness of IoT \nwould most likely be security. Applications for the\
    \ IoT \nmay encounter many of the security restrictions and \ndifficulties which\
    \ recently become the most popular \nresearch in this field. These limitations\
    \ inspire the \nresearchers to implement special steps in securing those \ndevices,\
    \ such as lightweight cryptography algorithms for \nencryption, lightweight feature\
    \ selection algorithms, and \nlightweight machine learning security framework\
    \ as in \n[40], where the authors produced lightweight machine \nlearning based\
    \ security framework for the detection of \nmalicious phishing URLs. IoT offers\
    \ many advantages \nand benefits in various areas and addresses a variety of \n\
    problems in different sectors. Below is a list of some \ntypical issues and challenges\
    \ in IoT solutions:  \n- \nData storage: In IoT systems, there are many \ndifficulties\
    \ for the developers of IoT applications \nbecause of the huge recorded and stored\
    \ data by \nthe heterogeneous IoT sensors. The number of IoT \ndevices is exponentially\
    \ increasing and its \nrecorded data is increasing as well. As reported, \nthere\
    \ will be more than 50 billion terminal devices \nworldwide, and the annual data\
    \ generated will \nreach 847 Zebytes by 2021. “Big data” hereby \nbecomes common\
    \ in IoT applications, such as \nindustrial manufacturing, smart cities, energy\
    \ \nInternet, and wireless sensor network (WSN), \namong others [41]. Huge storage\
    \ areas are made \navailable by cloud computing, which also \nprovides a platform\
    \ for IoT-connected devices to \ncommunicate. Multiple sensors through IoT store\
    \ \ndata in the cloud and communicate using cloud \nsystems, instead of using\
    \ local servers or storage.  \n- \nData format: The variation in IoT systems causes\
    \ \ndifferent data formats. Thousands of IoT systems \nare currently running all\
    \ around the world, and \nbillions of those devices are used in those systems.\
    \ \nMost IoT environments are for sensing purposes, \nand sensor data is often\
    \ presented as a tiny tuple \nof structured data such as Boolean, numeric, \n\
    continuous data, binary, and more. The different \nways that IoT data can be represented\
    \ make a \nchallenge for developers and data analyzers.  \n- \nArchitecture challenge:\
    \ The IoT include numerous \nlinked devices, where each one communicates \nusing\
    \ a unique set of protocols and standards that \n12 \nInformatica 47 (2023) 1–54\
    \ \nk. Harahsheh et al. \ndifferentiate them from other devices’ protocols, \n\
    so in IoT, there are no clear criteria or guidelines \nfor linking devices together.\
    \ This causes difficulty \nfor developers in the system architecture. \n- \nIntegration\
    \ with other devices: IoT systems must \ncollaborate \nwith \nother \nforms \n\
    of \ntechnical \ninfrastructure in order to generate useful outputs if \nthey\
    \ are to be even more advantageous. For \nexample, the cloud must be used to store\
    \ recorded \ninformation. Then the data is transferred and \ndistributed using\
    \ hubs and routers which may also \nuse \nblock-chains \nto \nadd \nmore \nsecurity.\
    \  \nAdditionally, the data collected must be analyzed \nusing big data analytics\
    \ and other techniques. The \nproblem becomes more complicated when all \nthese\
    \ technologies are combined with IoT. So, a \nsolution \nis \nneeded \nto help\
    \ \nin \ngathering, \ntransferring, and analyzing data quickly and \nsecurely\
    \ without hurting the performance. \n- \nSecurity, privacy, and trust: Attackers\
    \ become \nmore interested in using the data from the huge \nunorganized IoT devices\
    \ which are scattered \naround us. For security professionals, integrating \n\
    security features is difficult since sensors have \nlimited computing and storage\
    \ capacity. Peoples \nand individuals store huge data in the cloud daily, \nwhich\
    \ makes it a challenge to secure this data as \nthe back-and-forth connections\
    \ include sensitive \nand private information. By creating gaps, \nattackers might\
    \ take control of the sensors and \nbreak the system.  \n- \nNeed skills and experience:\
    \ It is important to \nconsider certain capabilities and experience while \ndesigning,\
    \ deploying, improving, and maintaining \nsecurity. Any of these components that\
    \ are \ndisrupted could harm the security of the IoT \nenvironment. Because of\
    \ the daily development of \nnew IoT devices, there is a lake of experts in this\
    \ \nfield. There are extremely few skilled individuals \nthat can manage IoT technology\
    \ effectively.  \n- \nlegal and ethical issues: IoT is connected \neverywhere\
    \ around us and inside our homes, and \nit monitors and records some sensitive\
    \ data about \nus. It does not only maintain privacy but also \npeople rely more\
    \ on technology for different \nactivities such as shopping, banking, doing \n\
    business, and online studying, especially after the \nquarantine imposed during\
    \ Covid-19. Currently, \nmany companies are requesting patients and \npeople to\
    \ upload their symptoms and vitals to \nonline portals for further prediction\
    \ and analysis \nof Covid-19 outbreaks [42]. Users cannot feel \nconfident \n\
    enough \nto \ngive \npersonal \nhealth \ninformation because there are no clear\
    \ legal \noperations \nor \ninstructions \noffered \nby \nthe \ngovernment to\
    \ protect people’s privacy in IoT \nuntil now. IoT and other technical systems\
    \ should \nbe managed and guided by the government to \ncover \nthe \nwhole \n\
    process \nof \nusing \nsuch \ntechnologies to share information with respecting\
    \ \ntheir legal rights. \n- \nTechnical complexity: IoT devices may appear to\
    \ \nbe doing straightforward activities, but their \ndevelopment requires a great\
    \ deal of complicated \ntechnology. In addition, by giving crucial data to \n\
    another system, they risk having a harmful impact \non every system to which it\
    \ is linked, and fixing \nthe issue is really not simple. Behind these \ndevices,\
    \ a wide range of complex processes \noperates to execute the task. The amount\
    \ of code \nand machine connection between the many \ndevices makes it challenging.\
    \ The main part of the \nIoT complexity comes from the failure that affects \n\
    the whole network if one device defects. \n- \nConnectivity dependency to the\
    \ power and \nInternet: Internet service is important for IoT \ndevices, where\
    \ the devices are unable to function, \nand tasks cannot be completed without\
    \ a stable \ninternet connection. The proper operation of IoT \nalso requires\
    \ constant electricity. Both the \nequipment and everything attached to it stop\
    \ \nworking when either one fails. IoT devices are so \nembedded in today's organizations\
    \ and when it \ngoes down, anything else could come down. \n- \nHigher costs (time\
    \ and money): IoT device \ndeployment requires a significant time and budget.\
    \ \nThere are numerous devices that must be ordered \nand set up, as well as expert\
    \ members to install the \ndevices and other members to link them to the \nnetwork\
    \ and support their teams, and this entire \nstep is costly. \n- \nForensics challenges:\
    \ Digital forensics, a branch \nof forensic science, focuses on recovering and\
    \ \ninvestigating digital materials, such as document \nand image files, often\
    \ in relation to computer \ncrimes. IoT forensics can be defined as a branch \n\
    of digital forensics [43]. IoT forensics is more \ncomplex than regular network\
    \ forensics because \nof the huge number of devices, the big data \ncollected\
    \ by those devices, and the diversity of \nprotocols. A variety of devices is\
    \ another \nchallenge for IoT forensics where it is not only for \ncomputers but\
    \ also for sensors, phones, and all \nsmart devices in the IoT environment. This\
    \ causes \ndifficulty in identifying the huge number of \ndevices with a variety\
    \ of hardware and the nature \nof each. Not only devices but also data privacy\
    \ \nadded another challenge to IoT forensics.  \n- \nOther challenges based on\
    \ the network: IoT \nrequires a variety of protocols in order to connect \nto\
    \ other networks, some of which use IP and \nothers do not. This results in a\
    \ variety of features \nand ineffective security measures for devices. \nAnother\
    \ issue with IoT devices in a single \nnetwork is their variety, as it is challenging\
    \ to \nlocate a single network that can support all of the \ndifferent IoT types.\
    \ Additionally, IoT devices \nhave the ability to join or leave the network from\
    \ \nanywhere at any moment, which results in a \ndynamic network topology. As\
    \ a result, the IoT \nsmart devices and their security are not \ncompatible with\
    \ this architecture, and the \nA Survey of Using Machine Learning in IoT Security\
    \ and the…                                                  Informatica 47 (2023)\
    \ 1–54 \n13 \nnetwork's current security cannot handle this kind \nof unexpected\
    \ topological changes. One of the \nmost important characteristics of IoT devices\
    \ is \nmobility, which refers to the ability of these \ndevices to join other\
    \ networks without the need \nfor pre-configuration. \n- \nOther challenges based\
    \ on software: Operating \nsystems of IoT that are embedded in IoT devices \n\
    have \nthin \nnetwork \nprotocols, \nand \nsome \nvulnerabilities \nof \nthe \n\
    IoT \ndevices \ncannot \nreprogram because it depends on the embedded \nprotocol.\
    \ \n- \nOther challenges based on resources: Memory \ncapacity, power capacity,\
    \ and processing capacity \nare the main resource limitations in IoT which \n\
    make \nit \nmore \nchallenging \nto \nsecure \nthe \ncomparison with regular network\
    \ devices. IoT \nuses a small RAM that stores a few kilobytes of \nsensing data,\
    \ and when this RAM is full, some \ndata is dropped and ignored, which may be\
    \ \nimportant sometimes. Most IoT devices use low-\nbandwidth network connections\
    \ because they do \nnot consume much power. Many IoT devices have \nlimited power\
    \ sources that need to be replaced \ncontinuously; at the same time, we have some\
    \ \nnon-rechargeable IoT devices with a large power \ncapacity.  \n5  \nIOT and\
    \ cybersecurity  \nNowadays, IoT devices can be found in every corner \nof our\
    \ lives. They store and transmit sensitive and costly \ndata, starting from web\
    \ cameras in our houses which may \ndestroy our privacy with unsecured devices.\
    \ They also \nbecame a main part of the military field such as drones, \nrobots,\
    \ and datacenters, among others. IoT can be viewed \nas \"A global infrastructure\
    \ for the information society, \nenabling advanced services by interconnecting\
    \ (physical \nand virtual) things based on existing and evolving \ninteroperable\
    \ \ninformation \nand \ncommunication \ntechnologies [44]\". IoT also covers large\
    \ cities, helps \nautonomous cars to take quick and hard decisions on the \nroad,\
    \ and it became a main part of everything \nsurrounding us. Thanks to IoT for\
    \ helping make life \neasier, and this popularity makes vendors fight to produce\
    \ \nand improve more devices. IoT can bring between $3.9 \ntrillion to $11.1 trillion\
    \ in income by 2025 [2]. At the \nsame time, cybercrime damages are also on the\
    \ rise [45]. \nOn the other hand, the device itself and its \ncommunication \n\
    network \nbecame \na \ncybersecurity \nchallenge due to the large number of devices,\
    \ the variety \nof vendors, the characteristics of each layer, and \ncommunication\
    \ options. Some of the most extensive and \ndestructive cyber-attacks deployed\
    \ on the Internet have \nbeen Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks [46].\
    \ \nThe IoT system layers divided into three main parts: \nphysical layer, network\
    \ layer, and application layer. \nDifferent layers characteristics present very\
    \ critical \nvulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are primarily related \nto\
    \ \npoor \nphysical \nsecurity, \nresource \nconstraints, \ninsufficient authentication\
    \ and encryption, insecure \naccess controls, and inadequate update management\
    \ as \nmentioned in survey [2].   \n \n5.1 \nVulnerabilities in IoT \nBecause\
    \ of the big range of IoT covers in different \nindustries, \nacademic \nenvironments,\
    \ \nvendors, \nmanufacturers, and competitors to produce new devices \ndaily,\
    \ all compete to be the top developer in the IoT \nworld, little of them take\
    \ into account to improve \ndevices’ security, which makes IoT devices a target\
    \ to \nmany attackers. Threats are not only in the device itself, \nbut they are\
    \ in all parts of the IoT system. The steps are \nas follows: \n1) \nHardware\
    \ threats in the same device. \n2) \nNetwork threats. \n3) \nClouds threats. \n\
    4) \nWeb and application threats. \n5) \nOther threats. \nEach IoT layer has different\
    \ kinds of attacks which \ncould be active or passive. “An active attack disturbs\
    \ the \noperation of running services, whereas a passive attack \nenumerates IoT\
    \ network information without disturbing \nthe live service” [12] page 1649. The\
    \ most common \nattack in all IoT systems, services, and layers is the denial\
    \ \nof service (DOS) which will be discussed in detail in the \nnext sections.\
    \ \n \n5.2 \nIoT layer-based threats \nThis section discusses in-depth IoT threats\
    \ and \nvulnerabilities for the different layers as in Figure (7) and \nTable\
    \ (11) in the appendix which compares 152 papers in \nthe last five years and\
    \ covers different kinds of detections \nin the IoT environment. \n \nFigure 6:\
    \ IoT layer-based threats. \n1) Physical layer, also known as perception layer:\
    \ It \ncontains the hardware especially the sensors which are \nthe main part\
    \ of the IoT environment. The main idea of \nthe physical layer is sensing and\
    \ gathering data. Machine \nlearning, data encryption, and secure authentication\
    \ are \nthree ways to secure the physical layer [3]. The security \n14 \nInformatica\
    \ 47 (2023) 1–54 \nk. Harahsheh et al. \nof this layer is very important because\
    \ it can be attacked \nphysically and from cyberspace. Below is a list of the\
    \ \nmost popular attacks in the IoT physical layer.  \n- Eavesdropping: This happened\
    \ by connecting a \ndevice in the traffic path to get useful information by \n\
    making passive snigging. \n- Battery draining attack: a huge number of requests\
    \ \ndone by malicious devices controlled by attackers. \nThese multiple requests\
    \ make power loss in IoT \ndevices, as discussed above in section IV under “IOT\
    \ \nLimitations and challenges”. Such a kind of those \ndevices have multiple\
    \ limitations, and power is one of \nthem. \n- Hardware failure: when the device\
    \ itself is physically \ndamaged.  \n- Data injection: it is the process where\
    \ the hacker \nchanges the meaning of the original data before \nsending it to\
    \ the application; it may happen by \nchanging one binary digit.  \n \nFigure\
    \ 7: IoT architecture. Data captured by sensors in the perception layer can be\
    \ sent Network and Transport layer \nfor reliable communication. The processing\
    \ layer is responsible to secure big data in a cloud server where AI-based \n\
    security mechanisms are implemented to provide security services to the Application\
    \ layer users against frequent \nthreats on IoT networks [13]. \n \nA Survey of\
    \ Using Machine Learning in IoT Security and the…                            \
    \                      Informatica 47 (2023) 1–54 \n15 \n- Node cloning: Cloned\
    \ IoT devices are dangerous \nbehavior, where an attacker can physically steal\
    \ the \ndevices, take critical information, make an exact copy \nof the devices,\
    \ and deploy the duplicates in the systems \nto harm them.  \n- Fake Node and\
    \ Malicious: A malicious node is one \nthat tries to prevent other IoT nodes in\
    \ the network \nfrom receiving services. It also makes changes to data \nbefore,\
    \ after, and while transmission. \n- Reverse Engineering: occurs when the attacker\
    \ \ndisassembles the IoT system into small pieces to \nidentify the system weaknesses\
    \ and then uses these \nvulnerabilities to attack similar devices.  \n- \nRadio\
    \ Frequency Interference: involves an attacker \nusing a device to hinder the\
    \ connectivity of IoT \ndevices. Jamming and RF interference occur when \nthe\
    \ attacker is usually in the vicinity of the device’s \nlocation [47]. \n- \n\
    Tampering: In most cases, tampering is the first step \nof a cyber-attack. It\
    \ happens when the attacker can \nphysically alter the IoT device and get the\
    \ encrypted \naccess credential. \n2)  Network layer: is used for transmitting\
    \ the data \ncollected in the physical layer to the application and \nstorage\
    \ places. Below is a list of the most popular \nattacks in the IoT network layer\
    \ \n- DOS: is an attack that causes different problems such \nas \ncollision,\
    \ \nchannel \ncongestion, \nand \nbattery \nexhaustion. \n- Eavesdropping: In\
    \ eavesdropping attacks, hackers \nlisten to network communication passing through\
    \ IoT \ndevices. When a link between two endpoints (such as \nan IoT device and\
    \ a server) is insecure, hackers take \nadvantage of this weakness for network\
    \ sniffing or \nsnooping.  \n- Man-In-The-Middle MITM attack: this attack \nhappens\
    \ when the hacker intercepts, alters, and sends \ndata as the original sender\
    \ to the receiver. \n- Storage attack: Data is stored in storage where people\
    \ \nand apps can interact with data. The storage should be \nsecured in order\
    \ to prevent unwanted access to data and \nunderlying storage systems and to ensure\
    \ that \nauthorized users and apps are only the ones allowed to \naccess. \n-\
    \ Spoofing: To create spoofing attacks in IoT networks, \nan attacker can generate\
    \ routing nodes, transmission \npaths, and fake error messages [48]. \n- Replay\
    \ attack: it is a kind of network attack that \nhappens when criminals track down\
    \ and identify data \ntransmission after which they delay or repeat. \n3) Application\
    \ layer: this layer is varying from one \nIoT device to another, and there are\
    \ no common standers \nto follow to secure this layer. An application layer is\
    \ the \ninterface between the IoT physical structure and the user. \nMost of the\
    \ time, it uses a graphical user interface (GUI) \nto interact with the device.\
    \ Below is a list of the most \npopular attacks in the IoT application layer:\
    \ \n- Malicious code: It is any code that may harm a \nsystem. \n- Weak application\
    \ security: it is the weakness in the \nsoftware code, cryptographic, or access\
    \ control that can \nbe exploited by a malicious hacker and potentially \ncause\
    \ security risks. \n- Cross-Site Scripting: When a hacker inserts malicious \n\
    scripts into a trusted website, the user will run the \nscript regardless of the\
    \ trusted website, and then the \nmalicious script will access the cookies and\
    \ any data \nstored by the browser. \n- Phishing Attacks: Phishing is the practice\
    \ of attackers \nsending malicious emails meant to lead recipients to \nfall for\
    \ a scam. Attackers trick the user into doing \nthings like downloading harmful\
    \ software by visiting \nmalicious links. \n4) Middleware: is a summary layer\
    \ used in IoT to \neliminate the layer between network and application \nMiddleware\
    \ layer, and it includes brokers, persistent data \nstores, queuing systems, and\
    \ machine learning, among \nothers [37]. Middleware has different kinds of attacks\
    \ \nsuch as: \n- Man-in-the-Middle Attack. \n- SQL Injection Attack. \n- Signature\
    \ Wrapping Attack. \n- Cloud Malware Injection. \n- Flooding Attack in Cloud.\
    \ \nFinally, Ml and DL may be used on both sides: attack \nand defense. Hackers\
    \ may use ML to find holes in the \nsystems, and they are possible to be employed\
    \ in \nmalicious things. \n \n5.3 \nCommon IoT threats \nThis section highlights\
    \ the most popular threats found \nin most IoT environments. Threats lists are\
    \ daily updated \nand add new dangers to the systems. Several approaches \nare\
    \ currently in use: traffic analysis, content analysis, \napplication, and user\
    \ behavior analysis [49]. Malware \ncompromises and challenges the integrity,\
    \ confidentiality, \nand availability of the victim's information on hardware\
    \ \nor software. Malware is a combination of `mal' from \n`malicious' and `ware'\
    \ from `software'. Viruses, Worms, \nTrojan Horses, Spyware, and Adware are commonly\
    \ \ntaken examples of it [1]. \n1) Dental of service DOS/DDOS: are very common\
    \ \nin IoT networks than regular networks due to the \nIoT environment limitations\
    \ such as low power, \nlow computation, and low capacity which are \ndiscussed\
    \ in section IV under “IOT Limitations \nand Challenges”. Those limitations make\
    \ the \nnetwork \nresources \nunavailable \nand \ndisrupt \nservices. Due to the\
    \ heterogeneity characteristics \nof the IoT environment and interconnected \n\
    networks, the malware can easily spread across \nthe network and propagated to\
    \ the adjacent \nnetwork through the gateway [50]. DDoS attacks \nare one of the\
    \ most severe and frequent attacks in \nIoT networks. This attack can occur at\
    \ multiple \ntiers of the architecture, which makes its detection \nand resolution\
    \ increasingly complex [51]. \n \n \n16 \nInformatica 47 (2023) 1–54 \nk. Harahsheh\
    \ et al. \nTable 6: Overview of different kind of detection \nsystems on the IoT\

    \ detection \n109-122, 156, 157  \n7 \nSpam detection \n167  \n2) Hardware and\
    \ software vulnerability: not all \nthreats are in cyberspace, as physical threats\
    \ in the device \nitself are also very important to consider. Sometimes an \n\
    open port in the device is used remotely by attackers. \nUniversal passwords and\
    \ weak embedded codes are \nexamples of this kind of threat. \n3) Social engineering:\
    \ it is when malicious activities \nare done through human interaction. Social\
    \ engineers \ntrick organizations and individuals to break security or \nget sensitive\
    \ data. IoT devices are important for social \nengineers because it gives them\
    \ a brief about someone’s \nbehavior which is one of the main steps for success\
    \ to \nsocial engineers. \n4) User weakness: many studies show that most \ncompanies’\
    \ attacks were because of employees. Social \nengineering, mail phishing, and\
    \ other security problems \nare caused by the lack of security knowledge and \n\
    training. \n \n6  \nDatasets \nThe dataset is a collection of data of different\
    \ types \nsuch as text, image, audio, video, and numeric data that is \nused to\
    \ train the model to learn and predict outputs \ndepending on the dataset pattern.\
    \ So, it is a file that \ncontains many records, where the record is the main\
    \ unit \nof information stored in the dataset as a row. Dataset \nsources on the\
    \ Internet are from public and private \ninstitutions, or from individuals and\
    \ researchers who \ncollect data themselves. Preparing and choosing the right\
    \ \ndataset is a very important part of the machine learning \ntraining module.\
    \ For using the dataset, it must slice into \nthree parts: training data, testing\
    \ data, and validation data. \nTesting data is the biggest part of the dataset\
    \ around, \nwhere 60% of the main dataset is used to train the ML \nmodel. The\
    \ testing part uses 20% of the dataset to \nevaluate the accuracy of the ML model,\
    \ whereas the \nvalidation part also around 20% of the dataset to evaluate \n\
    the model’s parameters after training and testing. \n \n6.1 \nPopular datasets\
    \ used in IoT security \nIoT system is a collection of devices linked with \n\
    sensors, applications, and other parts to collect and send \ndata over the Internet.\
    \ Those systems collect large \namounts of data from its environment as records\
    \ in the \ndataset. There are many free datasets related to IoT \nsystems on the\
    \ Internet. In this survey, I focused on the \ndatasets related to IoT security\
    \ such as in Table VII \nwhich contains the IoT security dataset used in all \n\
    references in this survey for the last five years and all the \nproperties of\
    \ those datasets. \n \n6.2 \nData Pre-processing \nData pre-processing is a combination\
    \ of data mining \nand data analysis. It converts raw data to another format \n\
    that can be understood by the system. IoT data are huge \nand called big data\
    \ as it consists of thousand, or maybe \nmillions, of records collected when IoT\
    \ senses the \nenvironment as texts, images, or videos. Raw data are \nmessy data\
    \ because it is collected from different sources, \nand it not only had errors\
    \ but, most of the time, is \nincomplete or has no uniform design, which is also\
    \ called \nunstructured data. Unstructured data should first be \ncleaned and\
    \ reformatted before analysis. When the ML \nmodel trains bad data, it will produce\
    \ bad analysis results. \nMachine \nlearning \nresearch \nrequires \ngood \nand\
    \ \ncomprehensive data analysis. The first step is to arrange \ndata in such a\
    \ configuration that it will be compatible \nwith the input of any ML algorithm\
    \ [52]. Cleaning data is \nthe process of ignoring the missing record, filling\
    \ missing \nvalues manually, filling in using computed values, and \ncorrecting\
    \ errors in data. Getting clear and useful data \nwill directly affect the learning\
    \ model.  \nThe next step of data pre-processing is data integration \nwhich is\
    \ used to combine data from several sources into a \nsingle, larger data storage,\
    \ such as a server. After that, we \ndo data transformation which means converting\
    \ the \nuseful data into new forms by changing its structure or \nformat. The\
    \ last step is data reduction and compression to \nminimize the size of the dataset\
    \ to make it easier to \nhandle by data analysis and data mining algorithms. The\
    \ \nlast step, which is the most important task, is to identify \nthe type of\
    \ features. \nData cleaning is the process of removing duplicate \ninformation,\
    \ correcting existing errors, and providing \ndata consistency. It is estimated\
    \ that the anomaly and \nimpurity in the data generally account for about 5% of\
    \ the \ntotal data, which may be even worse for IoT. The data \ntypes that need\
    \ to be cleaned are Incomplete Data, \nIncorrect Data, and Duplicate Data [22].\
    \ \n \n6.3 \nFeature Selection \nFeature selection (FS) is one of the optimization\
    \ \ntechniques that is used as a pre-processing step in \nmachine learning problems\
    \ to improve or at least \nmaintain the classification accuracy and simplify the\
    \ \ncomplexity of the used classifier. It is considered one of \nthe most critical\
    \ steps in the process of building an \nintrusion detection system [53]. Most\
    \ research in IoT \ndataset feature selections works on producing a \nlightweight\
    \ technique that is compatible with this \nenvironment’s limitations which is\
    \ discussed in Section 5 \nunder the title of IoT challenges and limitations.\
    \ The \nmain idea of FS is to reduce the amount of data by \nselecting the most\
    \ important features which affect the \nA Survey of Using Machine Learning in\
    \ IoT Security and the…                                                  Informatica\
    \ 47 (2023) 1–54 \n17 \nmodel accuracy and ignoring other less important \nfeatures.\
    \ Feature selection is an important process for \nbuilding a Network intrusion\
    \ detection system (NIDS) \nwhere it helps to remove the noisy features and keep\
    \ only \nthe features that are relevant to system output [54]. \nReducing the\
    \ number of data samples affect positively in \nthe model performance, reducing\
    \ the computational \nprocesses time, and increasing the testing and training\
    \ \nspeed. \n \n6.4 \n Number of hyperparameters \nIn general, an increasing number\
    \ of hyperparameters is \nassociated with additional work for the user. Either\
    \ \nappropriate values have to be defined through user \nexperience or reasonable\
    \ parameters have to be found via \nresearch or optimization on a set of possible\
    \ values. A \nhigh number of hyperparameters can yield better model \nperformance\
    \ through extensive parameter search [55]. \n \n7  \nMachine learning and Deep\
    \ \nlearning \nMachine learning is frequently mistakenly with \nartificial intelligence;\
    \ however, it is a subfield or form of \nAI. Predictive analytics and predictive\
    \ modeling are other \nnames for machine learning. Deep learning also is a \n\
    domain of AI, and it is a subset of machine learning at the \nsame time. The word\
    \ “deep” relays to the depth of the \nlayers in the neural network, where the\
    \ neural network is \nthe base of DL, ML, and AI.  \nNeural Network (NN) is a\
    \ set of algorithms nodes used \nto recognize the relationship between input data\
    \ through a \nprocess similar to human brain operations. Several NNs \nmake a\
    \ layer, more layers add to the depth, and more in-\ndepth generate Deep Learning\
    \ which is discussed further \nin this section. \n \nTable 7: An overview of the\

    \ techniques on \nhuge data sets, ML also enables based the ability to learn \n\

    \ programmed, these models are \nused as a basis for making future predictions\
    \ on the new \ninput data [15]. In actuality, the depth of a neural \nnetwork—the\
    \ number of node layers—is what defines a \ndeep learning method, which needs\
    \ more than three \nlayers. The discipline of Machine Learning is a subset of\
    \ \nArtificial  \nIntelligence is concerned with the capability of \ncomputer\
    \ systems or machines to improve their \nperformance automatically throughout\
    \ their experience \n[56]. Deep artificial neural networks, such as recurrent\
    \ \nneural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural \nnetworks (CNNs), are a specific\
    \ family of machine \nlearning algorithms that convert input data into output\
    \  \nTable 8: Differences between ML and DL \nthrough multiple layers of non-linear\
    \ transformation. \nTable 8: Multiple deep-learning solutions are already \nutilized\
    \ in IoT forensics [43]. \nA branch of artificial intelligence called machine\
    \ \nlearning focuses on making computers capable of \ncompleting tasks without\
    \ user intervention. Data that is \norganized into rows and columns is sent to\
    \ the \ncomputers. A computer can continuously accept fresh \ndata after it has\
    \ been programmed, sort it, and take action \non it without additional human input.\
    \ Even if you quit \nlabeling your data over time, the computer could \neventually\
    \ be able to recognize each sample. The core of \nmachine learning is what is\
    \ known as \"self-reliance.\" \nOnly a small portion of machine learning includes\
    \ \ndeep learning. In terms of how each algorithm learns and \nhow much data each\
    \ type of algorithm consumes, the \nfollowing presents the main areas where they\
    \ differ. The \nconcept of DL was proposed by Hinton based on the deep \nbelief\
    \ network (DBN), in which an unsupervised greedy \nlayer-by-layer training algorithm\
    \ is proposed that \nprovides hope for solving the optimization problem of \n\
    deep structure. Then, the deep structure of a multi-layer \nautomatic encoder\
    \ is proposed [57]. Much of the feature \nextraction portion of the process is\
    \ automated via deep \nlearning, which reduces the need for manual human \ninteraction.\
    \ Large data sets can also be used due to it.  \n \nFigure 8: AI taxonomy \nThe\
    \ majority of data in an organization is thought \nto be unstructured, and deep\
    \ learning can handle \nunstructured data correctly. Traditional, or \"non-\n\
    deep,\" machine learning is more reliant on human \ninput. To grasp the distinctions\
    \ between different data \nsources, human specialists create a hierarchy of \n\
    attributes, often learning from more structured data.  \nA labeled dataset is\
    \ not always necessary for \"deep\" \nmachine learning. It can take in unstructured\
    \ data and \nautomatically identify the features that set one sample \napart from\
    \ the others. \nAs a result, Both ML and DL are types of AI. \nMachine learning,\
    \ in essence, is AI that can \nautonomously adapt with little assistance from\
    \ \nhumans. While deep learning is a type of machine \nlearning to simulate the\
    \ way the human brain learns. \nAnd Table VIII lists the differences between ML\
    \ and \nDL in simple words. \n \nSome of the security-related real-world applications\
    \ \nof ML are as follows [15]: \n• Face recognition for forensics: pose, lighting,\
    \ \nocclusion (glasses, beard), make-up, hairstyle, etc. \n• Character recognition\
    \ for security encryption: \ndifferent handwriting styles. \n• Malicious \ncode\
    \ \nidentification: \nidentifying \nmalicious code in applications and software.\
    \ \n• Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) detection: \ndetecting DDoS attacks\

    \  \nThere are four types of machine learning: supervised, \nunsupervised, \n\
    Semi-supervised, \nand \nreinforcement \nlearning. It is different types to handle\
    \ all kinds of \ntargets. The data are huge, and we use machine learning \nbecause\
    \ it allows us to cover a large amount of data, learn \nand make predictions,\
    \ find patterns, or classify data. In \nthese highly dynamic times, a wide variety\

    \ problems in the real world. The \nautomatic, self-correcting ml algorithms will\
    \ get better \nover time.  \nIn its simplest form, machine learning relies on\
    \ pre-\nprogrammed algorithms that take input data and analyse \nit to estimate\
    \ output values that fall within a certain \nrange. These algorithms learn from\
    \ fresh data as it is \ngiven to them, optimizing their processes to increase\
    \ \nperformance and gaining \"intelligence\" over time. One of \nthe most popular\
    \ examples of ML is Covid-19. During \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, many studies have\
    \ been \nconducted to explore ML in fighting against the virus to \nsave many\
    \ lives [58]. \n1.   Supervised learning: Supervised learning in \nmachine learning\
    \ use a labeled dataset in training \nthe ML model with labeled input to expect\
    \ the \noutput. Supervised learning keeps comparing the \ncorrect output with\
    \ its output, and the process is \nstill repeated until the model gets the best\
    \ \naccuracy. Based on whether target labels are \ndiscrete or numeric, the learning\
    \ process is \ndefined \nas \nclassification \nand \nregression, \nrespectively\
    \ [59]. \n2.  Unsupervised learning: Unsupervised learning used \nunlabeled datasets\
    \ to find the missing dataset and \nunknown relationships by grouping similar\
    \ data \ninto clusters. In unsupervised learning the machine \nwill figure out\
    \ the output without telling the \npattern, the output will be classified depending\
    \ on \nits similar features using different algorithms. \n3. \nReinforcement learning:\
    \ Reinforcement learning \nis between supervised and unsupervised learning; \n\
    it has no labeled information as input, but it works \nwith reward values. It\
    \ involves Learning by \nobservation of the environment to self-train \ncontinually\
    \ using trial and error. Examples of RL \nare Q-Learning and Deep QLearning [60].\
    \ They \nare trial-and-error learning algorithms; in which \ntraining is done\
    \ through data collected from the \nenvironment [61]. We have two main methods\
    \ for \nreinforcement learning:  \n \n \n \nFigure 9: Top Search Terms from IEEE\
    \ Xplore [65]. \n- Policy search: This is the search for an optimal \npolicy using\
    \ gradient-based or gradient-free methods. \nFor example, Google's Alpha Go is\
    \ based on policy \nsearch and can learn without any human intervention or \n\
    interaction and still achieves superiority [59]. \n- Value function approximation:\
    \ This method estimates \nthe expected rewards of actions and attempts to reach\
    \ \nan optimized learning process and results. The key \ncomponent of the value\
    \ function is the state-action \nvalue function, known as the quality function\
    \ [62]. \n \n7.3 \nML and DL in IoT security \nAfter the big growth in IoT applications\
    \ and devices \nand after being surrounded by varies vulnerabilities, it \nbecomes\
    \ harder to secure those systems with humans, \nML techniques play an important\
    \ role in regular and IoT \nnetworks security. Considering the various vulnerabilities\
    \ \nin the IoT domain, ML algorithms are widely being used \nto tackle the potential\
    \ Issues [226]. The requirements for \nsecuring IoT devices have become complex\
    \ because \nseveral technologies, from physical devices and wireless \ntransmission\
    \ to mobile and cloud architectures, need to \nbe secured and combined with other\
    \ technologies. The \nadvancement in ML and DL has allowed for the \ndevelopment\
    \ of various powerful analytical methods that \ncan be used to enhance IoT security\
    \ [6]. IoT devices \ndepend on big data, and the most prevalent methods for \n\
    dealing with big data analytics are machine learning and \ndeep learning methods.\
    \ Machine learning refers to the \ndeployment of artificial intelligence (AI)\
    \ to teach a \nmachine (a computer system) by exploring patterns and \ndiscovering\
    \ inferences among unclassified training data \nwithout the use of explicitly\
    \ programmed instructions \n[63]. \nML algorithms build behavioral models using\
    \ \nmathematical expression techniques on enormous data \nsets. Without explicit\
    \ programming, ML can empower \nsmart devices to learn. Based on new input data,\
    \ these \nmodels serve as a source for future predictions [35]. Not \nonly ML\
    \ but also DL and AI, in general, are getting \nexpanded rapidly in cybersecurity\
    \ fields, especially in the \nearly detection and prediction in different domains\
    \ such \nas malware detection in references [33] to [180], DOD/ \nDDOS detection\
    \ in [109] to [122], intrusion detection as \nin references [158] to [165], spam\
    \ detection as in [167], \nand BOTNET detection in references [179] to [192].\
    \ \nMore details are in Table 5 which overviews different \nkinds of detection\
    \ systems in the IoT environment. \n20 \nInformatica 47 (2023) 1–54 \nk. Harahsheh\
    \ et al. \nThe Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a typical \nsystem designed\
    \ to monitor protected networks and \nsystems for malicious activities and is\
    \ an important \napproach \nto \nprotecting \ncyber \ninfrastructures \nand \n\
    enforcing system security [59], Figure (10) from [64] \nproposed intrusion detection\
    \ and response methodology. \nIDSs can also be categorized into active and passive\
    \ \ndetection systems. Passive detection systems send an \nalarm to the network\
    \ administrator when an attack is \ndetected. Then, action is required by the\
    \ administrator to \nlook at and decide the appropriate decision. On the other\
    \ \nhand, active detection systems are responsible for \ndetecting attacks and\
    \ taking automatic and immediate \naction to stop or mitigate the impact of the\
    \ attacks by \nexecuting a predefined script [54]. IoT devices can apply \nsupervised\
    \ learning techniques to evaluate the runtime \nbehaviors of the apps in malware\
    \ detection. In the \nmalware detection scheme as developed, an IoT device \n\
    uses K-NNs and random forest classifiers to build the \nmalware-detection model\
    \ [8]. \nYet no unified IoT security standards have been \ndeveloped. Various\
    \ organizations, such as IEEE and \nETSI, attempt to create IoT slandered for\
    \ security [17]. \nML techniques can address the scarcity available of \nrequired\
    \ personnel with expertise in these niche \ncybercrime detection technologies.\
    \ Moreover, vigorous \napproaches are needed to detect and react against the \n\
    cyberattacks of the new generation (automated and \nevolutionary) [1]. \nAL, ML,\
    \ and DL are quick solutions against multiple \nkinds of attacks, they can learn\
    \ from labeled datasets or \nfrom experiences and environments for new attacks\
    \ \nwhich are not listed before in the dataset. Technology is \ndaily updated\
    \ but at the same time attacks and new \nvulnerabilities are daily generated,\
    \ and this is the \nadvantage to use ML in such solutions to predict new \nattacks.\
    \ Figure (9) shows how much AI, ML, and Dl \ntrends in the cybersecurity field\
    \ in the IEEE Xplore \nsearch. We can notice how they become more popular in \n\
    the last decades. \nCurrently, ML and DL can be used and achieve \nsuccess in\
    \ all cybersecurity areas, especially in Big Data \nwhich is mostly created from\
    \ the IoT sensing \nenvironments. DL works better with huge datasets with \nno\
    \ need for human decisions. AI-based systems give \nbetter performance than traditional\
    \ AI detection systems \nand reduce the investigation time. Machine learning \n\
    algorithms have improved and solved many open \nchallenges and problems such as\
    \ resource control and \nlocation in IoT networks [2]. Traditional cybersecurity\
    \ \nsystems are weak in automation, and they mostly depend \non humans and some\
    \ static rules. This makes ML and DL \nsolutions an interesting area for people\
    \ who search for \nautomotive cybersecurity systems which take decisions \nautomatically\
    \ through experience. \n \n \nFigure 10: Proposed intrusion detection and response\
    \ \nmethodology [64]. \n• \nLinear Regression (LR): it is a supervised \nlearning\
    \ method for regression problems and to find the \nrelationship between variables.\
    \ LR predicts a dependent \n(y) based on independent (x). \nLearning algorithms\
    \ improve the prediction through \nlearning from training, for example classifying\
    \ new \ntraffic to be normal or abnormal from training previous \nbehaviors similar\
    \ to references [123] to [137], [141], and \n[204]. \n \n7.4 \nFrequently used\
    \ ML and DL techniques  \nUnder this title, we discuss different types of ML \n\
    algorithms including supervised, unsupervised, semi-\nsupervised, and reinforcement\
    \ learning as listed in Figure \n(11). ML algorithms help solve problems as they\
    \ are \nautomated and develop themselves over time to get \nsmarter. Machine learning\
    \ algorithms functions can \ndiscover hidden patterns in data, predict results,\
    \ and \nenhance performance based on past performance. Those \nalgorithms are\
    \ various depending on the tasks, such as \nprediction and classification problems.\
    \ \n- Supervised learning / classification problems: \n• \nSupport Vector Regression\
    \ (SVR): SVM is a \nsupervised machine learning algorithm that can \nbe used for\
    \ both classifications of data and \nregression analysis, but mostly in classification\
    \ \nproblems [66]. SVR is similar to SVM but with a \nfew differences. SVR works\
    \ with continuous \nvalues in regression problems while SVM works \nproperly in\
    \ classification problems. \n \n \n \n \n \nA Survey of Using Machine Learning\

    \ 47 (2023) 1–54 \n21 \n• \nDecision Tree (DT) is a supervised ML algorithm \n\
    for classification problems. It makes decisions \nbased on simple decision rules\
    \ learned from \ntraining data. The pros of using this algorithm are \nit is simple\
    \ to interpret and can handle the \nmissing value in data well as in Figure (13).\
    \ The \ncons are it is prone to overfitting and unstable \n[67]. \n \n \nFigure\
    \ 11: ML and DL techniques. \n• \nRandom Forest (RF) is a supervised ML \nclassification\
    \ algorithm that consists of a large \nnumber of DTs discussed above, and because\
    \ of \nthat, it is called Forest. Each tree in the RF \nconsists of a class, and\
    \ the class which gets the \nhighest number of votes becomes the model \nprediction\
    \ for the problem, as shown in Figure \n(14). \n• \nSupport \nVector \nMachine\
    \ \n(SVM): \nThe \noptimization \nobjective \nof \nSupport \nVector \nMachine\
    \ (SVM) is to maximize the distance \nbetween adjacent margins between the separating\
    \ \nhyperplane (decision boundary) and the training \nsamples that are closest\
    \ to this hyperplane [68]. \nSVM is a supervised ML model for solving \nclassification\
    \ problems using labeled data. The \nline in the model is the decision boundary\
    \ where \nanything that falls on the first side belongs to \ncategory 1, and the\
    \ other side is category 2 as in \nFigure (15). \n• \nNaïve Bayes (NB): It is\
    \ a supervised learning \nalgorithm, not a single algorithm. It is a family of\
    \ \nalgorithms based on Bayes’ theorem, all the \nBayes algorithms have a common\
    \ principle, and \ntheir results are classified independently of each \nother.\
    \ \n \n• \nK- Nearest Neighbor (KNN): The simplest ML \nalgorithm for supervised\
    \ classification problems. \nKNN categorization process works in the \nsimilarity\
    \ between the new data and the existing \ndataset by calculating the Euclidean\
    \ distance \nbetween the new data point and the categories, \nwhere the nearest\
    \ is the category that belongs to \nit, as in Figure (16). The k-nearest-neighbor\
    \ \n(KNN) anomaly detection is one of the most \ncommonly \nused \ndistance-based\
    \ \nanomaly \ndetection methods. It is a simple technique that \nworks out of\
    \ the box in most cases and detects \nglobal anomalies precisely [69]. \n• \n\
    Euclidean distance between \n \n• \nNeural Network (NN): An artificial intelligence\
    \ \ntechnique called a neural network allows \ncomputers to analyze data in a\
    \ manner similar to \nthe human brain. NN is built by many neurons or \nnodes\
    \ gathered in a layered framework. It has \ndifferent branches depending on the\
    \ task we \nwant to solve, the NN types are: \n1. Artificial Neural Network (ANN):\
    \ it is a branch \nof neural network where the data trained forward \npass and\
    \ vice versa cycles. ANN is easy to use where \nthe activation value is counted\
    \ in all nodes within all \nlayers including the hidden and the output layer;\
    \ this \nis why the activation value affects the classifier \nperformance. \n\
    2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): it is a \nnetwork architecture for DL which\
    \ learns from data, \nit is commonly used for image recognition, \nprocessing,\
    \ and classification as in Figure (17). \n3. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): it\
    \ is a type of \nartificial neural network that has different hidden \nlayers\
    \ and is used in speech recognition and natural \nlanguage processing. Some layers\
    \ in RNN are used \nas memory locations to store results during the \nprocess\
    \ in a loop.  \n4. Deep Belief Network (DBN):  It is a class of \ndeep neural\
    \ network, it has multiple hidden layers \nwith different units, and all units\
    \ interact together \nthrough connections.  \n- \nUnsupervised learning problems:\
    \  \n• K-means: it is an unsupervised ML algorithm for \nsolving clustering problems\
    \ for unlabeled datasets. K-\nmeans groups the unlabeled data into k different\
    \ clusters \nwhere all the data in each cluster are similar to each \nother as\
    \ in Figure (18). \n• K modes: k-modes unsupervised learning used \nclustering\
    \ to categorize variables. It creates clusters \ndepending on the matching and\
    \ similarity between data \npoints.  \n• Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications\
    \ \nwith Noise (DBScan): it is an unsupervised learning \nmethod used to separate\
    \ data points into clusters \ndifferent in size and shape. \n• Principal Component\
    \ Analysis (PCA): it is an \nunsupervised learning algorithm used to decrease\
    \ the \nnumber of features in the dataset without affecting the \nuseful information.\
    \  \n• Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA): it is an \nunsupervised learning algorithm\
    \ but not a clustering \nalgorithm because it does not generate new clusters but\
    \ \ndistribution groups from the big data.  \n \n• Gaussian Discriminant Analysis\
    \ (GDA): it is a \nlearning algorithm used to find the distribution \n22 \nInformatica\
    \ 47 (2023) 1–54 \nk. Harahsheh et al. \nfor the classes. It is commonly used\
    \ for the data \nthat can be distributed and fit to Gaussian \ndistribution. \n\
    - Reinforcement learning problems:  \n• Q-Learning: it is a Reinforcement learning\
    \ \nalgorithm based on values learning. Q-Learning \nhas an agent used to deal\
    \ with the environment \n\"as input\" and take actions \"as output.\" It also\
    \ \nuses a Q-table containing rows and columns to \nhelp the agent in the next\
    \ movement.    \n• Deep Q-Learning: it is similar to Q-learning but \nthe main\
    \ difference is that Deep Q-learning uses \na neural network instead of a Q-table.\
    \ \n• Double Q-Learning: it is a reinforcement \nlearning double faster than Q-learning\
    \ by \nreducing \noverestimation \nproblems \nwith \ntraditional Q-learning. \n\
    Most reliable ML systems in intrusion detection use \nseveral techniques and vote\
    \ for the most usable one as in \nFigure (21) to get the best output.   \n \n\
    Figure 12: Intrusion detection system process. \n7.5 \nModel selection and evaluation\
    \ metrics \nModel Selection and Evaluation is a very important \nstep in the machine\
    \ learning process to analyze the \nmodel. Model evaluation is the way to estimate\
    \ the \ncorrectness of the model over the test data which has not \nbeen applied\
    \ in the model before, while model selection \nis the method to select the best\
    \ model for the data after \ncomparing \nmultiple \nmodels \nand \nchecking \n\
    their \nperformance. We do model evaluation and selection to \nget the best predicts\
    \ results and increase the accuracy \nlevels to a higher percentage and this is\

    \ In \nclassification problems, we classify data into a finite \nnumber of classes.\

    meaning of each value  in the cybersecurity field which \nthen follows with the\
    \ equations and the idea of each one: \n- \nTrue Positive (TP): In general TP\
    \ is the number \nof outcomes where the model success to predicts the \npositive\
    \ class. In the cyber security field, TP is the \nnumber of normal network traffic\
    \ that is not attacked and \nis correctly classified by the model (Predicted True\
    \ and \nTrue in reality). \nTable 11: Confusion matrix \n \nActual \n \nPredicte\n\

    False Negative \n(FN) \nTrue Negative \n(TN) \nR2 \n \n \nC1 \nC2 \n \n- \nTrue\
    \ Negative (TN): in general, TN is the \nnumber of correct results for the negative\
    \ class. In the \ncyber security field, TN is the count of results when the \n\
    network flow is classified as an attack, and it is an attack \n(Predicted False\
    \ and False in reality). \n- \nFalse Positive (FP):  in general, FP is the \n\
    number of outcomes where the model incorrectly predicts \nthe positive class.\
    \ In the cyber security field, FP is also \ncalled a False alarm where the network\
    \ flow predicts to \nbe an attack, but it is not an attack but a normal traffic\
    \ \n(Predicted True and False in reality). \n- \nFalse Negative (FN): in general,\
    \ FN is the \nnumber of outcomes where the model incorrectly predicts \nthe negative\
    \ class. In the cyber security field, FN is the \nnumber of network flows that\
    \ predicts to be normal, but, \nunfortunately, it is abnormal (attack), and this\
    \ is a \nvulnerability in the system to allow abnormal traffic to \nflow in the\
    \ system, device, or network (Predicted False \nand True in reality). \nThe hold-out\
    \ method is the simplest and easiest way to \nevaluate the model, this method\
    \ split the data into two \nsets, one called the training set and the other one\
    \ is the \nTest set. The flowchart in Figure (23) explains the \nprocess of Hold-Out.\
    \ The hold-out process has four main \nsteps, step 1 is to split the data randomly,\
    \ and most of the \ntime the split ratio is 2/3. We keep test data aside and \n\
    work with the training part. After this, we go to step 2 in \nwhich we chose a\
    \ learning algorithm with specific \nhyperparameter values which we think may\
    \ be \nappropriate for the problem and then run the model. In \nstep 3 we use\
    \ test data to evaluate the model, find out the \nperformance and the model accuracy\
    \ and bring the results \nto the final step. In step 4, which is the last step,\
    \ we \ncheck if the model scores are good enough to solve the \nproblem. If yes,\
    \ we keep it as the final model, and if not, \nwe change the hyperparameter values,\
    \ select another \nlearning algorithm, and run the model again, and so on \nuntil\
    \ we find the best values.  \nThe neural networks can successfully classify multiple\
    \ \nclass classification problems by automatically learning \ntheir features via\
    \ neural nodes at each hidden layer and \nclassifying the input at the output\
    \ layer [70]. Model \nevaluation and selecting the best model in Hold-out and\
    \ \nany other methods depend on different scores which are \nthe results of doing\
    \ some calculations on confusion \nmatrix terms as in the following evaluation\
    \ equations:  \n1. Accuracy is the most popular evaluation metric, and \nit refers\
    \ to how the model correctly classifies the data; it \nis the ratio of correct\
    \ predictions to all data in the dataset. \nIf we go back to the network traffic\
    \ example, the model \nwill work well if it can classify normal traffic (positive\
    \ \nclass) and abnormal traffic (negative class) correctly. \nA Survey of Using\
    \ Machine Learning in IoT Security and the…                                  \
    \                Informatica 47 (2023) 1–54 \n27 \n \n2) \nError Rate is also\
    \ called Misclassification, and it \nis the opposite of accuracy. While accuracy\
    \ is the \ncorrectly classified data, the error rate is the incorrect \nclassified\
    \ data, and it is the ratio of incorrect predictions \nto all data in the dataset.\
    \ In the cyber security network \ntraffic example, the error rate is the number\
    \ of normal \ntraffic that is classified as abnormal and vice versa. \n \n \n\
    Figure 23: Hold-out processes. \n3) \nit is also called positive predictive value;\
    \ it is all \nabout YES (positive), it is the ratio between data \ncorrectly classified\
    \ positive (normal traffic) to the total \nnumber of data classified positive,\
    \ even if it is correct or \nnot (normal traffic + abnormal classified as normal).\
    \ \n \nThe precision increase when the nominator is huge \ncompared with the denominator,\
    \ which means it is \nincrease when the model results in a lot of correct \npositive\
    \ classified data, and when the model makes the \nleast amount of incorrect positive\
    \ classification. Because \nof this precision is more accurate than accuracy to\
    \ decide \nthe model performance. Precision reflects the reliability \nof the\
    \ model in classifying positive data. \n4) \nRecall, or Sensitivity, is also called\
    \ True \nPositive Rate (TPR), and it refers to the ratio of positive \nclassified\
    \ data to all positive data including missed \npositive predictions (FN). While\
    \ precision care about \ncorrect positive classified data out of positive predictions\
    \ \nonly, recall cares about the same plus the missed ones. \n \nWhen to use precision\
    \ or recall? This depends on the \nkind of problem you want to solve. In cybersecurity\
    \ \nproblems, which are more sensitive than other problem, \nrecall is used. It\
    \ is OK if you miss one of the cat photos \nwhen the model puts it with raccoons’\
    \ groups, but it is a \nbig problem to miss one attack traffic, add it to the\
    \ \nnormal traffic group, and let it flow in your network. So, \nin my opinion,\
    \ I prefer to select a model with higher \nrecall scores in most of the cybersecurity\
    \ problems. \n5) \nFalse Negative Rate (FNR): Also called the \n(Miss Rate). It\
    \ is the proportion of incorrectly classified \npositive samples to all positive\
    \ samples. \n \n6) \nFalse Positive Rate (FPR): Also called the (Fall \nOut).\
    \ It is the proportion of incorrectly classified negative \nsamples to all negative\
    \ samples \n \nIn addition, we can write the FPR equations as:  \n \n7) \nFalse\
    \ Discovery Rate (FDR): it is the ratio \nbetween incorrect classified data to\
    \ the total of negative \nsamples in the whole dataset. The lower result for FDR\
    \ \ndescribes better performance. \n \n8) \nFalse Omission Rate (FOR): it is the\
    \ ratio \nbetween incorrectly classified positive data to the total of \npositive\
    \ samples in the whole dataset. The lower result \nfor FOR describes better performance.\
    \ \n \n9) \nF1 Score: it is a harmonic combination of \nprecision and recall into\
    \ a single metric to measure the \nmodel accuracy. This measure will be helpful\
    \ if the user \nseeks a balance between recall and precision, and the \nsample\
    \ distribution is an uneven class distribution. A \nhigher value of the F1-score\
    \ shows the ML model is \nperforming better than other models [1]. \n \n10) \n\
    Specificity: it is also called True Negative Rate \n(TNR), it is the opposite\
    \ of recall, while recall is the ratio \nof positive classified data to all positive\
    \ data including \nmissed positive predictions (FN), Specificity is the ratio\
    \ \nof negative classified data to all negative data include \nmissed negative\
    \ predictions (FP). \n \n11) \nG-mean: it is also called the geometric mean, it\
    \ \nis calculated using the correct classified data, G-mean is \nmore powerful\
    \ and helpful in accuracy when the number \nof negative data is huge compared\
    \ with positive data, and \n28 \nInformatica 47 (2023) 1–54 \nk. Harahsheh et\
    \ al. \nin this case, G-mean is more correct to describe the \nmodel performance\
    \ than the accuracy. \n \n \n12) \nMatthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC): It\
    \ is \nthe relationship between the predicted classes and the \nfundamental truth.\
    \ MCC is commonly recognized as a \nbalanced measure that can be applied even\
    \ when the \nclasses are in various sizes. \n \n13) \nReceiver \nOperating \n\
    Characteristics \n(ROC) \nCurve: The TPR and FPR trade-off is represented \ngraphically\
    \ by the ROC curve as in Figure (24). We \ncompute TPR and FPR for each threshold\
    \ and plot them \non a single graph. The better, the greater TPR and the \nlower\
    \ FPR for each threshold. The AUC score, which is \nfound in the region below\
    \ the ROC curve, expresses how \neffective the ROC curve is. Both ROC and AUC\
    \ scores \ndemonstrate how well the model ranks predictions. \n14) \nPRC Area\
    \ (Precision-Recall Curve Area): \nPositive Predictive Value (precision) and TPR\
    \ are \ncombined to create the PRC curve as in Figure (24). \nPositive Predictive\
    \ Value and TPR are computed for each \nthreshold, and the appropriate graph point\
    \ is presented.  \nA higher AUC indicates a good PRC curve. \n \n \nFigure 24:\
    \ ROC and precision-recall curves under class \nskew. In (a) and (b), the test\
    \ set has a balanced 1:1 class \ndistribution. Graphs (c) and (d) show the same\
    \ two \nclassifiers on the same domain, but the number of \nnegative instances\
    \ has increased tenfold [23]. \n15) \nArea Under Curve (AUC): The area under ROC\
    \ \nis measured by the AUC, which ranges from 0.5 to 1.0. A \nhigher AUC value\
    \ indicates that a classifier is performing \nbetter. \n16) \nLog Loss: it is\
    \ also called Cross-entropy. How \nclosely the prediction value matches the true\
    \ value is \nindicated by log-loss. The log-loss result is 0 or 1 in case \nof\
    \ binary classifications. Lower the log-loss result shows \nbetter predicted.\
    \ \n \nWhere n is the number of observations, is the given \nrecord, y is the\
    \ true value, and ŷ is the prediction \nprobability for this formula and all other\
    \ ones. \n \n Gini Coefficient: it is calculating the probability \nof a specific\
    \ value which misclassified when it is \nrandomly selected. It is similar to the\
    \ range of log-loss, \nGini values between 0 and 1. Where 0 shows the purity \n\
    of the classification model. Gini is the sum of squared \nprobabilities for each\
    \ class. \n \nWhere Pi is the probability of an element being \nclassified for\
    \ a distinct class. \n \n18) \nMean Square Error (MSE): It is one of the \n“Metrics\
    \ for Regression” which is calculated by \naveraging the squared difference or\
    \ error between the \nclassifier's actual and predicted values. MSE is popular\
    \ \nbecause it is simple, continuous, and separable. Taking \ninto account one\
    \ significant outlier may result in a \nmassive value, which can result in significant\
    \ errors. A \nlower MSE value is preferable and indicates better \nclassifier\
    \ performance. \n \nWhere n is the total number of samples, and Squared \nError\
    \ = (yi- ŷi)2 \n \n19) \nRoot MSE (RMSE): It is calculated by taking \nthe square\
    \ root of the MSE. A lower RMSE value is \npreferable and indicates better classifier\
    \ performance. \n \n20) \nMean Absolute Error (MAE): MAE calculates \nthe mean\
    \ of the absolute difference between prediction \nand actual data returned, where\
    \ the outlier values in the \ntrain set have no effect on MAE. This metric can\
    \ be \ncalculated by taking the average of the absolute \ndifference or error\
    \ that occurred between the actual \nvalues and predicted values of the classifier.\
    \ A lower \nvalue of MAE is desirable and shows better performance \nof a classifier\
    \ [1]. \n \n21) \nMean Bias Error (MBE): bias in \"Mean Bias \nError is a tendency\
    \ of a measuring technique to \nA Survey of Using Machine Learning in IoT Security\
    \ and the…                                                  Informatica 47 (2023)\
    \ 1–54 \n29 \noverestimate or underestimate the value of a parameter.  \nBias\
    \ only has one direction and can be in either a positive \nor negative direction,\
    \ a positive one indicates an \noverestimation of the data error, whereas a negative\
    \ bias \nindicates an underestimation of the data error. Taking the \nmean of\
    \ the difference between the expected values and \nthe true values is known as\
    \ the mean bias error (MBE). \nWith the help of this evaluation metric, the total\
    \ bias is \nquantified, as well as the typical bias in the forecast. The \nonly\
    \ difference between it and MAE is that the MAE \ntakes the absolute is considered.\
    \ It is important to use \ncaution when using this evaluation metric because \n\
    positive and negative errors might cancel one another out. \n \n \n \nFigure 25:\
    \ Mean Square Error (MSE). \n \n22) \nMean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): It\
    \ is \nalso called The Mean Absolute Percentage Deviation \n(MAPD), and it is\
    \ just the difference between the \nobserved and the real value. It is calculated\
    \ by dividing \nthe absolute error by the actual data. The relative error is \n\
    then multiplied by 100 to produce the percentage error. \nThe lower MAPE value\
    \ shows better performance. \n \n23) \nRelative Absolute Error (RAE): It is calculated\
    \ \nby dividing the total absolute error by the absolute \ndifference between\
    \ the mean and the actual value. \n \nWhere ȳ is the mean of the n actual values,\
    \ and its \nformula is: \n \n24) \nRelative Squared Error (RSE): it is calculated\
    \ by \ndividing MSE over the square of the difference between \nthe true value\
    \ and the mean of the whole data. \n \n25) \nRoot Relative Squared Error (RRSE):\
    \ It is \ncalculated by taking the square root of the RSE. \n \n26) \nRelative\
    \ Root Mean Squared Error (RRMSE): is \nthe RMSE normalized by the RMS. The difference\
    \ \nbetween RRMSE and RMSE is that the RMSE is \nrestricted with original measurements\
    \ and each predicted \nvalue is scaled against the true value, but in RRMSE \n\
    there are different measurement methods. The lower \nRRMSE is the better for model\
    \ accuracy, and when \nRRMSE increases, it means your predictions are \ninaccurate.\
    \ \n \n27) \nit is the root of the difference between the log \nfor actual values\
    \ and the log for predicted values. \nRMSLE is important because it is handled\
    \ the outliers \nand treated them even though they are large outliers or \nsmall.\
    \ \n \n28) \nR-squared (R2): it is an evaluation method for \nlinear regression;\
    \ used to calculate how close are the \npredicted data to the fitted line. R2\
    \ shows the ratio of the \ntotal difference between data points and the filling\
    \ line, in \naddition to the total difference for the data from the \nmean. \n\
    \ \nWhere SSR is the Some Squared Regression error, \nSST is the Sum Squared Total\
    \ Error as shown in. \n \n \nFigure 26: R-squared calculation. \n29) \nKappa statistic\
    \ - Cohen's Kappa coefficient (k): \nIt is applied to evaluate the model's predicted\
    \ labels to the \nactual labels in the data, so it shows how many data or \nrecords\
    \ classified by the ML model are matching the true \none. K result ranges from\
    \ -1 (worst performance) to 1 \n(best \nperformance). \nIn \nthe \nproblem \n\
    of \nbinary \nclassification pe = pe1 + pe2; pe1 - the probability that \nthe\
    \ predictions agree randomly with the actual values of \nclass 1 - \"good\"; pe2\
    \ - the probability that the predictions \nagree randomly with the actual values\
    \ of class 2 - \n\"accidentally\". The assumption is that the two classifiers\
    \ \n(model \nprediction \nand \nactual \nclass \nvalue) \nare \nindependent. In\
    \ this case, the probabilities pe1 and pe2 \n30 \nInformatica 47 (2023) 1–54 \n\
    k. Harahsheh et al. \nare calculated by multiplying the share of things in the\
    \ \nclass and the share of the predicted class [72]. \n \n \n \n8  \nList of ML\
    \ and DL challenges in \nIoT security and current solutions \nIn many IoT systems\
    \ and applications, machine \nlearning (ML) techniques are essential to recognize\
    \ the \ncyber-attack in those systems. However, there remain \nmajor difficulties\
    \ and challenges in guaranteeing the \nreliability of ML techniques in cyberspace,\
    \ there are \nmany ML weaknesses and vulnerabilities that may use by \nbad hackers\
    \ to damage the systems. Understanding which \nmethods are suitable for protecting\
    \ IoT systems is a \nchallenge because of the extensive variety of IoT \napplications\
    \ and scenarios [17]. This survey has many \ntargets but the most important one\

    \ The difficulties of using \nML approaches to cyber security are fully covered\

    \ ML techniques is that \nit needs enough amounts of data while training the \n\
    module, Shaukat et al. 2020 [1] suggest using multiple \nGPUs, which is neither\
    \ a power-efficient nor cost-\neffective solution and must have powerful and robust\
    \ ML \ntechniques that are specifically designed to deal with \nsecurity attacks\
    \ and handle adversarial inputs instead of \nhaving traditional ML techniques.\
    \ On the other hand, \nOne ML model cannot detect all attacks, so securing a \n\
    full environment means having multiple ML models to \nhandle all possible cyber-attack.\
    \ These challenges include \nthe generation of labeled data required for the effective\
    \ \ntraining of the model because a network traffic dataset is \nmulti-part and\
    \ irregular [17].  \nMalware exists in a way that can be copied to 3 \nmillion\
    \ new samples in an hour, and some new attacks \nare able to bypass end-point\
    \ detection and can be \nlaunched at variable rates [209]. Toward solving some\
    \ of \nthe aforementioned issues, potential solutions include \nusing high-dimensional\
    \ data and incremental learning for \nnon-stationary data. Using high-dimensional\
    \ data can \nincrease model complexity, accuracy, and diversity of the \nA Survey\
    \ of Using Machine Learning in IoT Security and the…                         \

    malware \nfingerprinting \n[59]. \nHigh-\ndimensional data solve the huge growth\
    \ in malware new \nrecords, but at the same time it may affect the training \n\
    and testing speed, researchers try to solve this problem \nfor example Liang et\
    \ al. [210] investigated an online \nlearning strategy that utilized slices of\
    \ continuous data to \nupdate machine learning models to fit the new datasets\
    \ \ndynamically. On the other hand, distributed learning ML \nmethods can also\
    \ handle this problem, like what the \nresearchers improve in [211] after designing\
    \ and \ndeploying different distributed platforms and algorithms. \nAnother research\
    \ direction and future work are to \noptimize computing resource management as\
    \ in reference \n[212].  \nAuthors in [130] developed a solution to solve the\
    \ \nchallenge of anomaly detection which is done because of \nthe limitation in\
    \ anomaly data records. They developed \nan unsupervised the ANN (Artificial Neural\
    \ Network) \ndetection model based on the LSTM-based Auto-\nEncoder. The LSTM\
    \ cell can capture temporal \ndependencies in multivariate sensor data. The Auto-\n\
    Encoder network architecture is used to learn the normal \nbehavior without a\
    \ labeled dataset. Once the model is \nwell trained, the online evaluation data\
    \ is fed into our \nmodel as a set of sequences by a sliding window for real-\n\
    time anomaly detection. Finally, an alert is triggered \nwhen a time interval\
    \ is voted as an anomalous data point \nby the majority. Another way to solve\
    \ this problem is \nusing Bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTMs) instead of the \nregular\
    \ ones. BiLSTMs simply by running two different \nLSTMs - one going from start\
    \ to end and the other in the \nopposite direction, once the LSTMs finish moving\
    \ across \nthe sequence, the outputs obtained during the forward and \nbackward\
    \ LSTMs are combined for a final prediction \n[228]. \nThe openness of IoT and\
    \ the expansion of attack scale. \nOpenness is reflected in the various processes\
    \ of IoT \nsystems. IoT can obtain data from various fields, \nintegrate various\
    \ communication technologies and \nstandards, and provide open services for users\
    \ in various \nfields [22]. The massive data collected by sensors in CPS \nand\
    \ IoT can use wireless communications to exchange \nthe data as well as the data\
    \ can be used with AI/ML to \naddress the challenges associated with communications\
    \ \nin CPS/IoT, including communication-related issues [6]. \nNoisy Data Is a\
    \ Challenge for ML and DL Mechanisms: \nMost of the real-world data is embedded\
    \ with noise that \nnegatively affects the learning models used for \nclassification.\
    \ DL algorithms have better classification \ncapabilities as compared to traditional\
    \ ML algorithms; \nhowever, these algorithms are undermined by noisy data \n[15].\
    \ \nPreventing Zero-day attacks or “new attacks” is \nanother challenge for ML\
    \ in cyber-attack detection \nbecause ML techniques depend on training previous\
    \ \nfeatures on the datasets, while new attacks have different \nfeatures and\
    \ may not be detected in the same way. We \nmay depend on the behavior to detect\
    \ new attacks in the \nfuture, which means focusing more on unsupervised \nlearning\
    \ with unlabeled data, Bout et al. 2022 in [2] \ntalked about deduction of the\
    \ behavior of the IoT network \nto find the optimal strategy autonomously, but\
    \ they found \nthat only one attack responds to this motivation in the \nliterature\
    \ which is the jamming attacks. Data, in general, \nis a major challenge in ML.\
    \ Most datasets are out of data \nwith various numbers of features in each one\
    \ and, \nsometimes, it has no complete records. The number of \nfeatures and categories\
    \ for each dataset is different. Also, \ndataset shift is another problem where\
    \ the model was \ntrained and tested with different datasets, which may \navoid\
    \ by removing the leaked data or changing the \ntraining data. The key challenge\
    \ in malware data \naugmentation is to produce new samples that preserve \nadequate\
    \ data distribution for each class. This will \nimprove the classification accuracy\
    \ of DL methods since \nimproving the coverage of collected data translates to\
    \ \nbetter detection capabilities of new, and existing, \nmalware attacks [16].\
    \ \nHowever, the performance of DL-based methods \nstrongly depends on the quantity\
    \ and quality of the data \navailable [12]. Machine learning models have strict\
    \ \nrequirements for the sizes, shapes, and types of input \ndata, even though\
    \ CPS collects massive data, the quality \nof such data may not be guaranteed,\
    \ especially as the \nlifetime of newly created IoT hardware will be unverified\
    \ \n[59]. To fill the gap of need to truth and high-quality \ndatasets, [213]\
    \ is the first to propose a benchmarking data \nset containing vulnerable source\
    \ code collected from nine \nopen-source software projects written in C programming\
    \ \nlanguage. Their data set offers labels at two levels of \ngranularity i.e.,\
    \ the function level and the file level. \nHowever, their proposed data set is\
    \ still at the \npreliminary stage since it only consists of around 1400 \nvulnerable\
    \ functions and 1300 vulnerable files. \nAnother performance challenge is maintaining\
    \ the \nmodule performance over time. Most existing ML IDS \ngives high accuracy,\
    \ but they should be controlled over \ntime because of adding new data continuously.\
    \ Abdel \nWahab [233] discuss an online outlier detection \ntechnique that identifies\
    \ the outliers that diverge both \nfrom historical and temporally close data points.\
    \ His \nstudy was about an online deep neural network (DNN) \nthat dynamically\
    \ adjusts the sizes of the hidden layers \nbased on the Hedge weighting mechanism,\
    \ thus enabling \nthe model to steadily learn and adapt as new intrusion \ndata\
    \ come. the results suggest to his solution reduces the \nFP by approximately\
    \ 6% and FN by approximately 4.5%, \ncompared to the static DNN model. \nThe ML\
    \ challenges in IoT security are not only the \namount or the form of the data\
    \ but also the way to use \nthis data taking into account its privacy. Security\
    \ and \nprivacy are two of the main factors in the commercial \nrealization of\
    \ IoT services and applications [15]. Data \nsecurity and privacy are challenges\
    \ in processing and \nusing data. In the process of data collection and \ntransmission,\
    \ you may face the risk of leakage of privacy \n[22]. Fernandes et al. [214] focused\
    \ on similarities and \ndifferences in the security issues in IoT and traditional\
    \ IT \ndevices. Furthermore, they focused on privacy issues. \nThe main driving\
    \ factors to argue on the similarities and \ndifferences include software, hardware,\
    \ network, and \napplications. The existing security trade-offs, such as that\
    \ \n32 \nInformatica 47 (2023) 1–54 \nk. Harahsheh et al. \nbetween availability\
    \ and safety, are another challenge to \nthe achievement of a robust security\
    \ scheme for IoT \nsystems. Moreover, the importance of various security \ntrade-offs\
    \ differs from one IoT application to another. For \nexample, an IoMT system should\
    \ provide a security \nscheme, but it should also offer the flexibility of being\
    \ \naccessible in emergency situations [17]. \nMehedi et al. [229] solve the new\
    \ challenges with a \nsmall amount of data, they proposed in their paper a \n\
    dependable intrusion detection system for IoT. The \nunique contributions include\
    \ effective attribute selection, \nwhich is best suited to identify normal and\
    \ attack \nscenarios for a small amount of labeled data, designing a \ndependable\
    \ deep transfer learning based ResNet model, \nand evaluating considering real-world\
    \ data. Their model \nimproved the IDS performance compared with previous \nresearch.\
    \ The overall accuracy of the proposed detection \nmodel is 87%, ensuring dependability\
    \ and low time \ncomplexity. Moreover, the model greatly improves the \nprecision\
    \ score of 88%, the recall score of 86%, and the \nf1-score of 86%, which are\
    \ higher than the benchmark \nmodels. \n \nFigure 27: Overall scenario of the\
    \ proposed IDS applied \nto the heterogeneous IoT network [229]. \n \nFigure 28:\
    \ Overall architecture of Abdel Wahab solution. \n[233]. \nIoT has also an architecture\
    \ challenge because of using \nthe clouds. Because of the IoT limitations especially\
    \ in \ncapacity, it relays mostly on clouds, and this causes a \nnew challenge\
    \ in processing, storing, analyzing, and \ncontrolling the data. In the Cloud,\
    \ a wide range of \nsecurity challenges are observed due to two factors: \nmisconfiguration\
    \ in hardware equipment, and poorly \nsecured Cloud databases. These caused the\
    \ theft or \nleakage of 70 million records in 2018 [16]. It is worth \nmentioning\
    \ that cloud can be an essential part of the IoT \ninfrastructure due to several-fold\
    \ reasons: handling big \ndata, storing and processing huge amounts of data from\
    \ \nIoT, and producing end results for the respective \napplications in the IoT\
    \ environment [15]. To solve the \ncloud challenge, many researchers discuss an\
    \ “Embedded \nedge AI chip into the IoT devices”. \nMost traditional AI computing\
    \ tasks are performed \nremotely on centralized core devices or platforms, but\
    \ \nthis is not the best solution for IoT. Edge AI chips make \nit possible to\
    \ embed AI computations into IoT devices. \nAn Edge AI chip [215] is a chip that\
    \ can perform or \naccelerate machine learning tasks on edge devices. At \npresent,\
    \ Google, NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, and Huawei \nare all rapidly developing edge\
    \ AI chip technologies, \nsuch as Google Coral Edge TPU [216]. Edge AI chips \n\
    can also protect data privacy and security. The \ncalculations do not need to\
    \ send original data back to the \ncloud, which can greatly protect the security\
    \ and privacy \nof data and reduce the possibility of data leakage and \ninterception\
    \ or abuse of personal/corporate data [22]. \nThe next challenge is the huge number\
    \ of IoT \nresources \nthat \ncollect \ndifferent \nforms \nof \ndata. \nHeterogeneity\
    \ of IoT data accords when the data is \ncollected from numerous sources, which\
    \ forms a new \nchallenge for ML models. In addition, using multiple \nparameters\
    \ for module evaluation is one of the ML \ndifficulties Researchers in [2] suggest\
    \ considering an \nagreed standard set of metrics for the model's comparison \n\
    for further improvements. In the same paper, data privacy \nfor sensitive data\
    \ is considered a weak point during ML \ntraining and testing, and researchers\
    \ suggest randomly \ndividing the confidential values into several parts so that\
    \ \nthe opponent cannot deduce any information on the \nprivate value with a single\
    \ element. Machine learning \nalgorithms themselves have vulnerabilities that\
    \ can be \nexploited by a malicious user. These kinds of attacks, \nnamed adversary\
    \ machine attacks, aim to target the ML \nalgorithms of a system to alter these\
    \ initial functions. It is \nworth noting that it is essential to consider this\
    \ threat \nwhen setting up security solutions integrating ML \nsystems. Such networks\
    \ usually have heterogeneous \ndevices, dense users, frequent communication requests,\
    \ \nand ubiquitous channel interference, which impose \nsignificant challenges\
    \ on improving the Quality of \nService (QoS) [21]. \nAnastasakis et al. [230]\
    \ take the huge IoT network log \nas an advantage to enhance the security in IoT\
    \ systems \nusing federal learning (FL). FL is a distributed machine \nlearning\
    \ approach that aims to build and train global \nmodels based on training datasets\
    \ that are distributed \nacross different remote devices while avoiding data \n\
    leakage. The data is never processed on central servers, \ndecoupling the machine\
    \ learning process from the data \nsources. In practice, FL solutions train an\
    \ initial, generic \nmachine-learning model in a central server, which is a \n\
    baseline to start with, but their application faced a data \nA Survey of Using\
    \ Machine Learning in IoT Security and the…                                  \
    \                Informatica 47 (2023) 1–54 \n33 \nprivacy challenge. Venkatasubramanian\
    \ et al. [232] did a \ncomprehensive survey about FL-based systems in IoT \nmalware\
    \ analysis, where their survey provides an \noverview of different approaches\
    \ that integrate FL with \nIoT. \nPerformance and accuracy are not fixed parameters\
    \ we \nwant to achieve, but they should depend on the IoT \nsystem itself. For\
    \ example, if the mission is life-critical \n(e.g., autonomous car, Military,\
    \ Healthcare), we should \nprovide a very high-performance model considering \n\
    speed and accuracy. On the other hand, if we want to \nsave power or battery,\
    \ the calculation should be different. \nBout et al. [2] say that there is no\
    \ comparative study of \nbattery consumption, either from an attacker or a victim’s\
    \ \npoint of view that was carried out in a real context during \nmost of the\
    \ previous experiments. It is essential to \nimprove learning methods in order\
    \ to reduce the cost of \nthe necessary resources and training time while \nincreasing\
    \ their performance. Due to the rapid data \ngeneration speed and the complexity\
    \ of data sources of \nIoT, maintaining high-quality data in real-time is a \n\
    challenging task [217]. Therefore, it remains an open \nresearch issue to investigate\
    \ whether the available \nfeatures in known benchmark datasets are sufficient\
    \ to \nachieve high detection rates even in the presence of \nchanging attack\
    \ patterns or whether it will be necessary \nto add new features to maintain a\
    \ high level of detection \naccuracy [12]. \nOne of the main IoT challenges is\
    \ its characteristics \nwhich cause limitations in different ways like power,\
    \ \ncapacity, computational processes, and more, those \nlimitations encourage\
    \ researchers to find lightweight \ntechnologies and techniques to deal with IoT\
    \ devices, and \none of those is in ML and DL solutions, IoT \ncharacteristics\
    \ and limitations discussed more in section \nIV. Latif et al. [52] discussed\
    \ a lightweight random \nneural network stack detection schema in the industrial\
    \ \nenvironment IIOT, and they talked deeply about the \nchallenges they found\
    \ and some research future \ndirections to control those challenges. One of the\
    \ \ndirections was about the generation of new security-\nrelated datasets, where\
    \ high-quality data is an important \nthing for model performance evaluation.\
    \ The other future \ndirection was the improvement in existing ML schemes \nfor\
    \ low-quality and noisy datasets, and they said the \nimprovements in existing\
    \ proposed schemes and the \ndevelopment of new algorithms are required to deal\
    \ with \nlow-quality and noisy data. They also list other directions \nsuch as\
    \ the implementation of learning schemes at the \nedge, fog domain security, and\
    \ the last solution was in \nusing Blockchain-Based secure ML schemes for IoT\
    \ \nsecurity. \nMachine learning decisions about IoT detection are \nanother challenge,\
    \ most of the time ML can detect the \nintrusion but cannot decide how to deal\
    \ with it. Abou El \nHouda et al. [225] produce Explainable Artificial \nIntelligence\
    \ (XAI) which is a full system that can detect \nand take decisions about IoT\
    \ intrusions using ML and DL \ntechniques. They first build an ML/DL-based IDS\
    \ using a \ndeep neural network (DNN) to detect and predict IoT \nattacks in real-time.\
    \ Then they develop multiple XAI \nmodels (i.e., RuleFit and SHapley Additive\
    \ exPlanations, \nSHAP) on top of our DNN architecture to enable more \ntrust,\
    \ transparency, and explanation of the decisions made \nby their ML/DL-based IDS\
    \ to cyber security experts. \nAbdelmoumin et al. [148] found a solution for costly\
    \ \ntraining and testing time and computational overhead, \nthey solve it using\
    \ a distributed intelligent IDS \narchitecture that can help reduce the computational\
    \ \noverhead and; hence, reduced latency. Shukla [218] \nproposed XML-based lightweight\
    \ IDS for low-power IoT \nnetworks running 6LoWPAN. They used the IDS \nmechanism\
    \ to detect wormhole attacks in IoT networks. \nThe proposed IDS mechanism uses\
    \ three ML techniques, \ni.e., K-means clustering (unsupervised learning), decision\
    \ \ntree (supervised learning), and a hybrid technique \ncombining the aforementioned\
    \ techniques. \nM. Raza et al. [42] present the role of IoT in healthcare \nand\
    \ cover suitable IoT-driven solutions, especially in \nCovid-19. They also present\
    \ challenges in the adoption of \nIoT in healthcare such as patient monitoring\
    \ from home \nbecause of the lockdown. Patients need technologies in \ntheir homes\
    \ to keep their health monitored and this was \none of the challenges. The other\
    \ challenge is energy and \npower usage, which is a main limitation in the IoT\
    \ \nenvironments, and researchers cover this gap with \nsuggestions for empowering\
    \ IoT solutions. Authors listed \nother IoT challenges and limitations in healthcare\
    \ during \nCovid-19 such as security, privacy, integration with other \ntechnology,\
    \ data format, and legal and ethical issues. \nAlrashdi et al.  [125] focus on\
    \ two main IoT \nchallenges, but in the smart city environment. The first \nchallenge\
    \ was in zero-day attack detection, and the \nsecond one was finding the best\
    \ AI method in cyberattack \ndetection. In this research, the authors faced three\
    \ \nchallenges: Limited resources, heterogeneity, and a high \nfalse positive\
    \ rate. They introduced an approach based on \nNIDS, called the AD-IoT system,\
    \ to detect various loT \nattacks in a distributed fog layer instead of a cloud\
    \ layer \nto solve those challenges. \nBagaa et al. [141] provided a list of promising\
    \ \ntechnologies and designed a security framework to \nintegrate them comprehensively.\
    \ The research challenge \nthey found was in defining standardized interfaces\
    \ to ease \nthe interactions among the envisioned framework \nmodules, including\
    \ common languages to specify the IoT \nsecurity policies needed to react according\
    \ to the AI-\nbased decisions. Secondly, as the IoT landscape is \ncontinuously\
    \ evolving, the AI system will need to be \nautonomously reconfigured to deal\
    \ with additional \nemerging (and potentially unknown) IoT cyber-attacks, \nwhich\
    \ do not follow previous network/systems signatures \nand patterns. Thirdly, another\
    \ challenge deals with \nmachine learning methods and algorithms that can be \n\
    used by the reaction agent to dynamically plan the best \ncountermeasure(s) to\
    \ enforce according to different \ncontexts. \nOther challenges faced by Liang\
    \ et al. [59] were, first, \nthe training process is time and computationally\
    \ \nexpensive, and that traditional machine learning cannot \nhandle dynamic systems,\
    \ such as intrusion detection \nsystems are dynamic systems, in which new training\
    \ data \n34 \nInformatica 47 (2023) 1–54 \nk. Harahsheh et al. \nare continuously\
    \ generated. Second, applying one well-\ntrained machine learning model to multiple\
    \ scenarios is a \nchallenging issue. Third, machine learning is a black-box \n\
    process, and backtracking through specific training steps \nis difficult, if not\
    \ impossible. Authors found some future \ndirections which may help in reducing\
    \ those challenges. \nFor example, using some online distributing learning will\
    \ \nimprove training and testing time and speed, especially in \ndynamic systems\
    \ in which those distributed platforms can \ndo training on the new slice for\
    \ data only, instead of \nentering and retraining the whole dataset. They also\
    \ \nsuggest a solution for the problem of deploying ML in \ndifferent CPS scenarios,\
    \ where using data normalization, \ndiscretization, and sampling could an a appropriate\
    \ \nsolution. However, these solutions are not satisfactory in \ncomputation-limited\
    \ devices in collaboration with time-\nsensitive CPS requirements. Therefore,\
    \ mechanisms to \nreduce the size of collected and stored data in constrained\
    \ \nCPS devices are another possible research direction [59]. \nSalau et al. [6]\
    \ did a survey that provided a review of \nthe ML techniques that have been applied\
    \ to solve some \nof the challenges of wireless networks for IoT and CPS, \nand\
    \ some open challenges in wireless networking for \nCPS and IoT systems that AI\
    \ techniques can be used to \nfill the gap, and the future work needed to create\
    \ robust \nAI systems for IoT/CPS. \nGümüşbaş et al. [12] discuss the criteria\
    \ for a reliable \nbenchmark dataset, which concerns the diversity of the \ntraffic\
    \ data, the diversity of the protocols, the volume of \ncollected data, the diversity\
    \ of the attacks considered, the \ninclusion of novel attack types, the inclusion\
    \ of full \npayloads without anonymization, the presence or absence \nof \ninformative\
    \ \nfeatures, \nthe \nupdatability, \nthe \nconsideration of realistic traffic,\
    \ the extent of labeling, \nand the size of the feature set. Finally, any discussion\
    \ of \ndataset reliability should consider the ability of a dataset \nto adapt\
    \ to changes over time, by mimicking statistically \nnormal traffic in accordance\
    \ with upcoming needs, for \nexample. Similarly, researchers in [219] propose\
    \ the \nfollowing 11 criteria for assessing the reliability of a \ndataset for\
    \ intrusion detection:  \n1) Attack diversity. \n2) Anonymity. \n3) Available\
    \ protocols. \n4) Complete capture (with payloads). \n5) Complete interaction.\
    \ \n6) Complete network configuration. \n7) Complete traffic. \n8) Feature set.\
    \ \n9) Heterogeneity (all network traffic and system logs). \n10) Correct labelling.\
    \ \n11) Metadata (full documentation of data collection). \nCode Analysis and\
    \ Neural Learning are other trends \nthat can also reveal that, with the network\
    \ becoming more \ncomplex, the effort required for code analysis efforts \ndecrease\
    \ [29]. From the reviewed literature, a trend can \nview the network models applied\
    \ for vulnerability \ndetection as becoming increasingly complex and more \nexpressive\
    \ for better learning code semantic indicative of \nvulnerable code snippets.\
    \ From recent studies using the \nCNN [220], [221] or LSTM [222], until the very\
    \ recent \nstudies adopting memory networks [223], the evolving \nnetwork structure\
    \ has shown the research effort that has \nbeen put into exploring the potential\
    \ of neural networks \nfor reasoning about the code semantics and rich patterns\
    \ \nfor facilitating vulnerability discovery. Researchers from \nthe ML and NLP\
    \ communities have been motivated to \nadopt state-of the-art tools/approaches\
    \ for code analysis \nfor vulnerability detection [224]. \nWe cannot ignore IoT\
    \ connectivity challenges that are \nencountered in the deployment of IoT devices\
    \ [17]: \n• The first one is providing unique IPs to billions of \ndevices connected\
    \ to the Internet. This challenge can be \nmitigated by incorporating 6LoWPAN\
    \ which uses IPv6. \n• The second challenge is developing low-power \ncommunication\
    \ for transmitting data generated by \nsensors. \n• The third challenge is implementing\
    \ effective routing \nprotocols that consider the limited memory of sensors \n\
    and support the flexibility and mobility of smart objects. \nFinally, Hussain\
    \ et al. [15] listed at the end of their \nresearch a number of future directions\
    \ and challenges to \nbe solved such as: \n1) DL–One Size Does Not Fit All: DL\
    \ techniques are \nvery much application-specific where a model trained for \n\
    solving one problem might not be able to perform well \nfor another problem in\
    \ a similar domain. \n2) Neural Networks Are Black Boxes: Deep neural \nnetworks\
    \ act like a Blackbox, as we do not know how \nany DL model reaches a conclusion\
    \ by manipulating the \ninput data using the neurons at the intricately \ninterconnected\
    \ layers. \n3) Longer Convergence Time: Most of the RL \nalgorithms have longer\
    \ convergence times, and it may \nmake them unsuitable for real-time applications.\
    \ \n4) Butterfly Effect of ML and DL: The Butterfly effect \nis a phenomenon where\
    \ a minute change in the input of a \nsystem creates chaos in the output. In this\
    \ regard, ML and \nDL are also susceptible to this effect where a slight \nchange\
    \ in the input data to the learning system will create \nan enormous change in\
    \ the output which is the learned \nmodel. \n5) Challenges for DL in the Edge:\
    \ IoT will leverage \nthe advantages of edge computing which will increase the\
    \ \nIoT applications and services space. However, due to the \nsheer amount of\
    \ data generated by IoT devices, it will be \nhard to implement DL techniques\
    \ in edge devices. \n6) Over-Fitting Requirements and Hyper Parameters: \nTraining\
    \ offline from the fixed data logs (specified with \nexternal behavior policy)\
    \ and learning from limited \nsamples on the real system greatly affects the credibility\

    \ \n9  \nConclusion \n \nTo improve security measures to recognize and \nrespond\
    \ to assaults, cyber security has grown to be a \nconcern on a global scale, especially\
    \ when technology \nhas become an integral part of our life. IoT gained more \n\
    popularity in the last 15 years and became one of the top \ncomponents around\
    \ us. All companies and individuals \nsearch for smart things to make life easier,\
    \ and IoT helps \nthem to reach this. However, when we think about \nsecurity\
    \ and privacy, they are in danger with this \nenormous growth. The standard security\
    \ systems that \nwere previously in use are no longer appropriate since \nthey\
    \ are ineffective at identifying new threats.  In a \nvariety of applications,\
    \ ML and DL techniques are \nessential in new cybersecurity systems and become\
    \ more \nknown in this area. Our survey has shown that there is a \nfast expansion\
    \ in using ML in securing devices, \nespecially IoT which became a main part of\
    \ learning, \nshopping, business, banking, and government. \nThe survey also compared\
    \ different ML techniques for \ndeveloping systems security against attacks in\
    \ IoT \nnetworks in the last five years. It has many comparison \ntables which\
    \ list 152 papers from IEEE Xplore in IoT \nsecurity using ML techniques. We have\
    \ offered a full \nreview of the application of ML and DL for IoT systems. \n\
    The most popular technologies are also listed, and many \ntitles in ML, cybersecurity,\
    \ IoT, Models evaluations, \ndatasets, and more are thoroughly discussed. The\
    \ current \npaper also attempted to cover all possible challenges \nfacing the\
    \ researchers who use ML in security IoT \nenvironments. Those challenges help\
    \ us and other \nresearchers solve problems to improve the security \nmodel. \n\
    Our paper centers on IoT environment limitations and \ncharacteristics which make\
    \ it different from regular \nnetworks and need special care in power, capacity,\
    \ and \ncomputational limitations. The survey ends with some of \nthe most recent\
    \ solutions and future directions from \ndifferent research from 2018 to 2023.\
    \  \nHowever, the last section includes some open challenges \nto investigate\
    \ and offer a useful road map for academic \nand industrial researchers working\
    \ in the field of ML and \nDL for securing IoT and all its layers. \nWe recommend\
    \ our paper to all researchers who are \ninterested in solving one of the biggest\
    \ challenges in \nsecurity which were caused by the IoT environment \nlimitations\
    \ and characteristics which make it different \nfrom regular networks and need\
    \ special care in power, \ncapacity, and computational limitations. Our survey\
    \ \nprovided open challenges to investigate and offer useful \ndirections for\
    \ academic and industrial researchers \nworking in the field of ML and DL for\
    \ securing IoT and \nall its layers. Listing the challenges may help us and other\
    \ \nresearchers to directly find problems, try to solve them, \nand draw a roadmap\
    \ for future work. This survey also \nhelps compare several ML and DL techniques\
    \ and \nalgorithms to finally get the best performance depending \non its accuracy,\
    \ precision, and recall, among other results. \nWe also recommend this paper because\
    \ it provides a list \nof the last updated datasets used in IoT security in Table\
    \ \n7. The table provides different useful information for \nresearchers such\
    \ as dataset purposes, number of records, \nnumber of features, and a direct and\
    \ updated accessible \nlink. \nIn conclusion, we think that our study may be helpful\
    \ \nin shedding light on how machine learning techniques are \nused to create\
    \ cyberattacks and can aid readers who are \ninterested in creating fresh defenses\
    \ against more \nsophisticated and potent attacks on IoT networks. We \nhave also\
    \ provided comprehensive literature in this field \nand briefly outlined some\
    \ of the major difficulties \nassociated with applying machine learning techniques\
    \ to \ncyber security. Future studies are recommended to pay \nattention to the\
    \ aforementioned difficulties. \nWith a thorough discussion of the evaluation\
    \ matrix, \ndatasets, IoT characteristics, and other helpful material, \nthis\
    \ paper aims to give readers a roadmap for \nunderstanding the potential of ML\
    \ and DL methods for \nIoT security and detection systems. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\

    Preface

    The data is changing the way society and technology evolves, with the advent of
    IoT,

    Big Data, ML and AI, a rapid development in technology towards more human-

    centric applications has been envisaged. The finance and insurance sectors are
    not

    an exception and developments in FinTech and insurance-tech are in a phase of

    developing unique offerings.

    It is very important to have a common understanding of the actual conditions

    in the financial and insurance sectors and how the technology can help to advance

    and evolve those conditions in a positive manner. By discussing the principles
    of

    the modern economy that make the modern financial sector and FinTech the most

    disruptive areas in today’s global economy, a better understanding and knowledge

    will be acquired.

    The use of data-driven approaches envisions many opportunities emerging for

    activating new channels of innovation on the local and global scale while at the

    same time catapulting opportunities for more disruptive human-centric services.

    Data-driven human-centric applications are at the same time the result of a shared

    vision from a natural evolution of technology and society. Experts in the financial

    and insurance sectors are looking at a dramatic change in how people think about

    global economy and at the same time the technology is facilitating the instruments

    for new ways of understanding, providing a common vision and identifying impacts

    in finance and insurance.

    The INFINITECH book series is focused on addressing the need for clear infor-

    mation for better understanding of the foundations, principles and technologies
    for

    experts and non-technical experts that participate in the financial and insurance

    process and the constant need for innovation and new services across banks and

    insurance organizations.

    What is Addressed in the Book Series?

    “Concepts and Design Thinking Innovation addressing the Global

    Financial Needs”

    In the first part of the INFINITECH book series we begin by discussing the prin-

    ciples of the modern economy that make the modern financial sector and FinTech

    the most disruptive areas in today’s global economy. INFINITECH envision many

    opportunities emerging for activating new channels of innovation on the local
    and

    global scale while at the same time catapulting opportunities for more disruptive

    user- centric services. INFINITECH is at the same time the result of a shared
    vision

    from a representative global group of experts, providing a common vision and iden-

    tifying impacts in the financial and insurance sectors.

    “Methods and Design Principles for Financial Innovation, Explaining the

    Supply Side for Interoperability in Finance- and Insurance-Tech”

    In the second part of the series we review the basic concepts for Fintech referring
    to

    the diversity in the use of technology to underpin the delivery of financial services.

    The demand and the supply side in the financial sector are demonstrated, and fur-

    ther discussed is why FinTech is the focus of industry nowadays and the meaning

    for waves of digitization. Financial technology (FinTech) and insurance technology

    (InsuranceTech) are rapidly transforming the financial and insurance services
    indus-

    try. We provide an overview of Reference Architecture (RA) for BigData, IoT and
    AI

    applications in the financial and insurance sectors (INFINITECH-RA). Moreover,

    this book reviews the concept of innovation and its application in INFINITECH,

    and innovative technologies provided by the project for financial sector practical

    examples.

    What is Addressed in the Book Series?

    “Technical Financial Innovation, Solving the Interoperability

    Problems of Europe”

    The third book begins by providing a definition for FinTech as: The use of tech-

    nology to underpin the delivery of financial services. This book further discusses

    why FinTech is the focus of industry nowadays as the waves of digitization and

    the way financial technology (FinTech) and insurance technology (InsuranceTech)

    are rapidly transforming the financial and insurance services industry. In this

    book technology assets that followed the Reference Architecture (RA) for BigData,

    IoT and AI applications are introduced. Moreover, the series of assets includes

    the domain area where applications from the INFINITECH innovation project

    and the concept of innovation for the financial sector are described. Further,
    we

    describe INFINITECH Marketplace and its components including details of avail-

    able assets. Next, we provide descriptions of solutions developed in INFINITECH.

    What is Covered in this

    INFINITECH Part I Book?

    “Concepts and Design Thinking Innovation addressing the Global

    Financial Needs”

    The INFINITECH Way Foundation is explained in simple words, introducing the

    design principles and basic metrics for enhancing the state of the art. In this
    book we

    illustrate how INFINITECH Way can offer many advantages in the on-boarding

    process offering speed and agility when optimizing the design and implementation

    of financial services reference architecture and/or without the problems of dealing

    with complex vendor-lock and/or proprietary infrastructure.

    It is also addressed how INFINITECH Way is very practical in multiple

    areas and how the INFINITECH Way is applied. The core elements of the

    INFINITECH Way is the Reference Architecture (RA) and the different meth-

    ods to assess the success of the implementation. Further, it is shown how the

    INFINITECH Way is applied to validate a Reference Implementation addressing

    Big Data, IoT and AI applications for the financial and insurance sectors. The
    refer-

    ence implementation will serve as a blueprint for the rapid and cost-effective
    solu-

    tions development and deployment. The INFINITECH-RA classify and describe

    a set of common functional building blocks that will support advances of Big Data,

    AI and IoT applications.

    In this book, a concise and detailed overview of the INFINITECH Reference

    Architecture is provided. The INFINITECH Data Pack is also explained contain-

    ing the set of files, schemas, and metadata model diagrams (Graphs) that represent

    how the INFINITECH way and the financial data could be organized and struc-

    tured. Furthermore, the core vocabularies of the INFINITECH Data Pack includ-

    ing FIBO, FIGI, LKIF, and INFINITECH Core are cited and explained. This

    What is Covered in this INFINITECH Part I Book?

    book also includes a practical example of how the INFINITECH Core is used and

    describes possible extensions in terms of a global technology named traffic analy-

    sis Hub and its work towards formalizing the vocabularies as the TAHO (Traffic

    Analysis Hub Ontology). Finally, a quick run-down of INFINITECH technolo-

    gies, data, and processes applied in the project are listed. In the section on
    self-

    assessment, we describe its integration with RA. INFINITECH WAY impact on

    Fintech and Insurance is discussed and its application to pilots is illustrated.

    Abstract

    In this first part of the INFINITECH book series we begin by discussing the princi-

    ples of the modern economy that make the modern financial sector and FinTech the

    most disruptive areas in today’s global economy. INFINITECH envisions a large

    number of opportunities emerging for activating new channels of innovation on

    the local and global scale while at the same time catapulting opportunities for
    more

    disruptive user-centric services. INFINITECH is at the same time the result of
    a

    shared vision from a representative global group of experts, providing a common

    vision and identifying impacts in the financial and insurance sectors.

    The INFINITECH Way Foundations is explained in simple words, introduc-

    ing the design principles and basic metrics for enhancing the state of the art.
    In this

    book we illustrate how INFINITECH Way Foundations can offer many advantages

    in the on-boarding process offering speed and agility when optimizing the design

    and implementation of financial services reference architecture and/or without
    the

    problems of dealing with complex vendor-lock and/or proprietary infrastructure.

    It is also illustrated how INFINITECH Way Foundations is very practical in mul-

    tiple areas and how the INFINITECH Way Foundations is applied. The core

    elements of the INFINITECH Way Foundation are the Reference Architecture

    (RA) and the different methods to assess the success of the implementation. Fur-

    ther, it is shown how the INFINITECH Way Foundations are applied to vali-

    date a Reference Implementation addressing BigData, IoT and AI applications for

    the financial and insurance sectors. The reference implementation will serve as
    a

    blueprint for the rapid and cost-effective solutions development and deployment.

    The INFINITECH-RA classifies and describes a set of common functional build-

    ing blocks that will support advances of BigData, AI and IoT applications.

    INFINITECH and The Global

    Financial Sector

    1.1

    INFINITECH and The Global Financial Sector

    The finance sector is among the most data-savvy and data-intensive of the global

    economy. The on-going digital transformation of financial organizations, along

    with their interconnection as part of a global digital finance ecosystem is produc-

    ing petabytes of structured and unstructured data. The latter represent a significant

    opportunity for banks, financial institutions, and financial technology firms
    (Fin-

    Techs): Leveraging these data financial organizations can significantly improve
    both

    their business processes and the quality of their decisions. As a prominent example,

    modern banks can exploit customer data to anticipate the behaviors of their cus-

    tomers, and to deliver personalized banking solutions to them. Likewise, data
    can

    enable new forms of intelligent algorithmic trading and personalized asset manage-

    ment [Soldatos et al., 2022].

    To harness the benefits of big data, financial organizations need effective ways

    for managing and analyzing large volumes of structured, unstructured, and semi-

    structured data at scale. Furthermore, they need to manage both streaming data

    and data at rest, while at the same time providing the means for the scalable
    pro-

    cessing by a variety of analytics algorithms. The latter processing may also require

    1

    2

    INFINITECH and The Global Financial Sector

    support for real-time analytics over the heterogeneous types of data (i.e. struc-

    tured/unstructured, streaming/data-at-rest). Management of heterogeneity is there-

    fore one of the most important concerns for big data management in the financial

    sector. Currently, financial organizations spend significant effort and IT resources

    in unifying and processing different types of data, which typical reside in different

    repositories such as operational databases, analytical data bases, data warehouses,

    data lakes, as well as emerging distributed ledger infrastructures (i.e. blockchains).

    Moreover, several applications require also semantic interoperability across datasets

    that are “siloed” across different systems, while the use of big data in real-life

    banking applications also requires the utilization of pre-processing functions
    (e.g.,

    anonymization), which boost the ever-important regulatory compliance of digital

    finance applications. Despite the evolution of big data technologies, there is
    still a

    need for novel solutions that can successfully confront the above-listed challenges

    to enable the development, deployment, and operation of big data applications
    for

    digital finance at scale [Soldatos et al., 2022].

    Big data management and analytics solutions enable Artificial Intelligence (AI)

    solutions in finance. AI refers to the capability of machines to imitate intelligent

    human behavior and act like humans. In many cases AI systems think like humans

    and reason over complex contexts in order to evaluate and to take optimal deci-

    sions. As such, AI systems support two main processes: (i) A learning process
    that

    allows them to produce rules about how to process and use the information they

    receive, and (ii) Reasoning that drives their decisions and actions. Several AI
    systems

    are already deployed or planned to be integrated in applications of the financial
    ser-

    vices industry. They are usually based on one or a combination of technologies
    such

    as video processing and visual scene analysis, speech recognition, Natural Language

    Processing (NLP), automated translation, machine learning, deep learning, and

    cognitive search. Typical AI applications in digital finance include robo-advisors,

    AI-based personalized asset management systems, statistical credit underwriting

    and risk assessment applications, automated and intelligent KYC (Know Your Cus-

    tomer) applications, fraud detection and anti-money laundering (AML), personal-

    ized finance applications for citizens and businesses, as well as a variety of
    front

    office applications such as chatbots. Moreover, there are many interesting AI
    appli-

    cations in the insurance sector such as automated insurance claims management

    and usage-based insurance i.e., statistical calculation of risk premiums based
    on

    data about the customers’ behaviors (e.g., lifestyle or driving behavior data).
    Most

    of these use cases leverage Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) tech-

    niques. However, the above list of AI use cases in finance is non-exhaustive.
    As more

    data becomes available, the use of AI to improve automation, personalization and

    reduce costs will become more attractive. It is expected that FinTech enterprises

    will produce novel AI-based ideas in the years to come. Nevertheless, in several

    INFINITECH and The Global Financial Sector

    3

    cases AI deployments have to overcome barriers and limitations of existing big
    data

    management technologies. In other cases, integration with other emerging tech-

    nologies (e.g., RPA – Robotics Process Automation and blockchain technologies)

    are required. In this context, the presentation of tangible AI deployments in
    finan-

    cial institutions is interesting in terms of the technologies employed, as well
    as in

    terms of the integration of AI in the digital transformation strategies of the
    financial

    organizations [Soldatos et al., 2022].

    The regulatory compliance of big data and AI solutions is also a major concern

    of financial institutions. Recent regulatory developments in the finance sector,
    such

    as the 2nd Payment Services Directive (PSD2) in Europe, open significant innova-

    tion opportunities for the sector, through facilitating the flow of data across
    finan-

    cial organizations. At the same time, these regulations make compliance processes

    more challenging, while introducing security challenges. Other regulatory devel-

    opments (e.g., MiFIDII and the 4th AML Directive) affect the way certain use

    cases (e.g., fraud detection) are developed. Moreover, all data-intensive use
    cases

    should comply with data protection regulations such as the General Data Privacy

    Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union (EU). At the same time, there are new

    regulations (e.g., eIDAS) which facilitate certain tasks in large scale big data
    and

    AI use cases, such as the process of digital on-boarding and verification of cus-

    tomers. Overall, regulatory compliance has a two-way interaction with big data

    and AI applications. On the one hand it affects the design and deployment of big

    data and AI applications, while on the other big data and AI can be used to boost

    regulatory compliance. Indeed, AI provides many opportunities for improving reg-

    ulatory compliance in the direction of greater accuracy and cost-effectiveness.
    For

    instance, the machine learning segment of AI enables collection and processing
    of

    very large amounts of data relevant to a financial or banking workflow, including

    structured data from conventional banking systems and alternative data such as

    news and social networks. These big data can be analyzed to automate compliance

    against regulatory rules. This is the reason why many RegTech (Regulatory Com-

    pliance) enterprises are AI-based. They leverage AI and big data analytics to
    audit

    compliance in real time (e.g., by processing streaming data in real time), while
    at

    the same boosting the accuracy and richness of regulatory reporting.

    Overall, the development, deployment and operation of novel big data and AI

    solutions for modern digital financial organization requires a holistic approach
    that

    addresses all the above listed issues. Since October 2019, the European project

    INFINITECH (co-funded by the H2020 program of the European Commis-

    sion) is taking such a holistic and integrated approach to designing, deploying
    and

    demonstrating big data and AI solutions in Digital Finance. The project brings

    together a consortium of over forty organizations, including financial organizations,

    FinTechs, large vendors of AI and big data solutions, innovative high-tech Small

    4

    INFINITECH and The Global Financial Sector

    Medium Enterprises (SMEs), as well as established research organizations with
    a

    proven track record of novel research outcomes in AI, big data and blockchain

    technologies and their use in the finance sector. The present book is aimed at
    pre-

    senting INFINITECH’s approach to big data and AI driven innovations in Digital

    Finance, through a collection of scientific and technological development contri-

    butions that addresses most of the earlier identified challenges based on innovative

    solutions. Specifically, the book presents a set of novel big data, AI and blockchain

    technologies for the finance sector, along with their integration in novel solutions.

    Furthermore, it puts emphasis on regulatory compliance issues, including techno-

    logical solutions that boost compliance to some of the most important regulations

    of the sector.

    INFINITECH is a joint effort of Europe’s leaders in ICT and Finance/Insurance

    sectors towards providing the technological capabilities, the experimentation
    facil-

    ities (testbeds & sandboxes) and the business models needed to enable European

    financial organizations, insurance enterprises and FinTech/InsuranceTech innova-

    tors to fully leverage the benefits of BigData, IoT and AI technologies. The latter

    benefits include a shift towards autonomous (i.e. automated and intelligent) pro-

    cesses, that are dynamically adaptable and personalized to end-users’ needs, while

    being compliant to the sector’s complex regulatory environment. It will provide:

    [the proposal]

    • Novel Big Data/IoT technologies for seamless management and query-

    ing of all types of data (e.g., OLAP/OLTP, structured/ unstructured/semi-

    structured, data streaming & data at rest), interoperable data analytics,

    blockchain-based data sharing, real-time analytics, as well as libraries of

    advanced AI algorithms.

    • Regulatory tools incorporating various data governance capabilities (e.g.,

    anonymization, eIDAS integration) and facilitating compliance to various

    regulations (e.g., PSD2 2nd Payment Services Directive), 4AMLD (4th Anti-

    Money Laundering), MIFiD II).

    • Novel and configurable testbeds & sandboxes, each one offering Open APIs

    and other resources for validating autonomous and personalized solutions,

    including a unique collection of data assets for finance/insurance.

    The project’s results will be validated in the scope of 15 high impact pilots
    pro-

    viding complete coverage of the sectors, including Know Your Customer (KYC),

    customer analytics, personalized portfolio management, credit risk assessment,

    preventive financial crime analysis, fraud anticipation, usage-based insurance,
    agro-

    insurance and more. INFINITECH will establish a market platform that will pro-

    vide access to the project’s solutions, along with a Virtualized Digital Innovation

    INFINITECH and The Global Financial Sector

    5

    Hub (VDIH) that will support innovators (FinTech/InsuranceTech) in their Big-

    Data/ AI/IoT endeavors. Based on their strong footprint in the European digital

    finance ecosystem, the partners will engage stakeholders from all EU-28 countries,

    making INFINITECH synonymous to disruptive BigData/AI innovation in the

    target sectors.

    INFINITECH Way Foundations

    2.1

    INFINITECH Way Foundations

    The INFINITECH Project has introduced the “INFINITECH Way Foundations”

    which offers the best practices in FinTech developments for the insurance and
    finan-

    cial sectors in Europe. [Innovation Readiness Assessment]

    INFINITECH has introduced the “INFINITECH Way Foundations” which

    offers many advantages in the on-boarding process offering speed and agility when

    optimizing the reference architecture and without the problems of dealing with

    complex, proprietary infrastructure. This on-boarding process outlines adopting

    containers and orchestration and transitioning implemented solutions to a con-

    tainerized approach. INFINITECH Readiness Level (IRL) focuses on evaluating

    the paths taken in the adoption and deployment of those paths and technologies

    for an easy adoption and efficient deployment. [Innovation Readiness Assessment]

    The INFINITECH project has successfully designed and used a holistic frame-

    work called INFINITECH Business Approach or “INFINITECH Way Founda-

    tions” to navigate through the design, development, and deployment of technology

    solutions in the financial services and insurance sectors. [INFINITECH Project

    Review Report]

    The resulting “INFINITECH Way Foundations” provides a strong technical

    framework for developing data driven financial services related applications.
    The

    6

    INFINITECH Way Foundations

    7

    business case for using the technical framework, for example, through a business

    model specification, has not (yet) been validated. By relying on the “INFINITECH

    Way Foundations” as a development framework SMEs, notably FinTech and Insur-

    anceTech companies should be able to advance more effectively and avoid reinvent-

    ing the wheel over and over. [INFINITECH Project Review Report]

    In the other hand INFINITECH is using an innovative on-boarding called

    the “INFINITECH Way Foundations” which also act as a methodology outlining

    containerized solutions and orchestrated Development and Operations (DevOps)

    operations and transitioning methods for implemented software assets, compo-

    nents, and solutions. For example, the “INFINITECH Way Foundations” is an

    innovative product that provides a strong technical framework for developing data

    driven financial services related applications, but a strong business model has
    not

    been clearly specified. [Innovation Readiness Assessment]

    INFINITECH Way Foundations applies to:

    • INFINITECH Reference Architecture (RA)

    • INFINITECH Data pack

    ◦ FIBO, Financial Industry Business Ontology

    ◦ FIGI Financial Instrument Global Identifier

    ◦ LKIF, the Legal Knowledge Interchange Format

    ◦ INFINITECH Core

    ◦ Example-TAHO (Traffic Analysis Hub Ontology)

    • INFINITECH data, technologies, and processes

    ◦ Interoperability Data Pack

    ◦ CI/CD

    ◦ KYC/KYB

    • INFINITECH Way Self-assessment

    • INFINITECH Way impact on Fintech and Insurance

    Overall, the INFINITECH-RA will be built on several concepts that have been

    introduced by other reference architecture models, including models developed
    by

    industrial organizations (e.g., large IT enterprises) and associations (e.g.,
    BDVA),

    as well as models produced by other projects. Moreover, it considers the structuring

    principles of BigData and AI applications in digital finance, as these principles
    are

    reflected in industrial reference architectures. Nevertheless, the INFINITECH-RA

    aims at introducing a more flexible approach: Instead of providing a rigorous
    (but

    monolithic) structure of BigData/AI applications, it defines these applications
    as

    collections of data-driven pipelines. The latter are built based on INFINITECH

    8

    INFINITECH Way Foundations

    components. Hence, the INFINITECH-RA provides a number of layered archi-

    tectural concepts and a rich set of digital building blocks, which enable the
    devel-

    opment of virtually any BigData or AI application in Digital Finance. The project

    will offer increased flexibility in defining data-driven applications in the sector,
    in

    a way that covers’/subsumes most of the rigorous architectures outlined in earlier

    paragraphs. [D2.15]

    The INFINITECH Way Innovation

    The Innovation is a process that requires to identify and define clear activities
    from

    both scientific and industrial domains. The Infinitech project also offer innovative

    methods and their means for measuring i.e. Infinitech Innovation Readiness Assess-

    ment or Innovation Radar, which is construct by Customer Evaluation Levels, IPR

    readiness Level, Compliance Maturity Level and Infinitech Readiness Level (IRL).

    In this document we review them and explain its advantages towards catapulting

    innovation in the financial sector.

    The INFINITECH Project (www.infinietch-h2020.eu) has introduced the

    “INFINITECH Way Foundation” which offers the best practices in FinTech devel-

    opments for the insurance and financial sectors in Europe.

    In a complex and competitive European Ecosystem Infinitech emerge offering

    efficient and agile methods and introduced an optimized FinTechs-Friendly refer-

    ence architecture to reduce the problems of dealing with proprietary infrastructures.

    Infinitech Reference Architecture offers many advantages for further development

    using the concept of containers and sandbox development and offers a simple-to-

    follow on-boarding process. A driver of the reference architecture is the innova-

    tion and its potential exploitation which should drive the leadership in Europe
    and

    beyond borders.

    The Innovation is a process that requires to identify and define clear activities

    from both scientific and industrial domains. The INFINITECH Project also offer

    innovative methods and their means for measuring i.e. Infinitech Innovation Readi-

    ness, Customer Evaluation Levels, IPR readiness Level, Compliance Maturity Level

    and INFINITECH Readiness Level (IRL). In this document we review them and

    explain its advantages towards catapulting innovation.

    In the other hand Infinitech is using an innovative on-boarding called the

    Infinitech Way which also act as a methodology outlining containerized solutions

    and orchestrated DevOps operations and transitioning methods

    The Infinietch project rely in the capabilities of its partner members to produce

    value that is exploitable beyond the lab or Proof of Concept of ideas. The Figure
    2.1

    shows the Infinitech Innovation Roadmap where expertise from academia and

    research converge with industrial products and exploitation plans that uses design

    principles and Reference Architectures into creating a reference implementation
    for

    the financial and insurance sectors. The participation of stakeholders also comple-

    ment the activity and bring value to transform ideas an innovate.

    2.3

    Innovation Radar

    Innovation is always difficult to quantity, particularly when multiple and diverse

    aspects are involved in the innovation process, the Infinitech project is not
    an excep-

    tion and thus creative ideas and methods needs to be invented to measure Innova-

    tion.

    The INFINITECH Pentagon is an adopted kiviat diagram used as the tool to

    evaluate innovation in the Infinitech project pilots, In the INFINITECH Pen-

    tagon, five dimensions are used to evaluate the different relevant areas of a
    pilot.

    i,e. Customer, Market, Compliance, Technology, resources and Customer. Each

    area is assessed and ranked quantitatively, with integers represented in a concentric

    manner from 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest.

    The Figure 2.2 below shows a graphical representation (called a Kiviat diagram)

    as example.

    After the evaluation of each dimension, each pilot will have its personal Pen-

    tagon to validate the current level of Innovation. The methodology to evaluate

    each dimension is straightforward – a weighted average combining two different

    evaluations:

    • 50% of the final level is the ranking obtained through stakeholders feedback

    and evaluation, following the methodology developed and described in T7.8.

    • 50% of the final level is the ranking obtained through either quantitative or

    qualitative analysis and categorization. They will be thoroughly described in

    the following section.

    Customer

    It is assessed through three different aspects: the number of Early Adopters,
    the

    performed Stakeholders workshops and the formalized interests of possible paying

    or internal users. Table 2.1 is the categorization and weight of each component.

    The resulting level of the weighted average is 3,66. Assuming that the level of

    the feedback assessment resulting from the stakeholders questionnaire (developed

    in T7.8) is 4, the resulting overall level would be rounded to 4.

    them by analyzing company competitiveness and market attractiveness – through

    relative market share and growth rate – thus prioritizing investments in markets

    and business units according to their degree of profitability. Moreover, the matrix

    underlines the gap that has been generated by the enterprise itself with respect
    to

    its competitors, gaining a significant cost advantage on them.

    Given that relative market share and growth are the two drivers of the matrix,
    the

    latter illustrates specific combinations of them which are displayed in each quad-

    rant. As it is shown by the picture below, markets and business units can be classified

    as “cash cows”, “stars”, “question marks” or “dogs”:

    • Cash Cows are markets/business units with low growth rate and high rela-

    tive market share which can be leveraged to assign cash to reinvest in more

    profitable opportunities.

    • Stars are characterized by high growth rate and high relative share, being a

    market/business unit with high future potential.

    • Question marks reflect high growth and low share markets/business units

    which can be further exploited or abandoned according to their probability

    of becoming stars.

    • Pets are low share and low growth markets/business units on which companies

    should change their position, divest or liquidate.

    Growth Share Matrix

    The Figure 2.3 depicts the ability of a company to gain a leading position in
    its

    market before the growth slows represents a key factor. It is in fact most proba-

    ble that a product eventually becomes either cash cows or pets. In the Table 2.3

    Strategic Positioning Model

    The Strategic Positioning Model that can be seen in the Figure 2.4 is a tool that

    helps in the analyses the competitive advantage and the differentiation of a specific

    solution in respect to competitors.

    There are two main variables: the target customers (B – broad and N – narrow)

    and the perceived value (L – low-cost and D – differentiation) with four possible

    combinations. INFINITECH is an innovation project and therefore differentiation

    is its objective. The lowest value is given to the so called Cost Leadership (B;L)
    on

    the upper left.

    The focused cost leadership (N;L) is considered slightly better; whereas a broad

    differentiation (B;D) is an improvement and the focused differentiation (N;D)
    is

    of the highest value.

    Compliance

    Nowadays, compliance represents an important tool in the context of competition,

    as it can provide a competitive advantage. The INFINITECH approach addresses

    such a key aspect under two perspectives – Intellectual Property Right (IPR) and

    Compliance Maturity – by leveraging two tools: the IPR Readiness Level and the

    Compliance Maturity Model.

    IPR Readiness Level

    The first one assesses the readiness level of IPR by considering the entire process
    of

    IPR release, as it is shown by the Table 2.4.

    Compliance Maturity Model

    The second one represents the compliance to internal policies and whether the

    company working on the solution follows specific procedures. Each pilot should

    follow specific procedures, have a quality plan and a risk management procedure
    in

    place. The guidelines provided by the INFINITECH project can be found in D1.2

    and future versions. In order to assess the compliance value, the selected model
    is the

    Compliance Maturity Model represented and explained below. It is an adaptation

    of the widely used CMMI (Capabilities Maturity Model Integration).

    Technology

    Technology represents a key dimension for the Infinitech Innovation Readiness

    Mapping. Such areas of interest can be split up into two sub-categories: technology

    readiness level and infinitech readiness level.

    TRL Readiness Level

    The Technology Readiness Level indicates the technology maturity phase of a

    technology according to the EU adoption of the NASA TRL developed in the

    1970 decade, spanning from basic-principle observations to the actual system

    proven in an operational environment. The use of TRLs emerge as a guide that

    enables different background technologist and general public to have a consis-

    tent, uniform discussions of technical maturity across different types of technol-

    ogy. TRLs are measured by unity scale of 1 to 9 with 1 being the lowest level
    and

    9 being the most mature technology. The US Department of Defense has used

    the scale for procurement since the early 2000s. By 2008 the scale was also in

    use at the European Space Agency (ESA) and in 2010 the European Commis-

    sion advised EU-funded research and innovation projects to adopt the scale. In

    2013, the TRL scale was further canonized by the ISO 16290:2013 standard. TRLs

    were consequently used in 2014 in the EU Horizon 2020 program. The TRL is

    16

    INFINITECH Way Foundations

    determined during a Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) that examines pro-

    gram concepts, technology requirements, and demonstrated technology capabili-

    ties. The second one assesses the actual level of development of a pilot in respect

    the Infinitech Way (TBD – we’ll have the final version of it in the coming days)

    INFINITECH Readiness Level

    The INFINITECH Readiness Level (IRL) is a self-assessment method created to

    evaluate and provide guidance during the adoption process of generic or specific

    technology assets and/or technology conditions related to the deployment phase

    of a pilot project. IRL’s main objective is to act as a tool for project pilot
    lead-

    ers to help them and guide them in their process to identify and select ready-to-

    go technologies, in particular IRL also is useful in the on-boarding process of
    the

    INFINITECH Way Foundation where technologies that have been developed in

    advance can be adopted at any stage duration the execution of the project pilots.

    IRL is applicable to any program (i.e. INFINITECH Pilot) at any stage that

    operates or want to make use of the technology assets that are developed or imple-

    mented for the financial and insurance sectors, the IRL defines 5 levels scored
    1 to 5

    where 1 is the lowest level and 5 is the highest level. IRL can be used directly
    in the

    INFINITECH Pentagon (i.e. kiviat diagram) as it can be mapped directly within

    the innovation process/radar facilitating in this way the path towards achieve
    high

    levels of Innovation.

    On-Boarding Process – the development of ad-hoc technologies is an expensive

    process and cumbersome if there is not adequate allocated resources (i.e techno-

    logical and personnel), the re-use of other technologies can facilitate the develop-

    ment and deployment of better applications improving the way teams develop and

    deliver rapidly and efficiently innovative applications in order to achieve a
    compet-

    itive advantage and operational efficiency.

    INFINITECH project has introduced the “INFINITECH Way Foundation”

    which offers many advantages in the on-boarding process offering speed and agility

    when optimizing the Reference Architecture and without the problems of deal-

    ing with complex, proprietary infrastructure. This on-boarding process outlines

    adopting containers and orchestration and transitioning implemented solutions

    to a containerized approach. IRL focus on evaluating the paths is taken in the

    adoption and deployment of those paths and technologies for an easy adoption

    and efficient deployment.

    Self-Assessment – IRL provides to any project (INFINITECH Pilot) the capacity

    to self-assess the level of adoption following identified technological characteristics

    in different technology domain areas i.e. Data Modeling and Data Interoperability,

    Infrastructure Deployment and Services Platform Adoption, Information Manage-

    ment and Analytics and Intelligent Applications. The technology domain areas are

    Innovation Radar

    17

    defined by following the requirements from ICT experts into a full-stack imple-

    mentation and the IRL method allows the self-assessment of the evolution of the

    pilot project during the phase of adoption or onboarding process. IRL also adds
    the

    temporal dimension to an onboarding process which helps to not only self-assess

    the way the project is being implemented but also the validity of the process
    for

    following that path.

    IRL Level 1 – Look after the identification and definition of basic conditions

    to start a pilot with as much as possible re-use of INFINITECH

    baseline technologies. As a first step other technologies outside

    INFINITECH Ecosystem may be used but with a clear design

    perspective for on-boarding Infinitech assets in next iteration.

    IRL Level 2 – Ready to go technologies for a prototype building in Client-

    Server model, a series of demonstrators can be available to

    test/proof the deployment of basic functionalities, at this level

    integration is not required but is recommended to have data

    model integration and common access control tools.

    IRL Level 3 – First Deployed Demonstrator with all functionalities in Cloud-

    based deployment, the use of INFINITECH Way Foundation

    and Reference Architecture is the core of this level, the use of

    demonstrators is essential to explain high level use cases and also

    the use of Data sets following the INFINITECH Data model

    or other best practices/standards in the particular domain of the

    pilot demonstration.

    IRL Level 4 – Cross Domain services deployed with DevOps ready for easy

    deployment. Data is required to be shared across different

    domains, it can be tested with simple applications or inte-

    grated in the cross-domain query system. At this level all the

    components are integrated following DevOps Techniques and

    the orchestration methods described in the INFINITECH Way

    Foundation.

    IRL Level 5 – Implemented Proof of Concept (PoC) with interoperable cross-

    domain services, DevOps and Sandboxes deployments are fea-

    tured to facilitate the inclusion of the assets and solutions in the

    INFINITECH marketplace.

    Table 2.7 summarises the IRL levels providing short descriptions on what is

    observed and considered for evaluation on each IRL level and its correspondence

    with technology domains described as parameters and as part of the self-assessment

    evaluation points.

    Resources

    Resources are the fuel that drives the business and can be represented by three
    key

    variables: financials; staffing and skills; and organization readiness. The first
    param-

    eter can be quantitatively assessed by the ROI indicator (the expected or foreseen

    ROI, in this case) (Table 2.9), further understanding what could be the return
    of

    the company on the investments it made: it is a key tool to verify the quality
    of the

    decisions made upon managing assets and liabilities.

    The second and the third are qualitative variables that provide important infor-

    mation on the overall know-how of the company which can be evaluated both

    in terms of the set of skills the company staff has and whether the company

    implements and adheres to schedules and detailed documentations, also smoothing

    internal processes. The self-assessment tool selected for such purpose is the
    “Team

    Readiness Capability Assessment Model” (see picture 2.5 above), which quantifies

    the readiness capability level of team category groups.

    There are five levels of Team Readiness which are related to the analysis of the

    following variables: command and communication, document and share, tools and

    techniques, internal resources, external resources, training and drilling and
    metrics.

    The correspondent levels are the following:

    – Lv.1: Not prepared

    Certification

    The world bank defines Financial Sector as a group of resilient, transparent and

    smooth-functioning financial systems and capital markets that contribute to finan-

    cial stability, job growth and poverty alleviation. While in the other hand according

    to Investopedia the Financial Sector is a section of the economy made up of firms

    and institutions that provide financial services to commercial and retail customers.

    Any of these two definitions could potentially suit the different stakeholder
    needs.

    There is no common agreement and thus not common ways to assess and evaluate

    innovation in this complex sector. The only common agreement is that this sec-

    tor comprises a broad range of industries including banks, investment companies,

    insurance companies, and real estate firms and that in the current business condi-

    tions FinTechs are emerging rapidly with very disruptive applications and services

    best practices for business innovation are required.

    In current financial market conditions there is no way to ensure Financial Ser-

    vices are designed with the adequate level of interoperability and that they are

    deployed following best design practices to compete with the very disruptive Fin-

    Tech Markets. However there are good indicators coming from the INFINITECH

    Innovation Readiness, INFINITECH On-boarding Process and INFINITECH

    Readiness Level approaches that may constitute the first step to create the certifica-

    tion program that is required to ensure that best practices are followed, standards

    are used and the created, implemented, deployed and tested technologies within

    the INFINITECH Marketplace are used.

    Figure 2.6 shows the potential certification label that will be provided to

    pilots that demonstrate (following the certification programme) to be part of
    the

    INFINITECH ecosystem but beyond that to prove that all their technologies fol-

    lows the INFINITECH way and that the provided applications at the plot level are

    fully compliant with innovative levels.

    Infinitech Terminology

    The common vocabularies in the insurance and financial sectors are evolving in

    the same way society and economy, INFINITECH project take an step ahead

    and identify and define terminology that is required for innovation activities,
    from

    simple concept like assets and case studies to a more elaborate terms like integration

    and marketplace, terms that are emerging as trend activities in software systems.

    Table 2.10 summarises the Infinitech terminology which can help for better under-

    standing at INFINITECH project level but also in other activities in FinTechs.

    Reference Architectures Analysis

    3.1

    Reference Architecture Analysis

    Reference Architectures are designed for facilitating design and developments
    of

    concrete technological architectures, mostly in the IT domain, reducing risks
    with

    proven components, all while improving overall communication within an organi-

    zation. Real drawbacks and benefits of RAs have been analyzed with respect to
    the

    project’s Pilots.

    RA facilitated development of concrete IT architectures and reduced mainte-

    nance costs. In general, the value of RAs can be summarized in the following points:

    • reduction of development and maintenance costs of systems

    • facilitation of communication between important stakeholders

    • reduction of risks

    Typically, when a system is designed without a RA, an organisation may accumu-

    late technical risks and end up with a complex and non-optimal implementation

    architecture.

    In the industry, complex infrastructures for big data systems and high-

    performance computing (HPC) have been developed and proved to sustain

    intensive data processing services (Netflix, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc.).

    22

    Methodology

    23

    The architectures and technologies of world class infrastructure have been pub-

    lished and RAs have been designed and proposed. However, very few solutions

    have been published for the Financial and Insurance sectors and this book aims
    to

    partially cover the gap.

    3.2

    Methodology

    The methodology for the development of the INFINITECH-RA is based on the

    following overlapping phases:

    • Phase 1 – Review and Analysis (M2-M7): This phase was focused on the

    analysis of relevant technical and scientific information, ensuring that the

    INFINITECH-RA considers recent developments in BigData architectures

    in general and for the finance sector in particular. It analysed the BDVA

    RA, along with BigData architectures for digital finance applications that

    have been introduced and are widely used in the industry. In this con-

    text, BigData/AI environments and tools have been reviewed as well. Like-

    wise, this phase considered the stakeholders requirements (from T2.1 of the

    project), as well as regulatory compliance requirements and the specifica-

    tions of INFINITECH technologies reflected in D2.5 and D2.7 respectively.

    The overarching goal of this phase was to make sure that the design of the

    INFINITECH-RA aligns with key requirements of BigData applications in

    digital finance, as well as with the evolution of the state of the art in BigData

    in finance.

    • Phase 2 – Architecture Design (M6-M12): This phase produced the ini-

    tial design of the INFINITECH-RA, using the 4 + 1 view methodol-

    ogy [Kruchten95] for specifying software architectures. The selection of

    this proven and well-known methodology was motivated from the fact

    that INFINITECH pilot systems are essentially software systems. Hence,

    a methodology for specifying software architectures was applicable. In-line

    with the 4 + 1 architecture the INFINITECH-RA is described as a col-

    lection of complementary views (i.e. process, development, logical, physi-

    cal) that represent dynamic behaviors and static behavior of the systems,

    as well as relevant implementation aspects. Likewise, 4 + 1 signifies the

    need for confronting the architecture against a number of scenarios like the

    INFINITECH pilots. As part of the second phase of the INFINITECH

    development, a set of main views for the INFINITECH-RA were specified

    and described, as presented in subsequent paragraphs. Note that the phase

    extends beyond the delivery of the first version of the INFINITECH-RA

    24

    development.

    (i.e. to M12 of the project), as several of the presented views will be revised

    in the coming months.

    • Phase 3 – Fine Tuning and Updates (M12-M27): The third development

    phase of the INFINITECH-RA started after the submission of D2.13. Phase

    3 aims at revising and fine-tuning the INFINITECH-RA based on its actual

    use in other work packages, including the sandboxes and pilot development

    work packages. It will receive and exploit stakeholders’ feedback from the

    practical use of the INFINITECH-RA for developing BigData/AI systems

    for the finance sector. The feedback will be exploited towards improving

    aspects of the INFINITECH-RA, but also towards validating the architec-

    tural concepts introduced in practice. This Phase will lead to the final version

    of the INFINITECH-RA as part of deliverable D2.15 i.e. the third and last

    version/release of this deliverable.

    The Figure 3.1 illustrates the three development phases of the INFINITE

    CH_RA and the main activities that they comprise.

    General AI/BigData Challenges

    3.3.1

    Big Data

    Over the past few years and in the context of big data, new challenges have emerged

    in data analytics, turning the attention to methodologies that raise the abstrac-

    tion level and facilitate the convergence rate of algorithms. To this end, several
    big

    data frameworks have been developed by researchers and engineers and respective

    algorithms have been compiled, mainly being domainspecific. However, the devel-

    opment of scalable and distributed analytics solutions for extreme-scale analytics
    in

    the finance/insurance sector remains quite a complicated process given the diversity

    in datasets and data sources.

    General AI/BigData Challenges

    25

    Data sources can be of different type (structural, semi-structural or completely

    unstructural), in various formats and data accessibility options. Due to the above-

    mentioned factors, , modern enterprises rely on a variety of different and hetero-

    geneous data management systems in order to handle with this data diversity: rela-

    tional datastores that are used to store structural data compliant with an entity-

    relational model where the ensurance of transactional semantics and data con-

    sistency is of major concern, document-based data management systems to store

    semi-structural data, keyvalue stores that are considered efficient to store data
    com-

    ing from IoT sensors or logging information (i.e. when navigating among different

    web pages in the network, or simply logging the details of a finance transaction

    that took place) and even the use of HDFS data lakes is now considered prominent

    and facilitates the analysis of unstructural data that can be available. However,
    the

    analysis over a superset of the available data management system of an organization

    is not a trivial task. Joining data across datasets is very cost demanding and
    difficult

    to be implemented efficiently in the application or data processing level. To
    over-

    come this barrier, various analytical frameworks have been proposed that provide

    polyglot capabilities and abstract this problem from data scientists, making the
    data

    management process transparent from their perspective.

    Accessing heterogeneous data sources (a concept often addressed by data inte-

    gration systems or multidatabases [Özsu11], [Tomasic98]) is a problem that has

    been widely studied in the literature and with the recent emerge of cloud database

    and big data processing, it has been evolved towards polystore systems. Early
    imple-

    mentations [Minpeng11], [Ong14], [Simitsis12] relied on a single common model

    that the target datastores had to transform their schema to. A further improved

    presented by the polystore BigDAWG [Duggan15], [Gadepally16] which defines

    islands of information, which makes use of a single data model and language. Nowa-

    days, Spark SQL [Armbrust15] exploits its advantage for massive parallel process-

    ing over a federation of different and heterogeneous stores. It defines the notion
    of

    dataframe and provides different connectors over a variety of supported datastores.

    By providing a single interface and a common query language, it pushes down

    the query execution on the target databases, when this is possible, and retrieves

    data into those dataframes that are being used for further processing. That requires

    however the retrieval of the data in the data analysis layer, which can be memory

    greedy. Similarly, Presto allows for massive parallel processing where a coordinator

    orchestrates the query execution on several workers which make use of correspond-

    ing connectors, all of them implementing a common interface in order to hide the

    details of the query execution on the target database. Towards the same direction,

    Apache Drill and Impala maintain the notion of the data connectors that are able
    to

    retrieve data from external and heterogeneous datastores, and transform it to
    their

    own intermediate format and model that can be used for data processing in the

    upper layer of the framework. All those approaches provide polyglot capabilities,

    26

    Reference Architectures Analysis

    however, they are considered as additional frameworks that require the retrieval
    of

    the dataset in memory, and exploit their abilities for massive parallelism to
    be able

    to scale out adequately in order to deal with these requirements. The challenge
    lies

    on exploring the attributes and statistics of each individual dataset that is
    stored in

    each store, optimize the query execution and retrieve only the minimum amount
    of

    data that is needed in each query operator, thus minimizing the need for memory

    consumption and data traffic in the network.

    Besides the analytics level, running analytics over stale data is not ideal. For
    exam-

    ple, consider the case of a recommender system that aims to predict the behavioural

    patterns of a user, her preferences or dislikes, and provide personalised recommen-

    dations of relevant items. In a real-world scenario, user preferences change fre-

    quently, and new data continuously arrive in a real-time manner. A recommender

    system should, if possible, adapt to these changes as they happen, modifying its

    model to always reflect the current status, while requiring a single pass through
    the

    data. Furthermore, training new versions of the model in a continuously growing

    dataset is computationally inefficient, leading also to unnecessarily amplified
    infras-

    tructure costs. Hence, data management approaches are required both to account

    for new datasets and to support these incremental analytics.

    Apart from the scenarios where systems and analytical algorithms should con-

    tinuously take into account the overgrowing datasets in order to update the results

    of their analysis, they will also need to analyze real-time data in order to respond
    to

    events and create alerts and notifications as they events occur. An example of
    such

    a scenario is fraud detection, where users must be notified when the fraud trans-

    action occurs. However, dealing with data related to financial transaction raises
    a

    lot of concerns regarding data consistency and isolation. This is the reason why

    traditional relational database management systems are used, which ensure trans-

    actional (from a database theory perspective) semantics and ensure that a series
    of

    actions will be executed all or none (Atomicity), the data will be consistent
    (Con-

    sistency) and that they will not be stored breaking the rules that have been imposed

    by the database administrator (the balance of a bank account cannot be negative),

    parallel actions can be executed concurrently, but the result of their modifications

    will be likewise each action was executed in order (Isolation) and finally, that
    data

    will be preserved in terms of a system failure and all information can be recovered

    (Durability). Those four attributes consist of the ACID properties that traditional

    database management systems ensure and are of major importance in the finance

    sector. These databases are ideal for handling operational workloads, and they
    rely

    on the use of locks on data items that are being modified when a transaction access

    a data table. However, in order to perform a fraud detection, the system needs
    to

    read a variety of data by scanning the whole data table. In other words, to perform

    an analytical operation.

    General AI/BigData Challenges

    27

    Operational and analytical operations are compatible and one blocks the other,

    as the existence of a lock will prevent the latter from being executed. Likewise,
    a

    long-running analytical operation will pose read locks in the whole data table,
    thus

    blocking all operational workloads from being executed: the database will not
    be

    able to serve customer needs as long as the long-running operation takes place.

    Due to this, modern enterprises take a snapshot of the operational database and

    send it to a data warehouse, thus separating those two workloads: The relational

    datastore will serve operational workloads by ensuring the ACID-ity, while the
    data

    warehouse will serve analytical query processing. The drawback of this approach
    is

    that detection of a fraud transaction will take place the following day, as moving
    data

    from one store to the other is cost-expensive operation and relies on heavy ETLs

    that are being performed during the night. Even exploiting modern approaches

    and apply microbatching in the data movement process (i.e. the modifications of
    a

    transaction are being sent to a data queue, and a worker periodically gets data
    from

    the queue and sends them to the analytical warehouse) this allows for near real-time

    analytical processing, and cannot detect events that happen on real-time. Due
    to

    this, the analytics over operational data is still of great challenge.

    3.3.2

    Data Pipelines

    An additional aspect and challenge refers to data management that needs to be

    enhanced in order to both facilitate the needs at extreme-scale (in terms of efficiently

    for data throughput and access) and to address the challenge of various federated

    and distributed systems that hold and corresponding datasets. What is more, one

    needs to consider the changes on the underlying systems (and datasets) and thus
    the

    required level of dynamicity, raising the challenge for approaches that perform
    data

    pipelining from heterogeneous distributed systems towards analytics frameworks,

    while being adaptive to the aforementioned changes.

    Tightly-coupled multistore systems trade autonomy for performance, typically

    in a shared-nothing cluster, to integrate structured (RDBMS) and HDFS data.

    Polybase [Minukhin18] is a feature of Microsoft SQL Server Parallel Data Ware-

    house to access HDFS data using SQL. It allows HDFS data to be referenced

    through external PDW tables and joined with native PDW tables using SQL

    queries. Hybrid systems are similar to tightly-coupled systems, e.g. integrating

    HDFS and RDBMS in a sharednothing cluster, except that the HDFS data is

    accessed through a data processing framework like MapReduce. For example, QoX

    [Xu18] uses a dataflow approach for optimizing queries over relational (RDBMS

    and ETL) data and unstructured (HDFS) data, with a black box approach for cost

    modelling.

    Reference Architectures Analysis

    Moreover, when dealing with analytics performed on a variety of data sources,
    it

    is no less important to focus on the data aspects. Data-intensive distributed
    frame-

    works such as such as Apache Spark and Apache Drill can access multiple data stores

    using a unified API such as SQL. However, applications running on these frame-

    works have direct access to specific data stores and as a result to specific datasets,

    while frameworks such as Apache Ranger offer standardized access authorization

    to data stores, but only for a limited set of supported data stores and with limited

    policies.

    What is required refers to an approach for data management that minimizes

    the data pipelining process and would enable a hybrid management of data, both

    for analytical and for transactional workloads. The latter would enable analytics
    to

    account for the different datasets made available as they are ingested in the
    data

    stores (mainly through the respective transactions).

    Specific Challenges for the Finance Sector

    3.4.1

    Siloed Data and Business Operations

    One of the most prominent challenges faced by banks and financial organizations
    is

    the fragmentation of data across different data sources such as databases, data
    lakes,

    transactional systems (e.g., ebanking) and OLAP (On Line Analytical Processing)

    systems (e.g., Customer Data Warehouses). This is the reason why financial organi-

    zations are creating BigData architectures that provide the means for consolidating

    diverse data sources. As a prominent example, the Bank of England has recently

    established a “One Bank Data Architecture” based on centralized data manage-

    ment platform . This platform facilitates the BigData Analytics tasks of the bank,

    as it permits analytics over significantly on larger datasets.

    Note that the need for reducing data fragmentation has been also underlined by

    financial institutions following the financial crisis of 2008, where several financial

    organizations had no easy way to perform integrated risk assessments as different

    exposures (e.g., on subprime loans or ETFs (Exchange-Traded Fund)) were siloed

    across different systems. INFINITECH-RA must therefore provide the means for

    reducing data fragmentation and taking advantage of previous siloed data in inte-

    grated BigData Analytics and ML tasks.

    3.4.2

    Real Time Performance Requirements

    Real Time Computing is when an IT system must respond to changes according

    to definite time constraints, usually on the order of milliseconds or seconds.
    In

    the realm of financial and insurance sectors, real time constraints apply where
    a

    Specific Challenges for the Finance Sector

    29

    response must be given to provide services to users or organizations and are in
    the

    order of seconds or more. Examples range from banking application to cybersecu-

    rity. Most of real-world financial applications are NOT real time as other indus-

    trial automation (plant control) and are usually solved putting more computing

    resources (cpu/gpu power, memory,…) at the problem. However, in the case of

    ML/DL and BigData, algorithms can take significant amount of time and become

    useless in practical cases (responses arrive too late to be used). In those cases,
    a

    quantitative assessment of the computing time of algorithms is needed to config-

    ure resources to provide acceptable time.

    3.4.3

    Mobility

    The digital transformation of financial institutions includes a transition to
    mobile-

    first banking [Bons12]. This refers to the interaction of customer and financial

    organizations through mobile channels as part of mobile banking. INIFINITECH

    must support mobile channels when visualizing BigData, AI and IoT applications

    for digital finance, but also when collecting and processing user’s/customer’s
    input.

    3.4.4

    Omni-Channel Banking – Multiple Channels Management

    One of the main trends in banking and finance is the transition from conven-

    tional multi-channel banking to omni-channel banking [Komulainen18]. The lat-

    ter refers to seamless and consistent interactions between customers and finan-

    cial organizations across multiple channels. Hence, omnichannel banking/finance

    focuses on integrated customer interactions that comprise multiple transactions,

    rather than individual financial transactions. The INFINITECH-RA should pro-

    vide the means for supporting omni-channel interactions through creating unified

    customer views and managing interactions across different channels based on inte-

    grated/consolidated information about the customer. Note that BigData analytics

    is the cornerstone of omni-channel banking as it enables the creation of unified

    views of the customers and the execution of analytical functions (including ML)

    that track, predict and anticipate customer behaviors.

    3.4.5

    Automation

    Data intense applications, also in the banking and insurance sectors, are realized
    by

    specialized IT and RDBMS administrators. Recently, more and more data scientists

    and business analysts are involved in the development of such applications at
    a

    significant cost. The INFINITECH-RA should provide the means for orchestrating

    data intense application and management through easily creating workflows and

    data pipelines.

    30

    Reference Architectures Analysis

    3.4.6

    Transparency

    During the last couple of years, financial organizations and customers of digital

    finance services raise the issue of transparency in the operation of BigData systems

    as a key prerequisite for the wider adoption and use of BigData analytics systems
    in

    financial, sector use cases. This is particularly important for use cases involving
    the

    deployment and use of AI/ML systems that operate as blackboxes and are hardly

    understandable by finance sector stakeholders. Hence, a key requirement for AI/

    ML financial sector applications is to be able to explain their outcomes. For
    exam-

    ple, a recent paper by bank of England [Bracke19] illustrates the importance of

    providing explainable and transparent credit risk decisions.

    Overall, INFINITECH shall provide support for transparency in AI/ML work-

    flows based on the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques
    such

    as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) [Ribeiro16], which

    develops/finds a local model around the prediction that is interpretable. XAI
    tech-

    niques should be supported as part of the ML techniques of the project, but also
    as

    an add-on to them as in several cases they will be used to interpret the outcomes
    of

    other ML/ AI techniques (e.g., some classifiers).

    3.5

    Reference Architecture for Big Data/IoT/AI in

    Finance/Insurance

    INFINITECH introduces and validate a Reference Architecture (RA) for BigData,

    IoT and AI applications in the financial and insurance sectors (INFINITECH-

    RA), which will serve as a blueprint for the rapid and cost-effective solutions
    devel-

    opment and deployment. The INFINITECH-RA will specify a set of building

    blocks that will support advanced BigData, AI and IoT applications. These building

    blocks will support scalable, unified and interoperable data collection from different

    sources and databases (e.g., OLTP-On-Line Transactional Processing, OLAP-On-

    line Analytical Processing, Data Lakes, SQL databases, NoSQL databases, alter-

    native data sources), efficient real-time predictive analytics, multi-channel/Omni-

    channel interactions, data governance functionalities, as well as interoperable
    data

    sharing and interactions between stakeholders of the financial & insurance value

    chains. INFINITECH-RA will specify the structuring principles that will drive

    the integration of these building blocks in real-life solutions. The INFINITECH-

    RA will serve as a basis for designing, developing and deploying novel BigData,

    AI and IoT solutions that feature “SHARP” (Smart, Holistic, Autonomy, Per-

    sonalized and Regulatory Compliance) characteristics. The project will also pro-

    vide a number of blueprints for developing and deploying solutions aligned to
    the

    INFINITECH-RA. The blueprints will be based on the elaboration of different

    INFINITECH Reference Architecture

    31

    designs and deployment configurations that will be tailored to the needs of spe-

    cific solutions. Both the INFINITECH-RA and its relevant blueprints will address

    functionalities that are prioritized as part of the SRIA (Strategic Research and
    Inno-

    vation Agenda) of the BDVA (BigData Value Association), while considering and

    consolidating concepts from RAs introduced by relevant standardization bodies
    and

    associations. [the proposal]

    It will provide an overall of the technical requirements and specifications driving

    the project, as well as the detailed specification of the INFINITECH data models,

    technology/regulatory building blocks and the INFINITECH-RA. In here the fol-

    lowing objectives are satisfied: (i) To articulate stakeholders’ requirements
    regarding

    BigData and IoT-based services with SHARP properties in the financial and insur-

    ance sectors; (ii) To refine and detail the SHARP properties of various services

    in the target sectors; (iii) To analyze the background BigData and IoT platforms

    that will support the pilots and testbeds of the project, and to detail how they
    will

    be enhanced in order to empower the INFINITECH vision; (iv) To specify the

    security and regulatory compliance requirements of the INFINITECH services,

    while at the same time specifying the relevant solutions to be used in the project;

    (v) To specify the capabilities of the testbeds that will support the development
    and

    deployment of SHARP services; (vi) To specify the INFINITECH-RA.

    3.6

    INFINITECH Reference Architecture

    Reference Architecture (RA) of the INFINITECH project aimed to develop Smart,

    Autonomous and Personalized Services in the European Finance and Insurance Ser-

    vices Ecosystem. The INFINITECH partners have selected a methodology to work

    on the RA, identifying it in the “4 + 1” architectural view model, which is pre-

    sented in the document. The methodology is based on five different views, from

    which the structure of the system can be analyzed (logical view, process view,
    devel-

    opment view, physical view and scenarios). Moreover, it will be demonstrated that

    all the functionalities of INFINITECH environment are properly covered by this

    model. [D2.13]

    The State-of-the-Art survey underlines that some already existing Reference

    Architectures provide substantial input to INFINITECH, such as the pipelined

    and workflow approach to support the functionalities of the different Pilots and
    Use

    Cases of the project. Relevant inputs to the task have been considered, in particular

    the input coming from use-cases considered in task “User Stories and Analysis
    of

    Stakeholders’ Requirements” and a cross reference matrix. [D2.13]

    Finally, a layered and high-level reference view and a detailed logical view of

    the RA are presented. Different layers have been identified (infrastructure, data

    32

    Reference Architectures Analysis

    management and protection, data processing and architecture, analytics, inter-

    face, and presentation/visualization). The layers are mainly a mean of classification

    of the building blocks to form different workflows. The resulting RA provides
    a

    schema for building solid workflows and ensures full communication and interac-

    tion between all the building blocks, from the data source level (at the infrastructure

    level of the organizations) up to the Data Stores and Processing Analytics to
    pre-

    sentation and visualization applications. [D2.13]

    High-Performance Computing (HPC) can be distributed at nodes within the

    platform supporting a high degree of scalability. Moreover, RA considers for

    external data sources such as public and private Data Lakes, IoT networks and

    Blockchains. A list of identified building blocks provides the basic functionalities

    of the INFINITECH reference sandbox for a more general class of use cases. Build-

    ing blocks will be identified where existing technologies are available while
    other

    components will be designed, implemented, and integrated according to different

    assigned tasks. [D2.13]

    The validity of the RA has been proved by a mapping the workflows of the pilots

    of the projects, ultimately proving the conceptual approach of the INFINITECH

    RA. [D2.13]

    The RA constitutes a living solution constantly verified during the continu-

    ous project development and in particular with the different pilots. Moreover,
    the

    Consortium will promote the RA, along with its methodology and technological

    advancements, during project dissemination as a more general solution applicable

    to a broader set of different use cases beyond the original scope in the Financial
    and

    Insurance sectors whenever Big Data and AI are to be considered. [D2.15]

    RAs are designed for facilitating design and developments of concrete technolog-

    ical architectures, mostly in the IT domain, reducing risks with proven components,

    all while improving overall communication within an organization. Real drawbacks

    and benefits of RAs have been analyzed with respect to the project’s Pilots. RA
    facil-

    itated development of concrete IT architectures and reduced maintenance costs.
    In

    general, the value of RAs can be summarized in the following points: [D2.15]

    • Reduction of development and maintenance costs of systems.

    • Facilitation of communication between important stakeholders.

    • Reduction of risks.

    Typically, when a system is designed without a RA, an organization may accu-

    mulate technical risks and end up with complex and non-optimal implementation

    architecture. [D2.15]

    In the industry, complex infrastructures for big data systems and high perfor-

    mance computing (HPC) have been developed and proved to sustain intensive data

    INFINITECH Reference Architecture

    33

    processing services (Netflix, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc.). The architectures

    and technologies of world class infrastructure have been published and RAs have

    been designed and proposed. However, very few solutions have been published for

    the Financial and Insurance sectors. In the following sections, some relevant
    Refer-

    ence Architectures and Models will be considered along with their relevance to
    the

    domain sector at which INFINITECH is aimed. [D2.15]

    The purpose of a Reference Architecture is to provide a conceptual and logical

    schema for solutions to a large class of problems. In the INFINITECH project

    the domain is as vast as the Financial and Insurance Sectors where most of the

    applications are data-driven. The class of problems of the project (pilots and
    use

    cases) and in general the service management of financial institutions and insur-

    ance companies are largely based on data that should be managed in the safest
    and

    protective way. [D2.13]

    In these domains customers’ enormous data sets must be processed to derive

    information with the purpose to provide better and more competitive services

    respecting the complex and sometimes conflicting regulatory frameworks such as

    privacy, security, interoperability, etc. [D2.13]

    Therefore, a Reference Architecture should have explored in advance the specific

    domains in which the class of problems must find solutions providing a general

    model to which stakeholders (end-users, business owners, designers, data scientists,

    developers, maintainers etc.) can refer for best practices in the specific problem-

    solution space. In information technology, a RA can be used to check solutions
    to a

    particular problem in that class against the best practices and specific technologies.

    The INFINITECH RA is no exception, and it is the result of the analysis of the

    significant number of use cases in the project’s pilots, their requirements (users’

    stories) and constraints (regulatory, sector and technological) as well as the
    state-

    of-the art technologies and similar architectures. [D2.13]

    It is important to state what is the RA in the INFINITECH project:

    • A set of views for the Logical, Process, Development and Physical implemen-

    tations.

    • A set of common scenarios referring to generic use cases.

    • A way to verify the use cases’ scenarios and solutions.

    • A way to speak the same language among stakeholders.

    • A way to leverage solutions referring to best practices and building blocks.

    • A way to verify if constraints in requirements, regulatory, technical, and log-

    ical have been addressed properly.

    It is also important to state what the INFINITECH RA is NOT:

    • A ready-to-deploy technological IT framework.

    • A rigid and unmutable set of connecting building blocks.

    34

    Reference Architectures Analysis

    • A set of mandatory rules for development and integration.

    • A manual for implementation and rollouts.

    • A one-size-fits-all recipe for all business cases.

    The INFINITECH Reference Architecture (IRA) (shown in Figure 3.2 and

    explained in Deliverable D2.13), defines a set of layers and allows flexible work-

    flows out of data processing modules, called components that performs specific

    data transformations. A workflow usually consumes one set of data (sources) to

    produce another set of data (destinations). A component can be identified by the

    Input/Output interfaces and the functionality (transformation) provided at the

    edge. In that respect, a data component can be considered as a black box that
    can be

    replaced by any technological implementation that performs at the edge the same

    transformation. [D2.13]

    The Figure 2.1 depicts the different reference layers of the IRA along with exam-

    ples of data components. Scope of the section is to identify existing and desired
    data

    components that will support the design, the development and deployment of the

    Pilots’ sandboxes. [D2.13]

    The “black-boxes” follow predefined colors in order to map components in the

    different layers. An INFINITECH solution (sandbox) can be built organizing com-

    ponents in a workflow (sometimes referred to data pipeline) to accomplish a com-

    plex transformation from one set of data sources to another set of data solving

    the business case. Components should therefore be interoperable, with clear inter-

    faces and perform a clear function over the data. The rest of this section is
    a first

    attempt to identify the existing and to be developed components of the project.

    Further progress in the project will provide the needed details for implementation

    and deployment.

    The first step is the ingestion of data from the relevant data sources, typically

    stored in operational databases. This data ingestion is massive and takes many

    hours, a significant amount of time. The challenge here is to be able to acceler-

    ate data ingestion without sacrificing the querying speed that becomes crucial
    for

    the next steps.

    The second step is data protection that enables coordinating the invocation of

    components that implement privacy, security, or data protection techniques as
    well

    as other external services in order to provide a suitable privacy, Security and
    data

    protection level specified by a secure service provider compliance to regulations.

    Further, the data Protection Orchestrator coordinates several privacy, security
    and

    data protection components and services to ensure that the successive use of the

    data that have been protected can be processed or stored preserving their privacy

    and Security. It also allows the removal of the protection of the results (if
    required)

    before delivering them to the end user.

    Reference Architectures Analysis

    The next step is data processing. The development of ML uses cases for digital

    finance entails a series of data processing steps, which can be structured in
    end-

    to-end data management pipelines. INFINITECH-RA specifies building blocks

    for processing large datasets from their ingestion to the ultimate visualization
    of

    ML results. This approach is in-line with the operation of most ML platforms

    and tools (e.g., KNIME, Auto-SKLearn, MLBox) which facilitate the development

    and integration of end-to-end pipelines. INFINITECH-RA builds on popular ML

    concepts, as well as on best practices introduced by relevant Reference Architecture

    Models for the finance sector that have been introduced in the industry.

    INFINITECH’s Data Analytics Platforms are products developed to leverage

    the promptness and accuracy of the suspicious events recognition while reducing

    costs and optimizing procedural efforts.

    The interface group contains projects that provide UI functionalities of general

    purpose. This might include some user interfaces, visualization graphs that can
    be

    reused by pilots to show the results of analytical tools etc. It is important
    to highlight

    here that this group does not include front-end implementations that are specific

    to the pilots, rather than implementations that are generic and can be reused
    by

    each pilot.

    The data visualization is a layer that deals with visualization of data.

    In summary The INFINITECH-RA defines layers to logically group compo-

    nents. The identified layers are: [D2.13]

    • Data Sources: At the infrastructure level there are the source of data (database

    management systems, data lakes holding non-structural data, etc).

    • Ingestion: A layer of data management usually associated with data import,

    semantic annotation, and filtering from data sources.

    • Security: A layer for management of the clearance of data for security,

    anonymization, cleaning of data before any further storing or elaboration

    • Management: A layer responsible for the data management aspects, includ-

    ing the persistent storage in the central repository and the data processing

    enabling advanced functionalities such as Hybrid Transactional and Analyti-

    cal Processing (HTAP), polyglot capabilities, etc

    • Analytics: A layer for AI/ML components.

    • Interface: A layer for the definition data to be produced for user interfaces.

    • Cross Cutting: A layer with service components that provides functionalities

    orthogonal to the data flows (e.g. Authentication, Authorization, …).

    • Data Model: A cross cutting layer for modelling and semantics of data in the

    data flow.

    • Presentation/Visualization: A layer usually associated with the presentation

    applications (e.g., desktop, mobile apps, dashboards)

    INFINITECH Reference Architecture

    37

    In the end one should note that there are horizontal and vertical concerns.

    • Horizontal concerns cover specific aspects along the data processing chain,

    starting with data collection and ingestion, and extending to data visuali-

    sation. The horizontal concerns do not imply a layered architecture. As an

    example, data visualisation may be applied directly to collected data (the data

    management aspect) without the need for data processing and analytics.

    • Vertical concerns address cross-cutting issues, which may affect all the hori-

    zontal concerns. In addition, vertical concerns may also involve non-technical

    aspects.

    INFINITECH Data Pack

    4.1

    INFINITECH Data Pack

    The INFINITECH Data Pack is the set of files, schemas, and metadata model

    diagrams (Graphs) that represent the way the INFINITECH data is organised and

    structured. It contains the metadata in .ttl format and also contains the metadata

    in two different formats, .json-ld and .owl to ensure the Data Pack is accessible
    to

    different communities. [D4.3]

    The INFINITECH Graph Data Model is the documentation that describes in

    detail all the taxonomies and vocabularies from INFINITECH Core, FIBO (https:

    //edmcouncil.org), FIGI (https://www.openfigi.com) and LKIF (https://github.c

    om/RinkeHoekstra/lkif-core) domains used in INFINITECH and that describes

    and represent all the relationships between them to build the Data Representation

    of the INFINITECH Graph Data Model. [D4.3]

    The INFINITECH Core ontology compile the common vocabularies that are

    used across different fintech’s and finance domains in the INFINITECH Project.

    The objective of the INFINITECH Core Ontology is to summarize the common

    terms or vocabularies and establish their relationship based on similarities or
    equiv-

    alences. [D4.3]

    38

    INFINITECH Data Pack

    39

    This ontology is the compilation of vocabularies and taxonomies that are com-

    mon to the INFINITECH project and that are used in fintech’s and finance

    domains. The INFINITECH core ontology main purpose is to enable data inter-

    operability and data exchange by identifying the similar vocabularies that are
    used

    across different domains but because they pertain to different domains, the similar

    terms are not related. INFINITECH core establishes and define the relationships

    between them, facilitating the identification and definition of data exchange
    and

    data sharing. [D4.3]

    4.1.1

    FIBO, Financial Industry Business Ontology

    FIBO is a business conceptual ontology standard providing a description of the

    structure and contractual obligations of financial instruments, legal entities,
    market

    data and financial processes. The primary application of the business conceptual

    ontology is for data harmonization and for the unambiguous sharing of meaning

    across data repositories. This common language (or Rosetta stone) for the financial

    industry supports business process automation and facilitates risk analysis. [https:

    //github.com/edmcouncil/fibo]

    Figure 4.1 depicts the components of FIBO including foundations, business

    entities, securities , and financial business and commerce.

    4.1.2

    FIGI Financial Instrument Global Identifier

    The Financial Instrument Global Identifier is an open standard, unique identifier

    of financial instruments that can be assigned to instruments including common

    stock, options, derivatives, futures, corporate and government bonds, municipals,

    currencies, and mortgage products. [https://www.openfigi.com/api]

    Figure 4.2 illustrates the component of FIGI including organizations, finan-

    cial instruments with its name and identifier, global identifier, identifier,
    code, and

    ticker.

    4.1.3

    LKIF, the Legal Knowledge Interchange Format

    Legal Knowledge Interchange Format (LKIF) models legal rules of the kind found

    in legislation and regulations. LKIF is an Upper and Core ontology from the the

    ESTRELLA project. The OWL files are available on GitHub. [https://github.com

    /RinkeHoekstra/lkif-core] Figure 4.3 shows the components of LKIF including

    norm, action, expression, legal action, and role.

    4.1.4

    INFINITECH Core

    The INFINITECH Core is the baseline of vocabularies and taxonomies used in

    the INFINITECH Project and that summarizes the different concepts that are

    overlapping the different financial and insurance tech. INFINITECH Core indi-

    cates whether the component is reusable and part of the core INFINITECH infras-

    tructure or a pilot specific component. The INFINITECH Core is a top-bottom

    approach in order to identify all the vocabularies that are common cross ontolo-

    gies and define the reference INFINITECH Graph Data Model implementation.

    [D4.4 to D4.6]

    Rather than thinking in extending the reference ontologies and/or identifying

    new things/concepts and relations it is a better approach to create an INFINITECH

    INFINITECH Data Pack

    41

    Figure 4.3. Legal knowledge interchange format – LKIF.

    core ontology that grounds on top of the three reference ontologies. To do that,
    it

    is necessary to identify without any reasonable doubt all these commonalities
    while

    connecting them in one main model, the so-called INFINITECH core model.

    Figure 2.5 shows this process and the connections between FIBI, FIGI, and LKIF.

    The picture summarizes the relationship between INFINITECH core component

    based on subclass, property, and alignments. [D4.4. to D4.6]

    Figure 4.4 represents the conceptual alignments between FIBO, LKIF and

    FIGI. All the three ontologies have common concepts between them. For exam-

    ple, organization concept is defined in all the three ontologies. We have identified

    the common concepts and defined relationships between the common concepts.

    In Figure 2.5, you can see that “equivalentClass” relationship is defined between

    the concept representing an organization in FIBO, FIGI and LKIF. In the case of

    document concept, “subClassOf” relationship between document concept from

    The INFINITECH core model and data pack define a lingua franca necessary to

    minimize the shortcomings of fragmented data from distinct data silos while har-

    monizing the data organization and knowledge representation within enterprises.

    In particular, the financial sector is covered by using FIBO as reference model
    while

    insurance sector is covered by LKIF. Furthermore, data pack ontologies and mod-

    els for Internet- of-Things (IoT) derived from FIESTA-IoT or OpenIoT, are also

    considered, in order to consider one of the technologies that is driving the digital

    transformation where data are provided by ubiquitous devices. FIESTA-IoT pro-

    vides tools, techniques, processes and best practices enabling IoT testbed/platforms

    operators to interconnect their facilities in an interoperable way based upon
    cutting

    edge semantics-based solutions. [INFINTECH Technical Report D1.6]

    Example-TAHO (Traffic Analysis Hub Ontology)

    TAH have developed a unique platform called the Traffic Analysis Hub (TA Hub),

    which ingests vast amounts of media content from diverse sources and builds an

    interactive map of people trafficking routes and hotspots. This platform is currently

    being used by many NGOs, Enforcement Agencies, and Financial Institutions to

    identify where they can best focus efforts in identifying and exposing the criminal

    gangs behind the trafficking. The TA Hub prototype runs in a secure IBM Cloud

    environment that was designed to meet the security needs of these partners, and

    it includes IBM’s Watson AI and other analytical tools that analyze blended data

    to uncover Trafficking hot spots and routes that have not been evident before.
    The

    TAH tools are also pulling in and making sense of open source data, including
    thou-

    sands of daily public news feeds, to augment the data contributed by consortium

    partners, and to develop predictive capabilities in the future. [D6.3]

    Pilot #3 leverages innovative INFINITECH technologies/ components in order

    to meet its objectives. The pilot participants collaborate to develop an AI driven

    capability using KYC/KYB methods and semantic technologies over transactional

    data generated by the financial activities that identifies money-related profiles
    based

    on the data generated. Data profiles then can be associated with human profiles

    based on their financial activity. These profiles will be built into the Watson
    AI

    engine and will be combined with existing technology and data sourced from the

    TAH human trafficking platform. The results will produce a complete picture of

    people’s profile, people trafficking routes and the corresponding money flows
    back

    to the criminal organizations. [D6.3]

    Pilot #3 implements KYC/KYB methodologies and uses emerging technolo-

    gies investigating business innovation opportunities, as well as technology inno-

    vation for the banking sector and exploring the ways to reduce constraints that

    limit the development of new sharing data services. The Pilot participants are

    44

    INFINITECH Data Pack

    primarily financial institutions and organizations, investigating the introduction

    of data sharing capability to facilitate improvement of core banking and business

    capability alike the improvement of financial services. [D6.3]

    The pilot proposes that KYC/KYB, a service that is well known and extensively

    used in financial and insurance companies when onboarding new customers, can

    benefit from the ability to share data securely and effectively between inter-bank

    departments, banks and also external services. The Pilot looks after identifying

    data patterns that can be related to unlawful activities and innovate by looking

    at the potential for fighting against human trafficking activities. KYC/KYB data

    sharing is a key characteristic for improving the financial sector, particularly
    now

    with the advent of FinTech companies where more people are investing using online

    platforms making more disruptive businesses, banking sectors need to enable the

    creation of new products and services. [D6.3]

    Pilot #3 target is to build data profiles then can be associated, by use of

    INFINITECH semantic technologies, to human profiles based on their financial

    activity. These profiles named Red Flag Typologies will be built into an AI engine

    and will be combined with existing technology and data sourced from the Traffik

    Analysus Hub (TAH) human trafficking platform. The expected results are a capa-

    bility to produce a complete financial profile of people that may incur on illegal

    activities, trafficking routes and the corresponding money flows back to the crim-

    inal organizations. The adoption of the INFINITECH Way Foundations by Pilot

    #3 application offers numerous business innovations. [D6.3]

    Current Overall Application Scenario(s) for business innovation focuses

    on: [D6.3]

    1. Money flows detection based on transactional data, this is always an interest-

    ing topic in the area of finance and banking transactions.

    2. The identification of abnormal operations, which in today’s banking systems

    is a trivial activity but the identification and detection of current money data

    flows and its traceability across different banking entities and financial insti-

    tutions and organizations is yet a challenge and particularly when those trans-

    actions are associated to unlawful operations.

    3. Detection of potential human trafficking activities, human trafficking is one

    of the fastest growing crimes in the world today, representing a $150 billion

    industry, and infiltrating supply chains at many levels.

    4. Better understanding in how to fight and disrupt human trafficking crimes

    and put marked and indicators on transactions and/or operations that can

    be identified and thus end to the misery suffered by its victims.

    Technologies

    The following is a list of the possible technologies that may be useful in the
    fintech

    and insurance tech sectors, most of them are referred as INFINIETCH technolo-

    gies as they are included in some of the processes in the pilots while others
    are

    included by its relevance on the sector. This list does not aim to be extensive
    but

    includes basic descriptions for a general public understanding about all the relevant

    technologies as a summary.

    5.2.1

    Data Ingestion

    This technology is tasked with the capture, homogenization, distribution and stor-

    age of the datasets that support the connected car pilot. It involves the design
    and

    implementation of the IoT agents that adapt the data available from the Vehicle,
    as

    well as deploying the necessary modules for data storage and distribution (FIWARE

    Orion, FIWARE Cygnus, etc). As the data sources size increases, the technology

    will have to become more robust by polishing the performance of the deployed

    IoT agents.

    5.2.2

    Data Protection Orchestrator (DPO)

    It is an enabler for embedding and automating the assurance of security and privacy

    by design and by default in heterogeneous and complex business flow. It orches-

    trates various privacy and security management functions (such as access control,

    Technologies

    51

    encryption and anonymization). It will be used as part of the data governance

    Framework of the Project, and towards establishing the regulatory compliance tools

    in the project’s sandboxes. It requires Swagger specification of the components

    (PETs) that will be called via REST by DPO There will be developed the busi-

    ness flows to address the specific communication with the components.

    5.2.3

    Digital User Onboarding System (DUOS)

    It is a solution for dealing with virtual identities in a mobile device. It provides

    remote user registration using eID or passport. It is needed to use eIDs issued
    by

    European National authorities according to the EU eID schemas: eID cards and

    Passports There will be implemented the needed improvements regarding integra-

    tion with end users application (Bank application) that needs user authentication.

    5.2.4

    EASIER-AI

    EASIER-AI is an Hybrid (Cloud/Edge) platform that facilitates to develop, mea-

    sure, monitor and deploy your AI models. The platform facilitates the data science

    tasks and it is focused on working on Hybrid Infrastructure and exploiting data

    generated by IoT. The platform synchronizes Cloud and Edge, keeping the Edge

    always up to date to run always the most accurate model. By including this tool
    in

    the INFINITECH project, we aim to feed it with new dataset sources, resulting
    in

    the development of new ML models for the platform.

    5.2.5

    Driver Profile Classifier

    This technology is aimed at the use of high-quality vehicle data allows insurance

    companies to offer customized products. The application of supervised machine

    learning techniques is proposed to classify drivers’ profiles which generates
    a cus-

    tomized insurance premium. The resulting model is then deployed with Tensor-

    Flow serving and integrated as part of the cloud platform with a wrapper, achieving

    an accuracy of 85.7%. The inclusion of this model in the project could bring an

    improvement on the data analysis of the datasets, bringing an improvement to the

    model accuracy.

    Powerful dialog system with dialogs that are isolated and composable. – Built-in

    prompts for simple things like Yes/No, strings, numbers, enumerations.

    5.2.8

    Crowdpolicy Open (Innovation) Banking Solution

    Crowdpolicy Open (innovation) banking platform is a set of predefined and cus-

    tomizable banking web services and data models integrated with our own API Man-

    ager that supports access control, monitoring and authentication. Our solution
    puts

    the bank (or any monetary financial institution) in control of the third-party
    part-

    ner relation. The solution is full PSD2 & GDPR Compliance. Enhancement aim

    through INFINITECH project are : – technology scale-up is to democratize the

    use and exploitation of open banking APIs even for users with no development

    skills, building fintech software development kits. – implement a complete pro-

    grammable framework to integrate different services and apis using protocols by

    providing similar user experience as zapier, “yahoo pipes” and “IFTTT”. The main

    objective at the innovation perspective is to provide a graphical user interface
    for

    building data and fintech services mashups that aggregate open banking APIs, open

    available data sets and rules and creating Web based apps from various sources,
    and

    publishing those apps.

    5.2.9

    AI-Engine-for-Psychometric-Profiling and

    Personalization

    AI-driven engine to extract four categories of behavioral features, grouped accord-

    ing to the type of spending behavior they capture: (i) overall spending behav-

    ior, (ii) temporal spending behavior, (iii) category-related spending behavior,
    and

    (iv) customer category profile. The engine uses these features to predict the
    person-

    ality of customers.

    5.2.10

    Open Source AI/ML Frameworks

    These frameworks facilitate the development of AI/ML based tools, which shall

    be applied to Financial Crime and Fraud, e.g. on so called Instant Loans. Today

    Technologies

    53

    a number of open source tools for AI/ML development are available. The AI/ML

    community is progressing these technologies dynamically. This way it provides
    the

    basis for solution development and facilitate the specific solution of a wide
    range of

    business problems as in INFINITECH. This way, these open source tools provide

    the foundation for development towards off-the-shelf modules being part of the

    INFINITECH-RA.

    5.2.11

    Data Layer – REST API

    A Data Layer to support Security Data Model with REST API based on a not

    relational database (MongoDB). Supports heterogeneous sources. Developed upon

    FLASK-Python3 framework and dockerized to be deployed on Kubernetes infras-

    tructure. This tool aims to complete the wrap with standard I/O.

    5.2.12

    Terrier Information Retrieval Platform

    Search Engine for BigData sets that offers integration with Spark for distributed

    processing. We plan to extend Terrier with a new open source module that combines

    real-time data stream ingestion (via Apache Flink) with distributed database access

    (via LeanXcale) for real-time data indexing and updating from multiple sources,

    within WP3 and WP5. We will also expand Terrier with enhanced Python inte-

    gration, allowing easier use from common data science pipelines, such as those

    involving Pandas. This technology can be used for tasks such as searching/sampling

    financial product portfolios, user profiles or for providing recommendations.

    5.2.13

    Anonymization Tool

    A tool that anonymizes data in order to preserve privacy. It also provides metrics
    that

    allow to measure the risk of the anonymized data and the impact of the anonymiza-

    tion process on the utility of the data. The tool will be used in pilot #11 and
    pilot

    #12. The component needs a specific configuration/development for each pilot in

    which it is used.

    5.2.14

    Polyglot Database Management System

    The LXS DBMS is a polystore database that provides access to different and het-

    erogeneous datastores via a common interface. It allows for the data user to submit

    a query, whose scan operators can request data that are stored in external datastores

    and combine their intermediate results with data coming from other sources, either

    LXS internal datastore or others. For instance, a JOIN operator might require
    to

    JOIN table A (resigned in LXS) and table B (resigned in a MongoDB or a Hadoop

    54

    INFINITECH Technologies, Data and Processes

    DataLake). At this phase, there is a support for a limited target datastores,
    for Proof-

    of-Concept of the prototype. Moreover, the user has to write queries for the target

    datastores in the specific dialect. What is more, JOIN operations are not efficient,

    as they require all data resigned in an external datastore to be retrieved in
    the query

    engine level. The enhancements that are planned to be implemented are the fol-

    lowing: (1) Provide support for a variety of different datastores, according to
    the

    needs of the pilots. (2) introduce a novel SQL-like query language, so that the
    data

    user can write a query in a seamless way, and let the polystore interprete it
    to the

    target datastore. (3) improve the query engine in order to take into account scan

    operations (mostly part of the one of the JOIN arguments) that need to retrieve

    date form an external datastore. This will require the query optimizer to explore

    equivalent operation graphs based on the nature of the target polystore, the opera-

    tor to be able to push down operations to the target store, and the query processor

    to set up the corresponding data pipelines during the execution of the query plan.

    It is not clear at this moment, if the corresponding wrappers/connectors for each

    target datastore will be able to retrieve statistics to feed the query optimizer.
    This

    depends on the target datastores that will be used by the pilots, and their capabilities

    to expose this type of information.

    5.2.15

    HTAP Database for the Financial and Insurance Sector

    An ultra-scalable SQL Database and real-time big data platform that revolution-

    ize the business database management systems by introducing the next generation

    business database that can scale in any of the three Vs of Big Data (Volume, Veloc-

    ity and Variety). In more technical details, it provides an ultra-scalable transactional

    management system that can scale out to 100s of nodes, which is typically a bot-

    tleneck in traditional database systems that provide transactional semantics,
    while

    on the same time, is full SQL compatible and ensures all ACID transactional prop-

    erties. It additionally exposes an interface for direct access of its key-value
    storage

    engine, thus providing a dual access without downgrade transactional semantics.
    It

    offers OLTP and OLAP integration, thus providing support for HTAP that allows

    for analytical queries over operational data, which realizes the concept of real
    time

    business intelligence. Finally, it enables for the execution of polyglot query
    process-

    ing across different and heterogeneous data sources. Modules of the database will

    be used for implemented all building blocks of INFINITECH that are related to

    data management. LXS background technology will be enhanced in order to sup-

    port the data management building blocks: Mainly, it will be enhanced in order

    to comply with the requirements for HTAP support, and to be compliant with

    the target data sources that need to be accessed via the polyglot mechanism. More-

    over, it will provide support for real time query processing, enabling queries
    that

    Technologies

    55

    combine both streaming data with data at rest. Finally, it will provide the support

    for incremental and parallel query analytics. However, at this phase of the project,

    it is not yet defined the exact technical details regarding these enhancements.

    5.2.16

    Natural Language Processing for Real-time,

    High-accuracy Credit Risk Assessment

    ReportBrain’s NLP functionalities: – Provide real-time structured feeds on risk-

    assessment worthy information sourced from the news – Interlink entities, updates

    and maintains knowledge graphs in real-time with all the interlinking of entities

    24/7 – Classify articles in real-time by their content (politics, business etc.)
    – Use its

    own models, identifies entities (organizations, persons and locations) in real-time.

    By using the AI enhancements that will be developed by Reportbrain in financial

    services & insurance sectors, users will be able to add an extra, yet orthocanonical

    feed to their existing credit rating models that will provide a real-time understand-

    ing of the world and more specifically on what’s if happening with specific entities

    (organizations & persons) of interest.

    5.2.17

    Machine Learning Algorithms for Health Related Data

    SILO has implemented such approaches in different health-related projects such
    as

    CrowdHEALT. SILO to make suggestions for the enhancement of the Platform.

    5.2.18

    Wenalyze Big Data Analytics Platform

    Platform that collect and process information from multiple open data sources

    regarding SMEs and apply cognitive algorithm to detect risk and changes in finan-

    cial needs. The tool will be use in pilot 13.

    5.2.19

    Octopush Geospatial Enabling Framework

    Octopush is a geospatial enabling framework, developed by AgroApps, allowing

    the collection, pre-processing, post-processing and distribution of geospatial
    data

    products and services, either referred to remote sensing (satellite, drones) acqui-

    sitions or multidimensional data outputs from numerical simulations. Octopush

    allows users to have access through a centralized access point to decentralized
    ser-

    vices, while Octopush SDK enables IT developers, to easily adapt or expand the

    provided geospatial services. Octopush was created by AgroApps aiming to adders

    the company/operations and services need for a modular system, independent from

    any third-party service provider (excluding those offering raw data like Copernicus,

    56

    INFINITECH Technologies, Data and Processes

    NASA etc.), a framework that will be easily adapted to the market needs and fol-

    low the service-oriented business model of the company. Octopush is the baseline

    framework that addresses the AgI companies need in geospatial information, either

    through the development of new services and data models or the adaptation of the

    existing ones. Some of the services that are currently offered by Octopush are:
    a

    significant number of Vegetation Indices derived from Optical and SAR imagery

    and crop specific biophysical parameters including leaf area index, chlorophyll
    con-

    tent and above ground biomass; crop specific yield estimation; farm management

    information services such as irrigation scheduling and variable rate fertilization;

    weather-driven models of possible pests and diseases outbreaks; high resolution

    weather forecasts and specific agrometeorological parameters; crop damage assess-

    ment services.

    5.2.20

    AgroApps Weather Intelligence Engine

    Weather Intelligence Engine, developed by AgroApps, is a numerical weather pre-

    diction and atmospheric data assimilation processing chain, based on the WRF

    numerical weather prediction model. Weather Intelligence Engine is producing

    operationally all the needed weather data products (Near-real-time, medium-range

    weather forecasting, subseasonal to seasonal forecasts) by AgroApps offered services.

    Weather Intelligence Service could take advantage of the available INFINITECH

    HPC resources, and pilot test a hybrid ensemble data assimilation scheme in con-

    vective scales.

    5.2.21

    Sentiment Analysis Tool

    Reportbrain Sentiment analysis tool uses application programming interface (API)

    calls to search existing news article index – Elastic Search Index. The results
    of

    the search are processed in Reportbrain’s Sentiment Analyzer and the outcome

    is returned to the caller as a REST API response. This means that articles that

    are requested by an authorized caller are evaluated in real-time for sentiment
    and

    returned to the API caller. Sentiment evaluation describes sentiment as 0 for
    neutral,

    −1 for negative or +1 for positive. The purpose of the RB News Article Sentiment

    API is to provide the sentiment of articles selected by the user via a Query.
    In partic-

    ular, the RB News Article Sentiment API provides several fields, that could be
    used

    as filters to query on RB platform. These are: content, language and date. The
    user

    can retrieve the sentiment analysis to personalize portfolios of their clients,
    using

    valuable insights of positive/negative/neutral evaluation of news articles about
    the

    entity of interest.

    uploading of the data provider’s (public or confidential) datasets in the cloud
    plat-

    form that is one of the results of the ICARUS H2020 project. The data check-in

    mechanism is deployed on the premises of the data provider as a stand-alone desk-

    top application and receives as input a list of data check-in jobs that incorporate
    a

    set of instructions with all the actions that will be performed on a specific
    dataset,

    residing on the local storage of running operating system, in order to enable
    the

    data preparation and uploading of new datasets in a secure manner. Internally,
    the

    mechanism handles the orchestration and execution of the designed instructions

    with the use of incorporated (micro) services for the: (a) data mapping of data

    source entities to the designed common data schema, (b) data cleaning operations

    on the data source entities, (c) the anonymization operations on the data source

    entities and (d) the encryption of the data source entities . This list of (micro)
    ser-

    vices is expandable based on the needs of each platform. The data check-in mech-

    anism is offered in the form of a local client for all OS (Mac, Linux, Windows)

    and is designed and developed using the latest technologies for desktop apps with

    the aim to offer end-to-end security on the data preparation and data upload tasks.

    INFINITECH Components Specifications

    The INFINITECH Reference Architecture (IRA) [Deliverables D2.13, D2.14],

    defines a set of layers and allows flexible workflows out of data processing modules,

    called components that performs specific data transformations. A workflow usually

    consumes one set of data (sources) to produce another set of data (destinations).

    A component can be identified by the Input/Output interfaces and the functional-

    ity (transformation) provided at the edge. In that respect, a data component can
    be

    considered as a black box that can be replaced by any technological implementation

    that performs at the edge the same transformation.

    Figure 5.1 depicts the different reference layers of the IRA along with examples

    of data components. Scope of the section is to identify existing and desired data

    components that will support the design, the development and deployment of the

    Pilots’ sandboxes.

    An INFINITECH solution (sandbox) can be built organizing components in a

    workflow (sometimes referred to data pipeline) to accomplish a complex transfor-

    mation from one set of data sources to another set of data solving the business
    case.

    Components should therefore be interoperable, with clear interfaces and perform

    a clear function over the data. The rest of this section finally describes the
    existing

    and to be developed components of the project. Further progress in the project
    will

    provide the needed details for implementation and deployment.

    Data Component Description

    In the following a first list of the identified components, are described using
    a stan-

    dard template described in the table below.

    5.3

    Data Components

    5.3.1

    Relational Database

    This component consists in the central data repository of the platform. It enables

    transactional semantics and provides capabilities for query processing based on
    stan-

    dard SQL statements. It can scale out on the runtime while continuing serving

    operational workloads. It can support analytical processing in combination with

    operational data modifications with the level of isolation to be snapshot isolation.

    That is, it enables real-time business analytics. The data repository is written
    in Java

    and C, and provides support for JDBC, ODBC and python drivers. It runs on K8S

    cluster.

    5.3.2

    Polyglot Query Processing

    This component enables the query execution over more than one datastore in seam-

    less manner. The data user can submit a single statement and let this component
    to

    Data Components

    63

    execute the query by pushing it down to the target database. By doing this, it
    can

    process the data on premise, and retrieve only the results, thus it is convenient
    for

    cases where data cannot be loaded the platform and they need to be accessed from

    an external datastore. This component is implemented in Java. It is an extension
    of

    the central repository itself. In fact, it consists of a jar binary which is loaded
    in the

    classpath of the query engine of the data repository. As of that, it will be deployed

    as part of the query engine via K8S cluster.

    5.3.3

    Incremental Analytics

    This component enables the query execution in an incremental fashion. The data

    user will be able to submit a continuous query to the datastore, which will be
    con-

    tinuously and incrementally validated. This means that the initial results will
    be

    retrieved first, and as data arrives to the data repository, they will be validated
    against

    the submitted query, and if it validates the statement, it will be returned to
    the user.

    This component is implemented in Java. It is an extension of the central repository

    itself. In fact, it consists of a jar binary which is loaded in the class path
    of the

    query engine of the data repository. As of that, it will be deployed as part of
    the

    query engine via K8S cluster.

    5.3.4

    OneHotEncoder

    Service to represent categorical variables as binary vectors. It is a BDA service
    reg-

    istered in the ALIDA catalogue. It is a PySpark-based micro-service running on

    K8S Spark cluster mode, working as part of the ALIDA framework. In a nutshell,

    ALIDA is a Micro-service based platform for composition, deployment, optimiza-

    tion, execution and monitoring of pipelines of Big Data Analytics (BDA) services.

    ALIDA is a result of previous research activities developed by ENG. Currently,
    it is

    a work in progress. ALIDA offers a catalogue of BDA services (ingestion, prepara-

    tion, analysis, visualization): user designs his own (stream/batch) pipeline by
    choos-

    ing the BDA services from it, indicates which Big Data set he wants to process,

    launches and monitors the execution of the pipeline and personalizes the results

    visualization by choosing from a set of available graphs, all this without worrying

    about having software developer skills or particular knowledge on big data tech-

    nologies. This service is registered in ALIDA catalogue as Spring Boot Application

    containing the python code and its dependencies. After implementing the algo-

    rithm using Pyspark, creating the Dockerfile and pushing the new image inside
    a

    repository, this microservice is registered into the ALIDA catalogue through the

    GUI. Source: https://home.alidalab.it/.

    INFINITECH Technologies, Data and Processes

    5.3.5

    Stream Processor

    This component will provide streaming processing capabilities. The data user can

    declare continuous queries that will be executed over the data stream. It will
    also

    allow to combine streaming data with data at-rest and enable the storage of data

    streams even when injected in very high rates. This component will be based on

    Apache Flink and will be containerized to be deploy with a K8S cluster. This com-

    ponent can exploit the capabilities of the declarative real time analytics. This
    will

    be very useful in cases where the data user wants to calculate a value over a
    stream

    that will need to perform an expensive scan operation over a data table (i.e.
    com-

    pare the input with the overall average of a field in a table). As scan operations
    (and

    operations that will require a scan operation, as the average etc) have a complexity

    bigger then O(1), they are timely costly and cannot be executed in a stream. For

    that, the developer often caches that value and periodically updates the value.
    With

    the declarative real-time analytics, the data user is given the opportunity to
    declare

    such an analytical operation (i.e. the overall average) with an SQL fashion, and
    the

    query will be executed with a complexity of a get operation, which will allow
    these

    types of analytical operations to be included in a stream operation, providing
    to

    it the current average, with respect to data consistency and isolation in terms
    of

    ACID properties and transactional semantics.

    5.3.6

    Online Aggregates

    This component allows for the execution of aggregate processing operators in

    an online manner. This way, the definition of the aggregate operations can be

    defined, and the result of the execution can be pre-calculated in an online man-

    ner, preserving data consistency and transactional semantics. When requested,

    the result of this execution can be retrieved with a GET operation, removing

    the need to scan the whole dataset. This component is based on the relation

    database component and extends its core storage and query engine. It runs on K8S

    cluster.

    5.3.7

    Data Collection

    This component provides the data ingestion mechanism that: (a) enables the acqui-

    sition and retrieval of heterogeneous data from a variety of diverse data sources

    and data providers, (b) facilitates the data annotation of the retrieved data
    by

    enabling the mapping between the data entities included in the retrieved data
    and

    the provided by the data provider data model, (c) enables the design and execu-

    tion of data cleaning operations towards the increase of the data quality of the

    Data Components

    65

    retrieved data. This component is based on Java and Python programming lan-

    guages. Additionally, Java Spring Boot, Flask, Pandas and NumPy frameworks

    and libraries are leveraged. This component is providing a highly configurable

    mechanism capable of addressing the various connectivity and communication

    challenges raised during data ingestion. Hence, the data provider is able to config-

    ure this mechanism in order to execute data collection pipelines that include
    data

    retrieval, data annotation and data cleaning operations which are tailored to
    their

    needs.

    5.3.8

    Anonymization Tool

    The anonymization tool modifies data in order to preserve privacy. It is especially

    indicated in those cases where a dataset contains personal data and it has to
    be

    outsourced or shared with a third party. The tool includes different anonymization

    algorithms that aim at avoiding the appearances of data combinations that could

    lead to a possible re-identification of the data subjects. It also includes a
    set of pri-

    vacy and utility metrics that allow to measure the risk that remains after anonymiz-

    ing the dataset, and the impact of the anonymization process on the quality of
    the

    data. The tool is based on two modules that can be deployed as a Docker container.

    The tool requires to retrieve and store the raw and anonymized version of the
    data

    from a relational database.

    5.3.9

    DUOS (Digital User On-boarding Services)

    Provides remote user registration using eID or passport, dealing with virtual
    identi-

    ties in a mobile device. It uses various identity proofing and verification services
    that

    link new user eID creation (virtual or derived eID) with government issued e-ID.
    It

    verifies electronic data stored on chip and machine readable zone. Provides Flexible

    Multi-factor authentication for different users or identities. Different underlying

    licenses (Apache 2.0 license for MRZ reader and license to be decided for biomet-

    ric checking).

    5.3.10

    DPO (Data Protection Orchestrator)

    The DPO embeds and automats the assurance of security and privacy by design

    and by default in complex business flows. It provides orchestration of Privacy

    Enhancing Technologies and related services using BPM tools in order to inte-

    grate privacy or data protection perspectives into business processes. It can
    orches-

    trate any kind of REST service. The DPO interacts with the privacy expert that

    prepares the business flow in a BPMN file. The flow interacts with PETs such as

    anonymization.

    INFINITECH Technologies, Data and Processes

    compatible with the most common data formats in the financial and Insurance sec-

    tor i.e. FIBO, FIGI and LKIF and additionally it uses INFINITECH Core Graph

    Data Model to enhance performance. The SeSAME component is designed as

    a dataflow/workflow execution framework connecting various data input/outputs

    through the concept of pipelines for creating the data mashup. Conceptually, each

    financial operator has input data or streams and SeSAME provides one output data

    or stream. The multiple inputs can be used simultaneously while a single out-

    put in RDF is provided. Only the final operator of a workflow can return a for-

    mat other than RDF, if necessary by defining and transforming the data into the

    desired format. The data Operators can be of three modes via APIs: API (1) a data

    acquisition operator is used to collect or receive data from data sources or gate-

    ways and can be pull-based or push-based. API (2) a stream processing operator

    defines stream processing functionalities in a declarative language, e.g., CQELS.

    API (3) a streaming operator streams the outputs of the final operator of a work-

    flow to the consuming applications. In these three API modes operators of the
    data

    transformations and alignments can be done to produce a normalised RDF output

    format.

    Semantics Streams Analytics Engine (SeSA-ME)

    The INFINITECH Semantics Streams Analytics Engine (SeSA-ME) and the

    related tools for enabling semantic data exchange is based on the development
    of

    an interoperability (ontology-based) database/registry supporting linking of diverse

    systems and datasets based on shared semantics, as well as semantically interoperable

    analytics. The SeSA-ME system includes tools along with a visual SPARQL query

    editor providing Swagger APIs for verification and visualization tools for novice

    users while supporting full access and control over the data mashups for expert

    users. Tied with the development of the SeSA-ME platform is the development

    and deployment of the INFINITECH Graph Data Model which enables the sup-

    port for both the design and deployment of stream-based web applications in a
    very

    simple and intuitive way and the analytics services using stream-based applications

    and services. [D4.6]

    Semantic Streams Analyzer Middleware-Engine – SeSAME, The SeSAME com-

    ponent is a data mashup builder for the financial sector that can be used as a

    data processing component for your data management application, it enhances the

    capacity to process financial and insurance data in the form of batches and provides

    76

    INFINITECH Technologies, Data and Processes

    a single output, it is ideal when multiple sources have different data formats,
    it is

    built to be compatible with the most common data formats in the financial and

    Insurance sector i.e. FIBO, FIGI and LKIF and additionally it uses INFINITECH

    Core Graph Data Model to enhance performance. The SeSAME component is

    designed as a dataflow/workflow execution framework connecting various data

    input/outputs through the concept of pipelines for creating the data mashup. Con-

    ceptually, each financial operator has input data or streams and SeSAME provides

    one output data or stream. The multiple inputs can be used simultaneously while
    a

    single output in RDF is provided. Only the final operator of a workflow can return
    a

    format other than RDF, if necessary by defining and transforming the data into
    the

    desired format. The data Operators can be of three modes via APIs: API (1) a data

    acquisition operator is used to collect or receive data from data sources or gateways

    and can be pull-based or push-based. API (2) a stream processing operator defines

    stream processing functionalities in a declarative language, e.g., CQELS. API
    (3) a

    streaming operator streams the outputs of the final operator of a workflow to
    the

    consuming applications. In these three API modes operators of the data transfor-

    mations and alignments can be done to produce a normalised RDF output format.

    Enhanced Distributed Reasoner over FinTech Ontologies – EnDoRFIN Seman-

    tic Reasoner, The EnDoRFIN component is a tool for inferring knowledge from

    data streams, it uses some rules as conditions for defining logics conditions
    and

    as a result logical consequences are provided as outcomes. The inference rules
    are

    defined based on the most commonly used financial and insurance vocabularies i.e.

    FIBO, FIGI and LKIF and the way to process the rules is using APIs for defining

    the logical descriptions for the data applications it is introduced. This component

    allow the use of other languages but need to be upgraded to the target vocabulary

    and additionally the EnDoRFIN uses INFINITECH Core Graph Data Model

    to ensure the inference is applicable to all the involved domains in FINTECHs.

    of the

    CI/CD pipelines to i) make their solutions available to other partners and ii)
    auto-

    mate the deployment of a pilot. [Blueprint guidelines for the INFINITECH Way

    Foundations deployments of project pilots and technologies]

    It makes use of an imaginary pilot solution that has been implemented to validate

    the process and can be used as a reference for other pilots to help them build
    their

    solutions. This reference pilot makes use of tow INFINITECH building blocks,

    the infinistore and the lx-kafka, and a micro-service that has been implemented

    Processes

    77

    specific for the needs of that pilot. In this document, we will see how we organize

    the code and artefacts: platform building blocks which are artefacts provided
    by

    INFINITECH, must go under the corresponding groups in order to be available

    for all pilot solutions, while pilot specific solutions must go under separate
    groups.

    We provide guidelines on how to create new projects under specific groups, setup

    the Dockerfile that instructs the CI process on how to build the image, and how
    to

    define the CI process itself, by making use of a Jenkins file. Finally, at the
    last step,

    we provide guidelines on how to make use of the CD process to define the arte-

    facts that the solution consists of and how to automate the deployments. Blueprint

    INFINITECH Way Foundations can be used to setup the Dockerfile that

    provides

    guidelines on how to make use of the CD process to define the artefacts that the

    solution consists of and how to automate the deployments. On the contrary with

    the CI pipelines, the CD pipelines are not triggered automatically. The reason
    is

    that we cannot afford to deploy all 16 Pilots solutions in the AWS resources.
    Due

    to this, the deployment will be started manually, for validation purposes. Blueprint

    KYC/KYB

    The Know Your Customer (KYC)/Know Your Business (KYB) policies in state-of-

    the-art financial relations expect that customer parties, either individuals or
    entire

    corporations, endeavour verification of their identity. Thus, each financial organi-

    zation is able to estimate the risks involved with sustaining a new business-customer

    partnership. In this context, together with the wider Finance field of Anti-Money

    Laundering (AML) procedures, every financial institution establishes KYC and

    KYB operations at the time they register a new customer. [D4.8]

    The KYC/KYB blockchain application resolves the implementation of such

    industry mechanisms by utilizing blockchain technology as a basic background

    infrastructure. Security, immutability and controlled transparency rule inside
    large

    enterprise blockchain networks while they offer efficiency of tasks and effectiveness

    of transactions within the corporation and its members. Ultimately, blockchain

    technology simplifies the emerging use cases and directly addresses any possible

    issues that are created. [D4.7 to D4.9]

    Particularly, a KYC/KYB mechanism ensures that the identification and veri-

    fication of a customer occurs against national and international regulations and

    78

    INFINITECH Technologies, Data and Processes

    laws set by governments, commissions, central banks and financial associations.
    As

    both the customer profile information and the relevant laws and rules are subject

    to changes over time, their update and maintenance become complicated. More-

    over, their centralized systems are exposed to data protection and cyber-security

    risks, which become cheaper to launch while they are led by more sophisticated

    adversaries year by year. [D4.7 to D4.9]

    Blockchain technology and particularly permissioned blockchain networks are

    capable of providing security to the KYC and KYB processes through decentraliza-

    tion. The concept of decentralization mainly exploits the idea that the information

    is replicated across all network nodes, while sabotaging one or more nodes cannot

    harm the information integrity and a single point of failure is avoided. In particular,

    the permissioned blockchain technology promises to keep that sensitive informa-

    tion inside a private network where only privileged parties can access it with
    an

    insider invitation. Thus, the customer information is kept safe on a private ledger

    that offers transparency to a privileged group of legal network participants.
    Both

    the customer and the organization are able to perform create, read, write, delete

    (CRUD) operations on the data under pre-defined access control policies. The var-

    ious features of permissioned blockchains enable different policies applications
    that

    are able to, for instance, separate legal parties into a higher privacy network
    run-

    ning inside the initial private one. Improved privacy control and data immutability

    rule inside the aforementioned technological scenario while they ensure legitimate

    customer data protection and management together with proper administration of

    this data by financial enterprises. [D4.7 to D4.9]

    Figure 5.2 depicts High-level architecture of the KYC/KYB solution. The

    KYC/KYB system is related to different stakeholders including customers, financial

    organizations, and financial institutions. It is ultimately connected with personal-

    ized blockchain network.

    Self-assessment

    The INFINITECH Readiness Level (IRL) is a self-assessment method created to

    evaluate and provide guidance during the adoption process of generic or specific

    technology assets and/or technology conditions related to the deployment phase

    of a pilot project. IRL‘s main objective is to act as a tool for project pilot
    lead-

    ers to help them and guide them in their process to identify and select ready-to-

    go technologies, in particular IRL also is useful in the on-boarding process of
    the

    INFINITECH Way Foundations where technologies that have been developed in

    advance can be adopted at any stage duration the execution of the project pilots.

    IRL is applicable to any program (i.e. INFINITECH pilot) at any stage that

    operates or want to make use of the technology assets that are developed or imple-

    mented for the financial and insurance sectors, the IRL defines 5 levels scored
    1 to 5

    where 1 is the lowest level and 5 is the highest level. IRL can be used directly
    in the

    INFINITECH Pentagon (i.e. kiviat diagram) as it can be mapped directly within

    the innovation process/radar facilitating in this way the path towards achieve
    high

    levels of Innovation. [Innovation Readiness Assessment]

    IRL provides to any project (INFINITECH pilot) the capacity to self-assess the

    level of adoption following identified technological characteristics in different
    tech-

    nology domain areas i.e. Data Modeling and Data Interoperability, Infrastructure

    Deployment and Services Platform Adoption, Information Management and Ana-

    lytics and Intelligent Applications. The technology domain areas are defined by

    following the requirements from ICT experts into a full-stack implementation and

    the IRL method allows the self-assessment of the evolution of the pilot project

    during the phase of adoption or onboarding process. IRL also adds the temporal

    dimension to an onboarding process which helps to not only self-assess the way
    the

    project is being implemented but also the validity of the process for following
    that

    path. [Innovation Readiness Assessment]

    INFINITECH Way Foundations Impact on Fintech and

    Insurance

    The financial and insurance sector have not yet an adopted/accepted unified way

    of accessing & querying vast amounts of structured, unstructured, and semi-

    structured data. It is envisioning that a semantic approach can increase data
    inter-

    operability and improve the OLTP (On-Line Transactional Processing) databases,

    OLAP (On-line Analytical Processing) databases and data warehouse which will

    reflect a potential benefit in the financial sector. The new technologies are
    having

    positive impact in all industries, and the FinTech’s are not an exception, the
    effort

    and cost that is associated to finance and banking services with the development
    of

    BigData analytics and AI systems is compensated with the number of opportunities

    and economic benefits. [D4.4 to D4.7]

    In recent years, the convergence of Internet technologies for communication,

    computation and storage networks and services has been a clear trend in the Infor-

    mation and Communications Technology (ICT) domain, beyond the fact that data

    fragmentation is an issue, there is also a lack of data interoperability across
    diverse

    datasets that can be reduced by using semantic technologies, however semantics

    81

    82

    INFINITECH Way Foundations Impact on Fintech and Insurance

    can be used to alleviate this concurrent issue by using the semantic descriptions

    that refer to the same data entities with similar (yet different) semantics as
    the way

    to improve interoperability. Currently there is an increasing production of finan-

    cial data and likewise an increase on the demand for such Information and in the

    other hand there is also a growing production of data coming from financial sec-

    tors, growing exponentially the number of sources of information, and thus it
    is

    necessary tools and systems that allows and facilitate that financial information
    can

    be accessed and integrated in a systematic, standardised, and cost-efficient manner.

    [D4.4 to D4.7]

    Semantic web technologies are taking more relevance in the financial sector and

    systems where the information needs to be shared making the information read-

    ily useful for solving many scalability issues. Consequently, remarkable efforts
    have

    been invested to enable data interoperability, so that pieces of data can be plugged

    in into the data infrastructures, directly exposing their own data semantics instead

    of using the data itself, facilitating exchange services. By introducing semantic
    tech-

    nologies, INFINITECH project provides an overlay that is much easier to process

    and at the same time minimize the risk on processing data. This semantic layer

    approach constitutes also the first step of the INFINITECH pipeline, i.e., gath-

    ering semantically annotated data from provided and/or available datasets or data

    streams. In this deliverable, we have described how INFINITECH project would

    benefit from semantic technologies like Linked Data and ontologies as the best

    practices in the semantic interoperability building process. [D4.4 to D4.7]

    Following semantic best practices, we have design and implemented the Seman-

    tic Stream Analytics Middleware-Engine (SeSA-ME) analyzed the already exist-

    ing ontologies that are related to the finance and insurance sectors and that
    can

    be reused for our purposes in the INFINITECH project. The main ontologies

    which are going to be used as baselines are FIBO, FIGI and LKIF, because they

    focused on both financial sector and financial operations containing the baseline

    for the metadata that represent, cross-domain and intra domain, financial transac-

    tions, and operations with an attached effort towards standardization. The INFIN-

    TECH Core ontology is an extension generated in the project that describes cross-

    domain vocabularies that are used in multi-domains within the INFINITECH

    project domain areas, it is meant to be complemented by other domain specific

    vocabularies. For this reason, and according to the initial requirements of the

    INFINITECH project, other vocabularies specifically related to security and pay-

    ments are presented. [D4.4 to D4.7]

    The project has successfully designed and used a holistic framework called

    INFINITECH Business Approach or “INFINITECH Way Foundations” to

    navigate through the design, development, and deployment of technology solu-

    tions in the financial services and insurance sectors.

    INFINITECH Way Foundations Impact on Fintech and Insurance

    83

    The project develops and validates a rich set of novel BigData and AI systems

    including BigData architecture, Data store, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms,

    anonymization and digital on-boarding technologies, decentralized systems for
    dig-

    ital finance, semantic interoperability technologies, etc.

    In terms of foundation:

    • The INFINITECH reference architecture (RA) has successfully been com-

    pleted and shown how it applies to the 16 Pilots in development.

    • The INFINISTORE database design has been completed providing a unified

    and integrated framework for handling real-time and offline data. It comple-

    ments well the RA.

    • Significant work has been completed with respect to data governance, han-

    dling, cleansing, pre-processing, and anonymization.

    • A framework for semantic interoperability and data exchange across plat-

    forms, services and datasets.

    • The library of ML algorithms has been extended, including a finalized version

    of a federated learning algorithm.

    • The specification and prototype implementation of four blockchain proto-

    types for digital financial applications.

    • Existing technologies (Flink, Calcite, Kafka, Etherum, Amazon WS, etc.)

    have been successfully leveraged to address the specific challenges faced in

    the banking and insurance sectors.

    In terms of experimentation:

    • Multiple sandboxes have been developed and implemented allowing to test

    and experiment with 16 Pilots and various assets made available through the

    INFINITECH marketplace.

    • The virtual digital innovation hub (VDIH) has been integrated into the mar-

    ketplace and effectively launched.

    • The INFINITECH marketplace has been revised and the web presence

    updated, including numerous courses, workshops, and record webinars.

    In terms of exploitation:

    • First drafts of business models have been developed for each of the 16 Pilots

    (excluding the discontinued pilot 1) and the pilots evaluated by stakeholders

    relying on the INFINITECH Pentagram.

    • Work has been performed in identifying synergies among consortium mem-

    bers by introducing the Joint Exploitation.

    84

    INFINITECH Way Foundations Impact on Fintech and Insurance

    In term of framework

    • For each of the pilots’ lessons learned have been identified as a continuous

    quality improvement.

    Also, the technology developments have an impact on the implicit training of

    different actors:

    • Business users that have been training in the statistical nature of the results

    coming from such tools, and therefore the interaction and cooperation

    human-AI tools.

    • Business managers to assess the impact and specificity of the use of such tech-

    nologies.

    • Data scientists and software architects and developers that have been trained

    during the development of the present project.

    Frauds on financial services are an ever-increasing phenomena and cybercrime

    generates multi-million revenues, therefore even a small improvement in fraud

    detection rates would generate significant savings. This viewpoint, built on infor-

    mation sharing activities currently running in the banking sector, is also reinforced

    and strengthened by trusted industry reports.8910. With some surveys and reports

    pointing to issues, such as: “recover less than 25 percent of fraud losses”, “Increase

    fraud typologies globally, from recent years, include identity theft and account

    takeover, cyber-attack, card not present fraud and authorized push payment scams”,

    “6 is the average number of frauds reported per company studied”, “56% asked

    companies conducted an investigation into their worst fraud incident. many organ-

    isations are failing to respond effectively”. These, and other issues in these
    reports,

    demonstrate the importance of developing new technologies and approaches, such

    as real time analytics, to enhance the need of fighting against cyber frauds.

    Figure 6.3 summarizes the INFNITECH market impact. INFINITECH has

    impact on banks and financial organization counterparts in INFINITECH project

    since it is used in more than fifteen banks and financial institutions (pilots).
    The

    INFINITECH project results were presented to more than ten banks and financial

    organizations outside INFINITECH. INFINITECH assets used by more than ten

    fintechs and small and medium size companies (SMEs).

    INFINITECH has certain industrial impacts (as shown in Figure 6.4). There

    are nine testbeds that support the INFINITECH Way Foundations including

    87

    Figure 6.4. INFINITECH industrial impact.

    INFINITECH-Reference Architect. These testbeds provide the means for rapid

    product development in the light of changing and heterogenous requirements.

    Further, INFINITECH developed mature innovative bigdata solutions such as

    INFINITECH, and library of AI/ML algorithms. The project devised innovative

    blockchain systems like graph mining, federated learning plus blockchain personal

    data market.

    INFINITECH has open-source community impacts as well. It implements

    ERC1155 smart contract for Hyperledger fabric (Golang) (see Figure 6.5). It

    applies multi token standard including fungible token, non-fungible token, art-

    works, and tickets. It also introduces functionalities such as transfer, mint,
    burn

    token, and batch transfer.

    INFINITECH has scientific impact as well (see Figure 6.6). The project pro-

    duced an open access book. It is downloaded 17,000 times (in a week) an average

    of 1,000 per day. It is viewed almost 11,00 times on various Linkedin posts. It
    also

    includes additional impacts through scientific publications, conferences and open-

    source results. The scientific Impact also includes the three INFINITECH Series

    open access books.

    Digitization is changing the Financial Services for many years from core banking

    to multichannel banking industry with different types of devices [1]. For several

    years now, the waves of digitization, financial technology (FinTech) and insurance

    technology (InsuranceTech) are rapidly transforming the financial and insurance

    services industry [3]. For instance, this is illustrated by the rapid growth of
    FinTech

    start-ups. McKinsey tracked more than 2000 FinTech start-ups in 2016 expecting

    even many more undetected [1]. Moreover, FinTech investments have grown from

    1.8 bn USD in 2011 to more than 30 bn USD in 2018 with a CAGR of ∼ 50%

    p.a. [2]. [D2.3 snd D2.4]

    FinTech is assigned to different views. They are as well attackers as enhancements

    of incumbents. Furthermore, FinTechs are part of large ecosystems, e.g. within
    the

    Alibaba platform, and selling infrastructure, e.g. used for open banking [2].
    In chal-

    lenging times or the end of a market cycle that is moving to a downward potential,

    new measures are required to maintain steady growth. Analysts like McKinsey [4]

    suggest several levers for organic growth to be explored by banks. [D2.3 and D2.4]

    (1) risk management based on powerful analytical tools to prepare for a down-

    turn;

    (2) productivity, using modular utilities to materially change cost structures;

    and

    (3) revenue growth through an improved customer experience (CX), bringing

    a larger customer base and/or share of wallet.

    Essential to exploiting these profitability levers are the critical enablers of

    advanced data analytics and talent. AI shows a great promise in this field especially

    with the progress in modelling techniques and methods.

    This will facilitate moving to new data sources as e.g. IoT supplementing tra-

    ditional big data analytics in FinTech [2]. A rapid scaling of advanced analytics

    and AI tools is a key to successful growth from McKinsey’s point of view [4].
    For

    instance machine learning models can improve predictive accuracy in identifying

    the riskiest potential customers by up-to 35%. [D2.3 and D2.4]

    According to Juniper Research [5] “Technologies such as machine learning and

    blockchain are having a transformative effect on fintech, fundamentally altering
    the way

    financial services are delivered and driving fintech platforms to become the ‘new
    nor-

    mal’. Such technologies will make new use cases mainstream, including smart contracts,

    loan underwriting using AI to analyze non-traditional data sources, and personalized

    insurance policies based on IoT-generated data.”

    The highest impact of technology application in Financial and Insurance Ser-

    vices shall be obtained in the focus areas of INFINITECH [4, 5]:

    • Lending & Financing, i.e. Credit Risks (Pilots 1 & 2).

    • Wealth Management and Risk Assessment (Pilots 3 & 4).

    • Customer Experience and Payment (Pilots 5 & 6).

    • Regulation and Compliance, (Pilots 7 & 10).

    • Usage based Insurance, which includes personalized insurance products

    (Pilots 11 to 14).

    • Banking.

    INFINITECH Way Foundations Impact on Fintech and Insurance

    91

    Figure 5.3 illustrates the INFINITECH impact in its focus areas. In banking

    area INFINITECH induce banks to offer a better customer experience. In this

    way, incumbents improve their digital presence. Customers have limited appetite
    to

    switch providers therefore, it is expected that incumbents remain the sole providers

    of current checking accounts for customers and businesses. In the area of payments

    there is a need for quicker and more convenient methods of payments among cus-

    tomers and business. This induces more competition among service providers, mak-

    ing providers looking to make a land grab as soon as possible. It is expected
    that

    technology firms add payments to their ecosystems by providing convenience and

    have ready-made installed base of customers.

    In the lending and financing area, firms have new and novel sources for assessing

    applicants. Many new entrants target riches or improve the customer experience.

    Suppliers in this area keep expanding the market to include those previously

    excluded from financial services. FinTech suppliers continue to keep ahead of

    incumbents by catering to niches. Insurance companies use good fit, analytics,

    and technologies allied with consumers’ desire for personalized services. Incum-

    bent insurers invest heavily in new product areas coupled with low barriers to
    entry

    foe new start-ups.

    There are ever increasing numbers of niche areas to serve. Nowadays, insurtech

    business models become the new normal as incumbents able to replicate business

    models of insurtechs. Wealth management is another area in which INFINITECH

    has major impact. It appeals to millennials who are looking for new ways to look

    after their investment. It is a crowded market as consumer-oriented banks enter
    the

    market.

    The market in its current state is considered for rich that is the reason why
    sup-

    plier should consider broadening the market by income. Trust remains the most

    important issue in this market. As traditional banks begin to invest in this market,

    the standalone firms feel the pressure in their everyday business. Moreover, Regu-

    lation and Compliance, e.g. Financial Crime, Money Laundering, Fraud, includes

    strong opportunities to disrupt as Figure 6.7 shows. This area is covered by pilots

    7 to 10.

    As a side effect of the digital transformation in Financial Services, the trend

    towards persistent digital identities is accelerating. Indeed, “this is due to
    multiple

    points of failure in conventional identification and verification processes, particularly
    for

    online payment details but also in a variety of other sectors. Passwords and centralized

    repositories have both been highlighted as the core issue within the growing problem
    of

    identity fraud, and a variety of approaches have arisen to combat this.” [6]

    Conclusions

    This book provides an easy way to understand the design principles and the overall

    process of the INFINITECH project, it can be considered as a handbook of the

    INFINITECH Way. Whit ever-increasing changes in the landscape of finance and

    insurance sector, technologies towards more human-centric applications are being

    developed. With the advancement of technologies, fin-tech and Insurance-tech

    business models are being re-defined. We explain the INFINITECH Way in simple

    words, enhancing the state of the art by introducing the design principles and
    basic

    metrics. We demonstrate the practicality and applications of INFINITECH Way

    in multiple areas.

    In this book it is described and explained the advantages of INFINITECH

    Way in the on-boarding process which provide speed and agility in optimizing

    the design and implementation of financial services reference architecture. The

    INFINITECH Way mitigates the problems arising from dealing with complex

    vendor-lock and/or proprietary infrastructure. Also, in addressing Big Data, IoT

    and AI applications for the financial and insurance sectors, we expand on how

    INFINITECH Way is applied to validate a reference implementation.

    In this book it is described the core elements of INFINITECH Way, the

    INFINITECH Reference Architecture (RA). A reference architecture for BigData

    systems in digital finance can greatly facilitate stakeholders in structuring,
    design-

    ing, developing, deploying and operating BigData, AI and IoT solutions. It serves

    as a stakeholders’ communication device, while at the same time providing a range

    95

    96

    Conclusions

    of best practices that can accelerate the development and deployment of effective

    systems. This book has introduced the first version of such a reference architecture,

    namely the INFINITECH-RA. The latter adopt the concept and principles of data

    pipelines, which are in-line with the state of the art in BigData and Artificial
    Intel-

    ligence systems. It is also in-line with the principles of the reference architecture
    of

    the BDVA.

    In practice, INFINITECH-RA extends and customizes the BDVA RA with con-

    structs that permit its use for digital finance use cases. The INFINITECH-RA

    defines the structuring principles that drive the integration of the INFINITECH

    technical components and technologies.

    Furthermore in this book it is explained how INFINITECH-RA can be used

    to support the development of common BigData/AI pipelines for digital finance

    applications. In this direction, the book has provided some examples of popular

    pipelines. This book also provides an initial mapping of most pilots of the project
    to

    the INFINITECH-RA, using INFINITECH components and technologies. The

    presented RA will serve as a basis for the implementation of the initial versions
    of the

    MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of the pilots. These implementations will allow

    the collection of stakeholders’ feedback regarding the RA. Based on this feedback,

    the next versions/released of the INFINITECH-RA will be produced, including

    updates in the different views of the architecture. Furthermore, future releases
    of

    the INFINITECH-RA will consider a broader range of BigData, IoT and AI related

    capabilities developed in INFINITECH.

    In this first book series it is described the methodology applied for

    INFINITECH-RA which is based on review and analysis, architecture design, and

    fine tuning and updates. Further, we discuss general AI/BigData challenges such
    as

    different type of data sources, accessing heterogeneous data sources, and running

    analytics over stale data, analyzing real-time data to respond to events and create

    alerts and notifications as they events occur, and the existence of a lock between

    operational and analytical operations. Besides, we address specific challenges
    for

    financial sector. siloed data and business operations, real time performance require-

    ments, mobility, multiple channels management, automation, transparency are

    among many challenges that INFINITECH Way is tackling.

    The summary of the INFINITECH data pack which is the set of files, schemas,

    and metadata model diagrams (Graphs) that represent the way the INFINITECH

    data is organized and structured is described in details and the references to
    the

    relevant ontologies available in the market are included. Furthermore, all rele-

    vant taxonomies and vocabularies from INFINITECH Core, Financial Industry

    Business Ontology (FIBO), Financial Instrument Global Identifier (FIGI) and the

    Legal Knowledge Interchange Format (LKIF) domains used in INFINITECH are

    delineated and cited for more reference. Moreover, an example of Traffic Analysis

    Conclusions

    97

    Hub Ontology (TAHO) to further the case is provided. Finally a detailed list of

    INFINITECH technologies, data, and processes is included.

    This book details The INFINITECH Readiness Level (IRL) which is a self-

    assessment method created to evaluate and provide guidance during the adoption

    process of generic or specific technology assets and/or technology conditions
    related

    to the deployment phase of a pilot project. IRL’s main objective is to act as
    a tool for

    project pilot leaders to help them and guide them in their process to identify
    and

    select ready-to-go technologies, in particular IRL also is useful in the on-boarding

    process of the INFINITECH Way Foundations where technologies that have been

    developed in advance can be adopted at any stage duration the execution of the

    project pilots.

    Furthermore, the INFINITECH Way Foundations impact on FinTech and

    Insurance are described. It is of singular importance to know that the financial

    and insurance sector have not yet an adopted/accepted unified way of accessing

    & querying vast amounts of structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data.

    In this way INFINITECH Way provide a practical solution to real-world prob-

    lems. The impact of INFINITECH Way on several categories including founda-

    tion, experimentation, exploitation, and framework is sumarized.

    Finally, the process of adopting INFINITECH Way Foundations is described.

    Currently the INFINITECH Way Foundations are adopted by 16 pilots in

    INFINITECH project which are listed below under five categories. Each pilot is
    a

    showcase of how NFINITECH Way could be adopted by practical projects in the

    field.

    Foreword \nArtificial Intelligence: \nThe New Paradigm \nto Boost Society 5.0\n\
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) takes human intelligence and bio-inspired systems\
    \ \nas a reference and has application to numerous fields of society and science.\
    \ \nThe applicability and great transformation potential of AI rely on its deploy-\n\
    ment in manufacturing environments, with Industry 4.0 as an exponent, its \napplication\
    \ in the fields of biomedicine and reliable economic transactions, \nthrough blockchain\
    \ approaches, or the identification of social profiles, among \nothers very diverse\
    \ examples. All this makes Artificial Intelligence a great \nsuccess story told\
    \ in the first decades of the current 21st century.\nIndeed, although Artificial\
    \ Intelligence, as a field of work, dates from the \nsecond half of the last century,\
    \ its impulse has occurred in the first decades of \nthe 21st century. The reason\
    \ is mainly based on:\n• The huge availability of unstructured data that needs\
    \ to be analyzed \n(Big Data)\n• Today’s high-capacity and low-cost computing\
    \ systems with com-\nputing capabilities that are already measured in petaflops\n\
    • The development and progress of complex Artificial Intelligence \nstructures,\
    \ associated, for instance, with deep learning, hybridiza-\ntion of fuzzy networks,\
    \ or the development of Machine Learning\nThere is no doubt that one of the main\
    \ challenges that today’s society faces is \nto ensure the incorporation of AI\
    \ technology throughout its economy.\nxii Foreword \nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN\
    \ THE \nGLOBAL AND EUROPEAN CONTEXT\nMost of the world’s major economies are indisputably\
    \ betting on the promo-\ntion of Artificial Intelligence and its application to\
    \ all fields of society. Thus, \nthe US Government has already in 2016 invested\
    \ close to 970 million euros \nin research on AI technologies. Since then, the\
    \ country has been increasing \nits economic contribution to the development of\
    \ the field. On the other hand, \nwith its “Next Generation Artificial Intelligence\
    \ Development Plan”, China \nhas committed to achieving world leadership in 2030\
    \ and is investing heavily. \nAlso, other countries, such as Japan and Canada,\
    \ have adopted strategies in \nrelation to AI.\nIn the European context, for the\
    \ period 2018–2020, the Commission \ndetermined that it would invest around 1.5\
    \ billion euros in promoting research \nand innovation in AI technologies, enhancing\
    \ AI applications that can pro-\nvide solutions to social challenges, supporting\
    \ cutting-edge initiatives in the \nfield, and creating centers of excellence\
    \ specialized in AI research. Also, the \nCommission established the need to attract\
    \ more private investment in AI \nthrough the European Fund for Strategic Investments.\n\
    The European Commission proposal for the scenario that arises from \n2020, within\
    \ the current multiannual financial framework 2021–2027, consists \nof several\
    \ goals, including:\n• The improvement of the pan-European network of centers\
    \ of excel-\nlence specialized in AI\n• Research and innovation in areas such\
    \ as explainable AI, unsuper-\nvised Machine Learning, and energy and data efficiency\n\
    • Additional digital innovation poles, state-of-the-art testing, and \nexperimentation\
    \ facilities in areas such as health care, transporta-\ntion, the agrifood industry,\
    \ and the manufacturing sector\n• The creation of a data-sharing support center,\
    \ which will be closely \nlinked to the AI-on-demand platform and whose mission\
    \ will be \nto facilitate the development of applications for companies and the\
    \ \npublic sector\n Foreword xiii\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE \nIN THE SPANISH AND\
    \ THE \nANDALUSIAN CONTEXT\nWithin the Framework of the Preparation of the Spanish\
    \ Strategy for Science, \nTechnology and Innovation, the Ministry of Science and\
    \ Innovation has drawn \nup different sectoral strategies, among which the Spanish\
    \ Strategy for R&D in \nArtificial Intelligence acquires an indisputable role,\
    \ which allowed the devel-\nopment of the National Artificial Intelligence Strategy\
    \ (ENIA in Spanish). The \nENIA has six strategic axes:\n• Promotion of scientific\
    \ research, technological development, and \ninnovation in Artificial Intelligence\n\
    • Promotion of digital skills, the development of national talent, and \nthe attraction\
    \ of international talent\n• Development of data platforms and technological infrastructures\
    \ \nthat support AI\n• Integration of AI into value chains to transform the economic\
    \ market\n• Promotion of the use of AI in the Public Administration and in \n\
    national strategic missions\n• Establishment of an ethical and regulatory framework\
    \ that guaran-\ntees the protection of individual and collective rights, with\
    \ social \nwelfare and sustainability\nWhen it comes to Andalusia, the region\
    \ located in the south of Spain, the \ncurrent framework that defines the Andalusian\
    \ R&D Strategy, together with \nthe Smart Specialization Strategy for the Sustainability\
    \ of Andalusia for the \nperiod 2021–2027, called S4, will set the guidelines\
    \ for boosting the Artificial \nIntelligence application in the region.\nAndalusia\
    \ already has a remarkable position in the field of work. At the \nuniversities\
    \ of Seville, Granada, Malaga, and Jaén, there is a very relevant \ngroup of researchers\
    \ who carry out their scientific activities in the field of AI \nand who occupy\
    \ prominent positions in the world rankings of scientific impact \n(highlighting\
    \ the Academic Ranking of World Universities [ARWU] ranking \nor that of Stanford\
    \ University, among others).\nAs a final consideration, the following three aspects\
    \ should be underlined: \n(i) the enormous transformative potential of Artificial\
    \ Intelligence for society \nxiv Foreword \nin all its fields of development,\
    \ (ii) the economic transformation that has taken \nplace in the business world,\
    \ since seven of the ten companies with the largest \nworld market capitalization\
    \ in 2020 were already users or developers of this \ntechnology, and (iii) the\
    \ mandatory responsibility of public administrations \nto collaborate to promote\
    \ the Artificial Intelligence at the different levels of \nsociety, on the one\
    \ hand, and to establish the necessary ethical framework for \nits development,\
    \ on the other.\nPablo Cortés Achedad\nGeneral Secretary for Business, Innovation\

    \ Spain\nxxiii\nIntroduction\nIn the early days of the Spanish public university,\
    \ only teaching activities \nwere carried out, since this institution was considered\
    \ a place where students \nacquired knowledge which enabled them to develop a\
    \ professional activity. \nSubsequently, teachers with inquisitiveness began to\
    \ make some progress in \nthe discovery of new knowledge, going beyond what was\
    \ explained in the \nclassroom. These were the beginnings of research work, which\
    \ in recent years \nhas become widespread among most professors.\nMoreover, in\
    \ the past 40 years, some of these professors and research-\ners began to transfer\
    \ the knowledge acquired in their research to institutions \nand companies in\
    \ the surrounding area that required it. In this way, the pro-\nductive sector\
    \ has gained a crucial element for its innovation in products and \nservices,\
    \ not only formed by the R&D departments of large corporations but \nalso supported\
    \ by university research groups, with the knowledge of their staff \nand laboratory\
    \ facilities. This contracted innovation is known as knowledge \ntransfer, and\
    \ in Spain, it is included as the third mission of the university in \nthe Organic\
    \ Law on Universities and in the Law on Science, Technology, and \nInnovation\
    \ of 2011.\nAs a result of this relationship between teaching and research staff\
    \ and \ninstitutions and companies, university staff begin to complement their\
    \ research \nwork with the needs of society. It raises its concerns and researchers\
    \ begin to \nthink about how to solve them. This is mostly reflected in institutions\
    \ and \ncompanies that have to improve specific aspects or acquire new processes\
    \ that \nthey currently lack. In this way, the possibilities of our society are\
    \ improved, \nby creating jobs with high added value, requiring qualified staff,\
    \ and having \na competitive advantage in the companies that collaborate with\
    \ the univer-\nsity. During this bidirectional process, innovation and knowledge\
    \ transfer take \nplace from the heart of the universities to the environment.\n\
    Here we find a crucial characteristic of innovation, which is the concern to \n\
    solve a problem in society or to improve the current situation. Therefore, there\
    \ \nare researchers who also seek to anticipate customer needs and solve future\
    \ \nproblems.\nTraditionally, it has been thought that university innovation and\
    \ knowl-\nedge transfer were research contracted with institutions, through the\
    \ contracts \nof the articles of the Spanish Organic Law on Universities 68/83,\
    \ intellectual \nxxiv  Introduction\nproperty, etc. However, these are just tools.\
    \ In university innovation, it is an \nessential requirement to have agile processes\
    \ and tools that allow the knowl-\nedge generated in the university to be transmitted,\
    \ without the professors dying \nin a tangle of administrative tasks. Likewise,\
    \ it is not a reactive activity but a \nproactive one. As it is a function of\
    \ the Spanish public university, waiting for \nknowledge to be requested is not\
    \ an option. On the contrary, it is assumed that \nwork must be done to find those\
    \ who can use it or to facilitate the creation of \ninnovative companies.\nHaving\
    \ detected this set of activities associated with university innovation \nand\
    \ knowledge transfer, the University of Seville was a pioneer in Spain, creat-\n\
    ing a specific Vice-Rector’s Office for this purpose in 2004, the Vice-Rector’s\
    \ \nOffice for Technology Transfer. Recently, in the first call for proving the\
    \ results \nof six-year knowledge transfer in 2018, published by the Ministry\
    \ of Education \nand Vocational Training, the University of Seville has been the\
    \ Spanish uni-\nversity with the most professors who have achieved this recognition.\n\
    Among the most important actions during almost 20 years of promoting \nknowledge\
    \ transfer, the Research Foundation of the University of Seville stands \nout,\
    \ as an entity that provides an administrative structure that adjusts university\
    \ \ninnovation to the pace of business, as well as the company chairs, that is,\
    \ company \ndonation agreements that help deepen in new research areas of interest\
    \ to society. \nIn addition, innovative entrepreneurship is encouraged, boosting\
    \ the capacities \nand creation of companies. Also, it is worth mentioning that\
    \ the University of \nSeville is a global partner of the University of California-Berkeley\
    \ since 2016.\nFollowing the same line of innovation and knowledge transfer, this\
    \ book \nhas arisen as a result of a novel action that brings together examples\
    \ of the \nprogress achieved by the University of Seville in the unique project\
    \ “Innovative \nEcosystem with Artificial Intelligence for Andalusia 2025”. It\
    \ has joined a \ntotal of 22 subprojects, made of research groups, on the one\
    \ hand, and different \ninstitutions and/or companies that act as aggregate agents,\
    \ on the other, with \nthe common denominator of using Artificial Intelligence\
    \ to incorporate inno-\nvation in their lines of action and help them in decision-making.\
    \ The relevance \nof Artificial Intelligence, its interdisciplinary nature, and\
    \ its ability to acceler-\nate global solutions have turned this set of technologies\
    \ into a tool aimed at \ngenerating a new social and economic reality. Hence,\
    \ the transformative power \nof AI in the areas of health, sustainability, infrastructure,\
    \ security, and tour-\nism, among others, has motivated the integration of these\
    \ disruptive technolo-\ngies in all the subprojects that are the subject of this\
    \ book.\nThus, starting from different Artificial Intelligence techniques, such\
    \ \nas Machine Learning, Blockchain, Internet of Things, Big Data, Business \n\
    Analytics, Robotics, Cybersecurity, Augmented Reality, Building Information \n\
    Modeling (BIM), and Geographic Information System (GIS), the research-\ners involved\
    \ in the mentioned unique project, together with collaborating \nIntroduction\
    \ xxv\ninstitutions and/or companies, have studied different ways of taking advantage\
    \ \nof technological knowledge in the following sectors: health and social welfare;\
    \ \nrenewable energies, energy efficiency, and sustainable construction; advanced\
    \ \nindustry linked to transport; mobility and logistics; endogenous resources\
    \ with \na territorial base; tourism, culture, and leisure; agribusiness and healthy\
    \ nutri-\ntion; digital economy (see Figure I.1).\nThese eight sectors, due to\
    \ thematic similarity, will be collected in five \nchapters of this book, where\
    \ some of the progress of these 22 bidirectional \nlines of action (university–company)\
    \ will be specified. The current situation \nof the field in which specific research\
    \ operates, on the one hand, and its novel \ncontribution, on the other hand,\
    \ will be presented.\nTherefore, apart from Artificial Intelligence as the common\
    \ thread of this \nbook, its relevance is reflected in the set of aggregate agents\
    \ selected for the \nproject, that is, institutions, corporations, and medium-sized\
    \ companies, with \nan outstanding dynamism component, which will allow an appropriate\
    \ tech-\nnology transfer to society.\nThis research is aligned with the Spanish\
    \ Strategy for Science, Technology \nand Innovation 2021–2027, within the Government\
    \ Delegate Commission on \nScience, Innovation and Universities (28/12/2018),\
    \ which drew up the R&D \nSectoral Strategies, and this proposal is framed in\
    \ the Spanish Strategy for \nR&D in Artificial Intelligence.\nThe coordinators\
    \ of this work hope that the use of Artificial Intelligence \ntechnologies can\

    1\n1\nHealth and \nSocial Welfare\nThe health and well-being of citizens is a\
    \ key factor that must be guaranteed, \nas has recently become clear with the\
    \ global health pandemic. Being aware \nof this, the University of Seville research\
    \ groups apply Artificial Intelligence \ntechniques to address existing problems\
    \ from a multidisciplinary perspective \nand improve current solutions. The health\
    \ sector has large amounts of patient \ndata, which, when correctly analyzed and\
    \ visualized, will increase the effi-\nciency of the applied treatments. For this\
    \ reason, there are medicine, computer \nscience, or physics groups that address\
    \ different issues.\nAn example of this is the application of Artificial Intelligence\
    \ to optimize \nfocused ultrasound cleaning of implanted shunts in patients with\
    \ different \npathologies. An innovative technology is used for the non-invasive\
    \ preven-\ntive cleaning of shunts, valves, or catheters implanted in patients\
    \ with dif-\nferent pathologies. Artificial Intelligence on the data of test cases\
    \ determines \nthe optimal parameters for its application in diverse clinical\
    \ environments, \nadapted to the individual circumstances and the specific devices\
    \ used in neu-\nrosurgery, oncology, and other clinical areas.\nLikewise, another\
    \ example of robotics that allows automating medical \nprocesses is shown, guaranteeing\
    \ the quality and safety of the steps carried \nout during the process. It is\
    \ intended to improve health processes with the use \nof emerging technologies,\
    \ such as blockchain or the robotization of software \nprocesses.\nFurthermore,\
    \ there is another situation generated by the extension of life \nexpectancy in\
    \ modern societies and the social challenge that arises in the pre-\nvention and\
    \ treatment of neurodegenerative diseases suffered by the constantly \nincreasing\
    \ elderly population. The underlying problem is the investigation of \nchanges\
    \ in gene expression of individual neurons in response to nerve terminal \ndysfunction\
    \ in the brain of genetically modified mice. Within this experimen-\ntation, Machine\
    \ Learning methods are used for the bioinformatic analysis of \na data set that\
    \ includes thousands of cells with thousands of genes each. This \nissue has a\
    \ utility to be addressed in future therapeutic strategies.\nDOI: 10.1201/9781003276609-1\n\
    2 AI Knowledge Transfer \n1.1 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR \nTHE OPTIMIZATION OF\
    \ FOCUSED \nULTRASOUND CLEANING OF \nSHUNTS IMPLANTED IN PATIENTS \nOF DIFFERENT\
    \ PATHOLOGIES\nEmilio Gómez-González and Javier Márquez-Rivas\nABSTRACT\nFocused\
    \ ultrasound is an innovative technology for potential non-invasive, pre-\nventive\
    \ cleaning of shunts and infusion systems (valves, catheters) implanted \nin patients\
    \ with different pathologies. Artificial Intelligence tools are used to \ndetermine\
    \ optimal parameters for their application in various clinical settings, \ntailored\
    \ to the individual circumstances and the specific devices used in neu-\nrosurgery,\
    \ oncology, and other clinical areas.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe expanding implementation\
    \ of technologies based on Artificial Intelligence \n(AI) represents an authentic\
    \ revolution in most aspects of daily life, having a \nvery relevant impact on\
    \ Medicine and Healthcare (Gómez González & Gómez, \n2020). Diagnosis and treatment\
    \ methods powered by AI, and their combina-\ntions with augmented reality (AR)\
    \ devices, evolve toward personalized three-\ndimensional (3D) models, and to\
    \ the development of advanced simulation tools \nfor predictive, interactive visualization\
    \ of the response of organisms under dif-\nferent circumstances and stimuli.\n\
    The European Union considers the development of AI an essential area, \nparticularly\
    \ in Medicine and Healthcare, and has launched different initia-\ntives to lead\
    \ its scientific and technological advances and to establish the \nbases for their\
    \ implementation (Nepelski, 2021). One of these initiatives is \nthe ATTRACT Program,\
    \ which seeks to identify and support groundbreaking \ntechnologies with a clear\
    \ potential of application for solving societal, clinical, \n 1 • Health and Social\
    \ Welfare 3\nenvironmental, problems of high impact (ATTRACT Program, 2019). This\
    \ \nwork presents an extension of a successful project within the aforementioned\
    \ \nATTRACT Program (FUSCLEAN Project, 2020).\nSTATE OF THE ART\nThe project described\
    \ in this article addresses the preventive cleaning of fluid \ninfusion or drainage\
    \ (shunting) systems implanted in the human body to avoid \ntheir obstruction\
    \ by the deposit of residues on their inner surfaces.\nIntended cleaning is achieved\
    \ by means of focused ultrasound beams that \ngenerate a certain 3D distribution\
    \ of energy, safe for the patient but which pro-\nduces mechanical effects—controlled\
    \ cavitation—in the fluid which, in turn, \ndisaggregate and remove the deposits\
    \ from the walls of the conduits and valves.\nThe initial field of application\
    \ of this technology is neurosurgery, to avoid \nthe most frequent complications\
    \ in patients with hydrocephalus, but it has the \npotential to be extended for\
    \ additional applications in other clinical areas in \nwhich shunting systems\
    \ are implanted in the human body to infuse or drain \nfluids, such as pain control,\
    \ oncology treatments, and anesthesia.\nIn this research, AI systems are employed\
    \ to conduct multiple 3D simulations \nto determine and optimize the parameters\
    \ required to achieve the desired level and \nspatial distribution of ultrasound\
    \ energy volume density in the targeted regions. AR \nsystems are also tested.\
    \ They include different types of display, from screens or tab-\nlets to glasses\
    \ or helmet-mounted devices, to superimpose “layers” of information \non the user’s\
    \ real field of vision (Baraas et al., 2021). They can also be integrated \nwith\
    \ positioning and motion tracking elements to enable simultaneous viewing of \n\
    real objects with data or graphics in different orientations or perspectives.\n\
    Currently, there are no references to early detection of debris in fluids \nflowing\
    \ through implanted shunts in the human body or to preventive proce-\ndures to\
    \ avoid the deposits of materials in the conduits and valves and their \npossible\
    \ obstruction. Therefore, no additional references are found about \nenergy focusing\
    \ and visualization technologies for the intended cleaning or \nabout similar\
    \ applications.\nCONTRIBUTION\nThe described technology is based on the generation\
    \ and real-time control of \na volumetric distribution of ultrasound energy in\
    \ the region of interest (called \n4 AI Knowledge Transfer \n“sonication volume”),\
    \ during the time interval necessary to produce the \ndetachment of deposits adhered\
    \ to the inner surfaces of conduits and valves. It \nis important to note that\
    \ ultrasound waves are mechanical waves (not electro-\nmagnetic radiation), without\
    \ ionizing effects. The intended effect is achieved \nby concentrating individual\
    \ beams in the sonication volume, analogously to \nthe concentration of the sun’s\
    \ rays using a magnifying glass.\nThe desired energy distribution is achieved\
    \ by the overlapping of the ultra-\nsound fields generated by independent emitters\
    \ at certain frequencies, whose \npowers and orientation are precisely determined.\
    \ This process requires iden-\ntifying the exact location of the shunt elements—catheters\
    \ and valves—under \nthe skin and generating a 3D numerical model of the emission\
    \ of the various \nultrasound beams. The combined ultrasound field produces a\
    \ controlled cavi-\ntation effect in the targeted volume—inside the conduits—that\
    \ disintegrates \nthe debris in the deposits so that they are evacuated by the\
    \ circulation of the \nfluid itself. Likewise, it is necessary to monitor the\
    \ temperature distribution in \nthe zone surrounding the region of concentration\
    \ of the ultrasound energy to \navoid possible thermal effects. We, therefore,\
    \ explore the combined use of vis-\nible and thermal imaging cameras.\nIn this\
    \ technology, AI algorithms are used to optimize the emission pat-\nterns of the\
    \ individual ultrasound beams, considering the various factors \ninherent to the\
    \ implanted systems (types of valves and conduits, with their \ndifferent mechanical\
    \ properties), the circulating fluid (biofluids, drugs) and the \npatient. It\
    \ is also required to include in the calculations the biological variabil-\nity\
    \ of elements which may be present in fluids and the state of the correspond-\n\
    ing system of each person, as well as their specific conditions (temperature,\
    \ \ncardiac and respiratory pulsations, possible concurrent pathologies) at the\
    \ time \nof the application of the ultrasound beams. The different types, positions,\
    \ and \ncircumstances of the implanted valves and conduits must also be considered\
    \ \nsince the presence of elements such as scar tissue, and the various characteris-\n\
    tics of the layers of the skin and subcutaneous fat, determine the effective dis-\n\
    tribution of ultrasound in the targeted structures, that is, within the implanted\
    \ \ndevices and components. This multitude of factors is completely different\
    \ for \neach clinical setting and person. Multiple 3D simulations must be developed\
    \ \nin a variety of physical scenarios, under varying circumstances and with dif-\n\
    ferent materials of complex properties. From them, the optimal sonication \nparameters\
    \ are extracted using AI tools.\nIn our work, we explore clinical applications\
    \ in which the consequences \nof possible obstructions of implanted systems may\
    \ be particularly relevant for \npatient safety and the effectiveness of the treatment,\
    \ and in which the removal \nand replacement of the implanted devices are more\
    \ complex or difficult. These \nareas of applications include, in addition to\
    \ patients of hydrocephalus in neuro-\nsurgery, treatments based on drug infusion\
    \ for pain control and chemotherapy \n 1 • Health and Social Welfare 5\nin oncology\
    \ and anesthesia. Such developments are possible within the institu-\ntional collaboration\
    \ framework of this project, with the participation of aggre-\ngate agents that\
    \ complement from the practical, medical, and clinical points of \nview, the scientific\
    \ analysis from the academic field.\nFrom a technical perspective, this project\
    \ is based on the availability of \nAI tools that allow the optimization of the\
    \ simulations of the different sce-\nnarios and visualization systems using augmented\
    \ reality devices. AI algo-\nrithms mainly belong to the “Machine Learning” type.\
    \ In general, although \nthey need extended data sets for training, they have\
    \ a great advantage—for \nsubsequent practical implementation—of their ability\
    \ to improve by increas-\ning the number and typology of processed cases. We also\
    \ explore different \nAR devices to allow for intuitive, user-friendly visualization\
    \ of the sonication \nvolume, targeted structures, and the calculated fields of\
    \ ultrasound energy and \nthe corresponding thermal maps. Visualization devices\
    \ differ in image quality, \nform factor, and ease-of-use.\nIn summary, described\
    \ contribution relies on the combined use of AI \ntechnologies with AR devices\
    \ for the optimization of parameters for the appli-\ncation, from outside the\
    \ body, of focused ultrasound beams to achieve preven-\ntive cleaning of deposits\

    \ in patients with various pathologies.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis project has been\

    ABSTRACT\nIn recent years, the application of new technologies to the healthcare\
    \ environ-\nment is a common practice. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown\
    \ us \nthat this application is a critical necessity for society. The application\
    \ of dis-\nruptive techniques such as Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning\
    \ in the \nhealthcare environment is something necessary but not sufficient. It\
    \ is neces-\nsary to take another qualitative leap. This paper presents a reflection\
    \ on the use \nof emerging technologies, such as blockchain or the robotization\
    \ of software \nprocesses to further improve healthcare processes.\nINTRODUCTION\n\
    In recent years, many lines of research and innovation have been developed, \n\
    aimed at improving the health environment through ICT (Information and \nCommunication\
    \ Technologies) and, very specifically, through the development \nof advanced\
    \ software. In this sense, the use of technologies such as Artificial \nIntelligence\
    \ or Machine Learning, the intelligent treatment of large masses \nof data (Big\
    \ Data), or the involvement of complex software processes has had \nmany fields\
    \ of research and application. However, frequently the development \nteam forgets\
    \ that the development of this software has to be accompanied by \nimportant quality\
    \ principles. Thus, guaranteeing aspects such as information \nsecurity, reliability,\
    \ or robustness of the software is an activity as basic and \nnecessary as the\
    \ need to produce the software itself. This work is based on \npresenting how\
    \ a clinical process can be benefited if early principles of qual-\nity assurance\
    \ are applied. In the work, it is presented how smart contracts \n8 AI Knowledge\
    \ Transfer \nand blockchain technology can be applied for the early assurance\
    \ of the secu-\nrity and traceability of information. We also propose the use\
    \ of RPA (Robotic \nProcess Automation) to increase the automation of these processes\
    \ and the \nreduction of errors in order to increase reliability and robustness.\n\
    STATE OF THE ART\nThe healthcare processes are the basis of many of the medical\
    \ protocols that \nare developed and applied. In a very concrete way, the clinical\
    \ guidelines \nshow the steps that healthcare teams must follow to carry out a\
    \ specific dis-\nease. These processes, guides, or protocols are usually represented\
    \ by busi-\nness processes that, very frequently, are implemented in software\
    \ solutions. \nThe development of these software tools has helped healthcare teams\
    \ to apply \nmedical protocols. Currently, Artificial Intelligence is being applied\
    \ in soft-\nware solutions of healthcare processes not only for helping healthcare\
    \ teams. \nThey are also suitable for supporting clinical decisions or even learning\
    \ from \ntheir actions with Machine Learning protocols.\nHowever, reality asks\
    \ us for even more. All software, whether sanitary \nor not, must comply with\
    \ quality principles: be safe, be robust, and be effec-\ntive and efficient, among\
    \ others. These principles must be guaranteed from \ntheir conception and, in\
    \ the case of healthcare processes software solutions, \ngiven the scope of application,\
    \ these quality principles acquire a critical char-\nacter. Software must be conceived\
    \ in this way and software development teams \nmust hardly work on guaranteeing\
    \ this quality from the beginning of software \nproduction.\nOn the other hand,\
    \ this early quality assurance cannot mean an increase in \ncosts, time, or resources,\
    \ neither in the development of the software itself nor \nin its subsequent use\
    \ in the healthcare environment.\nIn this work, we focus on three concepts: early\
    \ safety, robustness, and reli-\nability. There are few papers that early address\
    \ these non-functional require-\nments in healthcare software generally and in\
    \ healthcare process software \nsolutions in a concrete way.\nIn the study preceded\
    \ by Sánchez-Gómez (2020) a situation analysis is \ncarried out in which proposals\
    \ are evaluated to analyze aspects of safety, trace-\nability, and reliability\
    \ in technological solutions applied to laboratory envi-\nronments, specifically\
    \ human reproduction, seeing that there is a gap in this \naspect.\nOther disciplines,\
    \ such as banking, have successfully applied block-\nchain-based environments\
    \ to guarantee aspects of information security in \n 1 • Health and Social Welfare\
    \ 9\ntransactions. In these environments, a series of smart contracts are defined\
    \ to \nensure that the information is transferred in an adequate mode. The definition\
    \ \nof smart contracts in healthcare processes and the effective testing of them\
    \ \nin early stages can be a very positive aspect for the assurance of information\
    \ \n(Martins et al., 2019).\nIn the industrial environment, software process robotization\
    \ has also been \nused for years to increase automation and, therefore, reduce\
    \ errors, increase \nproductivity and increase the reliability of results. The\
    \ application of these \nprinciples can also be a key point in the environment\
    \ of healthcare processes \nsoftware solutions (Osman & Ghiran, 2019).\nWith all\
    \ this, what can be seen is that specific aspects such as smart con-\ntracts or\
    \ process robotization offer a further step in the context of health pro-\ncesses,\
    \ providing them even more with greater efficiency and, therefore, better \nservice\
    \ for society.\nCONTRIBUTION\nWith the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ministry\
    \ of Health issued \na technical document to indicate the emergency management\
    \ process for \nCOVID-19 (Ministerio de Sanidad, 2020). Concretely, this document\
    \ indicates \nhow to deal with patients in order to identify, isolate and inform\
    \ who may be \naffected by the disease as soon as possible. It obviously reduces\
    \ the risks both \nfor them, as well as for other patients, and for the sanitary\
    \ staff themselves. \nThis protocol can be modeled as a healthy process in which\
    \ the sanitary staff \ninteracts with the patient to, based on a series of rules,\
    \ make the decision on \nhow to act.\nThis protocol is a simple and very attractive\
    \ example for the purposes \nof our research. Therefore, in collaboration with\
    \ the Inebir clinic and the G7 \nInnovation company, a proof of concept was carried\
    \ out. It allowed us to vali-\ndate the use of smart contracts and RPA for the\
    \ early assurance of non-func-\ntional requirements.\nThe proof of concept was\
    \ carried out in different phases. The first thing \nthat was done was to model\
    \ the process itself defined by the Ministry. To \ndo this, the entire team worked\
    \ together applying the NDT 4.0 development \nmethodology (Escalona & Aragón,\
    \ 2008). Once the process was defined, the \ninformation transfer that was carried\
    \ out was studied and modeled using the \nmodels that this methodology has for\
    \ this. With all this, smart contracts were \nearly defined that allowed the information\
    \ provided by the patient to be safely \nexchanged through the triage protocol.\n\
    10 AI Knowledge Transfer \nAfter that, it was analyzed where the process could\
    \ be robotized. We con-\ncluded that the process itself was fully automatable\
    \ as long as we could simu-\nlate the figure of the interviewer, in this specific\
    \ case, the sanitary who was \nperforming the triage.\nIn order to carry out all\
    \ the proof of concept, we created a software appli-\ncation (available in desktop\
    \ and APP format) based on a chatbot. Using this \napplication, the patient was\
    \ being interviewed by a virtual doctor, called Dr. \nJones, who does the triage\
    \ to the patient. The patient was answering the ques-\ntions interacting with\
    \ Dr. Jones. At the end of the process, the sanitary respon-\nsible for triage\
    \ received a report showing the results: positive triage, if the \npatient was\
    \ not a potential COVID patient, or negative triage otherwise.\nWith our proof\
    \ of concept, we can conclude several things:\n \n1. Our solution cannot make\
    \ any decisions, what it actually does is \napply a process in an automated way\
    \ and give the result to the sani-\ntary that, based on the result, will issue\
    \ the final assessment.\n \n2. The proof of concept, in addition to being reliable\
    \ and demonstrat-\ning that our starting hypotheses regarding the use of smart\
    \ contracts \nand RPA in sanitary processes are adequate, shows that solutions\
    \ \nlike this can have important benefits for society. Specifically, with \nour\
    \ solution we have been able to see that:\n \na) \nThis kind of software solution\
    \ can help unblock the healthcare \nenvironment. If a patient performs the COVID\
    \ triage with a \nsoftware robot, the sanitary will not have to spend time in\
    \ per-\nforming the triage, they will simply analyze the results, leaving \nthe\
    \ robot to do the more mechanical work.\n \nb) \nSolutions of this type can help,\
    \ in the specific case of COVID-\n19, to reduce infections. The patient can perform\
    \ triage at home, \neven before arriving at the health center. If they turn out\
    \ to be \na possible COVID patient, their contact with other patients and \nwith\
    \ the sanitary staff themselves will be less and, therefore, the \nisolation will\
    \ be more effective.\n \n3. The proof of concept shows that, although the application\
    \ of \nArtificial Intelligence is necessary, it must be applied with basic \n\
    principles of software quality, and with our experience, we have \nshown that\
    \ this does not imply making the solution or the develop-\nment process more expensive.\n\
    Regardless of our solution, to carry out any technological application, it is\
    \ nec-\nessary that the technical and functional teams, in this case, the sanitary\
    \ ones, \n 1 • Health and Social Welfare 11\nwork collaboratively and jointly\
    \ applying mechanisms, such as NDT 4.0, for \nthe work to be effective and with\

    \ \nANALYSIS IN THE BRAIN\nMarina Valenzuela-Villatoro and Rafael Fernández-Chacón\n\
    ABSTRACT\nA major social challenge of modern societies is to prevent and treat\
    \ neuro-\ndegenerative diseases suffered by the constantly increasing elderly\
    \ popula-\ntion. We are investigating the changes in gene expression in single\
    \ neurons \nin response to nerve terminal dysfunction in the brain of genetically\
    \ modi-\nfied mice. Machine Learning approaches imported from other disciplines\
    \ are \nkey for the bioinformatic analysis of data sets comprising thousands of\
    \ cells \nexpressing thousands of genes each. Expression changes in specific genes\
    \ \nmight be essential to maintain neuronal homeostasis and, therefore, poten-\n\
    tially useful to be targeted in the context of therapeutic strategies.\nINTRODUCTION\n\
    Animals and plants function thanks to the coordinated interaction of multiple\
    \ \ndifferent cell types. The cell is the basic functional unit in biology. The\
    \ spe-\ncialized features of every cell depend on the selected repertoire of thousands\
    \ \nof genes that every cell expresses at any time. Genetic information is stored\
    \ in \nthe genomic DNA. When a gene is expressed, the genomic DNA is transcribed\
    \ \ninto the so-called messenger RNA (mRNA). The knowledge of the dynamics of\
    \ \ngenetic expression, which determines which genes are expressed and which are\
    \ \nnot, is of fundamental importance to understanding normal cell function and\
    \ \ndysfunctions linked to diseases. Recent revolutionary methodological advances\
    \ \nhave allowed separating individual cells from multicellular organisms; and\
    \ using \nhigh-throughput sequencing techniques (e.g., RNA-seq), it is nowadays\
    \ possible to \nidentify virtually all the mRNA molecules in a single cell (single-cell\
    \ RNA-seq). \n 1 • Health and Social Welfare 13\nThis allows classifying cell\
    \ types and detecting deviations between healthy and \nsick cells with unprecedented\
    \ precision. The research carried out by the Tabula \nMuris international consortium\
    \ exemplifies the advances in this field. This con-\nsortium has generated an\
    \ atlas of cell types by analyzing the single-cell tran-\nscriptome (the whole\
    \ set of mRNA molecules present in one single cell) in more \nthan 100,000 cells\
    \ from 20 different organs and tissues of a key model organism \nin biomedical\
    \ research, the laboratory mouse (Mus musculus) (Schaum et al., \n2018). Regarding\
    \ brain analysis, these approaches are being extremely powerful \nto define the\
    \ different neuronal types in the mouse brain (Zeisel et al., 2015) or \nto identify\
    \ gene expression changes in the brain of Alzheimer’s disease patients \n(Mathys\
    \ et al., 2019). Bioinformatics based on Machine Learning approaches is \nkey\
    \ for the analysis of the myriad of data generated in these experiments.\nSTATE\
    \ OF THE ART\nBioinformatics and computational methods applied to the analysis\
    \ of single-\ncell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) are being developed in part thanks to the\
    \ Machine \nLearning approaches that previously existed in other fields (Raimundo\
    \ et al., \n2021; Butler et al., 2018). Standard analysis of scRNA-seq data sets\
    \ might \ninvolve the deep analysis of hundreds of thousands of cells expressing\
    \ each a \nselection of several thousands of genes out of a repertoire of more\
    \ than 20,000 \ngenes. This analysis normally follows a number of sequential steps\
    \ including \nat least (1) the reading of raw data, (2) the elaboration of a count\
    \ matrix, (3) \nthe transformation of data into a low-dimensional space, (4) the\
    \ clustering and \ntaxonomic classification of cells into different cell types,\
    \ (5) the inference of \ncell trajectories to understand the transformation of\
    \ one type of cell into a dif-\nferent one (e.g., during the development or under\
    \ any biological situation that \nimplies progressive changes of gene expression),\
    \ and (6) the discovery of dif-\nferential gene expression patterns associated\
    \ with a particular situation such \nas a pharmacological treatment or a particular\
    \ genetic modification to model a \ndisease. Machine Learning approaches are being\
    \ determinant in an enormously \ngrowing list of tools devoted to scRNA-seq analysis.\
    \ The website scrna -tools \n. org currently tracks more than 900 tools classified\
    \ in 30 different categories. \nAmong the analytic steps stated above, the identification\
    \ of subpopulations of \nthe cells present across multiple data sets is a major\
    \ challenge. A successful \nanalytical strategy to integrate scRNA-seq data sets,\
    \ based on common sources \nof variation, has been implemented in the R toolkit\
    \ Seurat V.2 developed by the \nlaboratory of Rahul Satija1 (Butler et al., 2018).\
    \ This approach uses Machine \nLearning to extract shared gene correlation structures\
    \ conserved between all \n14 AI Knowledge Transfer \nthe different data sets to\
    \ be analyzed. Briefly, the procedure involves first the \ndetection of highly\
    \ variable genes, which are genes which expression varies \nsignificantly within\
    \ cells and therefore show a high standard deviation. Based \non those genes,\
    \ it is possible to obtain a dimensionality reduction consisting of a \nsimplification\
    \ of the repertoire of genes containing only genes that are meant to \ndescribe\
    \ specific cell types. Dimensionality reduction is reached using canoni-\ncal\
    \ correlation analysis (CCA) to generate canonical vectors or subspaces. \nEach\
    \ vector is formed by a specific group of genes, a so-called metagene, that \n\
    describes a specific group of cells. The alignment of canonical vectors through\
    \ \na dynamic time warping algorithm yields a shared low-dimensional space in\
    \ \nwhich clusters of similar cells populations are easily visualized in 2D plots\
    \ \nbased on t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) or Uniform \n\
    Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) (Butler et al., 2018). State-\nof-the-art\
    \ approaches are moving beyond the analysis of single-cell transcrip-\ntomics\
    \ and toward the comprehensive integration with other single-cell data \nsuch\
    \ as epigenomic, proteomic, and spatially resolved single-cell data. This has\
    \ \nbeen recently achieved and implemented into Seurat V.3 (Stuart et al., 2019).\n\
    CONTRIBUTION\nNeurodegenerative diseases are an increasingly growing public health\
    \ prob-\nlem; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic and neuro-\n\
    nal degeneration are poorly understood. Cysteine String Proteinα/DNAJC5 \n(CSPα/DNAJC5)\
    \ is a synaptic co‐chaperone related to neurodegeneration in \nhumans (Valenzuela-Villatoro\
    \ et al., 2018). Adult‐onset autosomal dominant \nneuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis\
    \ is caused by mutations in the gene DNAJC5. \nMice lacking CSPα/DNAJC5 present\
    \ activity‐dependent synaptic degen-\neration, detected especially in the fast‐spiking\
    \ GABAergic interneurons that \nexpress parvalbumin (PV). Since these mice die\
    \ early, it is difficult to follow \nthe time course of the synaptic and cellular\
    \ dysfunction of these neurons. We \nhave generated a conditional knock-out mouse\
    \ line lacking CSPα/DNAJC5 \nspecifically in parvalbumin‐positive GABAergic interneurons\
    \ (Valenzuela-\nVillatoro, 2019). These mice develop a progressive neurological\
    \ phenotype \nand synaptic dysfunction. In order to get insight into the mechanisms\
    \ of gene \nexpression associated with synaptic dysfunction in PV interneurons\
    \ lacking \nCSPα/DNAJC5, we have carried out the analysis of single-cell transcriptomes\
    \ \nof cortical PV+ interneurons in control and mutant mice. In collaboration\
    \ with \nDr. Ana Belén Muñoz-Manchado and Dr. Jens Hjerling‐Leffler (Karolinska\
    \ \nInstitute), we have combined fluorescence‐activated cell sorting (FACS), the\
    \ \n 1 • Health and Social Welfare 15\nSTRT‐seq‐2i method, and the WaferGen 9600‐well\
    \ platform for single‐cell \nRNA sequencing. Next, we have conducted computational\
    \ analysis using \nfirst the R toolkit Seurat V.2 and then Seurat V.3 (in collaboration\
    \ with Dr. \nMaría Eugenia Saez-Goñi and Dr. Antonio González-Pérez, Centro Andaluz\
    \ \nde Estudios Bioinformáticos (CAEBI)). We have integrated scRNA‐seq data \n\
    from control and mutant mice and, based on common sources of variation, \nwe have\
    \ identified different populations of PV interneurons and carried out a \ndownstream\
    \ comparative analysis of gene expression.\nThe gene ontology (GO) study based\
    \ on the differential gene expression \nanalysis suggests genetic dysregulation\
    \ of metabolism and synaptic function, \namong other processes (Valenzuela-Villatoro,\
    \ 2019). The collaboration with \nCAEBI has allowed a deeper bioinformatic analysis\
    \ of cell clustering and dif-\nferential expression analysis, which additionally\
    \ included analysis of cell tra-\njectories and investigation of interconnected\
    \ genes (co-expression networks). \nA number of relevant transcripts have been\
    \ selected and their changes have \nbeen experimentally investigated using quantitative\
    \ measurements of RNA \nexpression in situ by RNA-scope.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis\

    The importance of sustainability is key in the long-term industrial impact of\
    \ \nAndalusia, and that is why it is detected as one of the strengths of the University\
    \ \nof Seville research groups, reflected in their collaboration with the private\
    \ sec-\ntor and the impact they all make in the sector to achieve excellence.\
    \ In recent \nyears, energy efficiency and sustainability have been promoted,\
    \ enhancing \nArtificial Intelligence techniques, such as Machine Learning, Big\
    \ Data, the \nInternet of Things (IoT), and Business Intelligence.\nFollowing\
    \ these objectives, an IoT application for the gas sector is pre-\nsented in this\

    \ and the design of the pipeline, in order to have an intelligent \nmeasurement\
    \ system of individualized gas energy consumption in homes and \nindustrial companies,\
    \ maximizing the battery life of these sensors.\nAnother application covered in\
    \ this chapter is related to the design of new \nwireless sensors for intelligent\
    \ systems in the construction and transport sector \nthat guarantee sustainable\
    \ operations. To do this, a unified information storage \nsystem that applies\

    \ González Carvajal\nABSTRACT\nIn this paper, a complete design of a gas flow\
    \ sensor based on the measurement \nof the time of flight (ToF) of an ultrasonic\
    \ signal is presented. After the ultra-\nsound-based technique has been selected,\
    \ the sensor design flow has consisted \nof the following main stages: mechanical\
    \ pipe design, hardware selection and \ndesign, ToF detection algorithm selection\
    \ and implementation, and piezoelec-\ntric transducer selection. As a result of\
    \ this design, an ultrasonic-based gas flow \nsensor is presented, which completely\
    \ fulfills the accuracy requirements given \nby the standard EN14236, improving\
    \ the current commercial gas flow sen-\nsors specifications regarding costs, ultrasonic\
    \ signal-to-noise-ratio, and power \nconsumption, which is crucial to implement\
    \ smart gas meters able to autono-\nmously operate as IoT devices by extending\
    \ their battery life.\nINTRODUCTION\nNowadays, smart meters are becoming an essential\
    \ instrument for improv-\ning energy efficiency. This paper proposes a new smart\
    \ gas flow sensor based \non ultrasonic communication for energy-efficient applications\
    \ in gas distribu-\ntion networks, compatible with battery durations of more than\
    \ 15 years, the \nability to detect the type of gas to be measured, and equipped\
    \ with Artificial \nIntelligence (AI) through IoT technology, to provide services\
    \ related to the \ndigital economy and also with the ability to adapt the total\
    \ consumption of the \nsystem based on the flow rate that it measures. The sensor\
    \ will be integrated \ninto a smart meter and will be tested under real conditions.\n\
    The complete system will be used for the integrated, efficient, and sus-\ntainable\
    \ management of gas distribution networks, allowing public or private \noperators\
    \ access to detailed information of the state of the network, from the \n 2 •\
    \ Energy Efficiency 19\ngeneration of the resources to its delivery to the client\
    \ (domestic or indus-\ntrial). The information captured by the sensor will generate\
    \ value through AI, \nallowing features such as demand forecast, exact knowledge\
    \ of consumption \npatterns, network load status, diagnosis of the infrastructure,\
    \ and mainte-\nnance forecasts. In addition, it will promote direct communication\
    \ with the \nclient, implying a responsible use of energy. The system will use\
    \ IoT tech-\nnology to provide connectivity and intelligence, and it will be industrialized\
    \ \nand tested in a real operating environment, in collaboration with the company\
    \ \nWOODSWALLOW.\nSTATE OF THE ART\nThe selected technology to measure the gas\
    \ flow is based on ultrasonic com-\nmunication, whose operating principle is the\
    \ measurement of the time of flight \n(ToF) of the ultrasonic wave, being possible\
    \ to measure the flow velocity without \ndependency with the medium and also measuring\
    \ the velocity of the sound in \nthe medium without dependency with the flow velocity\
    \ (Baker, 2016). This fea-\nture will be used as the basis for the calibration\
    \ procedure implemented by AI \nin order to correct the flow measurement errors\
    \ due to temperature variations.\nSome benefits of the ultrasonic-based sensors\
    \ are the following:\n• Accuracy: it can be calibrated to <0.1%\n• Non-intrusive:\
    \ minimal pressure drops and non-obstruction of the flow\n• Bidirectional: measurement\
    \ of volumes in both directions\n• The composition of the gas inside of the meter\
    \ could be unknown: \nthe measurement is independent of the theoretical value\
    \ of the speed \nof sound\n• Gas properties: Additional information about gas\
    \ properties (such \nas sound velocity profile), which might be used for density\
    \ and calo-\nrific value determination\n• Possibilities for fast time response:\
    \ measurement of pulsating flow\n• Installation: easy to install\n• Low maintenance:\
    \ no moving parts means reduced maintenance \ntasks, compared to mechanical-based\
    \ sensors\n• Potentials of remote operation in order to implement the AI opera-\n\
    tions described in the Introduction section\n• Ability to self-diagnose the meter’s\
    \ health: it is possible to validate \na proper operation by electronic diagnosis\
    \ from parameters such as \nsound velocity and signal level\n20 AI Knowledge Transfer\
    \ \nHowever, there are several challenges related to ultrasonic-based sensors\
    \ that \nshould be addressed:\n• Sensitivity to ultrasonic noise and parasitic\
    \ ultrasonic signals\n• Relatively uncertain sensitivity to installation conditions\
    \ (bends, \npipe roughness, flow conditioners, etc.)\n• Sensitivity to turbulences\
    \ and asymmetrical flow profiles across the \npath tube and at the transducers\
    \ cavities\n• Influence of the propagation phase difference between both ultra-\n\
    sonic paths\n• Insertion loss at the transducer’s clamp-on material\nOnce the\
    \ ultrasonic-based technology has been selected, the design flow has \nbeen conducted\
    \ to achieve several innovations regarding the state of the art of \nthe current\
    \ commercial ultrasonic-based sensors, such as:\n• Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\
    \ enhancement by digital signal \npost-processing\n• Power consumption minimization\n\
    • Ability to work with different gas compositions\nCONTRIBUTION\nThe proposed\
    \ gas flow sensor based on ultrasonic communication involves \ndifferent design\
    \ stages:\n \na)  Mechanical design of the flow path tube\nIn this stage, different\
    \ ultrasonic paths configurations have been tested: \nZ-configuration (based on\
    \ a direct way between the transducers), V-configuration \n(based on one reflection\
    \ of the ultrasonic wave over the pipe floor), and \nW-configuration (based on\
    \ two reflections of the ultrasonic wave over the pipe \nfloor). For each configuration,\
    \ different form-factor alternatives have been tested: \nincidence angle, ultrasonic\
    \ path length, and cross section. Additionally, different \nmaterials (such as\
    \ PLA, SLA, and ABS by using a 3D printer) and different lami-\nnation and collimating\
    \ elements have been experimentally characterized.\nAfter this study, a V-configuration\
    \ results in the best option regarding:\n• Sensitivity: although a Z-configuration\
    \ usually provides a more \nrobust transmission (higher SNR), it has a lower sensitivity\
    \ for these \napplications, because there is a lower contact between the ultrasonic\
    \ \nsignal and the gas.\n 2 • Energy Efficiency 21\n• Simplicity: moreover, the\
    \ reflective V-configuration allows a sim-\npler assembly, because both transducers\
    \ are placed at the same side \nof the pipe.\nThe best option regarding the accuracy\
    \ of the selected V-configuration has the \nfollowing mechanical dimensions: an\
    \ incidence angle of 65º, a path length of \n55.9 mm, and a rectangular cross\
    \ section of 20.3 × 9.5 mm2. By employing a \nrectangular cross section, it is\
    \ possible to allow a flow measurement under the \nsame condition from the upstream\
    \ side to the downstream side of the ultra-\nsonic wave propagation path. In addition,\
    \ three planar separation plates have \nbeen placed into the pipe to make the\
    \ flow velocity distribution more uniform. \nFinally, the collimation elements\
    \ are implemented by using aperture holes \nsealing molded with the transducer-fixing\
    \ casing, in order to stabilize the flow \nbetween the ultrasonic transducers,\
    \ improving the ultrasonic reception level, \nand thereby increasing the measurement\
    \ precision and reducing the driving \ninput for the ultrasonic transducers.\n\
    \ b)  ToF detection algorithm selection\nA correlation-based method by using an\
    \ analog-to-digital converter (ADC) \nhas been selected instead of a zero-crossing-based\
    \ method by using a time-to-\ndigital converter (TDC). Using the correlation technique,\
    \ the whole waveform \nis captured, and the digital post-processing is performed\
    \ to derive the differen-\ntial ToF, whereas that the zero-crossing technique\
    \ is based on the detection of \nthe zero signal levels without capturing the\
    \ whole waveform. By using the cor-\nrelation technique, it is possible to achieve\
    \ better accuracy performance, since \nthe correlation acts as a digital filter\
    \ reducing the noise and other interferers. \nAlso, it is more robust to amplitude\
    \ signal variations, at the expense of higher \npower consumption per flow measurement.\n\
    However, this high-accuracy correlation-based method allows to perform \na lower\
    \ number of measurements to achieve the uncertain requirements given \nby the\
    \ standard EN14236; so from a preliminary power consumption esti-\nmation (19.2\
    \ μA·s per flow measurement), it will be possible to perform only \n3–4 measurements\
    \ each 2 seconds (measurement time required by the stan-\ndard), enough to comply\
    \ with the norm specifications for reducing the energy \nconsumption.\nAdditionally,\
    \ the sensor parameters have been optimized (at accuracy and \npower consumption\
    \ levels) depending on the number of transmitted pulses, the \nsampling frequency,\
    \ the use of a single-tone or multi-tone transmission mode, \nand the selection\
    \ of the algorithm for the absolute ToF (upstream and down-\nstream) measurement.\
    \ This algorithm is based on the Hilbert transform, in \norder to implement the\
    \ auto-correlation of the received signal (Hanus, 2015). \n22 AI Knowledge Transfer\
    \ \nThe accurate measurement of these absolute times is essential to detect tem-\n\
    perature variations in order to calibrate the flow measurement accordingly and\
    \ \nalso to avoid the use of an external temperature sensor, which would increase\
    \ \nthe cost and the power consumption.\n \nc)  Hardware selection\nThe electronic\
    \ circuitry integrated into the sensor is based on COTS (com-\nmercial off-the-shelf),\
    \ specifically on the Texas Instruments MSP430FR6043 \ncomponent. This ultrasonic\
    \ front end has been selected in order to mini-\nmize the power consumption and\
    \ due to its capabilities to implement the \nselected correlation-based method\
    \ by using an internal microprocessor. \nOther studied ultrasonic front ends have\
    \ been the Maxim MAX35104, the \nAMS TDC-GP30, the Texas Instruments TDC1000 +\
    \ TDC7200, and the \nMaxim MAX35101.\n d) Piezoelectric transducer selection\n\
    An experimental comparison between different piezoelectric manufacturers \n(Ceramtec,\
    \ Jiakang, etc.) and between different nominal ultrasonic frequencies \n(200–400–500\
    \ kHz) has been performed. These different transducers have \nbeen evaluated in\
    \ terms of sensitivity, uncertain flow measurement, zero flow \ndrift performance,\
    \ and flow measurement deviation between pairs in a cli-\nmatic chamber.\nA nominal\
    \ frequency of 200 kHz has been selected because it presents \nbetter properties\
    \ regarding sensitivity and gas attenuation (Ejakov et al., \n2003), relaxing\
    \ the requirements of the pre-amplification stage and reduc-\ning the hardware\
    \ costs and the energy consumption. Finally, the transducer \nJiakang 200KHz has\
    \ been selected because of its zero flow drift performance \n(±0.6 ns for the\
    \ tested pairs, i.e., <3% of the minimum differential ToF at 40 \nl/h required\
    \ by the standard, in the range −10ºC/40ºC) and its flow measure-\nment deviation\
    \ between pairs for different temperatures and flow rates (with \na maximum deviation\
    \ of ≈1%), assuming the pairs are calibrated at ambient \ntemperature (23ºC).\n\
    \ \ne)  Hardware design\nThe printed circuit board (PCB) installed in the gas\
    \ meter is based on the \nMSP430FR6043 ultrasonic front end, and it has been manufactured\
    \ and \nexperimentally characterized. Different versions of this hardware have\
    \ been \nimplemented in order to optimize the transducer impedance matching, and\
    \ the \nfiltering and the low-noise pre-amplification stages.\n 2 • Energy Efficiency\
    \ 23\nFinally, by the integration of all previously designed parts and by using\
    \ \nan experimental setup based on several compressors and flow meters, the \n\
    obtained accuracy results fulfill the standard EN14236, which requires an \nadmitted\
    \ error of (averaging six measurements) <3% in the range of 40–600 \nl/h and <1.5%\
    \ in the range of 600–7200 l/h. Specifically, the proposed sensor \npresents a\
    \ maximum error of 1.8% at 40 l/h, <1% in the range 80–600 l/h, and \n<0.5% in\
    \ the range 600–7200 l/h.\nAn intelligent and auto-calibrated ultrasonic-based\
    \ gas flow sensor has \nbeen presented in this paper, with an enhanced signal-to-noise\
    \ ratio and min-\nimal power consumption. All the sensor design flow stages (at\
    \ mechanical, \nhardware, and firmware levels) have been developed and experimentally\
    \ vali-\ndated, obtaining an accuracy performance that fulfills the standard require-\n\
    ments, with the purpose of integrating into smart gas flow meters, providing \n\
    new functionalities and features, such as extended battery life, efficient control\
    \ \nof the energy consumption, the ability to adapt to all markets and types of\
    \ \ngas, the prediction of demand, and the maintenance of the infrastructure.\
    \ The \nimpact of the proposed IoT gas meter will open new businesses in the digital\
    \ \neconomy, such as new forms of relationship between the client, the infrastruc-\n\
    ture operator, and the regulator.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis project has been carried\

    ABSTRACT\nThis paper presents the design of a new sensor node for intelligent\
    \ systems, \ncombining the needs of the IoT (wireless connectivity, low consumption,\
    \ sim-\nplicity and reduced cost), with limited local processing capacity, to\
    \ respond to \nthe needs of new edge- and fog- computing paradigms that appear\
    \ as a conse-\nquence of the increase in the complexity of the systems and in\
    \ the application \nof Artificial Intelligence techniques in the fields of sustainable\
    \ construction \nand intelligent transport systems.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe massive\
    \ deployment of wirelessly interconnected sensing elements, as well \nas the ubiquitous\
    \ presence of sensors in electronic devices, household appli-\nances, automobiles,\
    \ mobiles, and laptops, and the need to integrate this infor-\nmation with that\
    \ coming from computers and people has led to the so-called \nIoT. In parallel,\
    \ the development of systems based on Artificial Intelligence \nmakes it possible\
    \ to extract knowledge from the information available for deci-\nsion-making and\
    \ to develop systems that learn from experience, and even react \nto unforeseen\
    \ stimuli, imitating human behavior. The massive availability of \ndata from the\
    \ IoT entails new paradigms of action that require distributed com-\nputing, giving\
    \ rise to concepts such as Cloud Computing on massive data sets \nusing Big Data\
    \ techniques.\n 2 • Energy Efficiency 25\nSTATE OF THE ART\nThis paradigm is changing\
    \ recently as a consequence of (1) the need to reduce \nthe amount of relevant\
    \ information that is exchanged with the cloud to acceler-\nate the processing\
    \ of information, (2) the need to reduce the communications \nof the sensor elements\
    \ since these are the most demanding in consumption and \nlimit the useful life\
    \ of autonomous devices, and (3) the possibility of increasing \nthe local processing\
    \ capacity in the nodes, as a consequence of the appearance \nof microprocessors\
    \ with high processing capacity, ultra-low power consump-\ntion, and sufficient\
    \ memory size. As a consequence, cloud processing is com-\nbined with new paradigms\
    \ such as edge- or fog-computing (Bibri, 2018). All \nthis leads us to the need\
    \ to develop new sensor nodes with intermediate capac-\nity (Zantalis et al.,\
    \ 2019), which is the objective of this project.\nAzvi, the collaborating company\
    \ on the project, is an international refer-\nence in sustainable construction\
    \ and transport infrastructures, having collabo-\nrated with the research group\
    \ in numerous R&D projects (García-Castellano et \nal., 2019), (Torralba et al.,\
    \ 2021). In these fields of application, massive use of \nthe IoT is necessary\
    \ to face the new challenges that arise in terms of monitor-\ning and maintaining\
    \ critical infrastructure for transport and sustainable con-\nstruction. Throughout\
    \ this collaboration, both entities have verified the need to \ndevelop this type\
    \ of intermediate sensor node while maintaining the flexibility \nto adapt to\
    \ the different sensors that are currently used, keeping in mind a \nfuture adaptation\
    \ of the sensor node to the IoT standards of the fifth generation \nof the mobile\
    \ technology.\nCONTRIBUTION\nThis article presents the development of a sensor\
    \ node for the IoT, with low \ncost, small size, and moderate processing capacity,\
    \ especially oriented to mon-\nitoring in sustainable construction and transportation.\
    \ It is based on LoraWan \ntechnology, which includes interfaces with the most\
    \ common sensors required \nby the collaborating company. As part of the technology\
    \ transfer, work is also \ndone on the industrialization of the node and the testing\
    \ of the industrialized \nand pre-certified node in an operational environment.\n\
    The collaborating company has defined the specifications of the wire-\nless nodes\
    \ in relation to their applications of interest, focusing on an open \n26 AI Knowledge\
    \ Transfer \narchitecture that allows their adaptation to the different sensors.\
    \ These speci-\nfications have served as starting data to define the architecture\
    \ of the sensor \nnode. It is relevant to indicate here that different sensors\
    \ have been evaluated \nto verify the acquisition and processing capacity of the\
    \ mode with respect to \nthe data coming for different sensors, and several evaluation\
    \ PCBs have been \nbuilt for this purpose. Special attention has also been paid\
    \ to the integration of \nthe LoRaWan communication module. However, it has been\
    \ taken into account \nthat the architecture is sufficiently modular and efficient\
    \ so that the communi-\ncations module can be replaced by a technology compatible\
    \ with 4G and 5G \nsuch as NBIoT.\nThe sensor node is based on an ultra-low-power\
    \ ARM Cortex-M3 micro-\ncontroller with 512 Kbytes of flash memory, 32 MHz of\
    \ CPU, and a memory \nprotection unit. It admits power from 1.65 to 3.6 V, and\
    \ so it can be operated \nby batteries. This microcontroller (STM32L152RE) is\
    \ in charge of running the \noperating system in real time (free Real Time Operating\
    \ System [RTOS]) and \nhas a driver compatible with RTOS for each of the sensors\
    \ selected for each type \nof node. It also has a driver to control a LoRaWan\
    \ modem by AT commands. \nThe project also designs the concentrator node, based\
    \ on the same architecture \nas the sensor node, but with the ability to communicate\
    \ with a gateway, based \non AT commands, to be accessible from the LoRaWan backbone.\n\
    Once the sensor nodes have been manufactured and tested, a test network \nhas\
    \ been set up, on which different intelligent monitoring and control algo-\nrithms\
    \ will be tested, in order to verify the system’s capabilities for intelligent\
    \ \nacquisition and fog-computing functions. For this, intelligent road traffic\
    \ con-\ntrol systems will be used as an example, which use Artificial Intelligence\
    \ to \nmanage rail traffic in singular environments (Torralba et al, 2020) and\
    \ to con-\ntrol traffic in unattended intersections in rural and peri-urban environments,\
    \ \nwhich include a neuro-fuzzy system for remote learning and updating deci-\n\
    sion rules and scenario classification (Torralba et al, 2021). In this phase,\
    \ the \ncollaborating company will play a very significant role, verifying that\
    \ the set \nspecifications are met.\nFinally, the final tests will be carried\
    \ out, and the node will be rede-\nsigned for its industrialization, ending with\
    \ a level of technological maturity \nof TRL8.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis project\

    \ DYNAMIC \nMAINTENANCE SCHEDULING BASED \nON THE ADVANCED USE OF PREDICTIVE \n\
    ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES: APPLICATION \nTO THE USE CASE OF INTELLIGENT \nMAINTENANCE\
    \ OF HIGH-SPEED TRAINS\nAdolfo Crespo Márquez and Antonio De la Fuente Carmona\n\
    ABSTRACT\nNowadays the industrial grow of intelligent maintenance not only demands\
    \ \npredictive analytics techniques but new methods that allow translating them\
    \ \ninto dynamic maintenance decision-making. This paper presents an applica-\n\
    tion of predictive analytics for intelligent maintenance of train axle bearings.\
    \ \nIt is included within the design of a complete Condition Based Maintenance\
    \ \ngeneral process that facilitates the integration of this data and results\
    \ at infor-\nmation systems level and the human understanding of the information\
    \ pro-\nvided by these solutions in order to provide simple interconnection with\
    \ the \nmaintenance actions scheduling processes.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe unprecedented\
    \ advance in predictive maintenance is one of the pillars of \nIndustry 4.0. This\
    \ has led to an increase in the use of a wide range of sensors \nwith the aim\
    \ of achieving real-time monitoring of the variables that allow sys-\ntems’ control.\
    \ The development of predictive analytics makes the usefulness \nof this data\
    \ more concrete through the generation and use of algorithms for \nthe detection,\
    \ diagnosis, and prediction of failures. Once a certain level of \nmaturity has\
    \ been reached in these algorithms, interest has shifted, in recent \n 2 • Energy\
    \ Efficiency 29\nyears, toward algorithms for intelligent decision-making for\
    \ the dynamic \nmaintenance-task-planning process.\nThis work introduces condition-based\
    \ maintenance (CBM) plan for a train \nbearing failure modes based on real-time\
    \ temperature monitoring. The CBM \nsolution aims to reduce the risk of failure\
    \ occurrence, extend the service life \nof the bearings, and optimize their maintenance\
    \ in terms of costs, establish-\ning the guidelines for decision-making in the\
    \ planning of maintenance tasks, \nadapting the response times for the planning\
    \ of interventions on the failure \nmodes analyzed. A neural network model capable\
    \ of detecting the anomalous \nbehavior of the bearing temperatures associated\
    \ with the failure mode under \nmaintenance is proposed.\nSTATE OF THE ART\nWithin\
    \ the rolling system, axle bearings are critical from the point of view of \n\
    service quality and availability to the customer. Although the failure rate of\
    \ the \nelements making up these systems is very low—with most of the elements’\
    \ inci-\ndents registered with a rate of less than 5 × 10−3 failures per million\
    \ kilometers \n(FPMK)—more than 50% of these elements are considered critical\
    \ elements \ngiven the severity of their functional loss. Contributions are emerging\
    \ including \nthe development of advanced analytics-enabled frameworks to monitor\
    \ the deteri-\noration of these systems, predicting their rate of deterioration,\
    \ and recommending \ntheir maintenance for optimal scheduling to maximize expected\
    \ lifetime (Kumar \nand KP, 2019). Improvements in computing and communication\
    \ technologies \nallow automated data collection on a large scale. Prediction\
    \ models can then be \nconveniently trained and put into operation with real-time\
    \ sensors data. Clearly, \nbusinesses’ digital transformation fosters a new Operations\
    \ & Maintenance \n(O&M) paradigm: merging the data collected from assets and sensors\
    \ with big \ndata analytics allows to monitor entire fleets down to individual\
    \ components and \nto plan maintenance actions only when needed (Ferroni et al.,\
    \ 2018).\nLiterature of predictive analytics application to intelligent maintenance\
    \ \nin trains axle bearings includes, among others, references to Support Vector\
    \ \nRegression, which has been proposed for the estimation of the Remaining \n\
    Useful Life (RUL) of damaged bearings based on vibration frequencies and \nwith\
    \ good results but high computational requirements (Fumeo et al., 2015); \nartificial\
    \ neural networks (ANN) for predictive maintenance, through the use \nof vibration\
    \ sensors, acoustic bearing detector, and optical detectors; most \nrecent papers\
    \ on bearings predictive maintenance are based on the study of \n30 AI Knowledge\
    \ Transfer \nvibration data together with other signals allowing to bearing anomalies.\
    \ The \nneed for vibration data is the most relevant limitation required to be\
    \ able to \napply some of the pre-existing methods to this paper’s case study.\
    \ In addition, \ncomputation times to generate a balanced solution, with high\
    \ precision to pro-\nvide rapid decision-making, is also a relevant constraint.\n\
    On the other hand, advanced CBM frameworks should integrate predic-\ntive analytics\
    \ (PdA) or prognosis health management (PHM) techniques. In an \nadvance and complete\
    \ CBM process conception, data analysis allows detec-\ntion, diagnosis, and prognosis,\
    \ and these three results can be used as basic \ninputs for maintenance planning,\
    \ the final goal of the CBM process (Guillen \net al, 2016).\nCONTRIBUTION\nAs\
    \ described above in the text, this research solution is composed of com-\nbining\
    \ two aspects or components that can be included in every intelligent \nmaintenance\
    \ proposal: CBM general process and predictive analytic solution.\n \na)  CBM\
    \ general process\n \n \nWhen continuously receiving new information from monitoring\
    \ \nor maintenance activities, a dynamic process of maintenance deci-\nsion-making\
    \ starts. These two data inputs must be differentiated, \nsince monitoring is\
    \ continuous and usually requires predictive ana-\nlytics, and preventive maintenance\
    \ activities are discrete and do not \nrequire these techniques. In general terms,\
    \ it is possible to identify \nfour main steps:\n• Predictive analytics: Predictive\
    \ analytics is required to trans-\nform the information that arrives from the\
    \ IoT sensor network \ninto useful information that can be used in the subsequent\
    \ sub-\nprocess of event interpretation rules.\n• Rules of interpretation of events:\
    \ Predictive descriptors or main-\ntenance activities performed are received in\
    \ the event interpre-\ntation rules subprocess. In the case of predictive descriptors,\
    \ \nthey are compared with thresholds that have been previously \ndefined in the\
    \ event design.\n• Rules for assigning risk levels to events: the objective of\
    \ this sub-\nprocess is to evaluate the new risk level of the item. The input\
    \ of \nthis subprocess is an event that will be analyzed to define a new \nlevel\
    \ of risk for the item. Once an event has occurred and the \n 2 • Energy Efficiency\
    \ 31\ncorresponding new risk level has been assigned, we proceed to \nthe last\
    \ point of the methodology, risk treatment, and the main \ninput is the new risk\
    \ level associated with the failure modes \nanalyzed.\n• Maintenance decision-making/maintenance\
    \ scheduling: the last \nstep of the methodology is to determine the preventive\
    \ mainte-\nnance actions to be carried out and, in general, the maintenance \n\
    schedule over time. Once an event has occurred and the new \nrisk level has been\
    \ assigned, we try to mitigate or reduce the \nrisk through various actions. These\
    \ actions are the result of the \ndecision-making subprocess.\n b)  Predictive\
    \ analytics solution\n \n \nThis analysis focuses on axle bearings in a fleet\
    \ of passenger \ntrains. The train fleet considered has a total of 16 trains.\
    \ In addition, \naxle bearings typically have several major maintenance activities\
    \ in \nthe shop, restoring their functionality, and reach a service life of 4\
    \ \nto 5 million km. The temperature of each bearing is continuously \nmonitored\
    \ by onboard train control monitoring systems (TCMS). It \nis possible to implement\
    \ an analysis to detect the anomalies in the \ntemperature of the bearings of\
    \ the train rolling system. The imple-\nmentation of the predictive analytics\
    \ strategy generally consists of \nthree steps:\n• Select a predictive model:\
    \ The algorithms used for the analy-\nsis are generalized linear models (GLM),\
    \ ANN, decision trees \n(DT), random forest (RF), gradient-boosted trees (GBT),\
    \ and \nsupport vector machines (SVM). The comparative study of the \ndifferent\
    \ models was carried out with the Rapidminer Studio \ntool. The algorithm selected\
    \ for the implementation of the strat-\negy has been the neural network, due to\
    \ the best relationship \nbetween the correlation coefficient vs. total time (training\
    \ + \nimplementation), assuming a minimum required correlation \nfactor of 0.96.\n\
    • Training a model for prediction by selecting the most suitable \ndata set: the\
    \ data preprocessing starts by joining the 16 data-\nbases generating 1 database\
    \ for training and production (con-\ntaining Ti bearing data sets from any axle\
    \ j of any train). The \ndatabase used for training has a total of 14,000,000\
    \ records and \nthe one to be used for the validation study will have 6,800,000\
    \ \nrecords. The second step consists of cleaning the databases. \nThe last step\
    \ is to store the database of approximately 1gigabite \nof information, in the\
    \ repository, for later use in the learning \nprocess.\n32 AI Knowledge Transfer\
    \ \n• Test and validate the model: historical data of train operation, \nwhich\
    \ have been contrasted with information related to inci-\ndents registered in\
    \ the Computerized Maintenance Management \nSystem (CMMS), and subsequently validated\
    \ during mainte-\nnance. Data sets with approximately 6–8 months of operation\
    \ \nhave been selected in order to be able to appreciate the behavior \nof the\
    \ AE (absolute error in temperature prediction) in the three \nperiods in which\
    \ the bearing condition is divided.\n \nThe results obtained allow us to affirm\
    \ that the predictive analyt-\nics solution can detect anomalous behavior in the\
    \ bearing tempera-\nture when the AE exceeds 10ºC, anticipating the failure in\
    \ at least \n30,000 km.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis project is carried out in collaboration\

    \ IN SMART CITIES\nRafael Mª Estepa Alonso and Antonio Estepa Alonso\nABSTRACT\n\
    Intrusion detection systems (IDS) enable the detection of cybersecurity \nincidents.\
    \ This work addresses the design of an IDS able to detect anoma-\nlous behavior\
    \ in a real-world Smart Lighting application in the context \nof Smart Cities.\
    \ The system design does not interfere with the operation \n(i.e., passive) and\
    \ applies AI techniques to the data collected from sensors. \nResults show that\
    \ our system is effective for the detection of a wide range \nof potential threats.\n\
    INTRODUCTION\nSmart Lighting systems constitute an application of the Internet\
    \ of Things \n(IoT) in Smart Cities. Cyberattacks on Smart Lighting systems can\
    \ have a \nsignificant impact on the safety of citizens. As such, early detection\
    \ plays a \ncritical role in the mitigation of its impact.\nThis project suggests\
    \ a security solution for detecting cyber incidents in \nthe Smart Lighting system\
    \ developed by Wellness Techgroup, which has been \ndeployed in more than ten\
    \ countries. This system comprises lights controllers \nthat communicate with\
    \ an IoT application server (CoAP/MQTT) every 300 \nseconds to send data or receive\
    \ instructions from the system manager. The \ncontroller turns the lights on/off\
    \ according to circumstances, such as sunset \nor sunrise time and luminosity.\
    \ Lights themselves can also be configured to \ntrigger events because of motion\
    \ detection or low luminosity. The communica-\ntion between the IoT server and\
    \ the controller uses a deployment-dependent \nnetwork such as carrier-based NB-IoT\
    \ or LPWA (i.e., Lora or SigFox). Besides \ncyber threats, the system under design\
    \ should detect operational anomalies \n 3 • Digital Economy 35\nsuch as fraudulent\
    \ power drain. Finally, the system design should be guided by \nthe principles\
    \ of minimum cost and minimum computational resources.\nSTATE OF THE ART\nCybersecurity\
    \ in the Internet of Things (IoT) is a research sub-field within \nthe broader\
    \ context of industrial control systems (ICSs). The reader can find \nin the study\
    \ preceded by Cheminod (2012) an excellent state of the art in ICS \nand its main\
    \ differences with the IT world. These include different protocol \nstacks, devices\
    \ with constrained resources, and data traffic more predictable. \nCyberattacks\
    \ in ICS also exhibit particularities with respect to its counterpart \nin IT.\
    \ Daily news show how ICS attacks are performed by state-sponsored \ngroups, being\
    \ more sophisticated and addressed to a specific target (advance \npersistent\
    \ threat or ATP). On a few occasions, these attacks use new vulner-\nabilities\
    \ (0-day attacks), which explains why defense systems need to use tech-\nniques\
    \ for detecting both known attacks (e.g., signature-based detection) and \nunknown\
    \ attacks (e.g., anomaly-based detection) (Knowles et al., 2015). But a \nprerequisite\
    \ for detecting abnormal behavior is to know a normality profile on \nthe field\
    \ that depends on the particular ICS application domain. For this rea-\nson, commercial\
    \ products and proposals found in the scientific literature are \ntypically customized\
    \ for a specific application domain (e.g., power grid, gas \nplants, water-treatment\
    \ plants, IoT, etc.) (Bhamare et al., 2020). In this project, \nwe want to achieve\
    \ an intrusion detection system suited for Smart Lighting.\nThe main threats to\
    \ be detected are:\n• Attacks targeted to the IoT server. These can be carried\
    \ out by \ncompromising the lights controller (located in the carrier-operated\
    \ \nNB-IoT network), which could lead to actions such as poisoning \nthe temporal\
    \ series database or performing denial-of-service (DoS) \nattacks.\n• Credential\
    \ theft. The stealing of admin credentials enables the sys-\ntem’s malicious configuration,\
    \ which could lead to undesired out-\ncomes such as turning off lights at night.\n\
    • Operational issues. It would be desirable to detect incidents such \nas fraudulent\
    \ electricity connections or malfunction of equipment.\nOther system components\
    \ (e.g., a management application) may be attacked. \nStill, we believe that existing\
    \ technology from the IT world such as web appli-\ncation firewalls or conventional\
    \ IDS (e.g., Snort, Suricata, etc.) suffices for a \n36 AI Knowledge Transfer\
    \ \ndecent level of protection for these components. Indeed, our solution design\
    \ \nshould be compatible with these systems (which operate based on signatures\
    \ \nor malicious patterns).\nFinally, the solution design should be constrained\
    \ by some requirements. \nWe highlight the following: the use of Artificial Intelligence\
    \ (AI) techniques \nfor detecting abnormal system behavior (e.g., ATP or 0-day\
    \ attacks), and the \nminimization of the consumption of resources, either computational,\
    \ network \nbandwidth, or cost.\nCONTRIBUTION\nThis project has enabled the collaboration\
    \ between the university and the pri-\nvate sector (Wellness Techroup). The local\
    \ company has provided its Smart \nLighting product deployed in several worldwide\
    \ locations and a real-life data \nset that includes three months of operation,\
    \ which has been critical for train-\ning, testing, and validating the AI techniques\
    \ in place.\nWe have designed an intrusion detection system made up of the following\
    \ \nmodules:\n• B1: traffic-based anomaly detection module. This module takes\
    \ a \ncopy of the traffic received by the IoT server over a period (default \n\
    is 5 minutes) and generates events that indicate abnormal behav-\nior. To do this\
    \ job, it creates a flow-based traffic matrix and char-\nacterizes several properties\
    \ of each communicating pair. These \nproperties are examined for anomalies via\
    \ 25 indicators that use \nstatistical techniques such as EWMA or decision trees.\
    \ Some of \nthe defined indicators were the number of destination ports reached\
    \ \nfrom one source address, IP addresses from unexpected countries, \nor included\
    \ in reputational databases. This module watches anoma-\nlies at the traffic level\
    \ (OSI layers 1–4). As such, the range of poten-\ntial detections includes scanning\
    \ attacks, DoS attacks, unauthorized \ncommunications, abnormal traffic patterns,\
    \ etc.\n• B2: application-level anomaly detection module. This module takes \n\
    the data received from controllers and generates events that can be \nindicative\
    \ of a compromised IoT server (e.g., credential theft) or \noperational issues\
    \ such as fraudulent electric connections, erroneous \nconfigurations, or device\
    \ malfunction. Each controller sends peri-\nodically (every 300 s) a list of 26\
    \ data objects (e.g., power consump-\ntion, voltage, power factor, etc.) to the\
    \ IoT server. A temporal series \n 3 • Digital Economy 37\ndatabase stores data\
    \ from all controllers. This module accesses this \ndatabase for the following:\n\
    • Detection of anomalies between the variables from one control-\nler. In particular,\
    \ detecting incoherency between the set of 26 \nread variables. This may be useful\
    \ for detecting malfunction or \nunbalanced power lines. The AI technique used\
    \ was principal \ncomponent analysis trained with a sufficient number of compo-\n\
    nents so that anomalies could be detected without false positives \nafter performing\
    \ Q residue control over a new input vector.\n• Detection of anomalies in the\
    \ time series of each controller. \nThis is useful for detecting patterns such\
    \ as unexpected power \nconsumption (e.g., consumption during daylight). We examine\
    \ \nthe per-line power consumption for abnormal values against \nnormal behavior\
    \ (which is corrected using the daily sunset/sun-\nrise time, added to each data\
    \ sample). We have trained two mod-\nels of normality (for sunset and sunrise,\
    \ respectively) using 24 \nhours of data from the temporal series. The AI technique\
    \ devel-\noped was a hybrid model that uses Extended Isolation Forest \nand K-nearest\
    \ neighbors.\n• Detection of operational issues such as power overconsumption\
    \ \nor device malfunction. For this, we compared the detected con-\nsumption received\
    \ from a controller with average consumption \n(and variance) over a 24-hour sliding\
    \ window. If the difference \nis greater than a certain threshold (and variance\
    \ lower than a \ncertain threshold) over a sustained period (e.g., 5 hours) we\
    \ gen-\nerate a warning event.\n• B3: Correlator module. This module receives\
    \ the events generated \nby modules B1 and B2. It adds intelligence to infer the\
    \ type of attack \nor issue under progress, figuring out the root cause and generating\
    \ \nthe final alarm messages sent to the SOC. It is based on the light-\nweight\
    \ correlation engine SEC.\nThe data collected from real-world deployments includes\
    \ more than 60 light \ncontrollers during three months of operation. We have used\
    \ two weeks of this \ndata set for training, another two weeks for testing, and\
    \ two months for vali-\ndation. The designed test includes (a) insertion of network\
    \ attacks (e.g., port \nscanning, DoS, man-in-the-middle) and (b) contamination\
    \ of samples in the \ndata set: malicious behavior such as turning off lights\
    \ during nighttime or its \ncounterpart. We have detected several anomalous situations\
    \ which have been \nvalidated with experts. Our system scored 100% of detection\
    \ capacity and a \nrate of false positive of 10 alarms in two months. The computational\
    \ resources \nused by our system were moderately low, enabling the monitoring\
    \ of up to \n38 AI Knowledge Transfer \n600 controllers with a single conventional\
    \ computer (CPU i7, 8GRAM) which \nexceeds the need of most deployments (usually\
    \ between 60 and 200 control-\nlers). The next step is testing in a real-work\
    \ deployment.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis project has been carried out in collaboration\

    \ represents a fundamental principle; \nin particular, this need is of utter importance\
    \ in the governance of IT infra-\nstructures that support the general dynamics\
    \ of administration. In this paper, \nwe present the roadmap for a new generation\
    \ of IT governance platforms that \nimprove the level of transparency using blockchains\
    \ while having a perfor-\nmant behavior. In addition, as a first step, we provide\

    \ that addresses the \nanalytical challenges present in IT governance.\nINTRODUCTION\n\
    Public administration has a fundamental role in providing appropriate IT ser-\n\
    vices to citizens, which would drive the increasing need for the digitalization\
    \ \nof society. In such a context, the need for accountability represents a funda-\n\
    mental principle that should be intertwined into the layers of public organiza-\n\
    tions, but it is especially important in the IT infrastructures that support the\
    \ \ngeneral dynamics of administration.\nTo address a certain degree of accountability\
    \ and increase transparency \nin IT systems, in recent years blockchain technology\
    \ has become an appropri-\nate choice to evolve current systems and incorporate\
    \ nontampering mecha-\nnisms in distributed scenarios. In this paper, we present\
    \ the roadmap toward a \n40 AI Knowledge Transfer \nnew generation of IT governance\
    \ platforms that take advantages of these new \npossibilities to improve the level\
    \ of transparency, while having an efficient \nbehavior in the governance. In\
    \ particular, we outline promising first results \nwith the development of the\
    \ concept of Elastic Smart Contract which could be \nused as the framework to\
    \ drive analytics that supports automated governance \nwhile maintaining appropriate\
    \ levels of performance, non-manipulation, and \ntransparency.\nSTATE OF THE ART\n\
    Public administration represents a complex scenario where a variety of stake-\n\
    holders have to collaborate, sharing information between them and allowing \n\
    each party to carry out analysis and provide decentralized services on shared\
    \ \ndata. Trust issues become critical in this environment, as multiple parties\
    \ (one \nbeing the citizen) have to continuously agree on the validity of the\
    \ data and \nservices they need to integrate. Blockchain technologies fit naturally,\
    \ provid-\ning transparency and non-alteration to shared data in a trustless network.\
    \ In \naddition to these features, privacy and rights management can be considered\
    \ \nby using different blockchain implementations, ranging from permissioned \n\
    blockchains (Androulaki et al., 2018) to specific solutions tailored to IoT-based\
    \ \necosystems (Dorry et al., 2017), including novel approaches to data manage-\n\
    ment that focus on trust and privacy preservation (Zhaofeng et al., 2020).\nIn\
    \ recent years, the novel element concept of Smart Contract has appeared \nto\
    \ extend the blockchains as transaction placeholders to introduce a more pro-\n\
    active network and extend its capabilities; specifically, Smart Contracts repre-\n\
    sent a framework to develop a computational mechanism combining off-chain \ndata\
    \ with the one present in the blockchain.\nSince the introduction of Smart Contracts\
    \ (Buterin, 2013), blockchains \nhave evolved from mere distributed digital ledgers\
    \ to distributed computing \nplatforms that can include not only an immutable\
    \ data repository but also logi-\ncal and behavioral information to automatically\
    \ rule the relationships between \nstakeholders. Thus, Smart Contracts can encode\
    \ functionality needed to pro-\nvide additional services on top of the data registered\
    \ in the blockchain. These \ncontracts essentially aggregate some data under certain\
    \ conditions that will \ntrigger their execution. Although the data used within\
    \ the contract logic is \nmostly obtained from the blockchain where the contract\
    \ is deployed, often-\ntimes, there is a need to consider external data (commonly\
    \ referred to as off-\nchain data). To preserve the untrustworthy characteristic\
    \ of blockchains, an \nadditional agent, namely an oracle, needs to provide the\
    \ external data in a \nsecured, trusted form.\n 3 • Digital Economy 41\nCONTRIBUTION\n\
    The context of the current work has been the ANA project (Reliable Government\
    \ \nAutomation of Infrastructures Regulated by Service Level Agreements) where\
    \ we \nhave extended the pre-existing platform Governify, deployed in the Andalusian\
    \ \nregional administration to support the IT governance in a concrete set of\
    \ depart-\nments. Specifically, Governify is a service agreement management framework\
    \ \nthat boosts service governance by supporting audits in an automated way. It\
    \ is \ncomposed of a set of integrated components that can be combined to create\
    \ con-\nfigurable architectures that adapt to each scenario. The governance platforms\
    \ built \nwith Governify gather evidence from multiple external sources in the\
    \ organization \n(by means of their APIs) and provide visual dashboards to understand\
    \ the current \nrisks of not meeting targets. The Governify underlying agreement\
    \ model (iAgree) \nprovides a uniform modeling approach in a wide range of domains:\
    \ from Service \nLevel Agreements (SLA) in RESTful services to Service Objective/Penalties\
    \ and \nRewards in IT Service Support Desks driven by humans, or Best Team Practices\
    \ in \nAgile Development Teams. These holistic capabilities allow the definition\
    \ of inte-\ngrated metrics, goals, and dashboards to create a common governance\
    \ platform to \ndrive the strategy of the organization. From a technological standpoint,\
    \ Governify \nprovides the native microservice architecture of RESTful components\
    \ that can be \neasily deployed and operated as containers in the chosen infrastructure.\n\
    Nowadays, APIs are considered new business products and an increasing \nnumber\
    \ of organizations are publicly exposing their APIs to create new busi-\nness\
    \ opportunities in this so-called API economy. In the case of the Public \nAdministration,\
    \ there is also a similar trend to adopt the so-called microser-\nvices architecture\
    \ where the multiple information systems provide APIs to \nconform to a large\
    \ ecosystem of integrated services. In such a context, defining \nthe expected\
    \ SLAs of API (including elements such as the quotas or fees for \nthe different\
    \ stakeholders) is becoming a crucial activity in the general gover-\nnance of\
    \ the platform. In particular, within a joint and collaborative work with \nthe\
    \ company EVERIS, we have addressed these challenges in the context of a \nwidely\
    \ used mobile application that helps citizens by aggregating in a single \npoint,\
    \ multiple services from the wide list of departments that conform to the \nadministration.\
    \ In such a scenario, that variety of services has a direct corre-\nspondence\
    \ with an underlying layer of APIs that are provided by multiple scat-\ntered\
    \ infrastructures that make up a wide and complex distributed scenario.\nIn order\
    \ to improve the transparency in this scenario, we have extended \nthe Governify\
    \ platform to create a transparency layer that stores and develops \nanalytics\
    \ in a non-tampered way using blockchain technologies and the Smart \nContract\
    \ paradigm. Specifically, we can define two different kinds of data \nused as\
    \ input for analysis (i.e., by means of Smart Contracts) in the blockchain \n\
    42 AI Knowledge Transfer \nparadigm. On the one hand, the paradigm provides a\
    \ persistent, immutable, \nand non-tampered way to store a set of transactions\
    \ in the chain. On the other \nhand, for the sake of efficiency, in actual implementations\
    \ of the paradigm, \nthere are also other current (and mutable) data available\
    \ in the ledger that can \nbe used in analytics (such as the objects in Hyperledger\
    \ Fabric). In such a con-\ntext, although accessing and modifying that mutable\
    \ data are highly efficient, \nas the global size of that kind of data increases,\
    \ there could be a severe impact \non the performance of the blockchain. Consequently,\
    \ the performance impli-\ncations of maintaining a large data set impose a trade-off\
    \ on the appropriate \nsize of data to be kept for the analysis while maintaining\
    \ appropriate block-\nchain performance. This trade-off represents an important\
    \ challenge that we \naddress by proposing a new innovative concept: the Elastic\
    \ Smart Contract.\nElastic Smart Contracts represent an extension of the pre-existing\
    \ para-\ndigm to incorporate an automated orchestration of data management and\
    \ ana-\nlytical transactions into the blockchain to avoid saturating the blockchain\
    \ and \nmaintain the acceptable overall performance of transactions. Our preliminary\
    \ \nresults show that this new model could be adapted to variable situations to\
    \ have \nan automatic adaption of the analytics and support the challenges presented\
    \ in \nthe IT governance of infrastructures.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis project has\

    \ CLASSIFICATION IN \nCONVERSATIONAL SYSTEMS\nRicardo Durán Viñuelas and Manuel\
    \ Castro Malet\nABSTRACT\nGenerating a new conversational system requires a large\
    \ data set, which is \nsomething expensive to create. Thus, many authors are adopting\
    \ the use of \ncrowdsourcing techniques for the elaboration of these data sets.\
    \ However, this \nprocess requires a significant amount of manual effort related\
    \ to the annotation \nand validation of the input data. We adopt the use of Artificial\
    \ Intelligence and \nMachine Learning techniques that considerably reduce the\
    \ manual workload \nand ensure a quality data set.\nINTRODUCTION\nIn recent years,\
    \ task-oriented dialog systems have been growing steadily \nin home and work environments.\
    \ Moreover, platforms and tools such as \nGoogle’s DialogFlow or Rasa have been\
    \ made available to any user, com-\npany, or industry, helping the fast development\
    \ of new chatbots. However, \ndialog systems require large high-quality data sets\
    \ to ensure accuracy, which \nare extremely expensive to build, measured in both\
    \ annotator-hours and \nfinancial cost.\nSome of these issues can be solved using\
    \ crowdsourcing tools like Amazon \nMechanical Turk (AMT), a significantly cheaper\
    \ and faster method of collect-\ning annotations or data sets, thanks to a large\
    \ number of non-expert contributors \nfrom anywhere in the world, doing the work\
    \ in exchange for micropayments via \nthe web. Besides incorporating a large number\
    \ of workers as temporary labor, \ncrowdsourcing techniques are quite appropriate\
    \ for the task of generating data \nsets, because they also provide a diversity\
    \ hardly achievable by a reduced group \n44 AI Knowledge Transfer \nof workers.\
    \ On the other hand, it forces a task of supervision of the results since \na\
    \ significant number of tasks may contain errors.\nIn addition to crowdsourcing\
    \ techniques, the automation of tasks such \nas classification, labeling, and\
    \ data processing can also reduce the amount of \nhuman effort. In this sense,\
    \ the recent proposals applying transformer-based \narchitectures over Machine\
    \ Learning frameworks such as TensorFlow have \nproved to increase performance\
    \ significantly.\nIn this work, we propose a methodology to build a data set using\
    \ AMT \nand Machine Learning techniques that minimizes human efforts and ensures\
    \ \na quality data set.\nSTATE OF THE ART\nThe quest to reduce the large human\
    \ effort involved in creating a complete data \nset, in addition to the cost,\
    \ is a recurring topic in research. Many authors have \nstudied the validity or\
    \ benefits of using AMT. In April 2021, the Scopus data-\nbase included more than\
    \ 2,500 stored articles that talk about the use of AMT.\nThe work of Sabou et\
    \ al. (2014) is the starting point for proposing a crowd-\nsourcing approach for\
    \ the creation of a data set, as it summarizes and proposes \nguidelines and good\
    \ practices in crowdsourcing projects. The crowdsourcing \nprocess in the field\
    \ of collecting large amounts of data can be broken down \ninto four main stages:\
    \ data definition, data preparation, project execution, \nand data evaluation\
    \ and aggregation. Traditionally, many of these stages have \nbeen performed manually.\n\
    Kang et al. (2018) present two interesting metrics, diversity and cover-\nage,\
    \ and evaluate the performance of the scenario-driven and paraphrase \nmethods\
    \ and their variants when collecting data for a production dialogue \nsystem.\
    \ Following this article, Larson et al. (2019) build a data set for intent \n\
    classification, needing a large human effort to classify and evaluate the data\
    \ \nobtained through AMT. As shown in the “Contribution” section, we take \nthese\
    \ two articles as the main references and propose a new approach that \ntries\
    \ to automate these tasks reducing the human effort carried out by the \nauthors.\n\
    On the other hand, there are models that can be used to compute sentence-\nlevel\
    \ semantic similarity scores leading to the automation of text classification,\
    \ \nclustering, or other natural language tasks (Cer et al., 2018). Semantic similar-\n\
    ity is a widely useful measure in several natural language processing tasks.\n\
    Along the same lines of automating the laborious manual classification \nwork,\
    \ a recent work has proposed the use of DBSCAN, a popular density-based \n 3 •\
    \ Digital Economy 45\nclustering algorithm that searches for clusters (Chatterjee\
    \ & Sengupta, 2021). \nThe results obtained by the authors are encouraging.\n\
    CONTRIBUTION\nWhen facing the development of a new conversational application,\
    \ two sce-\nnarios can be considered: (1) Scenario 1: one or more sub-domains\
    \ or topics \nare provided or (2) Scenario 2: a specific set of intents is requested,\
    \ with a \ndescription and some examples provided for each intent.\nAgreeing with\
    \ the approach proposed by Larson et al. (2019), we split the \nwork needed to\
    \ solve both scenarios into two different tasks: (1) Task type_1: \nconverting\
    \ a topic or domain into a set of intents with example sentences for \neach intent\
    \ and (2) Task type_2: expand the coverage of an individual intent \nusing rephrase\
    \ and scenario tasks proposed by Kang et al. (2018).\nThe resolution of Scenario\
    \ 1, in which the intents covering the application \ndomain are unknown a priori,\
    \ would be achieved by executing M tasks type_1 \nfollowed by \ni\nM\ni\nN\n=å\n\
    1\ntasks type_2 (where M is the number of topics and Ni is the \nnumber of intents\
    \ identified for the topic Mi). For Scenario 2, the resolution \nwould be performed\
    \ by P tasks type_2 (where P is the number of intents \nspecified).\nSeveral articles\
    \ emphasize a large amount of manual workload that is \nusually associated with\
    \ the resolution of this type of tasks despite the use of \ncrowdsourcing. This\
    \ workload is manifested in three main points: (a) genera-\ntion of Human Intelligence\
    \ Task, that is, task definition and data preparation, \n(b) validation of task\
    \ results, taking into account the potentially high number \nof tasks with errors\
    \ due to the use of crowdsourcing, and (c) the subsequent \nwork of annotation\
    \ or classification of the results (applicable to Scenario 1).\nTherefore, our\
    \ approach proposes the following methodology:\nTask type_1: given a domain or\
    \ topics, get sample sentences for each \nintent as follows (1) manual work consisting\
    \ of the definition of the task and \nthe domain or topics and launching the task\
    \ in AMT, (2) we accept all tasks \nfrom AMT workers, even though we know that\
    \ some tasks may not have been \nperformed correctly. To reduce the number of\
    \ errors, we use data preprocessing \ncleaning techniques such as spellchecking\
    \ or language detection models, (3) in \norder to group the sentences received\
    \ in intents, we propose to use clustering \ntechniques, such as those indicated\
    \ in Chatterjee and Sengupta (2021) using the \ndistances calculated by Universal\
    \ Sentence Encoder (Cer et al., 2018). In this \n46 AI Knowledge Transfer \nway,\
    \ we obtain several clusters of sentences separated from each other, where \n\
    each cluster corresponds to a different intent, and (4) we validate the data after\
    \ \nthe clustering stage. Although it is not automatic, its impact is minimized\
    \ using \nthe two following points. We will look for (a) clusters with less than\
    \ n example \nsentences, which is indicative of sentences that may not belong\
    \ to the domain \nat hand and can be potentially deleted or (b) within a cluster\
    \ or intent, the LOF \n(Local Outlier Factor) is checked to identify and discard\
    \ outliers.\nTask type_2: expand the data set for each of the intents given or\
    \ identified \nas follows (1) following the work of Larson et al. (2019) and Kang\
    \ et al. (2018), \nwe use the rephrase and scenario tasks to collect additional\
    \ data for each \nintent again in AMT. The definition of the scenario task requires\
    \ a manual \nprocess, unlike the rephrase task which is automatic, since the sentences\
    \ to be \nparaphrased are the sentences themselves already obtained from the previous\
    \ \ntask, (2) once the results from AMT are received, we repeat the data prepro-\n\
    cessing cleaning process using the same techniques and methods previously \nused\
    \ in task type_1, and (3) we validated the data by re-performing the clus-\ntering\
    \ techniques and rechecking the LOFs. For every sentence received, the \nsemantic\
    \ distance for every intent is calculated, and we identify if the sentence \n\
    should be included in the proposed intent, or it should be discarded.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\

    \ THE \nCOVERAGE OF INFORMATION \nSOURCES ON THE INTERNET\nNuria Gómez-Vargas\
    \ and Jasone Ramírez-Ayerbe\nABSTRACT\nThis project focuses on the development\
    \ of tools for the automatic updating of the \nDirectorio de Empresas y Establecimientos\
    \ en Andalucía. Artificial Intelligence \ntechniques are used to analyze the different\
    \ information sources found on the \ninternet. Concretely, a process is developed\
    \ to automatically retrieve the content \nof the different websites and calibrate\
    \ their data quality, for its later use to update \nthe features of the directory\
    \ in the case of high scores. Furthermore, our procedure \nmakes it possible to\
    \ detect new registrations and deregistrations of establishment, \nas well as\
    \ to evaluate the representativeness of the different sectors on the internet.\n\
    INTRODUCTION\nThe updating of the Directorio de Empresas y Establecimientos en\
    \ Andalucía \ninvolves contracting private sources and accessing administrative\
    \ registers \nevery year, hence a study of alternative sources and the development\
    \ of auto-\nmatic information retrieval procedures are highly needed. The works\
    \ carried \nout within the framework of this project have been focused on the\
    \ identifica-\ntion of complementary information sources, the development of tools\
    \ for auto-\nmatic information retrieval from selected sources, and the analysis\
    \ of their data \nquality, to contrast them with the information available in\
    \ the directory.\nThe data analysis and comparison are based on the linkage with\
    \ the \nexisting information, using either the normalized literal information\
    \ or the \ngeographic location, depending on whether companies or establishments\
    \ are \n 3 • Digital Economy 49\nbeing considered, respectively. With the information\
    \ from those sources val-\nued as reliable, the dynamic update of the variables\
    \ that make up the differ-\nent registers is accomplished. In addition, this process\
    \ allows the detection of \nregistrations and deregistrations of establishments,\
    \ as well as assessing the \nrepresentativeness of the different sectors on the\
    \ internet.\nFor this, a series of procedures based on Artificial Intelligence\
    \ techniques \nhave been defined, which has allowed the automatic assessment of\
    \ the sources \nfor their subsequent exploitation.\nSTATE OF THE ART\nWeb scraping\
    \ is an important technique used to extract unstructured data from \nwebsites\
    \ and transform it into structured data that can be stored and further \nanalyzed\
    \ in a database. An overview of this technique and its tools can be \nfound in\
    \ Saurkar et al., 2018. These routines are used in diverse areas like \nproduct\
    \ price comparison, weather broadcasting, advertisement and market \nanalysis,\
    \ or the extraction of business details from business directory websites. \nIn\
    \ the latter field, we can find some research (Rhodes et al., 2015, Kim et al.,\
    \ \n2016) in which the aim is not only to obtain information about establishment\
    \ \nusing web scraping but also to compare and contrast the information obtained\
    \ \nfrom different sources.\nThe correct verification of the retrieved data is\
    \ of great importance and \nbecause of this, in the aforementioned research, the\
    \ veracity of the scraped \ninformation is checked through a crowdsourcing platform,\
    \ which had workers \ncontacting the establishment to verify each record. However,\
    \ this routine task \nis costly, time-consuming, and also subject to possible\
    \ human error. For this, \nwe propose as an innovative alternative a calibration\
    \ method, using Artificial \nIntelligence techniques, that does not require this\
    \ manual work.\nAlthough there are references in the literature of several studies\
    \ using \nthe online search methodology on establishments and companies, there\
    \ is no \nprevious research that we are aware of that addresses the dynamic compari-\n\
    son with a verified directory for the updating of its diverse registers. Only\
    \ \nevaluations of data quality standards have been found (Cai et al., 2015) but\
    \ \nthey focus on business needs in the sense of analyzing indicators (auditabil-\n\
    ity, relevance, accessibility, etc.), and the processing of big data. This is\
    \ why \nwe consider our work to be innovative and a major contribution, due to\
    \ the \ncomputer-based strategy that addresses the study of the data quality based\
    \ on \nboth the normalization of addresses and the standardization of the respective\
    \ \ngeolocation of these.\n50 AI Knowledge Transfer \nCONTRIBUTION\nThe starting\
    \ point of this study is the different information resources found on \nthe internet\
    \ that meet the requirements defined by the Instituto de Estadística y \nCartografía\
    \ de Andalucía (IECA). These websites have been crawled to define \nnarrow searches\
    \ that automatically filter out only the requested data from the \nestablishments\
    \ or companies and retrieve them using web scraping techniques. \nThis information\
    \ might be given in the form of geographic coordinates or \ncharacter strings.\
    \ In the first case, for the comparison with the directory data, \nthe coordinates\
    \ have been standardized; meanwhile, for the second data type, \nit has been necessary\
    \ to use aLink, the normalization tool provided by IECA.\nOnce the information\
    \ has been scraped and tuned-up, different method-\nologies have been established\
    \ depending on the nature of the information—\naccording to if they belong to\
    \ companies or establishments—in order to carry \nout the dynamic updating of\
    \ the variables that make up the records of the \n“Directorio de Empresas y Establecimientos\
    \ en Andalucía”.\nIn the case of companies, a supervised classification has been\
    \ defined \nsince each instance has a unique identifier, the TIN (Taxpayer Identification\
    \ \nNumber). This code has been used, in a first step, to make a direct link between\
    \ \nthe directory and the database with the companies found on the internet. In\
    \ a \nsecond step, the algorithm addresses the non-matches based on the informa-\n\
    tion that has been taken as truthful, the one in the directory. For instance,\
    \ \nthe number of non-coincidences decreases when inactive establishments are\
    \ \nchecked based on the updated information date, and a wider evaluation can\
    \ be \nassessed due to the massive scraping, by inspecting companies that have\
    \ been \nretrieved but with a National Economic Activities Classification Code\
    \ associ-\nated with another code within the same sector. Once the coincidences\
    \ have \nbeen matched, the quality of the source is analyzed by comparing the\
    \ addresses \nassociated with the same company, assigning a distance value between\
    \ 0 and \n1 to each match. First, to optimize comparisons, another unique identifier\
    \ is \nused and the worst case (a distance equal to 1) is assigned to addresses\
    \ belong-\ning to different postal codes. For the ones which match, the string\
    \ distance \nbetween the normalized street names is computed. Address normalization\
    \ is \na complicated process, thus obtaining the same literals in both records\
    \ (a dis-\ntance equal to 0) is rare. Because of this, the literal information\
    \ has been pre-\nprocessed by deleting from each record the so-called “stop words”.\
    \ This term \nrefers to the most common words in a language, like articles or\
    \ prepositions, \nwhose position within the literals depends on the normalization\
    \ performed. \nThe distance between strings might highly depend on the order of\
    \ the words, \ntherefore by ignoring them and retaining only the most significant\
    \ parts of \nthe literal, more accurate distances are obtained. There are different\
    \ distances \n 3 • Digital Economy 51\nto compare string literals, such as Levenshtein\
    \ or Jaro-Winkler. Finally, data \nquality evaluation is assessed by analyzing\
    \ the histogram of the chosen dis-\ntance, as well as the proportion of extreme\
    \ values 0 and 1.\nRegarding the information of establishments, the exact geographic\
    \ posi-\ntion has been obtained. In this case, a process has been developed including\
    \ \na coordinate conversion step and the implementation of the haversine formula\
    \ \nexpressed in terms of a two-argument inverse tangent function to calculate\
    \ \nthe distance between two points. This procedure enables the linkage of the\
    \ \nscraped addresses to their nearest one from the directory. However, the lat-\n\
    ter are geographically localized using the “Callejero Digital de Andalucía \n\
    Unificado” (CDAU), which does not always have the information of the exact \n\
    doorway and thus links the address to the center of the road or other approxi-\n\
    mations. That is why a more complex process is used for the allocation of \nscores:\
    \ different considerations are taken into account to correctly establish \nthe\
    \ matches, such as the type of geolocation in CDAU (exact portal, nearby or \n\
    via center), the previously introduced distance between the linked addresses \n\
    according to a threshold and the number of establishments per street. Finally,\
    \ \na score is associated with each instance using all the above features.\nThe\
    \ results of this analysis allow, in the case of instances with sufficiently \n\
    high scores, the dynamic and automatic update of the directory based on infor-\n\
    mation scraped from the internet.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis project has been carried\

    ABSTRACT\nIn the current paradigm, where rapid evolution of the retail industry\
    \ is seen, \nespecially in textile companies, general product assignment in any\
    \ distribution \nand supply chain, consisting of a main warehouse and several\
    \ locations, can \nmean an important challenge. The replenishing process in shops\
    \ centers all its \nattention on dynamically optimizing the inventory of shops\
    \ attending to a wide \nrange of products, starting from a sales prevision of\
    \ previous periods. In this \ncontext, the objective of this work is centered\
    \ on optimizing replenishing work \nin shops for non-perishable goods which lose\
    \ value as time passes.\nINTRODUCTION\nReplenishing in shops must satisfy independent\
    \ flow demands, in methods \nand time, allowing covering the demands of shops\
    \ without increasing their \nassociated warehousing costs. Different sectors (for\
    \ example, textile) have spe-\ncific casuistry facing a shortage of any product.\
    \ In normal conditions, this is \npenalized, but on certain occasions, this effect\
    \ is not that subject to accusa-\ntion because customers opt for different equivalent\
    \ products from another shop \nof the same company or they acquire them via web\
    \ channels. Nevertheless, \nthe fashion sector is subject to the strong depreciation\
    \ of the product (end of \nthe season), because it has not been sold during the\
    \ season for which it was \ndesigned. This means that unsold stocks are available\
    \ at prices with large dis-\ncounts, greatly reducing the profit margin.\nThe\
    \ objective of this work is to optimize the replenishment in shops, guar-\nanteeing\
    \ maximum product availability and rotation, and so, reducing costs, \nespecially\
    \ those derived from excess storage or, on the contrary, the costs of \n56 AI\
    \ Knowledge Transfer \nstock shortages. Therefore, a version conjugating two different\
    \ metaheuristics \nhas been implemented: particle swarm optimization (PSO) for\
    \ updating solu-\ntions and Simulated Annealing to calculate the changes experienced\
    \ in the \nsolution, in addition to limiting simulation time.\nSTATE OF THE ART\n\
    Currently, the shop replenishment problem has been repeatedly discussed to \n\
    improve the planning and optimization of the supply chain and retail com-\nmerce.\
    \ Nevertheless, only some researchers, such as Iannone et al. (2013), \nfocus\
    \ their attention on the textile sector and all its casuistry: extensive prod-\n\
    uct and customer catalog, high rate of rotation, highly unpredictable, as well\
    \ as \nseasonal and impulsive demand.\nPan et al. (2009) consider batch economic\
    \ models subject to market \nchanges or seasonality. Along this line, Grewal,\
    \ Enns, and Rogers (2015) \nassess the sensitive price variation dominated by\
    \ the randomness and season-\nality of demand. Searching for demand prediction,\
    \ Anily and Hassin (2013) \nfocus on heterogeneous behavior of customer decision.\
    \ Outside of the textile \nsector, other works, such as Coelho and Laporte (2014)\
    \ who focus on the rees-\ntablishment and replenishing of perishable or deteriorating\
    \ products in shops \nshould be highlighted.\nLee (1987) calculates the minimum\
    \ cost of an inventory with transfers \nfor replacement n shops, located in the\
    \ same territorial area, optimizing the \nexpected number of pending orders. Later,\
    \ Kukreja et al. (2001) add the casu-\nistry of shops located in different territorial\
    \ regions. Rudi, Kapur, and Pyke \n(2001) study a periodic review system with\
    \ the restocking of two shops after \nknowing the demand for the period but before\
    \ it is satisfied. On the other hand, \nArchivald (2007) develops an inventory\
    \ system based on a multi-location \nmodel with periodic reviews for different\
    \ industrial environments. He focuses \non quantifying the optimal decisions of\
    \ transfers between locations according \nto the moment in which movements are\
    \ allowed.\nOn the other hand, Minner, Silver, and Robb (2003) develop heuristics\
    \ \nto define the convenience or not of restocking or moving items in a continu-\n\
    ous multi-location review inventory where shortages are allowed. Elaborating \n\
    along this line, Axsäter (2003) implements a replenishing policy where the \n\
    shop with a shortage can obtain products from other shops that have less stock\
    \ \nshortage costs. The paper of Martino, Iannone, and Packianather (2016) has\
    \ \nbeen used for reference in this development, as a guide to define the model\
    \ and \nits equations, as well as the study of the shop replacement problems.\n\
    \ 4 • Mobility and Transportation 57\nCONTRIBUTION\nThe issue contemplated in\
    \ this study is about shop inventory and replen-\nishment management for a multi-product\
    \ model with multiple locations \nand over various time periods. The main objective\
    \ of the problem is to \nmaximize profitability, understood as the difference\
    \ between total income \nand costs. Among the main considered hypotheses, we can\
    \ mention the \nfollowing:\n• Each shop will receive an order from the central\
    \ warehouse at the \nstart of each period. The order will consist of different\
    \ typologies \nof products.\n• The periods can be defined as a range of days,\
    \ weeks, months, or \nyears.\n• This means that the products are not perishable\
    \ but do suffer from \ndevaluation over time.\n• There is an estimated demand\
    \ prevision based on historical data.\nRevenue has been defined as the unit sale\
    \ price of each product in each shop \nduring each period. The sales of each product\
    \ and in each shop will be esti-\nmated as the minimum value between the inventory\
    \ existing in the previous \nyear and the demand in the current period. The demand\
    \ of each product, in \neach shop and for each period, will be a value between\
    \ the range of sales pre-\ndictions with an uncertainty threshold of up to 20%.\n\
    In terms of costs, stock shortage costs can be considered only if the \ndemand\
    \ to be satisfied is greater than the inventory existing in the previous \nperiod;\
    \ otherwise, it will be nil. The purchase cost is the cost of acquiring \nall\
    \ the units of the different orders for each shop and period. The transport \n\
    cost is considered as separated into two concepts: the fixed-route cost of the\
    \ \nvehicle to supply all the shops and the variable cost depending on the distance\
    \ \nand type of order to be covered. This means that each vehicle travels back\
    \ to \none shop without visiting any others. Finally, the storage cost is the\
    \ sum of a \nfixed inventory maintenance cost per shop and a variable cost evaluable\
    \ by the \ndepreciation of the inventory during the period.\nTherefore, the proposed\
    \ optimization problem consists of maximizing \nthe benefit understood as the\
    \ difference between income and costs, on the \ncondition that purchase costs\
    \ do not exceed a previously set budget. Artificial \nIntelligence techniques\
    \ were used to solve the problem. Specifically, the \ndeveloped methodology combines\
    \ PSO metaheuristics where a leader (best \nsolution) sets the direction of solutions\
    \ group, with Simulated Annealing for \n58 AI Knowledge Transfer \nupward movements\
    \ and escaping from local optima, accepting or denying the \nchanges produced\
    \ in the solution.\nThis typology of problems presents many feasible solutions.\
    \ However, \nwith a finite period, there is no guaranteed convergence with the\
    \ optimum. \nTherefore, the best solution until meeting a fixed stop criterion\
    \ is sought in a \nmaximum number of iterations.\nThe sequence of steps of this\
    \ methodology is as follows: initially, a \ndemand, a random period, and a current\
    \ solution are calculated, defining the \nsales and the inventory for that first\
    \ solution, which will be the origin of the \nfirst vicinity. All the neighbors\
    \ of vicinity are formed based on a percentage \nvariation of values and periods.\
    \ This variation can be incremental or decre-\nmental in the range between 0%\
    \ and 40%.\nSubsequently, each solution will be valued defining its benefit, and\
    \ the \nbest solution will be updated according to its value. If the change of\
    \ the current \nbenefit is less than a limit, that change will be accepted updating\
    \ the current \nsolution. The creation of a new series of solutions has been designed\
    \ as the \nweighted measure of the best solution found so far, the current solution\
    \ and a \nrandom solution (the used weights have been fixed by experimentation).\n\

    DIAGNOSIS OF BUSES BASED ON CAN-\nBUS DATA TRANSMITTED WIRELESSLY\nFrancisco José\
    \ Jiménez-Espadafor Aguilar and \nJuan Manuel Vozmediano Torres\nABSTRACT\nFrom\
    \ the point of view of vehicle maintenance, one of the most important sys-\ntems\
    \ of urban buses is the cooling system. These vehicles run typically more \nthan\
    \ 80,000 km per year, and the radiator of the system gets fouled due to dust \n\
    and dirt of the cooling air, which produces an increase in water temperature.\
    \ \nThis situation forces to stop the vehicle and perform washing of the radiator.\
    \ \nThis study is focused on the development of a model of the cooling system\
    \ of \nurban buses based on an artificial neural network (ANN), which is used\
    \ for \nsystem diagnosis and engine surveillance. Data are gathered from the CAN-\n\
    bus system of every bus, which have allowed the development of a dynamic \nANN\
    \ that fits the cooling dynamics.\nINTRODUCTION\nFor urban buses, energy consumption\
    \ comes from the propulsion system, \nthe auxiliaries, and the thermal management.\
    \ The latter include the electric \ndevices, the generator, and the cooling of\
    \ the internal combustion engine \n(ICE). In this regard, maintenance of radiator\
    \ takes out from service the bus \nand requires many hours of work and, therefore,\
    \ is expensive from the main-\ntenance point of view. If this issue is considered\
    \ in a medium city transport \ncompany as the one of TUSSAM in Seville (Spain),\
    \ with a fleet of more than \n400 urban buses, the problem highlights because\
    \ currently there is no proce-\ndure able to determine the state of the radiator.\n\
    \ 4 • Mobility and Transportation 61\nSTATE OF THE ART\nFrom the point of view\
    \ of energy consumption, thermal management is very \nrelevant next to the rest\
    \ of the energy fluxes inside a propulsion plant. The \nimportance of considering\
    \ thermal management as a procedure to reduce fuel \nconsumption in ICE has been\
    \ demonstrated (Caresana, Bilancia & Bartolini, \n2011), where performance is\
    \ not only to maximize fuel efficiency but to \nincrease system life and reduce\
    \ the maintenance cost (Bayraktar, 2012).\nCONTRIBUTION\nCooling System\nICE has\
    \ to operate below a temperature limit in order to guarantee perfor-\nmance and\
    \ reliability. For this reason, the cooling system has to be properly \nmaintained\
    \ for the dissipation of the thermal energy generated by the whole \nvehicle.\
    \ On the other side, the cooling system requires electrical energy for \nits duty.\
    \ Therefore, the correct maintenance of this system contributes to the \nreduction\
    \ of the energy consumption of the bus.\nThe cooling system includes two pumps\
    \ arranged in series, a turbocharger \nheat exchanger, water radiators, a hydraulic\
    \ fan, and several valves. Thermal \nenergy from ICE (compressor, engine, gearbox,\
    \ and retarder) is conducted by \nwater through radiators, where it is transferred\
    \ to ambient air by the fan, which \nhas a maximum efficiency of roughly 50%.\
    \ The regulation valve is managed \nby the temperature measured by three thermocouples\
    \ that set the adequate \nwater flow rate for any load, in order to guarantee\
    \ that the maximum outlet \ntemperature is below the limit for any operating condition.\n\
    ANN Modeling\nANNs are widely found in fields related to the diagnosis of internal\
    \ combus-\ntion engines and system modeling, concretely for the detection and\
    \ quantifica-\ntion of failures. The main reason is that they can learn the behavior\
    \ of complex \nsystems only from observations. On the other hand, ANN can be used\
    \ as an \ninverse model (Desbazeille et al., 2010).\nIn this paper, only one ANN\
    \ is necessary to determine system fault iden-\ntification and its level and engine\
    \ state, taking into account that the configured \n62 AI Knowledge Transfer \n\
    network is allowed to reproduce the output temperature of water of the engine\
    \ \nblock, gearbox, and retarder. With this porpoise, an ANN is configured, as\
    \ well \nas trained and evaluated, in order to obtain a mapping between input\
    \ variables \nand the corresponding output variables (targets). In this case,\
    \ the input variables \nare as follows: instantaneous engine speed, ambient temperature,\
    \ instantaneous \nengine torque, and instantaneous fuel consumption. On the other\
    \ side, the output \nvariables are the instantaneous temperature of the leaving\
    \ water from the engine \nblock, the output temperature of the retarder, and the\
    \ gearbox.\nANN Architecture and Training Method\nSince the relationship between\
    \ inputs and targets is highly nonlinear, a multi-\nlayer network has been chosen.\
    \ The transfer function in the hidden layers is the \ntangent sigmoid function\
    \ and the function for the output layer is linear. Such \na network structure\
    \ is considered a universal function approximator (Hornik, \nStinchcombe & White,\
    \ 1989). In this case, the forward function is obtained \ndirectly from data,\
    \ so the configured ANN has to learn the inverse relation-\nship. As the number\
    \ of hidden layers is concerned, one hidden layer has been \nchosen. The number\
    \ of neurons in this layer is 19 and has been obtained by \ntrial and error.\n\
    Regarding the training method, the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm has \nbeen used.\
    \ In this kind of training method, early stopping must be taken into \naccount\
    \ to avoid the unwanted overfitting effect. Because of this, the total \nsample\
    \ data has been divided into three groups: training set (60% of the data), \n\
    test set (20% of the data), and the mentioned validation set (20% of the data).\n\
    Input and Target Data\nThrough the cooling system data gathered of the CAN bus,\
    \ a set of ANN inputs \nand targets have been specified. Such a set must be a\
    \ representative sample of \nthe engine’s whole load, which includes winter, spring,\
    \ autumn, and summer \ndata. This is important due to the huge change of ambient\
    \ temperature and the \nengine load that change the thermal load on the cooling\
    \ system. Holidays have \nalso been included because the load of the bus is greatly\
    \ reduced on these days. \nThe performance of the ANN has been evaluated by means\
    \ of a set of data that \nis not used throughout the training process, that is,\
    \ the aforementioned valida-\ntion set. A useful tool for the ANN validation test\
    \ is the relationship between \nthe targets and outputs. In this case, a linear\
    \ relationship has been observed, \nwhich means a regression coefficient close\
    \ to 1. This means that no overfitting \n 4 • Mobility and Transportation 63\n\
    takes place and, as a result, it can be considered that the trained ANN has \n\
    achieved favorable results.\nNoise Effect\nIn order to verify the robustness of\
    \ the dynamic ANN against noise, random \nnoise has been added to the signals\
    \ coming from the input data. Two different \nnoise signals have been considered:\n\
    \ \nNoise characterized by mean\nand standard deviation\n=\n=\n0\n1 5. %  \n \n\
    Noise characterized by mean\nand standard deviation\n=\n=\n0\n3 0. %  \nThe trained\
    \ ANN outputs were compared to the targets and a lack of robust-\nness could be\
    \ observed. However, after a sensitivity analysis, it has been seen \nthat the\
    \ most affected signal was room temperature, having the rest low sensi-\ntivity\
    \ to noise. In this regard, both sensor accuracy and position are considered \n\
    to be relevant for the robust results of the cooling model.\nCONCLUSIONS\nA complete\
    \ procedure for modeling the cooling system of an urban bus has \nbeen developed.\
    \ The method is based on the integration of instantaneous CAN-\nbus data and a\
    \ multilayer dynamic ANN. The method presents high robustness \nand also showed\
    \ its capability for diagnosing the health of the engine oriented \nto preventive\
    \ maintenance and failure diagnosis.\nThe method will be applied to a fleet of\
    \ 20 urban buses that belong to \nTUSSAM, where it will be used for monitoring\
    \ the condition of the cooling \nsystem. A huge reduction of the fleet out-of-service\
    \ period is expected due to \nmaintenance duties and an increase in fleet availability.\n\

    \ APPROACH \nFOR PIPELINE ROUTING\nYolanda Hinojosa Bergillos and Diego Ponce\
    \ López\nABSTRACT\nIn shipbuilding, pipeline routing is a difficult problem as\
    \ space is rather lim-\nited. This constraint and others related to obstacles,\
    \ costs, legislation, or oper-\nability are considered to set the pipeline layout\
    \ by means of a mathematical \nmodel. The problem is solved in an exact or heuristic\
    \ way when the complexity \nincreases when dealing with real instances, using\
    \ Artificial Intelligence tools. \nIn this work, we outline some issues and solution\
    \ proposals which have been \napplied to a case study that shows the usefulness\
    \ of mathematical tools in \ndesign engineering.\nINTRODUCTION\nShipbuilding consists\
    \ of a conceptual design phase, when engineers determine \nall the necessary construction\
    \ requirements, and a basic design phase, when \nthe equipment are adequately\
    \ selected and connected by pipes or electrical \ncircuits. Due to the limited\
    \ space, more pronounced in the shipping indus-\ntry than in other industrial\
    \ plants, the later phase is crucial. Some constraints \nmust be satisfied by\
    \ the optimal routes such as avoiding obstacles or passing \nthrough initial and\
    \ end points. Others are more flexible, such as preference \nzones, elbows, and\
    \ material and maintenance costs and can be determined \nwith the appropriate\
    \ mathematical tools.\nGHENOVA is an engineering company which delivers consulting\
    \ in \nmarine services and requires design tools based on Artificial Intelligence\
    \ \nand Machine Learning. These tools must incorporate particular features or\
    \ \n66 AI Knowledge Transfer \nrestrictions for ships which are not currently\
    \ considered by commercial soft-\nware. Among them is the so-called scheme problem.\
    \ The scheme encompasses \na set of design specifications regarding the number\
    \ of branches that must be \nconnected to a trunk line, valves on the branches,\
    \ and some other related \naspects to be considered. Once the initial design has\
    \ been determined, given \nby the scheme conditions, the pipeline routing problem\
    \ will be solved follow-\ning the technical specifications.\nSTATE OF THE ART\n\
    The first approach to the scheme problem proposed by GHENOVA company \nhas been\
    \ addressed by mixed-integer programming (Cuervas et al., 2017). \nIn this paper,\
    \ we will focus on pipeline routing, including main lines and \nbranches.\nThe\
    \ pipeline routing problem was previously solved by means of three-\ndimensional\
    \ routing algorithms. We refer the reader to Park and Storch (2002) \nand the\
    \ references therein to see some particularities of the pipeline design \nin a\
    \ shipbuilding domain. In that paper, the proposed algorithm combines \na cell-generation\
    \ method to consider the geometric aspects and the correct \nassignment of costs,\
    \ in order to take into account the non-geometric ones. \nSubsequently, the path\
    \ for each pipeline is chosen from a tree of combinations.\nPipeline routing has\
    \ been studied in other spheres beyond ships. For \ninstance, the problem has\
    \ been addressed to design chemical plants (Guirardello \n& Swaney, 2005). Here,\
    \ the developed procedure is based on the construction \nof a partial graph where\
    \ node positions determine where pipes can be routed, \nprovided that the safety\
    \ restrictions and minimum distances from components \nare satisfied.\nTraditionally,\
    \ pipe routing has been studied as a shortest path problem \nsolved using A* or\
    \ Dijkstra algorithms, among others. When the problem is \ndesigned in three dimensions,\
    \ it becomes more complicated. To face the prob-\nlem, Min, Ruy, and Park (2020)\
    \ have recently designed an ad hoc Jump Point \nSearch algorithm. This method\
    \ is performed in a three-dimensional space and \nprovides pipe paths which are\
    \ parallel to the axes.\nBuilding information modeling (BIM) software is used\
    \ during the \ndesign pipeline process. However, still there is room for improvement\
    \ for \nthose automatic tools and experienced people have to intervene in choosing\
    \ \nthe final pipe system layout (Singh & Cheng, 2021). To ease the task, many\
    \ \nheuristics and optimization methods have been studied and developed in \n\
    the field in recent years.\n 4 • Mobility and Transportation 67\nCONTRIBUTION\n\
    There are many aspects to consider as part of solving the pipeline rout-\ning\
    \ problem by means of Artificial Intelligence techniques. These issues \nare,\
    \ among others, the adequate definition of the solution space, the cor-\nrect\
    \ pipe layout satisfying a given scheme design, or the definition of an \nappropriate\
    \ function to compare the quality of different routing solutions. \nOur first\
    \ contributions to the field were reported in Cuervas et al. (2017). \nIn this\
    \ research, several of these technical aspects were solved following \nthe instructions\
    \ of GHENOVA, a company with which we are collaborating \nsince 2015.\nSome of\
    \ the contributions arising from previous and current transfer col-\nlaborations\
    \ with that company are (1) the development of a procedure that \ndiscretizes\
    \ the solution space by means of nonuniform meshes considering the \npresent physical\
    \ barriers, (2) an approximation of the scheme design problem \nby means of a\
    \ mixed-integer programming model capturing the main theoreti-\ncal characteristics\
    \ of the problem, and (3) a cost function to take into account \nthe singularities\
    \ in naval design, such as length, number of elbows, and zone \npriorities. They\
    \ have been included in the objective function as both bonuses \nand penalties.\n\
    From this starting point, we have improved the graph-based discretiza-\ntion solution\
    \ space. Along with the nodes contained in the primitive mesh, \nthe new graph\
    \ structure adds virtual nodes to incorporate changes of direc-\ntions (elbows)\
    \ in a number considerably smaller than the original one and, \ntherefore, the\
    \ size of the problems has decreased. Given the graph that defines \nthe solution\
    \ space, the adequate objective function, and the known initial and \nend points\
    \ of the pipelines which were defined by the scheme specifications, \nthe pipeline\
    \ routing problem has to be solved. Our contributions concerning \nthis stage\
    \ focus on modeling the pipeline routing problem in an efficient way, \nso that\
    \ the problem can be solved exactly. On the other hand, for large-sized \ninstances,\
    \ we have tested Machine Learning heuristics which provide feasible \ngood-quality\
    \ solutions sought by naval engineering.\nIn this respect, we have developed three\
    \ Matheuristics that share a com-\nmon idea: the decomposition of the general\
    \ problem in subproblems which can \nbe independently solved by flow algorithms\
    \ or by shortest path algorithms. \nIt should be noted that depending on the pipe’s\
    \ dimensions and shapes, the \npipeline routings must keep a security distance\
    \ between them and, therefore, \nthey “compete” for common space. Thus, the decomposition\
    \ of the general \nproblem on subproblems might lead to incompatibilities that\
    \ can be solved by \nan iterated scheme. The different Matheuristics differ in\
    \ the choice of the set \n68 AI Knowledge Transfer \nof subproblems, in how to\
    \ solve the incompatibilities, and in how to carry out \nthe iterated scheme.\n\
    Another important issue is the minimum required distance between \nconsecutive\
    \ elbows belonging to the same route. Accordingly, we propose \na recursive algorithm\
    \ to obtain the shortest paths that meet the threshold \nbetween consecutive elbows\
    \ that extends the classical shortest path algorithms. \nNevertheless, the complexity\
    \ of this new algorithm is greater than the classical \nones, so we have also\
    \ defined a heuristic algorithm to be integrated into the \nabove described Matheuristics.\n\
    At the same time, we have developed a model to exactly solve the pipe-\nline routing\
    \ problem. The problem is seen as a multicommodity flow prob-\nlem which extends\
    \ classical models by means of adding constraints to ensure \nthat the pipeline\
    \ routes of different services keep a security distance between \nthem. Additionally,\
    \ constraints to keep the above-mentioned distance between \nelbows are defined.\
    \ At this moment, we are working on algorithms which are \nable to reduce the\
    \ solution space, in order to solve the problem in this reduced \nsolution space\
    \ using branch-and-cut methods.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis project has been carried\

    \ ADVANCED \nTRANSPORT COMPANIES\nMiguel Torres García and Gonzalo Quirosa Jiménez\n\
    ABSTRACT\nThe project develops the concept and implementation of Industry 4.0\
    \ for \nsmall- and medium-sized companies, which is currently lacking in the indus-\n\
    trial sector. The aim is to obtain a methodology or procedure to facilitate the\
    \ \nconversion of medium-sized industrial manufacturing companies into “digital\
    \ \nfactory” working models, in accordance with Industry 4.0.\nINTRODUCTION\n\
    One of the missions that society entrusts to the university is the transfer of\
    \ \nknowledge. The activities in this area include finding answers to the challenges\
    \ \nand the needs of the industry. In relation to the above, the objective of\
    \ this proj-\nect, called FADIN 4.0, is to help small and medium-sized enterprises\
    \ (SMEs) \nin the advanced transport sectors (automotive, naval, aerospace) and\
    \ their sup-\nply chain, machining companies, and their supplementary to integrate\
    \ into the \nnew concept of digital factory (or Industry 4.0 paradigm). All this\
    \ is intended \nto be achieved through the development of the digital factory\
    \ concept for this \ntype of companies through the transfer of knowledge and the\
    \ use of existing \nlimited R&D infrastructures.\nSTATE OF THE ART\nThe concept\
    \ of Industry 4.0 is relatively recent and refers to the Fourth \nIndustrial Revolution,\
    \ which consists of a new way of organizing the means \nof production and the\
    \ introduction of digital technologies in the industry. The \n 4 • Mobility and\
    \ Transportation 71\nmain technological premises on which this concept is based\
    \ are Internet of \nThings, cyber-physical systems, the “do it yourself” culture,\
    \ and Factory 4.0. \nThis includes, for example, the robotization of processes\
    \ (in the Third \nIndustrial Revolution, process automation was a general concept),\
    \ the use of \nadvanced automation strategies, advanced manufacturing, etc.\n\
    As an example of the importance of this industrial revolution, the European \n\
    Commission has invested €500 million to define a series of Digital Innovation\
    \ \nHubs (DIH) to act as connectors and enablers for European industry to benefit\
    \ \nfrom digital innovations by upgrading products and processes and adapting\
    \ \ntheir business models to digital change (Moreno & García-Álvarez, 2018).\n\
    At present, many of the basic principles postulated by Industry 4.0 have \nyet\
    \ to be implemented in practice. In the manufacturing industry, which is so \n\
    conservative when it comes to introducing technological improvements in its \n\
    processes, the establishment of complete connectivity of all factory equipment\
    \ \n(Internet of Things concept) and the development of systems for capturing,\
    \ \nprocessing, and mass analysis of data from this equipment to assist in decision-\n\
    making (Big Data concept) are still in their infancy.\nIn this new paradigm, a\
    \ series of “digital enablers” have been defined, \nwhich are the set of technologies\
    \ that make it possible for this new industry to \nexploit its full potential.\
    \ In effect, these allow the hybridization between the \nphysical and digital\
    \ worlds, such as linking the physical and virtual worlds to \nmake the industry\
    \ a smart industry.\nOn the other hand, the European Digital Agenda (Moreno &\
    \ García-\nÁlvarez, 2018) in its analysis of the industry defines the current\
    \ context with \nkey data, such as the fact that the most digitized companies\
    \ are large compa-\nnies (54%) compared to 17% of SMEs.\nMost likely, the sectors\
    \ to lead this transition will be aerospace, defense, \nindustrial production,\
    \ and automotive, where people already work alongside \nsmart machines. However,\
    \ the digitization of industry, or Industry 4.0, encom-\npasses much more than\
    \ technology. Companies must be prepared to undergo \nradical changes due to various\
    \ factors, such as the speed of mass production, \nthe volume and unpredictability\
    \ of production, the increased fragmentation and \nreorientation of value chains,\
    \ the importance of the customer in the production \nprocess, and the new relationships\
    \ between research institutes, higher education \nand the private sector. All\
    \ this transition is even more accentuated in SMEs, due \nto the fact that they\
    \ neither have the appropriate means and resources nor spe-\ncialized staff, and,\
    \ therefore, they face a greater challenge than large companies \nthat do have\
    \ these resources, which are also specially adapted to them.\nHowever, although\
    \ the global, national, and regional industries are aware \nof the need to implement\
    \ Industry 4.0 technologies in the market to maintain \nand strengthen its competitiveness,\
    \ the reality is that there are still no solid \nsolutions that integrate all\
    \ the technologies of Industry 4.0, so as to respond to \nmany of the challenges\
    \ posed by the transformation of conventional factories \n72 AI Knowledge Transfer\
    \ \nto the concept of smart factories. This project meets this need for the develop-\n\
    ment and integration of solutions adapted to industrial SMEs through a meth-\n\
    odology that supports these companies in their process of hybridization of the\
    \ \nphysical and digital world, developing a technological platform adapted to\
    \ the \nneeds of industrial SMEs, setting up two demonstration centers that simulate\
    \ a \nreal production environment, preserving laboratory attributes that allow\
    \ mod-\nifications at the specimen level, enhancing synergies between technologies,\
    \ \nand developing and promoting training programs for those responsible for the\
    \ \ndigital factory of industrial SMEs, since the key lies in “transformation”.\
    \ This \nmeans that it is not just a matter of incorporating the latest technology\
    \ but of \ntransforming the business models of these companies through technologies.\n\
    CONTRIBUTION\nThe concepts of Industry 4.0, and all the technology associated\
    \ with them, \noriginate from their existence as part of a solution to a social\
    \ and environ-\nmental problem. The strategic positioning of the market in the\
    \ midst of digital \nfactories is aligned with those trends that can have a more\
    \ significant impact \non its business, such as personalization, sustainability,\
    \ or similar.\nThe main characteristics of the production model of Industry 4.0\
    \ or Digital \nFactory are flexibility, reconfigurability, and digitalization\
    \ (Pallarés Martínez, \n2018). However, there are two other transversal characteristics\
    \ that are very \nrelevant to the entire production model based on Industry 4.0\
    \ and are closely \naligned with sustainability in its economic, social, and environmental\
    \ aspects:\n• People-centered model, regardless of the level of automation.\n\
    • Efficient model, ensuring maximum value while using the mini-\nmum resources\
    \ necessary.\nFADIN 4.0 covers these characteristics. Mainly, it stands out for\
    \ being in line \nwith the sectoral and horizontal strategies and policies of\
    \ the EU. The project \ncontributes to the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy\
    \ to promote smart, \nsustainable, and inclusive growth, supporting innovation\
    \ efforts and improv-\ning the competitiveness of a strategic sector for Andalusia.\n\
    The project aims to improve the current capabilities of industrial SMEs \nthrough\
    \ innovations and technological developments necessary for their dig-\nital transformation.\
    \ Also, it pursues synergies with other programs such as \nH2020, Shift2Rail,\
    \ or Clean Sky, which are related to cleaner and more effi-\ncient production,\
    \ with the manufacture of more sustainable and environmen-\ntally friendly components\
    \ and structures. In this way, it can contribute not only \nto the economic development\
    \ of the regions but also to the sustainability of \n 4 • Mobility and Transportation\
    \ 73\nthe manufacturing sector associated with advanced transport, as well as\
    \ to the \nconservation of resources.\nMoreover, FADIN 4.0 and its actions are\
    \ aimed at enhancing innovation in line \nwith the flagship initiative “Resource\
    \ Efficient Europe” (European Commission, \n2011), which supports the transition\
    \ to an efficient and low-carbon economy for \nsustainable growth. Thanks to the\
    \ implementation of technologies related to \nIndustry 4.0 or Smart Manufacturing,\
    \ processes will be carried out in a more \nefficient way, reducing waste production\
    \ and minimizing raw material consump-\ntion. Innovation in this manufacturing\
    \ sector associated with advanced transport \n(automotive, naval, aeronautics)\
    \ directly generates great economic opportunities \nand improved productivity,\
    \ reducing costs and increasing the competitiveness of \nindustrial SMEs in the\
    \ cross-border regions of Andalusia and the European Union.\nThe project tends\
    \ to improve investment and innovation security for \nindustrial SMEs and to ensure\
    \ that all policies take into account resource effi-\nciency in a balanced way.\
    \ Also, it is planned to contribute, through innovation \nin industrial SMEs,\
    \ to the improvement of capacities of Andalusian important \ntransport companies,\
    \ as well as to enhance employability and economic and \nsocial sustainability\
    \ of areas where there is a high risk of depopulation.\nThe feasibility of the\
    \ project is based on the cooperation between com-\npanies and research organizations,\
    \ as well as the training and implementa-\ntion of innovations from research centers\
    \ applied to the needs of the market. \nTherefore, based on the future own resources\
    \ of the project partners, the results \nobtained by FADIN 4.0 are planned to\
    \ be sustainable in the future from the \nquadruple perspective of research, training,\
    \ development of improved proto-\ncols, and creation of business services.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\

    74 AI Knowledge Transfer \n4.5 A NOVEL APPROACH TO \nRADIATION HARDNESS ASSURANCE\
    \ \nFOR AEROSPACE APPLICATIONS \nBASED ON MACHINE LEARNING\nYolanda Morilla García\
    \ and Pedro Martín-Holgado\nABSTRACT\nThe space radiation environment damage at\
    \ the part level has a severe impact \non the reliability of missions. A rigorous\
    \ methodology, the so-called Radiation \nHardness Assurance (RHA), is needed to\
    \ ensure that this does not compromise the \nelectronics functionality and performance\
    \ during the space systems life. Although \nradiation testing is the most decisive\
    \ way of studying the radiation degradation, the \nincreasing use of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf\
    \ (COTS) devices and the NewSpace \nchallenges are pushing the need of finding\
    \ new approaches to assess the risk asso-\nciated with the radiation environments.\
    \ This work attempts to evaluate new RHA \nstrategies based on Machine Learning\
    \ (ML) philosophy.\nINTRODUCTION\nRadiation environments and their effects are\
    \ a critical concern for materials \nand systems used in aerospace. The radiation\
    \ damage has a severe impact on \nonboard electronics; it can induce malfunction,\
    \ temporary loss of operation, \nor even mission loss. Electronic components are\
    \ affected, so different effects \nupsurge, such as total ionizing dose—TID, displacement\
    \ damage—DD, or \nsingle-event effects (SEEs).\nThe RHA methodology (Campola &\
    \ Pellish, 2019) covers the activities to \nensure that onboard electronics work\
    \ according to their design specifications \nafter radiation exposure. For several\
    \ reasons, radiation testing has played a cru-\ncial role in revealing and characterizing\
    \ vulnerabilities in systems. In NewSpace, \n 4 • Mobility and Transportation\
    \ 75\nconsidering the commercial off-the-shelf or commercially available off-the-shelf\
    \ \n(COTS) devices and the cost-schedule constraints, testing every part type\
    \ is not an \noption. The use of historical data from previous tests is already\
    \ an important part \nof the device usage evaluation. Nevertheless, in order to\
    \ meet and justify that there \nis no need to perform radiation testing, engineers\
    \ should look for data that are not \nalways easy to find, access, or interpret.\n\
    We present the early stage of a new concept in the strategy for ensuring \nradiation\
    \ hardness in electronics. ML algorithms will be evaluated in the pre-\ndiction\
    \ of electronic components’ behavior under radiation.\nSTATE OF THE ART\nMcGovern\
    \ and Wagstaff (2011) already highlighted ten years ago how space \nwas an excellent\
    \ opportunity for new applications in the field of ML because it \nwould allow\
    \ greater autonomy. Until then, only one onboard operational ML \nhad been uploaded\
    \ to a mission: a support vector machine on the EO-1 space-\ncraft. It provided\
    \ an additional data product in real time for identifying events. \nOther developments\
    \ were performed, but none was uploaded, mainly due to \nrisk considerations and\
    \ the difficulty of proving sufficient security. A major \nbreakthrough consisted\
    \ in evaluating the impact of the severe radiation envi-\nronment from space on\
    \ the reliability of the learning algorithms themselves, \nand it was a focus\
    \ of attention. Several opportunities for ML in space were then \nrevealed, such\
    \ as image analysis and reinforcement learning.\nMore recent works (Mohan & Tejaswi,\
    \ 2020) declare the key role of \nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and ML for space\
    \ exploration, and how they help \nspace missions to solve the human error, time,\
    \ and cost issues. Nowadays, it \nis assumed that AI, and in particular ML, still\
    \ has some way to go before it is \nused extensively for space applications, but\
    \ there are lots of projects where they \nhave already been implemented (European\
    \ Space Agency, 2021). For instance, \nwhen analyzing massive amounts of Earth\
    \ observation data (too voluminous \nfor humans to analyze themselves) or spacecraft\
    \ telemetry data, examples such \nas safe operation of large satellite constellations,\
    \ ability to avoid collisions \n(space debris) or rovers that can circumvent obstacles\
    \ by autonomously finding \ntheir way through “unknown” fields, can be found.\n\
    AI is, therefore, widely used for improving onboard capabilities and anal-\nysis\
    \ technics. The degradation of components due to radiation is an impor-\ntant\
    \ constraint which limits severely spacecraft’s total lifetimes, in addition to\
    \ \nextreme environments, cost, and consumption of finite resources. The ques-\n\
    tion is how AI can improve the knowledge of this parametric degradation. An \n\
    answer to this question could be based on the predictive analysis of archival\
    \ \n76 AI Knowledge Transfer \ndata from previous radiation tests carried out\
    \ on similar electronic compo-\nnents. The use of historical data from previous\
    \ tests as an alternative to new \ntesting is not modern, but that approach was\
    \ usually considered quite unreli-\nable due to part-to-part and lot-to-lot variability.\
    \ Nevertheless, thanks to ML, it \nis expected that valuable information can be\
    \ obtained combining the extracted \ndata from other “equivalent components” already\
    \ tested under radiation and \nthe behavior of the devices under normal conditions.\n\
    CONTRIBUTION\nThe CNA—Centro Nacional de Aceleradores—is a joint center depending\
    \ on \nthe Universidad de Sevilla, the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC),\
    \ \nand the Andalusia Regional Government (Junta de Andalucía). Currently, two\
    \ \nof the installed particle accelerators and the gamma irradiation system are\
    \ used \nto carry out irradiation testing. ALTER Technology TÜV NORD is the leader\
    \ \nin the field of electronic components radiation testing. The long fruitful\
    \ rela-\ntionship between CNA and ALTER, participating in joint projects and shar-\n\
    ing the facilities, provides an ideal setting to offer a comprehensive radiation\
    \ \nlaboratory. However, in the frame of work of the current project PRECEDER,\
    \ \nthis consortium poses a new challenge: provide a novel predictive tool to\
    \ the \nradiation community. Having previous knowledge about the behavior of the\
    \ \ndifferent components under radiation is quite interesting in the design phase\
    \ of \nany system, more especially for NewSpace.\nNowadays, the number of small\
    \ satellites launched by commercial and \ngovernmental administrations is growing\
    \ up. The advantage of reducing pro-\nduction costs goes against the price of\
    \ using radiation-hardened devices, too \nhigh in comparison to the baseline approach,\
    \ the use of COTS. Additionally, \nit is important to consider the time consuming\
    \ and budget increasing due to \nthe performance of radiation testing on these\
    \ components, with many different \ntechnologies.\nTo meet and justify that there\
    \ is no need for performing radiation testing, \nit is necessary to search available\
    \ data, based on previous radiation tests. To \nfacilitate this arduous and tedious\
    \ work, our group has developed PRECEDER \nas a database in the form of a web\
    \ application, which will be included within \nVirtualLab1 by ALTER.\nCollected\
    \ data are the base for a more ambitious objective, the data analy-\nsis focused\
    \ on ML in order to obtain information about electronics behavior \nunder radiation.\
    \ Different data sources have been explored coming from ESA, \nNASA, JPL, ALTER,\
    \ and other private companies. The first critical step in \n 4 • Mobility and\
    \ Transportation 77\nany ML project is data cleaning and preparation (García et\
    \ al., 2016). So, tens \nof thousands of reports are being previously treated\
    \ in order to ensure the uni-\nformity, accuracy, and consistency of data. To\
    \ eliminate the variability of the \nreporting and the wide number of different\
    \ report templates, we were forced to \ndevelop a quite complex database structure.\n\
    Each irradiation test report includes several electrical parameters which \nhave\
    \ been measured in different conditions. Currently, millions of data are \navailable,\
    \ but substantial growth is expected due to the increase in space \nindustry in\
    \ the near future. As a novelty, the PRECEDER application, in an \ninteractive\
    \ way, offers the possibility to obtain a summary of conclusions or a \nprediction\
    \ about the most relevant parameters in the radiation level of interest. \nContinuously\
    \ updated, it will be public access with user-friendly interface, \nshortening\
    \ the amount of time and efforts to find the information.\nOnce all the information\
    \ is properly classified, cleaned, and clustered, we \nproceed to use different\
    \ data science methodologies applying ML techniques, \nlooking for some algorithms\
    \ that generate a greater degree of confidence. \nAchieving high accuracy requires\
    \ a large amount of data that is sometimes \ndifficult, expensive, or impractical\
    \ to obtain. In this field, where the avail-\nable data is not so extensive for\
    \ every component and the physical meaning is \ncritical, supervised learning\
    \ will be necessary. Integrating human knowledge \ninto Machine Learning can significantly\
    \ reduce data requirements, increase \nreliability and robustness of ML, and build\
    \ explainable ML systems. Under \nthis assumption, the last decision of clustering\
    \ data from one or more radiation \ntest reports must lie in radiation engineers\
    \ that give support to data scientists.\nFirst, we have studied TID reports for\
    \ different transistor families. In \nview of our initial observations, from clustering\
    \ and statistical data analysis, \nit seems to lead up to obtain valuable information\
    \ about parametric degrada-\ntion of electronic components. However, probably\
    \ it should be mandatory to \nperform standard electrical measurements of critical\
    \ parameters. Some weak-\nnesses, such as part-to-part variability, must be considered\
    \ as possible limiting \nfactors. Even so, any reduction in time and costs is\
    \ always welcomed. In the \nfuture, this kind of treatment could be included in\
    \ the RHA methodology for \naerospace applications.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis project\

    \ implementation of a technique for intensive infor-\nmation capture of the state\
    \ of the deep layers of the infrastructure of transport \nlinear works, in order\
    \ to (a) detect faults, (b) predict the evolution of the state \nas a function\

    \ share of transport infrastructures is composed of linear assets, \nsuch as roads\
    \ and rail tracks. The social and economic relevance of these con-\nstructions\
    \ force the stakeholders to ensure a prolonged health/durability, but \ninevitable\

    \ life cycle. Of all assets that make up an infrastructure, a very rel-\nevant\
    \ asset is the set of sublayers. The failure or deterioration state condition\
    \ \nof the deep layers absorbs high levels of economic resources and generates\
    \ \nimportant social impacts.\n80 AI Knowledge Transfer \nPredictive techniques\

    \ of needed corrective interventions. The use of historical \nasset conditions\
    \ and their corresponding maintenance interventions data, and \ndata analytical\
    \ approaches facilitate the envisaging of the adequate mainte-\nnance interventions\
    \ to be conducted before failures show up.\nThis paper presents (i) a technological\
    \ approach to capture, in real time, \nthe stress–strain state of the infrastructure\
    \ deep sublayers using optical sens-\ning based on FBG technology, (ii) an approach\
    \ to infer the state condition of \nthe layers using data analytics, and (iii)\
    \ an automatic learning procedure based \non self-learning rules from automatic\
    \ learning from false positive/negatives.\nSTATE OF THE ART\nThe detection of\
    \ maintenance alerts is generally based on the inspection of \nthe state of the\
    \ assets through the visualization/auscultation/measurement of \nthe explanatory\
    \ characteristics of the involved asset. The evolution of these \ncharacteristics,\
    \ estimated quantitatively or qualitatively, using projection tech-\nniques (i.e.,\
    \ regression) or qualitative (e.g., experience), and cross-checking \nwith thresholds\
    \ and limits (defined by technical standards prescribed by either \nthe administration\
    \ or infrastructure regulator), has been the main tool to antic-\nipate possible\
    \ failures or deficiencies in the operation of assets.\nFor decades, the inference\
    \ of deterministic or probabilistic models based \non a priori explanatory characteristics\
    \ (i.e., empirical-mechanistic models) has \nbeen the most pronounced trend (1960–1990).\
    \ Currently, developments have \nfocused on replacing this way of proceeding by\
    \ data-based modeling, making \nuse of data mining and Machine Learning techniques\
    \ (1990–2015); this is \nbased on the increasing availability of data captured\
    \ from activities, ausculta-\ntions, and monitoring campaigns.\nIn the field of\
    \ transport infrastructures, since the 1990s, the trend has \nfocused on predicting\
    \ the evolution of the state of certain components using \nML techniques and data\
    \ analytics; however, in most cases, attention has \nbeen focused on the prediction\
    \ of easily accessible active associated indi-\nces (pavement on highways, rails\
    \ and ballast on railways) or to the global \nstate of the infrastructure using\
    \ data from external geometry (1995–2020). \nIn relation to the estimation of\
    \ maintenance interventions, there have also \nbeen important advances referenced\
    \ in various publications on the state of \nthe art on this subject.\nIn the field\
    \ of monitoring the state of deep layers of the substruc-\nture, advances have\
    \ been more limited due to the cost and difficulty of \n 4 • Mobility and Transportation\
    \ 81\nsensorization. This study advances the use of data-harvesting methodolo-\n\
    gies to capture the state of the substructure at deep levels based on optical\
    \ \nsensorization techniques and its subsequent treatment to characterize the\
    \ \nstate of integrity.\nThese data, properly processed, constitute an important\
    \ source of infor-\nmation to infer the state of the substructure. The application\
    \ of some tech-\nniques developed by the research team, for the exploitation of\
    \ data associated \nwith the surface assets of road networks and railway lines\
    \ (Morales et al., 2017, \n2018, 2020; Reyes, 2018) is at the background of this\
    \ communication.\nCONTRIBUTION\nThe contribution of the research hovers on three\
    \ pillars: (a) to build and sen-\nsorize a test-rig to generate and harvest data\
    \ from infrastructure sublayers, \n(b) to exploit the harvested data to infer\
    \ a cause-effect (loading-failure) rela-\ntionship using data analytics and automatic\
    \ learning techniques, (c) to apply \nthe prediction methodology derived by the\
    \ research group to estimate mainte-\nnance interventions.\n \na)  Testing Rig\n\
    \ \n \nAt this stage of the project, a first test-rig scaled 1:7 has been \nbuilt\
    \ to simulate the condition of the infrastructure sublayers of a \nrailway track\
    \ section. The section is made of several layers of sand \nand gravel with embedded\
    \ thin monitoring metal plates (0.25 and \n0.1 m2), between layers.\n \n \nThe\
    \ monitoring plates house strain and temperature sensing (10 \nsensors each) based\
    \ on Bragg Grating sensing (FBG). An eternal \nread-out system (interrogator),\
    \ connected to the plates using silica-\nglass fibers, injects optical signals\
    \ of modulated laser pulse-lights \nthat interact with the sensors and that are\
    \ altered by the strain suf-\nfered by the sensors when some perturbation occurs.\n\
    \ \n \nThe FBG sensing system is characterized by its high sensitivity \nto any\
    \ alteration either on the loadings, experienced by the track \nmodel on the infrastructure\
    \ surface, or on faults appearing inside \nthe layers.\n \n \nIn order to quantify\
    \ the sensitivity of the substructure model, due \nto internal failures, a set\
    \ of air pressurized cushions (with externally \ncontrolled pressure) are set\
    \ inside some of the layers to artificially \ngenerate faults under several conditions.\n\
    82 AI Knowledge Transfer \n \n \nBy crossing out the level of interaction detected\
    \ by the interro-\ngator system, spatial mapping of the strain distribution inside\
    \ the \nlayers is generated and translated to soil displacements (i.e., breaks,\
    \ \nglides, settlements). Similar tests are performed under variable \nloadings\
    \ affecting the track surface in order to characterize the FBG \nsensing capability.\n\
    \ \n \nA second test-rig 1:1 is in process of construction, which holds a \nfull\
    \ real track section (rail, ties, ballast, sub-ballast, sublayers), with \na more\
    \ extensive sensorization level.\n b)  Data Generation and Exploitation\n \n \n\
    A multiplicity of tests is performed in order to generate a rich \ndatabase. The\
    \ tests should always be performed under variable set-\ntings (i.e., surface loadings,\
    \ layers faults). The distributed strain \nmeasurements of the sensor chain array,\
    \ provided by the interroga-\ntor, have to be post-processed first to map data\
    \ to a free-fault condi-\ntion of the layers. The second step consists in correlating/matching\
    \ \nsensor data with the loadings and faults. The third step applies a set \n\
    of Machine Learning methodologies to infer an estimating frame \ncause-effect.\
    \ Details about this last step can be found in the refer-\nences (Morales et al.,\
    \ 2018, 2020).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis project has been carried out in collaboration\

    \ \nTHE FUEL OF AI MICROSYSTEMS\nÁngel Rodríguez-Vázquez and Juan A. Leñero-Bardallo\n\
    ABSTRACT\nThis project explores innovative architectural concepts for image sensors\
    \ with \nembedded intelligence. The main attributes of these architectures are\
    \ the use \nof non-Von Neumann paradigms and the extensive usage of event-driven\
    \ con-\ncepts. The goal is to achieve vision with unprecedented throughput and\
    \ energy \nefficiency.\nINTRODUCTION\nMiniaturized, intelligent microsystems are\
    \ at the central focus of semiconduc-\ntor roadmaps and strategic nanoelectronic\
    \ agendas (International Roadmap for \nDevices and Systems, 2020). They are enabled\
    \ by the convergence of hetero-\ngeneous technologies and targeted to give electronic\
    \ systems the ability to \ninteract with the cyber-universe of analog information\
    \ carrier signals. Besides \nbeing intelligent, in the sense of capable of adapting\
    \ their response to arbi-\ntrary stimuli and unstructured environments, these\
    \ systems must communi-\ncate, have a minimal size and weight, minimum energy\
    \ consumption, and, if \npossible, energy autonomy. The target is to support human–machine\
    \ interac-\ntion with electronic systems and appliances, have these systems connected,\
    \ \nconstruct robots capable of detecting subtle surrounding changes and reacting\
    \ \nrapidly, allow vehicles to identify risky situations, escape from them, etc.\
    \ We \nalso want electronic systems to resemble natural beings’ outstanding capabili-\n\
    ties regarding sensory data acquisition, analysis, interpretation, and reaction\
    \ \nthereof. Challenges like these shape the domain of intelligent microsystems,\
    \ \na domain where the handling of information conveyed by light energy and \n\
    \ 4 • Mobility and Transportation 85\nthe sense of vision is expected to play\
    \ a significant role. Lately, the vision \nsense handles around 50% of the information\
    \ that humans interchange with \nthe environment.\nSTATE OF THE ART\nComputer\
    \ vision is one of the main areas within the ecosystem of intelligent \nsensory\
    \ systems. Strategic agendas coincide when pointing out the widespread \ndeployment\
    \ of miniaturized computer vision systems as one of the main \nengines of R&D-and-Innovation\
    \ in IT and nanoelectronics. The challenge is to \nconceive SWaP-optimized artificial\
    \ vision architectures with embedded analy-\nsis capabilities and large efficiency\
    \ in the number of operations completed per \nunit of time and energy. However,\
    \ conventional processing architectures can-\nnot meet these challenges. These\
    \ traditional architectures adhere to the para-\ndigm of encoding the analog information\
    \ in the digital domain (using digital \nimagers) and relying on Von Neumann’s\
    \ digital processing architectures for \nanalysis (A. Rodríguez-Vázquez et al.,\
    \ 2018). It implies encoding, storing, \nand transmitting the whole set of raw\
    \ image data, following a frame-by-frame \noperation basis that uses enormous\
    \ processing and energy resources while han-\ndling meaningless data. This approach\
    \ significantly differs from that of natural \nvision systems as they operate\
    \ by extracting information, instead of just raw \ndata, right from the very front\
    \ ends, at the edge of the information processing \nchain. Retinas, the front\
    \ ends of natural vision systems, are information-centric \nfront-end devices,\
    \ while imagers used in conventional computer vision sys-\ntems are data-centric\
    \ devices.\nThe TIC179 research group and the company Teledyne-Anafocus (which\
    \ \nwas launched in 2001 by members of the TIC179 with the name Innovaciones \n\
    Microelectrónicas S.L.) have conducted R&D on bio-inspired sensor front \nends\
    \ and smart imagers for decades. Contributions follow tracks that are con-\ncurrently\
    \ explored by many other companies and academic institutions world-\nwide, namely:\n\
    • By incorporating early-vision processing tasks right in the focal \nplane, they\
    \ are completed concurrently to light capture. The aim \nis to encode and communicate\
    \ features, instead of frames. The \napproach uses a parallel processing paradigm\
    \ alternative to Von \nNeumann’s architectures but conferred with the software-pro-\n\
    gramming capabilities of such a paradigm (Rodríguez-Vázquez \net al., 2018).\n\

    \ to those \nemployed by natural vision systems, including (i) the detection \n\
    of spatial-temporal contrasts within visual scenes, (ii) the usage \nof pixels\
    \ that trigger when they detect transient lighting changes, \nand (iii) use of\
    \ peak luminance sensors that perform a light-to-\nfrequency conversion (Leñero-Bardallo\
    \ et al., 2018). Similar to fea-\nture-extraction front ends, all these techniques\

    \ of smart-imaging and vision sensor chips. These chips are \nlately the fuel\
    \ of efficient sensor interfaces and hence crucial to incorporate \nArtificial\
    \ Intelligence at systems targeted for the following AI technolo-\ngies: (T1)\
    \ IoT, (T2) robotics, and (T3) augmented/virtual reality. Targeted \napplications\
    \ are, among others, in the following sectors: (S1) advanced \nindustry linked\

    \ ACTIVITIES\nLuis Onieva Giménez and Alicia Robles-Velasco\nABSTRACT\nAsset management\
    \ in water supply and sewerage infrastructures seeks correct \nplanning and prioritization\
    \ of the maintenance activities on their network ele-\nments. To determine the\
    \ replacement priority for each network asset, an original \npriority model is\
    \ utilized. It is based on a risk index that integrates both the proba-\nbility\
    \ and consequences of failure. Besides, when designing and performing work \n\
    programs, water companies generally abide by the street’s topography and other\
    \ \nurban elements, such as complete streets or street sections. This work considers\
    \ \nstreet sections between the two nearest intersections as the operational unit.\n\
    INTRODUCTION\nThe long-term sustainability of hydraulic infrastructures is based\
    \ on a correct \nand effective maintenance strategy. Establishing the right time\
    \ to replace a water \ndistribution and sewer network element is essential to\
    \ properly manage the infra-\nstructure. In this regard, an adequate definition\
    \ of the replacement needs of each \nnetwork element is key to the right infrastructure\
    \ management. Also, this pro-\ncess depends on the reliable condition and criticality\
    \ information of every asset, \nfor which an integrated, complete, and up-to-date\
    \ data system is fundamental.\nMoreover, this replacement priority has been usually\
    \ computed for indi-\nvidual water and sewer pipe objects. Nonetheless, when designing\
    \ intervention \nprograms, the use of this hydraulic element constitutes an ideal\
    \ and abstract \napproach. As a matter of fact, water utilities do not consider\
    \ pipelines to plan \ninterventions but perform work programs according to the\
    \ street’s topography. \nThe inclusion of geographical and urban criteria into\
    \ the planning process \n92 AI Knowledge Transfer \nhelps minimize the affection\
    \ on the traffic flow and the neighborhood, as well \nas fosters coordination\
    \ with other public infrastructure projects.\nSTATE OF THE ART\nThe reviewed literature\
    \ in this field addresses methodologies to develop and \nimplement different infrastructure\
    \ asset management strategies. More specifi-\ncally, the reviewed works target\
    \ the two following aspects: the utilization of a \npriority model to determine\
    \ the replacement urgency of the network assets and \nthe consideration of infrastructure\
    \ ‘units’ that represent the smallest replace-\nment element and abide by the\
    \ street’s topography or urban factors.\nFor example, Elsawah et al. (2016) define\
    \ corridors as the street section \nbetween the two nearest intersections. When\
    \ intervening a corridor, all the water, \nsewerage, and road infrastructure assets\
    \ within that segment are simultaneously \nreplaced. Also, the authors developed\
    \ an overall risk index for the whole corridor \nsegment, integrating the replacement\
    \ needs of the three coexisting infrastruc-\ntures. This methodology is applied\
    \ to a borough of the City of Montreal (Canada).\nA similar example can be found\
    \ in Tscheikner-Gratl et al. (2016), where \nentire street sections are ranked\
    \ for rehabilitation. These elements correspond \nto segments between valves or\
    \ manholes and include the road, water supply, \nand sewerage infrastructures.\
    \ Also, to avoid very long sections, a certain length \nthreshold is set. Again,\
    \ an overall priority index for the whole section is calcu-\nlated. A case study\
    \ of an Austrian city with 130,000 inhabitants is presented.\nLastly, Shahata\
    \ and Zayed (2016) developed another risk assessment \nmodel for road, water distribution,\
    \ and sewer networks. This model was imple-\nmented in the City of Guelph (Canada).\n\
    From the reviewed literature, it can be drawn that the utilization of pipe \n\
    objects as operational units is not practical to develop water replacement strat-\n\
    egies. Thus, the definition of a workable intervention unit complying with \n\
    urban elements, such as street sections, is essential.\nThen, the replacement\
    \ needs for a given corridor or street segment have to \nbe established. The reviewed\
    \ works propose an overall criticality index that is \ncomputed on the basis of\
    \ the previous calculation of an index for each infra-\nstructure separately.\
    \ This approach can lead to some difficulties when setting \nthe relative importance\
    \ of each infrastructure. The utilization of an index that \naddresses a section\
    \ as an integrated and indivisible unit, whose replacement \npriority does not\
    \ require the definition of the relative importance between the \ndiverse infrastructures\
    \ is still missing in the literature. Our contribution to the \nliterature in\
    \ this regard is described in the following section.\n 5 • Agroindustry and Tourism\
    \ 93\nCONTRIBUTION\nOur main contribution has been to establish the replacement\
    \ needs for every \nnetwork operational unit and rank them for intervention. In\
    \ the first place, \nthe operational unit had to be defined. Thus, we proposed\
    \ complete streets or \nstreet sections between intersections to be the smallest\
    \ replacement element.\nNext, an original procedure to determine the replacement\
    \ needs for net-\nwork assets and to rank them for intervention was required.\
    \ To this end, a risk \nindex (RI) was developed (Muñuzuri et al., 2020). This\
    \ index is based on the \nprobability and consequences of failure of a given pipe.\n\
    First, the likelihood of failure was obtained through AI technologies. \nMore\
    \ specifically, the Machine Learning techniques logistic regression and \nsupport\
    \ vector machine were utilized. They serve as a predictive system, \nsince they\
    \ produce an output variable that can be used as a failure probabil-\nity. Eight\
    \ variables were considered to explain pipe failures: material, diam-\neter, age,\
    \ length, number of connections, network type, pressure fluctuation, \nand previous\
    \ record of failures. The results obtained show that the number \nof unexpected\
    \ failures could be significantly reduced. In fact, with either of \nboth techniques,\
    \ and according to the historical data from the city of Seville \n(where this\
    \ methodology was applied), around 30% of failures could have \nbeen avoided by\
    \ replacing only 3% of the network’s pipes (Robles-Velasco \net al., 2020).\n\
    On the other hand, the factors measuring the consequences of failure are \nthe\
    \ water leakage flow and demand for supply pipes, the maximum evacuation \nflow\
    \ for sewer pipes, and the pipe criticality.\nThe RI can be easily assigned to\
    \ every pipe object, providing a replace-\nment priority for all of them. However,\
    \ pipe objects do not represent the opera-\ntional unit. The RI has to be computed\
    \ at a “street section” level. Thus, the \nprobability and consequences of failure\
    \ of the underlying pipes have to be \ntransferred to their corresponding street\
    \ sections. To this aim, the following \nprocedure was implemented.\nFirst of\
    \ all, it has to be noted that street sections and infrastructure objects \nare\
    \ linked by geographical superposition: every network pipe is related to \nthe\
    \ section it runs through. So, the failure probability of a street section \n\
    is computed as the average probability of failure of every pipe included in \n\
    that section. This average value is weighted by the inner pipe’s length. Since\
    \ \npipes may belong to more than one street section, only the length of the pipe\
    \ \ninside the given section is considered. Afterward, the leakage flow, demand,\
    \ \nand maximum evacuation flow for each section correspond to the maximum \n\
    value of all their constituting pipes. Also, a section is considered relevant\
    \ or \n94 AI Knowledge Transfer \ncritical when at least one of their inner pipes\
    \ is, indeed, critical. Once every \nsection is characterized by these five factors,\
    \ its RI and intervention priority \nare obtained.\nFinally, this methodology\
    \ was fully integrated into an easy-to-use software \napplication. It automatically\
    \ processes the input data, such as the network’s \ncondition and criticality,\
    \ and computes a RI value to every street section. This \nuser-friendly tool also\
    \ allows setting the planning horizon and the long-term \nobjective and generates\
    \ a prioritized list of street sections to be intervened. \nThe development of\
    \ this software was carried out by the aggregated partner \nGUADALTEL S.A.\nThe\
    \ here presented methodology was applied to the water distribution and \nsewer\
    \ networks of Seville (Spain), whose complete infrastructure system has a \ntotal\
    \ length of approximately 7,000 km, combining both the supply and sewer \nnetworks.\n\
    This approach can help establish a replacement priority for every network \nasset\
    \ and rank them for intervention, which is the basis to guarantee the long-\n\
    term sustainability of the infrastructure. Besides, since this approach is based\
    \ \non a risk model, combining both probability and consequences of failure, it\
    \ \naids to target those assets whose preventive replacement could avoid much\
    \ \nhigher future economic and social costs.\nFurthermore, this approach considers\
    \ street sections as the smallest \nreplacement units, which may be advantageous\
    \ for various reasons. First, \ngiven that an intervention generally affects single\
    \ streets, the impact on pedes-\ntrians or the traffic flow is reduced. Also,\
    \ it benefits the possible coordination \nof the hydraulic network maintenance\
    \ tasks with other infrastructures coexist-\ning projects, which can help avoid\
    \ duplicated road closures and the possible \nundermining of the company image.\n\
    Therefore, thanks to the integrated risk-based priority model and the uti-\nlization\
    \ of workable and functional operational units, this methodology can \nbe seen\
    \ as a useful and practical decision support system to prioritize mainte-\nnance\
    \ tasks and efficiently invest to guarantee the long-term sustainability of \n\
    the infrastructure.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis project has been carried out in collaboration\

    96 AI Knowledge Transfer \n5.2 NEW DATA STRUCTURE \n(ASYMMETRICAL AND MULTISCALE\
    \ \nGRID) FOR GEODATA INTEGRATION \nAND INPUT FOR MACHINE \nLEARNING ANALYSIS\n\
    Juan Pedro Pérez Alcántara and Esperanza Sánchez Rodríguez\nABSTRACT\nGeographic\
    \ data integration has been an ongoing problem when trying to approach \nmultivariate\
    \ analysis. Besides, workflows for new data analysis techniques and \ntechnologies\
    \ in the Machine Learning and Big Data parallel computing domains \nremain a challenge\
    \ for geographic data because of the intrinsic links between fea-\ntures due to\
    \ topological relationships. Heterogeneous data structures, dissymmetry \nin data\
    \ induced by the scale, and the geometric nature of geographic information, \n\
    especially when using vector structures, hinder multivariate analysis. To overcome\
    \ \nthese difficulties, a new data structure, asymmetrical multiscale grids, and\
    \ a com-\npanion software framework to build and manage them are proposed.\nINTRODUCTION\n\
    Heterogeneous environmental and socio-demographic geographic data integration\
    \ \n(Ojeda Zújar et al., 2021; Batista e Silva et al., 2013) is a vital process\
    \ for multivari-\nate spatial analysis. Different geometry types, like raster\
    \ and vector and, within the \nlatter, the use of polygon, line, and point features,\
    \ coupled with intrinsic geoinfor-\nmation traits like scale significance, pose\
    \ a challenge to this critical pre-analytical \nstep. Moreover, geodata, thanks\
    \ to its tightly interrelated nature due to the underly-\ning topology, lacks\
    \ a common framework when it comes to mapping the data to \nimplement parallel\
    \ processing workflows. To provide this framework, a new data \nstructure, called\
    \ asymmetrical multiscalar grids, is proposed.\n 5 • Agroindustry and Tourism\
    \ 97\nTo test this framework, an array of big data sets has been chosen. These\
    \ \ndata sets have been converted into the new format to test several solutions:\
    \ \nstatistical methods to transform and integrate the data, parallel computation\
    \ \nof this integration in a cloud environment, and suitability of the final product\
    \ \nto feed Machine Learning algorithms. The area of testing is the Autonomous\
    \ \nCommunity of Andalusia, southern Spain, with 83,000 km2. Data sets cover \n\
    demographics, cadastre, household income, and several environmental vari-\nables.\
    \ A cloud microservice application has been developed to integrate the \ndata\
    \ in a parallel computing environment and to serve data via an Application \n\
    Programming Interface (API) service. This API is used to power several web \n\
    visualization solutions.\nSTATE OF THE ART\nWith the increasing production of\
    \ semi-automatic geographic data, especially \nin the earth sciences area, where\
    \ computational models produce vast quantities \nof data sets on a regular basis,\
    \ integration of heterogeneous data sources has \nbecome a matter of research\
    \ in workflows, standards, and technologies (Álvarez \nFrancoso, 2016). Global\
    \ spherical hexagonal grids have been the subject of most \nof these works; among\
    \ them, the discrete global grid system (DGGS) standard \nof the Open Geospatial\
    \ Consortium (2017) (Bondaruk et al, 2019; Birch et al, \n2007) presents a “hierarchical\
    \ sequences of equal area tessellations on the sur-\nface of the Earth”. By relying\
    \ on this common framework, thematic specialists \ncan provide the results of\
    \ their research in a common, discretized reference, \ncompatible with the outputs\
    \ of other analyses. This common reference allows for \nstandardization not only\
    \ of procedures on the grid but of in homogeneous data \nthat can be used more\
    \ easily by non-specialists as input for multivariate analysis.\nCONTRIBUTION\n\
    The result of this project is a software platform that produces data in a new\
    \ geo-\ngraphic information format called the asymmetrical multiscalar grid. This\
    \ format \ndiscretizes the geographic space in a manner that resembles a raster\
    \ data structure. \nHowever, the grid is not pre-generated but mathematically\
    \ defined so each cell \ncan be computed in real time. This grid is used to integrate\
    \ geodata sources by a \nvariety of statistical means, depending on the nature\
    \ of the source data (vector or \n98 AI Knowledge Transfer \nraster, and the geometry\
    \ of the former). Only cells that have colliding source data \nreceive a data,\
    \ being this data only the one that affects the given cell. Therefore, the \n\
    grid is asymmetrical in the two dimensions of geographic data: alphanumeric and\
    \ \ngeometric. Cells without data don’t physically exist in the final output,\
    \ and each \ncell contains only the data set that collides with it. This way,\
    \ there can be cells with \na thousand variables while others may have only a\
    \ dozen, hence the asymmetry \nin the alphanumeric data. This is achieved by capitalizing\
    \ on nonstructured data \nformats commonly found in NoSQL databases, like for\
    \ example the JSON format. \nEach cell ends up containing a thematic vector composed\
    \ of a certain number of \nvariables. Empty cells don’t even exist in the final\
    \ output.\nOn this data structure, microservice architecture has been developed\
    \ to \nintegrate original data into the new format and to serve its data in several\
    \ \nforms. This service API provides data to remote clients. The data stored in\
    \ the \nvectorized alphanumeric variable reservoirs of each cell can be explored\
    \ and \nfiltered, obtaining multivariate vectors that are the common input format\
    \ for \nmost of the Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. To test the suitability\
    \ of this \nformat for ML, both an unsupervised and a supervised method have been\
    \ inte-\ngrated into the platform. For unsupervised processing, the K-Means algorithm\
    \ \nis used, and for the supervised, Random Forest (Bressert, 2012). The platform\
    \ \ncan apply these algorithms successfully to the integrated data stored in cells,\
    \ \nproving that it is useful for this kind of application.\nTo visualize the\
    \ data, some web client technologies have been used. One is \na custom design\
    \ that capitalizes the mathematical definition of the grid, therefore \nminimizing\
    \ the transit of data between client and server, because the geometries \nare\
    \ generated on the fly in the web browser by the geovisor. Given that the geovi-\n\
    sor is receiving the raw data contained in the cell’s vector in JSON format, it\
    \ can \nuse this information for a variety of mixed graphical data exploration\
    \ techniques, \ncombining for example statistical graphs like histograms with\
    \ highly interactive \nmaps. These two techniques, combined and in synch, can\
    \ produce highly flex-\nible and expressive means for data exploration. This geovisor\
    \ leverages the latest \nstandard stack of web technologies, such as HTML5 and\
    \ WebGL (Belmonte, \n2015; Anthes, 2012), along with libraries like D3, to enable\
    \ rich visualization \nclients. Another prototype has been created by exporting\
    \ data into the CARTO \nplatform, which is also a tool specialized in geographic\
    \ data exploration.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis project has been carried out in collaboration\

    \ VISION FOR SUPER-\nHIGH-DENSITY OLIVE ORCHARD\nOrly Enrique Apolo-Apolo and\
    \ Manuel Pérez-Ruiz\nABSTRACT\nNew super-high-density (SHD) olive orchards designed\
    \ for mechanical har-\nvesting are becoming increasingly common around the world.\
    \ However, pre-\ncision farming techniques such as yield monitoring and mapping\
    \ are still a \nchallenge. This study presents a new approach based on deep learning\
    \ algo-\nrithms to continuously monitor yields during the harvesting operation.\
    \ A pre-\ntrained model (Fast R-CNN) was implemented for the detection of two\
    \ classes: \nolives and residues. Olive fruit detection was used to automatically\
    \ count the \nnumber and determine the percentage of residue harvested. Detection\
    \ accuracy \nwith values of 80% was obtained with this novel model in both classifications.\n\
    INTRODUCTION\nYield monitoring and mapping during the harvesting process are essential\
    \ \nfor farmers, since they help them gain access to detailed representations\
    \ of \ntheir crop fields and make olive orchards more profitable. However, unlike\
    \ \nother crops such as cereals where these techniques are already mature, in\
    \ SHD \norchards yield monitoring systems are still an unfilled gap. Probably\
    \ because \nmechanically harvested SHD olive tree plantations have been established\
    \ in \nthe last decades in Spain (Pérez-Ruiz et al., 2018), which requires time\
    \ to \nimplement innovations related to harvesting machinery.\nOn the other hand,\
    \ the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, \nparticularly the\
    \ ones based on deep learning techniques, have shown transformative \nimpact in\
    \ the agriculture sector (Kamilaris & Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018), providing \n 5 •\
    \ Agroindustry and Tourism 101\nsuccessful results in agricultural robotics, crop\
    \ health, yield estimations, growth \nprogress detection, ripeness, and fruit\
    \ size detection among others. Moreover, the \nemergence of ISOBUS technology\
    \ standards has allowed communication and \ndata transfer between tractors and\
    \ agricultural machinery. Hence, the aim of this \nresearch is to develop a machine\
    \ vision yield monitor for a super-high-density olive \norchard suitable to be\
    \ mounted on a mechanical olive harvester.\nSTATE OF THE ART\nFrom the point of\
    \ view of the agricultural, few efforts have been done in develop-\ning solutions\
    \ for yield monitoring and mapping using AI. A machine vision-based \ncitrus fruit\
    \ counting system was developed for a continuous canopy shake and \ncatch harvester\
    \ was proposed by Chinchuluun et al. (2009). Colmenero-Martínez \net al. (2018)\
    \ propose an automatic trunk-detection system for intensive olive har-\nvesting.\
    \ On the other hand, a machine vision yield monitor for the counting and \nquality\
    \ mapping of shallots was developed by Boatswain Jacques (2021). The most \nrelevant\
    \ achievement has been suggested by Bazame et al. (2021). They imple-\nmented\
    \ a computer vision algorithm to detect and classify coffee fruits and map \n\
    the fruits’ maturation stage during the harvesting process. This study is significant\
    \ \nbecause the machinery used in SHD olive orchards and the one used for harvest-\n\
    ing coffee are similar. As a result of their research, accuracy greater than 80%\
    \ in \ndetecting coffee fruits is achieved.\nAccording to the literature review,\
    \ the most important components of yield \nmonitoring and mapping are the global\
    \ positional system receiver (GNSS), mass \nflow sensor, and yield monitor (Chung\
    \ et al., 2016). The combination of all these \ntechnologies provided one of the\
    \ most valuable sources of spatial data for pre-\ncision agriculture, the yield\
    \ maps (Ahmad & Mahdi, 2018). Traditionally, yield \nmonitoring and mapping systems\
    \ were based on volume or weight measurements. \nHowever, with advancements in\
    \ new technologies, especially computer processing \nspeed and AI, the door has\
    \ been opened to more precise developed solutions.\nCONTRIBUTION\nAn image classification\
    \ model based on object detection was trained to recog-\nnize two classes: olives\
    \ and residues. Both classes were included because in many \ncases the olive buyers\
    \ reduce the cost of the crop production depending on the \n102 AI Knowledge Transfer\
    \ \npercentage of residues detected when the olives arrive at the factory. For\
    \ the image \nacquisition, a small conveyor belt prototype was designed as the\
    \ conveyor found on \nthe straddle harvester. A tiny tank to store a known volume\
    \ of olives was attached \nat the beginning of the conveyor belt. Conveyor belt\
    \ speed was regulated using \nan electric engine. At the same time, a square metal\
    \ frame was placed over the \nconveyor belt. A Nikon D5200 digital camera was\
    \ placed in the center of the metal \nframe facing downward. Then, a volume of\
    \ olives and residues was placed in the \nsmall tank to simulate the conveyor\
    \ belt mounted on the harvester. The olive fruits \nrunning over the conveyor\
    \ belt were recorded in video format by the camera. The \nframes from all videos\
    \ were extracted as images using a python script. The videos \nwere recorded under\
    \ natural conditions of daylight and included vibration, occlu-\nsion, and overlapping\
    \ of both olive fruits and residues. A total of 1,000 images \nwere annotated\
    \ in the Visual Object Classes (VOC) format (Everingham et al., \n2010), using\
    \ the LabelImage tool (Tzutalin, 2015). The transfer learning technique \nto reuse\
    \ an existing pre-trained model (Faster R-CNN) originally trained on the \nCOCO\
    \ data set was used. The “data augmentation” technique was also imple-\nmented\
    \ during training. The model was trained during 20,000 steps, achieving a \nloss\
    \ value of 0.21.\nTo deploy the trained model, a Coral USB Accelerator and Google\
    \ Coral \nDev Board were used. These devices allow to perform powerful AI-enabled\
    \ \noffline computation in real-time processing (Natarov et al., 2020) with an\
    \ \nattached RGB camera. The Coral Board with the RGB camera was placed in \n\
    the same place where the Nikon D5200 was attached. Then, a known volume of \n\
    olives with residues was put into the tiny tank. The olives and residues over\
    \ the \nconveyor belt were detected with an accuracy of 95% and 70%, respectively.\n\
    The test in the prototype is just a preliminary study in laboratory conditions.\
    \ \nTo test the model in field conditions, it is intended to install a box with\
    \ a similar \nmetal frame over the conveyor belt of a straddle harvester (New\
    \ Holland Braud \n9090X Olive, CNH Global, Zedelgem, Belgium). This box will be\
    \ equipped with \nthe Coral Board, an RGB camera, and a cooling system to maintain\
    \ the hardware \nunder operative temperatures. Moreover, in the next steps, a\
    \ mathematical model \nwill be developed to relate the number of olive fruit to\
    \ fruit mass and its suitability \nto be sent and displayed on a monitoring screen.\n\

    \ a cyber-physical system based \non low-cost portable multispectral IoT nodes\
    \ and Artificial Intelligence that \nallows the most relevant parameters that\
    \ influence olive quality to be measured \nin a simple and economical way, with\
    \ the benefit of assisting the farmer in \nmaking a decision about when to collect\

    \ monitoring system based on artificial \nvision techniques, using multispectral\
    \ images and AI algorithms applied to \ncrops of products derived from the olive\
    \ tree. The aim is to obtain precise infor-\nmation on those organoleptic variables\
    \ of olives that have an impact on the qual-\nity parameters of the olive oil\
    \ obtained from them. The monitoring is carried out \nat two different moments\
    \ in the process: in the field, during the last months of the \ncampaign, and\
    \ in the oil mill, when the harvested olives are received.\nThe system provides\
    \ information on the level of maturity, the fat yield, and \nthe acidity of the\
    \ olives. These data, traditionally obtained through laboratory \nanalysis, are\
    \ obtained through IoT nodes. The nodes incorporate a processing \nsystem that\
    \ analyzes the image and calculates the corresponding values of the \nquality\
    \ parameters in real time.\nData from these samplings are integrated into a software\
    \ platform that \nprocesses and combines them to offer the farmer precise information\
    \ on the \nstate of the crop that helps them make logistical decisions (i.e.,\
    \ optimal date of \ncollection) and management (irrigation/fertilizers), in order\
    \ to achieve a higher \nproduction while maintaining the quality of the oil.\n\

    \ considered in the literature by different authors. In most \npractical applications,\
    \ it is the infrared bands that provide the most relevant \ninformation for classification\

    \ such as nitrogen and potassium in olive grove \nplots (Gómez-Casero, M.T. et\
    \ al., 2007) or acidity, humidity, and peroxide \nvalue in olive oil samples (Martinez-Gila\
    \ et al., 2015). The use of spectrom-\netry techniques (Vis/NIR) directly in the\
    \ fruit has been proposed by various \nauthors (León et al., 2003), (Cayuela et\
    \ al., 2009) for the generation of predic-\ntive models of quality parameters:\
    \ moisture, dry matter, oil content, free acid-\nity, and maturity index. These\
    \ predictive models use different wavelength sets \nfor each parameter.\nOnce\
    \ the hyperspectral information has been acquired and calibrated, \na system is\
    \ needed for the execution of complex algorithms and the evalu-\nation of the\
    \ characteristics of the crops to be determined. For these algo-\nrithms to work\
    \ properly, it is important to have a large number of samples \nthat contain both\
    \ positive and negative aspects, that is, as many objects \nthat contain what\
    \ is intended to be measured, as well as objects that do \nnot, in order to define\
    \ what are the characteristics of the reflection of the \nmentioned object. In\
    \ order to achieve this, it is important to have a large \ncollection of previous\
    \ images, in a catalog that facilitates application \ndevelopment.\nSolving this\
    \ in traditional computing structures is expensive and com-\nplex since it generally\
    \ requires oversizing above the expected demand. For this \nreason, the use of\
    \ technologies based on the use of cyber-physical systems is \nproposed, which,\
    \ as stated in the European Digital Strategy (Cyber-Physical \nEuropean Roadmap\
    \ & Strategy, 2013-21015), is a disruptive technology that \nallows controlling\
    \ and coordinating processes, on both local and global scale, \nusing communication\
    \ and information technologies.\nCONTRIBUTION\nThe project has been developed\
    \ by the TIC150 research group of the University \nof Seville in collaboration\
    \ with the company SOLTEL, an Andalusian ICT \n106 AI Knowledge Transfer \nconsultancy.\
    \ The stages in which the project has been developed are briefly \ndetailed below.\n\
    \ \na)  Development of a cataloging and labeling tool\n \n \nInitially, the need\
    \ to develop a tool for cataloging olive samples \nwas identified, so that an\
    \ adequate knowledge base could be built \nfor the analysis and training of pattern\
    \ detectors. Subsequently, \nintegration, validation, preprocessing, and semi-automatic\
    \ labeling \nfunctions were added.\n b)  Automatic image validation\n \n \nIt\
    \ is a fundamental function for the creation of the knowl-\nedge database, for\
    \ the algorithm training activities, and also for \nthe effectiveness of the real-time\
    \ detectors. The factors that most \ninfluence a correct interpretation of the\
    \ scene are the lighting and \nthe distance between the camera and the olive tree.\
    \ The perspec-\ntive from which the scene is captured also influences, although\
    \ to \na lesser extent.\n \n \nFor the validation process, a reference framework\
    \ implemented \nin Teflon is used in the capture process. The developed algorithm\
    \ \nlooks for that frame within the scene. From the spectral analysis \nof the\
    \ detected Teflon, it is possible to deduce the characteristics of \nthe ambient\
    \ light, in order to correct its influence on the rest of the \nscene. Using a\
    \ fixed lens, the size of the frame in the scene allows \nus to ensure that the\
    \ distance between the camera and the scene is \nsimilar in all captures. This\
    \ aspect is very important for two rea-\nsons. The first reason is to guarantee\
    \ that the size of the olives is \nsufficient to be detected, and the second one\
    \ is to be able to compare \nthe performance in terms of the number of fruits\
    \ based on their den-\nsity and not on their number within the scene.\n \nc) \
    \ Generation of a hyperspectral signature database\n \n \nHaving a database with\
    \ the spectral characteristics of the differ-\nent analysis objectives is essential\
    \ to obtain efficient classifiers.\n \n \nFor this purpose, the project has implemented\
    \ an algorithm that \nprocesses cataloged images in batches. The algorithm performs\
    \ the \nvalidation of the scene for each image, as well as the extraction of \n\
    spatial scales and lighting correction parameters. The corrected \nmean spectrum\
    \ is calculated for the area marked as olive and it is \nassociated with the labeled\
    \ degree of maturation. The spectra of all \nolives with the same ripening index\
    \ are averaged to obtain a base \nsignature. The most frequent univocal spectral\
    \ signatures present in \nthe same degree of maturation are calculated.\n 5 •\
    \ Agroindustry and Tourism 107\n \n \nUsing this technique, the knowledge model\
    \ will be based not on \none but on a set of signatures. This method facilitates\
    \ the interpre-\ntation of the models and increases the effectiveness and speed\
    \ of \ndetection of the classifiers.\n d)  Classifier training\n \n \nIn this\
    \ work, the paradigm known as “Supervised Learning” has \nbeen chosen, where each\
    \ example is associated with a discrete label \nthat identifies its membership\
    \ in a group or class. The set of exam-\nples is used both to train the algorithms\
    \ and to validate the results \nof their learning. The learning objective may\
    \ be the classification of \nnew examples or predictive inference.\n \n \nOnce\
    \ the algorithm has been trained, it is capable of performing \nseveral functionalities:\
    \ olives detection, olives counting, maturity \nindex estimation, pest detection,\
    \ and pest growth.\n \ne)  Integration\n \n \nData integration has required coordination\
    \ with the other part-\nners to define the information format and the exchange\
    \ mechanism \nbetween the applications involved in the capture, labeling, and\
    \ \nanalysis of the images. A distributed architecture based on REST \nservices\
    \ has been chosen for information exchange.\n \n \nThe intelligent analysis module\
    \ executes the extraction of infor-\nmation and the classification and estimation\
    \ algorithms in real \ntime, that is, as users upload the images to the web platform.\
    \ The \nalgorithms for preprocessing, information extraction, classification,\
    \ \ncounting, and estimation of the maturity index have been integrated \ninto\
    \ the management and operation system by means of a dynamic \nlink DLL library\
    \ that is called from the host that supports the \napplication.\n \n \nThe computational\
    \ performance is high since in the worst-case \nscenario the execution time is\
    \ less than 3 seconds, if we exclude the \nupload times of the images (with sizes\
    \ of 200 MB). Therefore, the \nviability of the developed algorithms is concluded.\n\

    \ ASSETS: CASE \nSTUDIES IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL \nAND ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE\nFrancisco\
    \ Pinto Puerto and Antonio García Martínez\nABSTRACT\nThe project develops and\
    \ adapts digital models based on BIM (building infor-\nmation modeling) and GIS\
    \ to the comprehensive and sustainable management \nof architectural heritage\
    \ supported by CMMS (computerized maintenance \nmanagement system) software. The\
    \ experience of the research team and the \ninvolved companies and institutions\
    \ provides the basis for creating processes \nand methodologies to adapt these\
    \ models for use in two cases of architectural \nheritage: archaeological and\
    \ social housing. The efforts are focused on defin-\ning a specific working methodology\
    \ for each case through meetings with the \ncompanies concerned to establish their\
    \ needs and requirements, create proto-\ncols, adapt resources, and redesign the\
    \ workflows.\nINTRODUCTION\nManaging knowledge and the conservation and maintenance\
    \ of important \nproperties and architectures with heritage status is extremely\
    \ time-consuming \nand resource-intensive for the institutions responsible for\
    \ them. The daily tasks \ninvolved in inspection, simple conservation planning,\
    \ restoration, and renovation \nrequire the acquisition and handling of vast quantities\
    \ of information, all of which \nmust be accessible in real time to ensure that\
    \ the correct decisions are made. In \nthis project, we explore the use of digital\
    \ technological resources that can lead \n110 AI Knowledge Transfer \nto much\
    \ more efficient and sustainable management. To illustrate this, we have \nchosen\
    \ two pilot cases that differ both in their architectures and, naturally, in the\
    \ \nactions required to manage them. However, they have points in common regard-\n\
    ing their complexity and the way in which the workflows are organized.\nTo carry\
    \ out these experiences, we have created digital models that serve \ntwo purposes:\
    \ steering the enormous body of data contributed from different \ndisciplines\
    \ (architecture, engineering, archaeology, history, geography, etc.) \ntoward\
    \ a convergence of knowledge and facilitating the rational application of \npractical\
    \ results in the companies and institutions involved in the conservation \nand\
    \ management of these architectural assets.\nSTATE OF THE ART\nIn recent years,\
    \ numerous authors have pointed out the advantages of imple-\nmenting BIM platforms\
    \ to manage the use and maintenance of properties \n(Aziz, Nawawi & Ariff, 2016;\
    \ Volk, Stengel & Schultmann, 2014).\nThe literature usually cites the main benefits\
    \ of using these platforms, as \nfollows: (a) efficient space management, (b)\
    \ optimization of data storage and \nmanagement, (c) common working and communication\
    \ space for the involved \nagents, (d) possibility of controlling the social,\
    \ environmental and economic \nimpact of the life cycle, (e) efficient and preventive\
    \ detection of the mainte-\nnance operations and necessary repairs, (f) ability\
    \ to link the compiled data \nwith other software programs, IoT, platforms, web\
    \ resources, etc., (g) efficient \nmaintenance of energy systems, and (h) optimized\
    \ planning and operation of \nthe common installations and services in buildings.\n\
    However, the transition from traditional management to more intelligent, \nefficient,\
    \ and advanced BIM management requires the development of pre-\ncise protocols\
    \ and workflows. The benefits are particularly significant in the \nfield of social\
    \ housing, as shown by the results of studies conducted in Triolo \n(Villeneuve\
    \ d’Ascq) in France and in the city of Wellington in New Zealand \n(Dunne, 2019).\n\
    The application of BIM to heritage architecture, known as HBIM, is giv-\ning rise\
    \ to a growing body of scientific literature that examines very different \naspects\
    \ of its connection with digital information models (Mayowa et al., 2021; \nPocobelli\
    \ et al., 2018) In any case, HBIM can be considered to constitute a par-\nticular\
    \ case of the BIM methodological baggage that accords special impor-\ntance to\
    \ the heritage status of the architecture in question.\nThe cultural significance\
    \ of the properties where HBIM is applied high-\nlights the problem of their geometric\
    \ documentation. This must be carried out \n 5 • Agroindustry and Tourism 111\n\
    in terms of architectural survey; in other words, as a critical process consisting\
    \ \nin gathering data about form and conducting an architectural analysis. This\
    \ \nprocess can lead to different levels of knowledge about the concerned property.\n\
    The guardianship (comprehensive management) of architectural heritage \nencompasses\
    \ identification, research, protection, and conservation. HBIM \noffers an efficient\
    \ methodology for the sustainable management of architec-\ntural heritage, adaptable\
    \ to different scales and types, as well as to the specific \nrequirements of\
    \ the agents responsible for its management, from documenta-\ntion to obtaining\
    \ legal protection to the registration and control of preventive \nconservation\
    \ activities.\nCONTRIBUTION\nWe set out with the aim of adapting BIM and GIS digital\
    \ information systems to \nmaintenance management supported by CMMS, in view of\
    \ the broad and com-\nplex range of architectural heritage that needs to be maintained\
    \ and preserved, \nso that it can continue to play a role in society. This particular\
    \ project focuses on \ntwo specific cases: social housing for rent, which requires\
    \ constant inspection \nand servicing by the Andalusian Housing and Renovation\
    \ Agency (AVRA), and \na large and complex set of highly vulnerable archaeological\
    \ ruins that receive \nnumerous cultural visits and are the topic of countless\
    \ research projects—the \nArchaeological Site of Itálica (CAI). We have aligned\
    \ the digital models to meet \nthe needs specified by both institutions: for example,\
    \ creating a workflow that \nfacilitates the management of information for research\
    \ purposes and improving \nthe way information is obtained to assess the maintenance\
    \ costs. This implies \ncreating an open system to allow information to be constantly\
    \ updated and pro-\ncessed so that users can create reports and tables or edit\
    \ existing plans.\nOur ultimate aim is to define the essential elements and the\
    \ most appropri-\nate workflow and create an inclusive system to facilitate use\
    \ by agents who are \nnot familiar with these tools.\nWe have, therefore, compared\
    \ the current working dynamics of the two \ninvolved institutions, defined the\
    \ elements that will be managed, and gath-\nered data from the accumulated experience.\
    \ We have also had to consider the \nhuman team and infrastructures available\
    \ since in the short term they are the \nones who are going to use the system.\n\
    We are currently undertaking four related actions:\nAction 1. Codification of\
    \ the assets and the conservation tasks based \non the systems that the two institutions\
    \ currently use: in the case \n112 AI Knowledge Transfer \nof AVRA, the Building\
    \ Evaluation Report (IEE), and in the case \nof the CAI the data tables, the graphical\
    \ objects in CAD and the \nQGIS platform used to manage routine maintenance work.\
    \ We are \nin the process of codifying the building systems and pathologies \n\
    recorded in the AVRA databases for the public facilities it manages \n(approximately\
    \ 70,000 housing units), and in the case of CAI for an \narchaeological site of\
    \ approximately 45 hectares, plus various plots \nof land in the town of Santiponce\
    \ and environs. In both cases, the \naim is to standardize periodic preventive\
    \ maintenance.\nAction 2. Definition of an IT system, in the form of a toolbox,\
    \ to contain \nthe most common combinations and proposals of architectural and\
    \ \narchaeological intervention for the subsequent comprehensive reno-\nvation\
    \ or conservation project. The renovation will take into account \nphysical, economic,\
    \ and social parameters, as well as energy strategies \nin the case of AVRA, and\
    \ in the case of the CAI, the conservation will \ninclude historical and artistic\
    \ values, as well as its cultural appreciation.\nAction 3. Integration into a\
    \ collaborative BIM and GIS platform of \nall the involved agents, as well as\
    \ the technologies necessary for \nthe traceable and optimal digitalization of\
    \ the information and the \nfuture management of the data, so that the pilot experience\
    \ can be \nreplicated in projects with similar general features managed by \n\
    AVRA or received by the CAI. In the case of AVRA, a digital model \nis being generated\
    \ for one of the properties and will incorporate \nselected information from the\
    \ IEE. In the case of the CIA, one of \nthe Roman houses and its immediate urban\
    \ vicinity are being mod-\neled, and we are also working on a selection of specific\
    \ preventive \nconservation actions across the entire site.\nAction 4. Creation\
    \ of systems for transferring information between \nusers from very different\
    \ disciplines who will be responsible for \nmanaging the information and/or making\
    \ the necessary operational \ndecisions for the conservation, maintenance, and\
    \ intervention in the \naffected architectures.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis project\

    \ book relies on the particular \nnature of the project “Innovative Ecosystem\
    \ with Artificial Intelligence for \nAndalusia 2025”, which has joined research\
    \ groups from the University of \nSeville, on the one hand, and private sector,\
    \ on the other. Together, these two \nparts have been working on the development\
    \ and application of various solu-\ntions to the issues the different sectors\
    \ currently face. Taking into account \nthe fact that all these possible solutions\
    \ are based on Artificial Intelligence \ntechniques, the book is intended to be\
    \ a type of manual or starting point for \nanswering in an innovative way to different\
    \ challenges Andalusia region faces \nin the health sector, sustainability, digital\
    \ economy, mobility, agroindustry, \nand tourism (Figure C.1).\nThis means that\
    \ the book, offering results obtained in 22 subprojects \nthrough the AI approach,\
    \ is primarily oriented to R&D departments of both \nsmall- and medium-sized companies\
    \ and large multinationals, as well as pub-\nlic institutions and health-care\
    \ centers. These departments can find in this \nbook essential information on\
    \ how to establish a mutually beneficial relation-\nship with universities and\
    \ research centers in terms of knowledge transfer. The \nhandbook might also help\
    \ them understand the possibilities of using Artificial \nIntelligence in different\
    \ sectors.\nThe book is also aimed at innovation centers, university communities,\
    \ \nand research groups, as it is an example of best practices in knowledge trans-\n\
    fer, university-business relations, and society and shows Artificial Intelligence\
    \ \ntechnologies as a transversal opportunity for development and innovation in\
    \ \nthe different sectors shown in this handbook (health and social welfare, energy\
    \ \nefficiency and sustainable construction, digital economy, mobility logistics\
    \ and \nadvanced industry linked to transportation, endogenous land-based resources,\
    \ \nagroindustry, and tourism). It is also considered to be an opportunity for\
    \ \nresearch groups to have a real impact on their environment, by enabling uni-\n\
    versities and research centers to be drivers of innovation and improvement of\
    \ \nsociety and industry within their region.\nFinally, it is aimed at university\
    \ students, as it shows AI technologies as a \ntransversal tool for the development\
    \ of different disciplines, highlighting the \nimportance for any student to have\
    \ at least a basic knowledge of these tech-\nnologies, whatever their area of\
    \ study is.\n116 Conclusion \nBIM\nAugmented / \nVirtual Reality\nMachine \nLearning\n\

    \ for human survival and \nis facing several challenges, such as climate \nchange,\
    \ population growth, and increasing demand \nfor food. Smart agriculture systems\
    \ using AI and \nML offer a promising solution to overcome these \nchallenges\
    \ by optimizing production, reducing \nwaste, and increasing yields. The integration\
    \ of AI \nand ML into agriculture systems involves the use of \nsensors, data\
    \ analytics, and machine learning \nalgorithms[1]. These technologies can provide\
    \ \nreal-time insights into crop health, soil moisture \nlevels, and weather conditions,\
    \ enabling farmers to \nmake data-driven decisions. This data is then \nanalyzed\
    \ using AI and ML algorithms to provide \nactionable insights that can help farmers\
    \ make \ninformed decisions. For example, AI and ML can \nbe used to predict crop\
    \ yields, detect plant diseases \nearly, and optimize irrigation schedules based\
    \ on \nweather forecasts. Smart agriculture systems using \nAI and ML can also\
    \ help farmers reduce their \ndependency on traditional farming practices and\
    \ \nmove towards more sustainable and efficient \napproaches[2]. This can lead\
    \ to a reduction in costs \nand an increase in profitability, while also \npromoting\
    \ sustainable farming practices. \n \nThe benefits of smart agriculture systems\
    \ are \nsignificant. By optimizing resource utilization, \nreducing waste, and\
    \ improving productivity, these \nsystems can help farmers increase profits while\

    \ AI and ML, smart agriculture \nsystems can provide real-time insights that can\
    \ help \nfarmers adapt quickly to changing conditions. \nHowever, the implementation\
    \ of smart agriculture \nsystems also presents some challenges. For \nexample,\
    \ many farmers may lack the technical \nexpertise to install and operate these\
    \ systems, and \nthere may be concerns around data privacy and \nsecurity[3].\
    \ Addressing these challenges will be \ncrucial for the successful implementation\
    \ of smart \nagriculture systems using AI and ML. \n \nIn this paper, we will\
    \ explore the various \ncomponents of a smart agriculture system using AI \nand\
    \ ML, including sensors, data analytics \nplatforms, and machine learning algorithms.\
    \ We \nwill also discuss the benefits of this system and \nhighlight some of the\
    \ challenges that need to be \naddressed for its successful implementation. \n\

    \ 2: Precision Agriculture using ML \n \nThe following are the differences between\
    \ the \nprevious work done in this field and our work: \n1. Most of the previous\
    \ work and authors have \nsuggested and used IOT sensors and devices to \npredict\
    \ and recommend the crop , fertilizers and \ndiseases in the plant. \n2. They\
    \ have used sensors like NPK sensors and \nPocket spectrophotometers to check\
    \ and measure \nthe quality of the soil and also their nutrients value \nlike\
    \ nitrogen content , phosphorous content and pH \nvalue. \n3. We proposed a technique\
    \ which is focused only \non the predetermined datasets and based on the \ndatasets\
    \ our model predicts the result. \n4. We have used supervised learning algorithms\
    \ like \nRandom Forest for crop recommendation , Support \nVector Machine(SVM)and\
    \ Random Forest for \nfertilizer recommendation and ResNet- 9 for \ndisease prediction\
    \ with a accuracy score of 98.90% \n, 97.89% and 93.64%. \n \nII. \nLITERATURE\
    \ SURVEY \nIn paper [4], The concept of \"Internet of Things\" \n(IoT) \ninvolves\
    \ \nconnecting \nvarious devices, \nvehicles, and equipment to a network to share\
    \ data. \nThis technology is increasingly used to connect and \ngather information\
    \ from devices, including those in \nagriculture. For this reason, incorporating\
    \ IoT \ntechnology into agriculture is crucial. The \nobjective of this project\
    \ is to establish a smart \nagriculture network that is integrated with the IoT.\
    \ \nTo address the unpredictable weather patterns in \nMalaysia, technology is\
    \ incorporated into an \nirrigation system that utilizes a Raspberry Pi 4 \nModel\
    \ B as the microcontroller. The local climate's \ntemperature and humidity, as\
    \ well as the soil's \nmoisture level, are monitored using the DHT22 and \nsoil\
    \ moisture sensor. This data will be available on \nboth a smartphone and a computer.\
    \ The integration \nof IoT and Raspberry Pi-based smart agriculture \nsystems\
    \ will significantly affect farmers' work and \nimprove agricultural productivity.\
    \ The adoption of \nIoT-based irrigation systems in Malaysia leads to \napproximately\
    \ 24.44 percent savings annually \ncompared to traditional irrigation systems.\
    \ This \ntechnology saves money on labor costs while also \nconserving water resources\
    \ for daily use. \n \n \nFigure 3: Number of publications by \nyears \n \nFig3.\
    \ Shows the rise in number of publications \nafter 2016. \n \nIn paper [7], The\
    \ economy of India heavily relies \non agriculture as a source of income. The\
    \ success \nof agrarian countries like India is dependent on crop \nagriculture.\
    \ The agricultural sector has traditionally \nhindered India's progress, and to\
    \ overcome this, \nmodernization of current agricultural systems \nthrough smart\
    \ agriculture is essential. To achieve \nsmart agriculture, automation and Internet\
    \ of \nThings (IoT) technology are suggested. IoT \ntechnology can be used for\
    \ irrigation decision \nsupport, crop growth monitoring, and crop \nselection.\
    \ To improve crop productivity and \nmodernize the system, a Raspberry Pi-based\
    \ \nautonomous irrigation IoT system has been \nproposed. The main aim of this\
    \ project is to \nmaximize crop growth while using the minimum \namount of water\
    \ necessary. Most farmers spend a \nlot of time in the fields to ensure plants\
    \ receive \nwater at the right moment. The proposed system \naims to simplify\
    \ the circuit's complexity while \nimproving water management. Sensor data is\
    \ used \nto calculate the required amount of water, and two \nsensors measure\
    \ soil temperature and humidity, as \nwell as the amount of daily sunshine received\
    \ and \ntransmit this information to the base station. The \nsuggested methods\
    \ determine the irrigation water \nquantity based on these factors. \n \nIn paper\
    \ [8], For a long time, people have \nconsidered agriculture to be the most important\
    \ \nactivity in human society. Traditional irrigation \nmethods like overhead\
    \ sprinklers and flood \nirrigation are useless. They waste a lot of water by\
    \ \nusing it inefficiently, and because the soil is too wet, \nthey may even make\
    \ people sick by promoting the \ngrowth of fungus. Due to the restricted supply\
    \ of \nwater, a computerized irrigation system is essential \nfor water conservation\
    \ and, consequently, for the \nsuccess of agriculture. \n \nIrrigation uses up\
    \ more than 85% of the water \nresources that are globally accessible. In the\
    \ \napproaching years, it is anticipated that the \npopulation would increase,\
    \ increasing this need. To \ndo this, we must employ creative methods that \n\
    minimize the water consumed for irrigation. Water \nis applied through controlled\
    \ irrigation. After \nsensors in the automated system check that the crops \n\
    have access to water, controlled irrigation is \nemployed to water them as needed.\
    \ Because of its \npractically endless storage and processing capacity \nand speedy\
    \ adaptability, cloud computing is an \nintriguing solution to the massive volume\
    \ of data \ngenerated. The objective is to concentrate on \nvariables like soil\
    \ temperature and moisture. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4: Documents by subject areas\

    \ to monitor irrigation systems \nmay raise privacy concerns among farmers and\
    \ \nworkers. \n \nTable 1: Comparative Study of Smart Agriculture \n \nIn paper\
    \ [5], Agriculture is essential to the Indian \npeople's economy and way of life.\
    \ \nThis project aims to create a mobile app-delivered \nembedded-based irrigation\
    \ and soil monitoring   \nsystem that will reduce the requirement for manual \
    \  \nfield monitoring. The method is made to help \nfarmers increase agricultural\
    \ productivity. Three \nsensors—one for pH, one for temperature, and one \nfor\
    \ humidity—are part of the apparatus used to \nexamine the soil. Based on the\
    \ results, farmers \nmay decide to plant the best crop for the area. \n \nIn paper\
    \ [6], Farmers in the agricultural sector \nrequire an efficient smart irrigation\
    \ system based \non loT. This research has developed a cost- \neffective and weather-based\
    \ smart watering \nsystem. To begin, an effective drip irrigation \nsystem that\
    \ can adjust water flow to plants \nautomatically based on soil moisture levels\
    \ needs \nto \nbe \ndeveloped. \nThen, \nan \nIoT- based \ncommunication feature\
    \ is incorporated into this \nwater-saving irrigation system to enhance its \n\
    effectiveness. This feature allows a remote user \ntomonitor soil moisture levels\

    \ \n \n⚫ Machine Learning Techniques: Machine  learning is \nbecoming more efficient\
    \ and accurate because of deep \nlearning algorithms. Using automated machine\
    \ learning, \none may reduce the need for ML expertise while also \nautomating\
    \ the ML workflow with greater precision. \nThe following algorithms are the ones\
    \ that have been \nimplemented in this present work: \n(i) Random Forest: We utilized\
    \ the binary tree- based \nmachine-learning method, Random Forest(RF), to \npredict\
    \ crop yields. RF has the ability to perform both \nclassification and regression\
    \ tasks, but for our study, we \nfocused on using it as a regression tool. To\
    \ train RF \nmodels, we grew numerous classification and \nregression trees (CARTs)\
    \ with a random subset of \npredictors and without pruning. The resulting forest\
    \ of \nCARTs was then averaged. We also employed \nbootstrapping techniques to\
    \ generate a large number of \ntrees randomly from subsets of the source data\
    \ for \nmodel training. The predictor variables were selected \nbased on how much\
    \ they decreased node impurity \nduring splits or how frequently they produced\
    \ \nsuccessful predictions in the forest of CARTs. Node  \nimpurity, which is\
    \ a measure of the homogeneity \nof a group of data points, was defined as the\
    \ mean \nsquare error (MSE) of the node in RF regression. \n \n(ii) Support Vector\
    \ Machine(SVM): Initially, find \nan ideal hyperplane that meets the classification\
    \ \nrequirement. Afterward, utilize a specific algorithm \nto maximize the separation\
    \ margin around the \noptimal hyperplane while maintaining accurate \nclassification.\
    \ This \nmethod \nenables efficient \nclassification of separable data into categories\
    \ . SVM \nbelongs to the category of learning algorithms based \non structural\
    \ risk minimization, and it offers superior \ngeneralization capabilities \ncompared\
    \ \nto \nother \nconventional learning algorithms based on empirical \nrisk minimization.\
    \ \n \n(iii) ResNet-9: \nResNet-9, \na \nneural \nnetwork \narchitecture that\
    \ can be employed to predict plant \ndiseases. For this application, a dataset\
    \ of images \nportraying healthy and diseased plants is required to \ntrain the\
    \ ResNet-9 model to differentiate between the \ntwo based on their images. Once\
    \ trained , farmers \ncan capture images of their crops using a camera or \nsmartphone\
    \ and utilize the ResNet-9 model to \npredict the likelihood of the plant being\
    \  diseased \nbased on  \nthe captured image. This approach can aid in early \n\
    \   identification of diseased plants and reduce yield     \n    losses and the\
    \ need for pesticides. \n \nHowever, the effectiveness of the ResNet-9 model \n\
    relies on the quality and diversity of the dataset used \nfor training. It is\
    \ essential to remember that plant \ndisease prediction is only one facet of plant\
    \ health \nmanagement, and other factors such as soil quality, \nwater availability,\
    \ and temperature play crucial roles \nin crop growth and yield. \n \nDivision\
    \ of modules in Smart Agriculture:The \nproject includes three modules, namely\
    \ crop \nrecommendation, \ndisease \nidentification, \nand \nfertilizer recommendation.\
    \ These modules are \nincorporated into a web application that is built \nusing\
    \ the Flask framework. When the user opens \nthe web interface, they will be directed\
    \ to a \nwebpage where they can provide details regarding the \nrecommendation\
    \ they require. \nIn the following sections, we will provide more detailed \n\
    information on each of these modules. \n \nModule 1: Crop Recommendation- It focuses\
    \ on crop \nrecommendation using machine learning algorithms. The \ndatasets \n\
    used \nfor \nthis \nmodule \nare \nCrop \nrecommendation.csv, soil.csv, and scientific_names.csv.\
    \ \nThe crop recommendation dataset contains attributes such \nas temperature,\
    \ humidity, average rainfall, soil pH, nitrogen \nrequirement ratio, potassium\
    \ requirement ratio, and \nphosphorous requirement ratio essential for predicting\
    \ a \ncrop. Data visualization techniques, such as correlation \nmatrices and\
    \ scatter plots, were used to analyze the dataset \nvisually[25]. After detecting\
    \ the outliers and visualizing the \nattributes, the dataset was split into a\
    \ training and testing \nset. Five classification algorithms were used to identify\
    \ the \nbest model for predicting the crop. The best model was \nstored in a pickle\
    \ file for future prediction.After the training \nphase, the model's effectiveness\
    \ is evaluated using the \nvalidation set by utilizing various metrics like accuracy,\
    \ \nprecision, recall, or F1 score. These metrics assess how  \n accurately the\
    \ model predicts the appropriate crop \nrecommendations based on the input data.\
    \ Once the \nmodel is trained and validated, it can be employed to \nsuggest suitable\
    \ crops for new, unseen data, such as real-\ntime sensor inputs or historical\
    \ records from a specific \nlocation. By considering input features like current\
    \ \nclimate and soil conditions, the model utilizes its \nacquired knowledge to\
    \ predict the most fitting crop or \ncrops. To enhance the accuracy and dependability\
    \ of the \nrecommendations, crop recommendation models can be \nrefined through\
    \ practices like gathering additional data, \nimproving feature engineering techniques,\
    \ or exploring \nalternative algorithms. Through iterative enhancements, \nthe\
    \ accuracy and reliability of the recommendations can \nbe progressively improved.\

    \ leverage artificial \nintelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) \ntechniques\
    \ have shown promising results in \nimproving crop yield, resource management,\
    \ and \ndecision-making processes. Here are some notable \noutcomes and benefits\
    \ of using AI and ML in smart \nagriculture: \n \nWe have used Orange Data Mining\
    \ for training the \nmodels and predicting the output. We have manually \ngiven\
    \ the input dataset for the model training purpose. \nIn Orange Data Mining, the\
    \ basic data mining units \nare called widgets. There are widgets for reading\
    \ the \ndata, \npreprocessing, \nvisualization, \nclustering, \nclassification\
    \ and others. Widgets communicate \nthrough channels. Data mining workflow is\
    \ thus a \ncollection of widgets and communication channels. \n \nIn this workflow,\
    \ there is a File widget that reads the \ndata. File widget communicates this\
    \ data to Data \nTable widget that shows the data spreadsheet. Notice \nhow the\
    \ output of the file widget is connected to the \ninput of the Data Table widget.\
    \ In Orange, the \noutputs of the widgets are on the right, and the inputs \n\

    Abstract

    Agriculture shows an important role in the enlargement of an economy. The proposed
    system explores how utilizing digital footprints might help improve

    agricultural practices and production. Agricultural data is increasingly available
    in digital form because of the development of modern technology and the

    spread of connected devices. These data can be utilized to produce digital footprints
    that document the whole lifecycle of agricultural production, from

    planting to harvesting. Farmers may then decide when to sow, water, fertilize,
    and harvest their crops by using machine learning algorithms trained on these

    digital footprints to spot patterns and forecast results. The study examines various
    machine learning methods that can be used to examine digital footprints

    and shows the advantages of doing so, including higher yields, better resource
    management, and lower costs. The timing of crop planting, fertilization, and

    harvest has long been determined by the agriculture sector using conventional
    techniques and experience. However, with the expansion of agricultural data

    available, there is now a chance to use machine learning algorithms to recognize
    trends and forecast outcomes based on this data. This study explores the

    potential of machine learning methods, particularly Random Forest optimization,
    to improve agricultural practices and boost output. The study uses Random

    Forest optimization, a potent machine learning method that can examine massive
    datasets, to forecast crop yield based on many variables like weather

    patterns, soil quality, and fertilizer application. The study''s ¦ndings show
    how well the Random Forest optimization technique predicts crop productivity with

    an accuracy of 99.97%. By giving farmers useful information about forecasting
    crop yields, they may increase their overall productivity by using their

    resources wisely. The report also emphasizes the necessity of additional study
    and funding for the creation of machine learning algorithms that are

    speci¦cally customized to the peculiarities of the agricultural sector, as well
    as the signi¦cance of data quality and privacy in the collecting and analysis
    of

    agricultural data. A combination of hardware and software tools, including data
    collection sensors, data processing equipment, graphics processing units

    (GPUs), cloud computing services, and mobile applications, will be needed for
    the hardware implementation of increasing agricultural practices in production

    using machine learning with Random Forest optimization techniques.

    I. INTRODUCTION

    The practice of farming involves cultivating land, keeping animals, and creating
    food, ¦ber, and other goods that support human life. As a source of food and

    raw materials for businesses that produce goods and services, it is a crucial
    sector of the economy. In many developing nations, since it is frequently the
    sole

    source of income for rural communities, agriculture plays a signi¦cant role in
    the economies of those nations. Agriculture has a signi¦cant role in the nation''s

    GDP and export revenues in addition to producing food and raw materials. It advances
    the construction of rural infrastructure, provides cash, and offers

    employment opportunities. The sustainability of the environment and rural development
    are also intimately related to agriculture. To address more general

    economic and social problems like food security, poverty alleviation, and environmental
    sustainability, the agricultural sector is also crucial. Furthermore,

    because higher productivity and e¨ciency can result in higher earnings and investments
    in other industries, agriculture may be a signi¦cant contributor to

    economic growth. In summary, agriculture is an important economic sector that
    has an impact on society and the environment in addition to its economic

    contribution [1]. Agriculture has been practiced for thousands of years, and over
    that period, it has undergone many changes. Scienti¦c techniques and

    cutting-edge technology are used in modern agriculture to boost output and e¨ciency
    while reducing its negative effects on the environment. Agroforestry,

    crop cultivation, and animal husbandry are some of the main agricultural activities.
    Food security, economic growth, and environmental sustainability all

    suffer from the effects of agriculture. Millions of people all around the world,
    particularly in poor nations, depend on it greatly for their daily survival.

    Sustainable agricultural practices are being created to make sure that agricultural
    activities meet the demands of the present without compromising the

    capacity of future generations to meet their own needs [2]. The use of synthetic
    inputs like fertilizers, insecticides, and herbicides to boost crop yields is

    referred to as conventional agricultural practices. These methods are based on
    monoculture farming, which is the practice of growing the same crop over and

    over in a single ¦eld. Large pieces of equipment, irrigation infrastructure, and
    high-input agricultural methods de¦ne conventional agriculture. Even though

    crop yields and food production have increased signi¦cantly thanks to conventional
    agriculture, the environment is still negatively impacted. When synthetic

    inputs are used excessively, they can cause soil erosion, water pollution, and
    biodiversity loss. In addition, monoculture farming''s reliance on crops makes

    them more susceptible to pests and disease, which can cost farmers a lot of money
    [3]. With the help of recent advancements in technology and scienti¦c

    knowledge, modern agricultural practices have undergone tremendous change. Farmers
    can now produce more food with fewer resources and less negative

    environmental impact thanks to these practices. However, the sector faces several
    challenges that can have signi¦cant impacts on its productivity and

    sustainability. Some of the challenges in agriculture include:

    Climate Change: Climate change is a signi¦cant challenge facing agriculture, as
    it can affect crop yields and increase the incidence of pests and

    diseases. Extreme weather events, such as droughts and §oods, can also impact
    agriculture and reduce crop productivity.

    Limited Resources: Agriculture is dependent on several resources, including water,
    land,

    and energy. However, these resources are becoming increasingly scarce due to factors such as population growth and urbanization. This can lead to comp

    Soil Degradation: Soil degradation is a signi¦cant challenge facing agriculture, as it can reduce the productivity
    of farmland and affect crop yields. Soil

    degradation can result from factors such as erosion, overuse of pesticides and
    fertilizers, and deforestation.

    Pest and Disease Management: Pests and diseases can have a signi¦cant impact on
    crop yields, leading to reduced productivity and higher costs for

    farmers. However, managing pests and diseases can be challenging, as it requires a comprehensive understanding of the pests and diseases and the

    appropriate management strategies.

    Access to Markets: Access to markets can be a signi¦cant challenge for farmers, particularly those in developing countries. Farmers may lack access to m

    and transportation systems, which can limit their ability to sell their products
    and receive fair prices.

    Labor Shortages: Labor shortages can be a signi¦cant challenge for farmers, particularly
    in developed countries. Labor shortages can lead to higher labor

    costs and di¨culties in ¦nding workers to perform critical tasks such as planting and
    harvesting.

    Financial Constraints: Farmers often face ¦nancial constraints, including limited
    access to

    credit and high costs for inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, and machinery. These constraints can limit their ability to invest
    in their farms and increase their

    Page 3/20

    productivity.

    Precision agriculture is one of the biggest innovations in contemporary agriculture.
    Data about soil conditions, crop development, and weather patterns are

    collected using cutting-edge technologies like GPS, sensors, and drones. With
    the help of this knowledge, decisions about pest management,

    fertilizer, irrigation, and planting may be made that will maximize yields and
    the e¨cient use of resources [4]. Genetically modi¦ed organisms (GMOs) are

    another signi¦cant development in agriculture. To increase their resistance to
    pests, diseases, and environmental stressors, these crops have undergone

    genetic engineering. As a result, farmers are now able to grow more food with
    fewer inputs like pesticides and herbicides.

    The importance of sustainable agriculture is likewise rising as global concern over climate change and
    environmental degradation rises. Reduced soil erosion,

    water conservation, and soil health are all bene¦ts of sustainable farming techniques
    like cover crops, crop rotation, and conservation tillage.

    By storing carbon in the soil, they also aid in lowering greenhouse gas emissions. The mechanization of farms has
    also aided modern agriculture. Many

    chores can now be automated by farmers, which lowers labor costs. Examples of
    advanced machinery include tractors, planters, and harvesters. Farmers can

    now manage greater land areas, which has increased farming e¨ciency.

    In summary, contemporary agricultural methods are crucial for feeding a growing
    world population while minimizing the negative effects on the environment.

    The "World Population Prospects," makes predictions on population growth. The
    most recent edition of this report, which spans the years 1950 to 2100, was

    released in 2019. According to the report, there were 7.7 billion people on the
    planet in 2019 and 9.7 billion are expected to live there by the year 2050 [5].
    The

    research also points out that although population growth rates have been falling
    since the 1960s, the overall number of people added to the world''s population

    every year has been rising. Farmers may continue to grow their food production
    while using fewer resources by utilizing technology, science, and sustainable

    farming methods, ensuring the industry''s viability. This is implemented using
    arti¦cial intelligence techniques as shown in ¦gure 1.

    Arti¦cial intelligence (AI) is the period used to designate the capacity of machines
    to carry out tasks that would ordinarily require human intelligence to

    complete, such as comprehending natural language, recognizing patterns, making
    judgment calls, and picking up knowledge from experience. The subject of

    arti¦cial intelligence is expanding quickly, revolutionizing several industries
    and perhaps changing how we work and live [6]. Numerous applications, including

    voice assistants, picture and speech recognition, natural language processing,
    and predictive analytics, currently make use of AI technology. It is also

    employed in industries including manufacturing, transportation, banking, and healthcare,
    where it helps to increase productivity, lower costs, and increase

    safety. However, the quick development of AI also prompts signi¦cant moral and
    societal issues. Concerns have been raised regarding how AI will affect

    employment, privacy, and security, as well as the possibility that these technologies
    would help to reinforce prejudice and discrimination. It will be crucial to

    address these concerns as AI technology develops and to make sure that it is created
    and applied in a way that bene¦ts society as a whole. Arti¦cial

    intelligence (AI) is taking on a bigger and bigger role in agriculture by assisting
    farmers and other stakeholders in making better decisions and maximizing

    their operations [7]. Crop observing, yield estimating, soil investigation, and
    pest controller are just a few of the applications of AI.

    Agronomists may spot possible issues early and take action before they worsen
    by using crop monitoring, where AI analyses images captured by drones or

    sensors to ¦nd changes in plant health or growth patterns. Based on data inputs
    like weather patterns, soil conditions, and previous yield data, AI- powered

    yield prediction can assist farmers in estimating crop yields. Additionally, AI
    can identify and forecast the spread of pest outbreaks to assist in pest

    management, analyze soil samples to evaluate nutrient content and provide fertilization
    suggestions.

    In general, using AI in agriculture helps farmers increase their yields, cut costs,
    and encourage sustainable farming methods. It can transform how we cultivate

    food and tackle some of the biggest issues confronting agriculture, such as food
    security and climate change. They are done using machine learning with

    optimization algorithms. It is de¦ned as the branch of arti¦cial intelligence
    called "machine learning" which uses algorithms and statistical models to let

    computers learn from data without having to be explicitly programmed. It is predicated
    on the premise that computers can discover patterns and reach

    conclusions by examining massive amounts of data [8]. With the introduction of
    technology, especially the use of machine learning techniques, agriculture

    has recently seen a substantial revolution. Since it can automate complicated
    activities and make predictions based on data, machine learning has grown in

    popularity. Some of the causes for utilizing machine learning are as follows:

    Automation: By automating time-consuming and repetitive processes, machine learning
    frees up human resources to work on tasks that are more

    complicated and creative.

    Forecasting and prediction: Machine learning models can be trained on historical
    data to create forecasts and predictions about future outcomes,

    including consumer behavior, sales trends, and market prices.

    Personalization: Machine learning can be used to customize user experiences, such
    as news feeds or product recommendations on e-commerce websites.

    Fraud detection: By learning from trends in historical data, machine learning
    can be used to identify fraudulent transactions or activities.

    Natural language processing: Chatbots, voice assistants, and other language-based
    applications can be made possible through machine learning when it

    comes to analyzing and comprehending natural language.

    Image and speech recognition: By using machine learning to identify patterns in
    images and audio, applications like facial and object identi¦cation and

    voice-based user interfaces are made possible.

    This study examines how digital footprints can improve farming practices and increase
    output. The process of transforming information from an analog to a

    digital representation is referred to as digitalization. Then, utilizing electrical
    equipment and computer networks, this digital format may be stored, processed,

    and sent. From the way we interact and consume information to the way we work
    and access healthcare, digitalization has drastically changed many facets

    of our lives [9]. The term "digital footprint" describes the online tracks that
    a person or business leaves behind on the internet. The importance of having a

    digital footprint in agriculture is rising as machine learning-enhanced production
    practices improve farming practices.

    Page 4/20

    Here are a few explanations:

    Data Gathering: Digital footprints can be used to gather information on agricultural
    practices, including the usage of pesticides, irrigation systems, and

    fertilizers. By using this information, it is possible to develop digital pro¦les
    of farms and produce insights that can be used to maximize agricultural

    output. Then, by analyzing this data, machine learning algorithms may provide
    farmers with insights and suggestions for enhancing productivity.

    Predictive Analytics: Machine learning algorithms can create predictions about
    crop yields, insect outbreaks, and weather trends using data from digital

    footprints. This can assist farmers in choosing planting, irrigation, and pest
    management strategies with more knowledge, which can increase yield. With

    precision agriculture, it is possible to construct computerized maps of farms
    that show regions with a particular need, such as nutrient shortages or pest

    infestations. Then, using machine learning algorithms, production can be improved
    by reducing waste and using targeted applications of pesticides or

    fertilizer, for example.

    Crop Monitoring: Sensors, drones, or satellites can employ digital footprints
    to monitor crops in real time. The data can then be analyzed using machine

    learning algorithms to give farmers information on the health and growth trends
    of their crops. This can assist farmers in identifying and addressing

    problems like nutrient de¦cits or pest outbreaks early on, which can boost crop
    yields and lower losses.

    The capacity to store and analyze enormous volumes of data rapidly and effectively
    is one of the main advantages of digitization. As a result, cutting-edge

    ¦elds like machine learning and arti¦cial intelligence have emerged, which generate
    predictions and judgments using vast volumes of data. It is now simpler

    for people to work together across distances and time zones thanks to new kinds
    of communication and collaboration made possible by digitalization. Online

    collaboration tools and remote work have grown in popularity over the past several
    years as a result of this. Agriculture and food production are being

    revolutionized by digitalization [10]. It has the potential to boost productivity,
    cut expenses, and boost yields, ultimately resulting in more lucrative and

    sustainable agriculture.

    In the case of cash crops, digitalization has allowed farmers to more effectively
    track and manage their harvests from planting to harvest. Farmers can

    monitor soil moisture, nitrogen levels, and other crucial factors thanks to technologies
    like precision farming and remote sensing, which improve crop yields

    and cut expenses. Digitalization is assisting in addressing problems with food
    crops such as food waste and ine¨cient supply chains [11]. For instance, food

    goods can be tracked using blockchain technology from farm to table, lowering
    the danger of contamination and enabling more effective recalls.

    Agriculture and food production are being transformed overall by digitalization,
    becoming more effective, sustainable, and pro¦table for both farmers and

    customers. We examine the application of machine learning algorithms in agriculture
    and how they might increase crop output and support farmers'' decision-

    making. We also look at the opportunities and problems associated with integrating
    digital footprints into agriculture and how that might result in sustainable

    practices. The digital footprints that people leave behind when interacting with
    technology are referred to as digital footprints. Digital footprints in agriculture

    can be used to gather information on farming methods, crop output, weather trends,
    and soil health. Machine learning algorithms can be created using this

    data to enhance agricultural practices. For instance, information on weather patterns
    can be utilized to forecast crop output and determine the ideal time for

    sowing. To utilize fertilizer and pesticides most effectively, data on soil health
    can be employed. Machine learning algorithms come in a variety of forms, such

    as reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, and supervised learning [12].
    Unsupervised learning includes spotting patterns in unlabeled data, whereas

    supervised learning uses labeled data to train a machine learning model. Due to
    its capacity to collect and analyze vast amounts of data to produce insights

    that might assist farmers in making more informed decisions, machine learning
    is becoming more and more widely used in agricultural practices. The usage

    of resources can be optimized, waste can be decreased, and crop yields can now
    be increased thanks to machine learning. Precision farming is one of the

    most often used uses of machine learning in agriculture. Applying the appropriate
    inputs, such as fertilizer, herbicides, and water, at the appropriate time and

    in the appropriate amount includes precision agriculture, which involves analyzing
    data to identify variability within a ¦eld. To assist farmers in making more

    accurate judgments about how to manage their crops, machine learning algorithms
    can analyze data from sensors, satellite photos, and weather forecasts.

    Predicting crop yields is another way that machine learning is used in agriculture.
    Machine learning algorithms can create predictive models that assist

    farmers in estimating their yields for the current season by analyzing historical
    data on crop yields and weather trends. Making decisions about when to

    harvest, when to sell, and how much to grow can be done using this information.

    Plant disease management and identi¦cation can both be done using machine learning.
    Machine learning algorithms can detect illnesses and pests early on

    by examining photographs of plants, allowing farmers to take preventative measures
    before serious damage is done. By doing this, you can increase crop

    quality while using less pesticides. Machine learning can be used to enhance not
    only crop management but also animal management [13]. Machine learning

    algorithms can aid farmers in identifying potential health issues and optimizing
    feeding and breeding schedules by analyzing data on animal behavior, such

    as feeding patterns and mobility. Despite the potential advantages of integrating
    digital footprints in agriculture, there are still several issues that need to
    be

    resolved. Data privacy and security are one of the di¨culties. Farmers'' concerns
    about privacy and security may make them hesitant to share their data. The

    absence of technology and data connectivity in rural places is another problem.
    The technology required to gather and analyze data may not be available to

    farmers in remote locations.

    This is implemented through Information and Communication Technology (ICT). By
    boosting output, boosting e¨ciency, and lowering environmental impact,

    ICT has also signi¦cantly contributed to the transformation of agriculture. Using
    ICT in agriculture entails putting different digital technologies to use to help

    agricultural practices such as precision agriculture, smart farming, and farm
    management systems. With the help of ICT tools like GPS, sensors, and drones,

    farmers can monitor and analyze data on their crops and soil to make educated
    decisions about planting, fertilizing, and irrigation. Precision agriculture is
    a

    growing ¦eld. In doing so, crop yields are improved while the consumption of resources
    like water and fertilizer is reduced. Automating various farming tasks,

    such as planting, harvesting, and livestock monitoring, through the use of ICT
    tools like Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and machine learning algorithms is

    known as smart farming. This might lower labor costs, boost productivity, and
    enhance farming techniques'' precision.

    Page 5/20

    To handle several areas of farming, including inventory management, ¦nancial management,
    and supply chain management, farm management systems use

    ICT tools like cloud-based software applications. This can facilitate operational
    simpli¦cation and enhance decision-making for farmers. In general, the

    application of ICT in agriculture has the potential to revolutionize the sector
    by enabling more productive, e¨cient, and sustainable farming methods. The

    major contributions of the proposed work include the following:

    Improved Agricultural Practices: By introducing the use of machine learning algorithms
    in analyzing data gathered from various sources, such as weather

    data, soil samples, and crop yields, the study may contribute to improving ag
    practices. Improved crop yields may arise from farmers making better

    decisions about when to sow, irrigate, fertilize, and harvest their crops as a
    result.

    Increased Crop productivity: By ¦nding ideal circumstances for crop development,
    recognizing and forecasting probable crop illnesses, and suggesting

    the optimum fertilizers or pesticides employ, the implementation of machine learning
    techniques in agriculture may boost agricultural productivity.

    Environmental Sustainability: By using fewer pesticides and fertilizers, improving
    irrigation techniques, and lowering crop waste, the paper may also help

    to advance environmental sustainability.

    Information Transfer: By presenting a framework for how machine learning might
    be used in the agriculture industry, the study may help spread

    information and best practices. This might facilitate the understanding of the
    potential advantages of this technology by other researchers, practitioners,

    and policymakers and promote its implementation.

    In conclusion, the use of machine learning in agricultural practices is growing.
    Farmers can make better decisions, enhance yields, and save waste thanks to

    its capacity to handle massive amounts of data and produce predictive models.
    Machine learning will likely play a bigger part in the future of agriculture as
    a

    result of the ongoing improvement of technology.

    II. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

    The proposed system paved way for smart farming. Using cutting-edge technology
    and data analytic methods, smart farming, sometimes referred to as

    precision agriculture, aims to enhance farming practices, boost agricultural production,
    and lessen waste and environmental effects. Optimizing farming

    operations like irrigation, fertilization, pest control, and crop management,
    entails the integration of numerous technologies like sensors, drones, GPS, and

    arti¦cial intelligence (AI). To meet the increasing demand for food in a world
    that is changing quickly, smart farming aims to make agriculture more effective,

    sustainable, and lucrative. Machine learning is one of these technologies; it
    uses algorithms to ¦nd patterns and insights in huge datasets. Machine learning

    in agriculture offers the potential to increase agricultural productivity and
    support farmers'' decision-making. This research examines how digital footprints
    can

    be used to improve agricultural practices and increase output. Smart agriculture
    practices use a variety of technology to streamline farming processes,

    increase yields, and cut waste. Among the most important technologies used in
    smart agriculture are:

    Precision farming: To maximize crop productivity and reduce resource wastage,
    such as water, fertilizer, and pesticides, precision farming is a

    sophisticated agricultural management method. Making educated judgments regarding
    planting, harvesting, and resource allocation entails gathering

    and analyzing data about the state of the soil, weather patterns, crop growth
    patterns, and other pertinent elements. The GPS is one of the most important

    technologies used in precision farming. (GPS). With the aid of GPS technology,
    farmers can follow their machinery in real-time

    and keep an eye on the location and crop productivity. Making informed judgments
    about where to sow crops and how much fertilizer and water to use can be

    done using this data. Additionally, GPS can be used to build ¦eld maps, which
    can be utilized to spot problem regions such as those with poor soil quality or

    low crop yield. Another increasingly popular precision farming method is Variable
    Rate Technology (VRT). Farmers are now able to apply the exact amount of

    pesticides, water, and fertilizer required for each ¦eld area thanks to VRT technology.
    By doing so, crop yields increase, waste is reduced, and money is saved

    [14]. As an illustration, if a farmer uses VRT to apply fertilizer, the system
    can modify the amount applied following the crop''s needs and the soil''s

    circumstances. The quality and production of the crops can be enhanced by making
    sure that the proper amount of fertilizer is applied to each section of the

    ¦eld. Remote sensing is a crucial tool for precision farming. The health of plants
    and the amount of moisture in the soil can be precisely determined using

    remote sensing technology like satellite photography and drones. Utilizing this
    information will allow you to keep an eye on crop development and spot ¦eld

    issues. The farmer can inspect the region and establish whether there is a pest
    infestation or a nutrient shortage, for instance, if a drone spots a patch of

    fading plants. Precision farming also includes the use of precision irrigation
    systems. These systems optimize water use by using sensors and software to

    make sure crops get the proper amount of water at the right time. Water waste
    is decreased, and crop quality is raised. For instance, a precision irrigation

    system can automatically change the amount of water sprayed to a ¦eld''s dry patches
    if it notices that the area is dry. In conclusion, precision farming

    techniques are revolutionizing the agricultural sector by utilizing cutting-edge
    technology and data analytics to maximize crop output, improve crop quality, cut

    down on resource waste, and boost e¨ciency and pro¦tability for farmers. Farmers
    may decide wisely about planting, harvesting, and resource allocation by

    gathering and analyzing data on soil quality, weather patterns, and crop growth
    patterns. This can result in better outcomes for farmers as well as the

    environment.

    Internet of Things (IoT): The Internet of Things (IoT) is playing a progressively
    signi¦cant part in agriculture, allowing farmers to enhance their resources

    and improve their yields while reducing costs and increasing e¨ciency. Here are
    some of how IoT is revolutionizing agriculture:

    1. IoT sensors can be utilized in agriculture to gather information on soil moisture,
    temperature, and nutrient levels as well as weather, plant development, and

    pest infestations. This information can be used to identify ¦elds that need attention,
    improve irrigation and fertilization schedules, and track crop health and

    growth rates.

    2. Livestock management: IoT sensors can be used to track a livestock''s movement,
    observe its eating and drinking routines, and spot any irregularities that

    would point to an ailment or injury. By using this information, feeding, and care
    schedules can be improved, disease outbreaks can be stopped, and overall

    Page 6/20

    animal health and production can be increased.

    3. Supply chain management: From the farm to the consumer, IoT sensors may be
    utilized to track the movement of crops and livestock. Farmers and

    distributors can bene¦t from this by maximizing logistics, cutting waste, and
    ensuring that goods are delivered to markets on schedule and in good shape.

    4. Monitoring environmental conditions: IoT sensors can be used to keep an eye
    on things like air and water quality, weather patterns, and climate change.

    This can assist farmers in selecting crops, timing plantings, and other agricultural
    practices that are in§uenced by environmental conditions.

    5. IoT technology can be utilized to create autonomous farming systems, where
    robots and drones can take care of chores like planting, watering, and

    harvesting crops. By doing so, the danger of human mistakes can be decreased while
    labor expenses can be decreased and productivity increased.

    Big Data Analytics: Big data analytics in agriculture have the potential to change
    how farmers and agricultural enterprises conduct their operations.

    Farmers may make more educated decisions that can result in higher yields, more
    e¨ciency, and lower costs by gathering, analyzing, and interpreting

    vast amounts of data. Predictive insights are one of the main advantages of big
    data analytics in agriculture. Farmers can estimate future yields with

    greater accuracy by looking back at historical data on weather patterns, soil
    characteristics, and crop performance. This can assist them in maximizing

    planting schedules, selecting the crops that are most suited for a speci¦c site,
    and modifying their agricultural techniques to increase productivity.

    Precision agriculture is another ¦eld where big data analytics can have a signi¦cant
    effect. Farmers can obtain comprehensive information about soil

    moisture, nitrogen levels, and other environmental aspects that in§uence crop
    growth by employing sensors and other data-collection equipment. Making

    decisions concerning irrigation, fertilizer application, and other farming-related
    issues will thus be easier with the aid of this knowledge [15]. Farmers may

    use big data analytics to spot possible issues like pest infestations or crop
    diseases early on. Farmers can spot warning signs early on and take action

    before the issue gets worse by analyzing data from sensors and other sources.
    Big data analytics in agriculture has the potential to greatly boost

    productivity, lower costs, and raise yields. However, it necessitates a large
    investment in technology, data analytic skills, and a readiness to adopt novel

    farming practices.

    Robotics: Precision farming, harvesting, monitoring, and maintenance are just
    a few of the agricultural applications where robots are becoming more and

    more crucial. Increased productivity is one of the key advantages of deploying
    robots in agriculture because they can operate around the clock and

    reliably perform repetitive jobs. Robots can also lower labor costs, boost productivity,
    and enhance sustainability. Robots are having a big impact on

    several industries, including precision farming. Robots can make accurate choices
    on planting, watering, fertilizing, and harvesting by gathering and

    analyzing data on crops, soil, weather, and other aspects. Thus, waste is decreased,
    environmental sustainability is increased, and crop yields are

    improved. Robots used for soil analysis, sensor-equipped drones, and self-driving
    tractors are a few examples of precision farming robots. Harvesting is

    another industry where robots are having a big impact. Robots are being developed
    to pick fruits and vegetables, which can be a labor-intensive operation,

    more effectively and precisely. Additionally, according to quality and other criteria,
    automated systems may sort and grade collected products. Due to their

    ability to operate continuously, harvesting robots can speed up the process of
    getting crops to market. The usage of robots in agriculture also extends to

    monitoring and maintenance. Robots can be employed to keep an eye on crop development
    and spot any issues like pests or illness. With the use of

    sensors and other cutting- edge technology, this can be done, allowing farmers
    to act immediately to avoid crop loss. To eliminate the need for manual

    labor, robots can also complete activities like irrigation, weeding, and trimming.
    In agriculture, autonomous vehicles are also becoming more prevalent

    [16]. It is possible to carry crops and supplies as well as plant and harvest
    crops using self-driving tractors and other autonomous vehicles. This lowers

    the demand for human labor and boosts productivity. Overall, the use of robots
    has the potential to revolutionize agriculture by increasing its productivity,

    sustainability, and e¨ciency. Robots can assist farmers in meeting the rising
    need for food while minimizing the impact of farming on the environment by

    lowering labor costs, boosting production, and improving sustainability. We may
    anticipate seeing even more cutting-edge agricultural robots produced as

    technology develops.

    Cloud Computing: Agriculture is seeing an increase in the importance of cloud
    computing, which bene¦ts farmers, academics, and other sector

    participants in a variety of ways. Cloud computing is assisting in enhancing e¨ciency,
    production, and sustainability in agriculture through data

    management and predictive analytics. Improved data management is one of the main
    advantages of cloud computing for agriculture. It can be di¨cult to

    store and analyse the vast volumes of data

    that farmers produce on their crops, soil, weather, and other variables [17].
    By providing a safe and expandable platform for data processing and storing, cloud

    computing offers a remedy. Farmers who use cloud-based solutions can access and
    analyse their data on any device, at any time, from anywhere. This

    enables them to decide on planting, fertilizing, and harvesting more wisely, which
    increase agricultural yields and decrease can waste. Additionally, the use of

    cloud computing improves communication between scientists and agronomists. Researchers
    can collaborate globally with co-workers and collaborators by

    putting study data on the cloud and making it accessible to them. This might hasten
    agricultural research and development and result in fresh ideas for

    managing crops, controlling pests, and other things. Predictive analytics is a
    bene¦t of cloud computing for agriculture as well. Farmers can utilize cloud-

    based technologies to forecast agricultural yields by examining data on crop growth,
    weather patterns, and other variables. They can then modify their

    planting and harvesting schedules as necessary. The risk of crop loss due to weather
    or other reasons can be reduced and resources may be used more

    effectively as a result. In terms of sustainability, cloud computing also has
    advantages. Farmers can use cloud-based solutions to manage data and cut down

    on the amount of paper and other physical resources required for data storage
    and analysis [18]. Farmers may also cut waste and make better use of

    resources by employing predictive analytics to optimize agricultural yields. Overall,
    cloud computing is playing a signi¦cant role in agriculture, providing

    advantages in terms of sustainability, cooperation, data management, and predictive
    analytics. We may anticipate seeing even more cutting-edge cloud-based

    technologies created for use in agriculture as technology develops, assisting
    farmers to increase output, decrease waste, and satisfy the rising need for food.

    Blockchain technology: To increase transparency, e¨ciency, and sustainability
    throughout the supply chain, blockchain technology is rapidly being

    applied in agriculture. Blockchain technology can revolutionize business and provide
    farmers, consumers, and other stakeholders with a wide range of

    advantages, from tracking food safety to expediting transactions. Improved traceability
    is one of the blockchain''s main advantages in agriculture.

    Farmers may follow their products from farm to table using blockchain-based technologies,
    giving consumers more details about the food''s origins and

    production processes [19]. Permitting quicker and more precise recalls in the
    event of contamination or another problem can assist boost consumer and

    Page 7/20

    farmer trust while also enhancing food safety. E¨ciency gains are another advantage
    of blockchain in agriculture. Farmers may cut down on the need for

    middlemen and streamline the buying and selling of products by adopting blockchain-based
    technologies to coordinate transactions. Better outcomes for

    both farmers and customers may result from this as it can lower costs and improve
    supply chain transparency. Blockchain can also aid increase

    agricultural sustainability. Blockchain-based platforms can encourage more sustainable
    practices and decrease waste by enabling farmers to track the

    environmental impact of their products. Blockchain can also encourage more sustainable
    production methods and lessen agriculture''s impact on the

    environment by giving consumers more information about the sustainability of the
    items they purchase. Smart contracts are one application of

    blockchain in agriculture. The details of the agreement between the buyer and
    seller are directly encoded into lines of code in smart contracts, which are

    self-executing contracts. This reduces the need for middlemen and can lower the
    possibility of fraud or disagreements. Smart contracts can be used to

    automate transactions between farmers and purchasers in the agricultural industry,
    guaranteeing that both sides receive fair compensation and lowering

    the possibility of payment delays or disagreements. By enhancing transparency,
    e¨ciency, and sustainability throughout the supply chain, blockchain

    technology has the potential to fundamentally change the agricultural industry
    [20]. We may anticipate more e¨cient and sustainable agricultural

    practices, which will bene¦t farmers, consumers, and the environment as more producers,
    retailers, and farmers implement blockchain-based systems.

    III. OVERVIEW OF MACHINE LEARNING

    Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to improve agricultural practices,
    by enabling farmers and agriculture professionals to optimize operations,

    increase productivity, and reduce waste. The use of ML in agriculture can include
    tasks such as crop yield prediction, pest and disease detection, precision

    agriculture, and livestock management. By leveraging advanced algorithms and data
    analytics, ML is helping to revolutionize the agricultural sector, improving

    the e¨ciency and sustainability of food production. This is implemented using
    an optimization algorithm. Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm

    that can be used to enhance productivity in agriculture by analyzing large amounts
    of data and providing valuable insights into crop production. The

    algorithm works by creating multiple decision trees, each of which independently
    analyzes a subset of the data [21]. The results of these trees are then

    combined to make a more accurate prediction. Certainly, the following ¦ve categories
    are employed in agriculture to boost production using machine learning

    as shown below in Fig. 2:

    A brief overview of machine learning:

    The development of models to mimic human learning and decision-making can be credited
    with giving rise to machine learning in the 1940s and 1950s. The

    creation of the perceptron algorithm by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957 is one of the
    early instances of machine learning. A particular kind of arti¦cial neural network

    known as a perceptron was capable of learning to divide inputs into two categories
    using a set of weights and biases. The development of decision trees and

    rule-based systems in the 1960s and 1970s contributed to the advancement of machine
    learning research [22]. These techniques were used to create expert

    systems that can decide based on a set of guidelines and information. Machine
    learning began concentrating on statistical techniques and algorithms in the

    1980s and 1990s, like logistic regression and linear regression. Classi¦cation,
    regression, and clustering challenges all used these techniques. Machine

    learning regained prominence in the 2000s with the rise of big data and improvements
    in computing power [23]. Numerous new methods, including deep

    learning and reinforcement learning, have been created and used in a variety of
    ¦elds, such as autonomous cars, natural language processing, and picture

    identi¦cation. Machine learning is still a discipline that is quickly developing
    today, with new methods and programs being created and used in sectors

    including healthcare, ¦nance, and cyber security.

    Following are the steps that machine learning uses to operate:

    1. Data Gathering: Gathering pertinent data from diverse sources is the initial
    stage in machine learning. Depending on the issue at hand and the desired

    solution, this data may be presented in either structured or unstructured form.

    2. Data processing: After the data has been gathered, it must be prepared for
    analysis. To prepare the data for use by machine learning algorithms, the data

    must be cleaned, missing values must be removed, and any outliers must be removed.

    3. Feature extraction: The process of selecting and engineering relevant features
    from the data aims to provide new features that may be more advantageous

    for machine learning algorithms.

    4. Model Selection: After the data is ready, the type of problem being tackled
    is taken into consideration and a suitable machine learning technique is selected.

    supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning are some
    examples of this.

    5. Training the Model: Using the prepared data, the selected machine learning
    method is then practiced. To reduce the error between the projected output and

    the actual output, the algorithm makes adjustments to its parameters as it learns
    from the data during training.

    6. Model Evaluation: After the model has been trained, its generalizability to
    fresh, unexplored data is assessed using a variety of performance criteria.

    7. Model tuning: Depending on the results of the evaluation, the performance of
    the model may need to be improved by modifying its hyper parameters or by

    employing a new algorithm.

    8. Model deployment: The model can be deployed in a production environment to
    make predictions on new data after it has been trained and tweaked.

    9. Monitoring and Maintenance: To ensure that machine learning models continue
    to perform well over time, it is necessary to monitor and maintain them.

    This entails keeping an eye out for data changes, frequently retraining the model,
    and making adjustments as necessary.

    Machine learning is an iterative process, thus when the model is created and applied,
    some steps might need to be repeated or improved. Depending on the

    type of problem being handled, numerous metrics can be used to assess how well
    machine learning models perform. The main objective of assessing a

    machine learning model''s performance is to ¦nd out how effectively it generalizes
    to new, untried data. Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm that

    can be used in agriculture to predict crop yield. It works by creating an ensemble
    of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a random subset of the data

    and a random subset of the features [24]. In the context of agriculture crop yielding,
    the algorithm can be used to predict the yield of a particular crop based on

    Page 8/20

    a variety of input variables such as weather patterns, soil quality, seed varieties,
    and management practices. To use the algorithm for crop yield prediction,

    historical data on crop yields and the corresponding input variables are used
    to train the model. Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the yield
    of

    a new crop based on the input variables provided. The random forest algorithm
    is particularly useful for agriculture because it can handle a large number of

    input variables and can also capture complex interactions between the variables
    that may be di¨cult to identify using traditional statistical methods [25].

    Additionally, the algorithm is robust to noisy data and missing values, making
    it suitable for real-world agricultural data. Overall, the random forest algorithm

    can be a powerful

    tool for predicting crop yields in agriculture and can help farmers make informed
    decisions about crop management and resource allocation. Here are a few

    typical metrics for assessing machine learning models:

    Accuracy: This gauges the percentage of instances that were correctly classi¦ed
    out of all the instances. For classi¦cation issues, it is frequently

    employed.

    Precision is the percentage of all accurately identi¦ed positive instances (also
    known as true positives) among all positive predictions. It is bene¦cial in

    situations when the expense of false positives is large, like in medical diagnostics.

    Recall: In case you forgot, this quanti¦es the percentage of real positives among
    all positive results. It helps identify fraudulent transactions when the cost

    of false negatives is signi¦cant.

    F1 Score: When false positives and false negatives are equally essential, this
    score—which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall—is helpful.

    Mean Squared Error (MSE): For regression issues, this statistic is frequently
    utilized. The average squared difference between the expected and actual

    values is what is measured.

    Since it is expressed in the same units as the target variable, the Root Mean
    Squared Error (RMSE), which is the square root of the MSE, is a more

    understandable statistic.

    R-squared (R2): This indicator shows how much of the target variable''s variance
    the model can account for. A better ¦t is indicated by higher values,

    which range from 0 to 1.

    Depending on the problem being solved, it is crucial to utilize the right evaluation
    criteria when assessing a machine learning model''s performance. To make

    sure the model can generalize to new data, it''s also critical to assess the model''s
    performance on a different test set. The trade-off between model complexity

    and performance is also crucial to take into account because more complex models
    may over¦t training data while underperforming on fresh data [26].

    In general, machine learning models can be divided into three groups based on
    the kind of learning that they employ:

    Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, the target variable is known and
    the computer is trained on a labelled dataset. To make precise predictions

    on fresh, unforeseen data, the model must learn the link between the input features
    and the target variable.

    Unsupervised Learning: In unsupervised learning, the goal variable is unknown
    and the machine is trained on an unlabelled dataset. The model''s objective

    is to identify structures, correlations, and patterns in the data without receiving
    any direct instruction or feedback.

    Reinforcement Learning: In reinforcement learning, a machine learns by doing things
    incorrectly, interacting with its environment, and receiving feedback

    in the form of rewards or punishments. The ideal policy, which maximizes the cumulative
    reward over time, is what the model seeks to learn. In robots,

    video games, and control systems, this kind of learning is frequently employed.

    The following categories are used to enhance productivity in agricultural sectors
    evolving machine learning techniques:

    Crop prediction: Choosing which crops to grow, when to plant them, and how to
    maximize their production all depend on crop prediction, which is a crucial

    component of agriculture. To ¦nd trends and create precise predictions, machine
    learning (ML) approaches have shown considerable promise in the ¦eld of

    crop forecasting. The gathering and pre-processing of data is the ¦rst stage in
    crop prediction using ML. This entails compiling information on many

    elements, such as weather patterns, soil quality, and the type of crop planted,
    that may have an impact on crop development [27]. The data is then pre-

    processed to clean out any errors or noise and to make sure that it is in a format
    that ML algorithms can use. The pre-processed data is then subjected to ML

    algorithms to ¦nd patterns and generate predictions. Several ML methods, such
    as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and

    arti¦cial neural networks, can be applied to crop prediction. (ANN). Each algorithm
    has its advantages and disadvantages, and the best one to use depends on

    the particulars of the problem at hand. The ML algorithm can be used to generate
    predictions on new data after being trained on existing data. For instance, a

    farmer can input information on the weather, soil quality, and other parameters
    to predict the yield of a speci¦c crop in a given season, and the ML algorithm

    will then do so [28]. The ability to maximize crop yield and minimize waste is
    one of the main advantages of utilizing ML for crop prediction. ML algorithms

    can detect the ideal circumstances for crop growth and suggest adjustments to
    planting plans, irrigation schedules, and other practices to maximize yield by

    analysing data on the elements that affect crop growth. The ability to lower the
    risk of crop failure for farmers is another advantage of utilizing ML for crop

    prediction. Farmers can take proactive steps to minimize or lessen the impact
    of crop failure by utilizing pest-resistant crops or modifying planting dates
    by

    forecasting the possibility of crop failure based on factors such as weather conditions,
    soil quality, and disease outbreaks. In conclusion, crop prediction using

    machine learning has the potential to completely transform the agricultural industry
    by empowering farmers to make data-driven decisions that maximize

    crop output and minimize risk [29]. To accurately anticipate crop production and
    assist farmers in choosing planting techniques, irrigation schedules, and

    other practices that in§uence crop growth, machine learning (ML) systems analyse
    vast volumes of data and look for trends. It is expected that ML technology

    will become more and more signi¦cant as it develops in agriculture and other sectors
    of the economy.

    Plant disease detection: Farmers and the agriculture sector are very concerned
    about plant diseases. They can lower crop quality and result in considerable

    yield losses, which might result in ¦nancial losses. To reduce these losses, early
    plant disease detection and prevention are essential. To forecast plant

    Page 9/20

    diseases and provide prompt intervention to stop their spread, machine learning
    approaches can be helpful. Data collection is the ¦rst step in the machine

    learning process used to predict plant diseases. This entails gathering information
    on the plant species, its growth stage, the type of disease, and climatic

    factors including temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Sensors, drones, satellite
    photography, and human observation can all be used to gather data [30]. Once

    the data is collected, it is pre-processed to remove noise, handle missing values,
    and normalize the data. Feature engineering is then performed to extract

    relevant features from the data that can be used to train the machine learning
    model. The extracted features may include plant morphology, texture, color, and

    shape, as well as environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. Various
    machine learning algorithms can be used for plant disease prediction,

    including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and deep learning
    models such as convolutional neural networks. The choice of algorithm

    depends on the size and complexity of the dataset and the accuracy required for
    prediction. The trained model is then tested on a separate dataset to evaluate

    its accuracy and performance. This is done by splitting the data into training
    and testing sets, with the majority of the data used for training the model and
    a

    smaller subset used for testing. A map displaying the location and severity of
    the disease or an alert system notifying farmers when the sickness is found are

    just two examples of how the model''s results can be displayed to the user. Using
    this knowledge, preventive steps can then be taken, such as applying

    fungicides or removing affected plants [31]. Machine learning- based plant disease
    prediction has several advantages over conventional disease detection

    techniques. By enabling early illness identi¦cation, it can lessen the need for
    expensive and time-consuming manual checks. Additionally, it can assist farmers

    in deciding when and where to apply fungicides and other

    treatments, minimizing the amount of chemicals needed and the negative effects
    on the environment. In conclusion, predicting plant diseases using machine

    learning is a potential strategy that can help to lower crop losses and improve
    agricultural practices. The right machine learning algorithms must be chosen,

    together with careful data gathering, pre-processing, and feature engineering.
    Machine learning can deliver precise and timely predictions of plant illnesses

    with the correct methods and equipment, allowing farmers to take preventative
    measures to save their crops [32]. In conclusion, predicting plant diseases

    using machine learning is a potential strategy that can help to lower crop losses
    and improve agricultural practices. The right machine learning algorithms

    must be chosen, together with careful data gathering, pre- processing, and feature
    engineering. Utilizing the appropriate methods and resources, machine

    learning.

    Weed detection: Weed detection using machine learning is a rapidly developing
    ¦eld that has the potential to revolutionize the way we manage agriculture. In

    traditional agriculture, weed management is time- consuming and labour-intensive,
    often requiring the use of herbicides, which can have negative

    environmental impacts. Machine learning-based weed detection offers an alternative
    solution, using computer vision and machine learning algorithms to

    identify and map weeds in real time. One of the key advantages of machine learning-based
    weed detection is its ability to process large amounts of data

    quickly and accurately. This is achieved by training machine learning algorithms
    on large datasets of images of crops and weeds [33]. These datasets are

    typically labelled to identify which pixels correspond to crops and which correspond
    to weeds, allowing the machine learning algorithm to learn to distinguish

    between the two. The training data is fed into a machine learning model, which
    then uses this data to create a model that can recognize patterns in new

    images. When new images of crops are input into the model, the machine learning
    algorithm can quickly identify which pixels correspond to weeds and which

    correspond to crops. This information can then be used to create a map of weed
    distribution across a ¦eld. Several challenges must be addressed when

    developing a machine learning-based weed detection system. One of the key challenges
    is ensuring that the system is robust to changes in lighting conditions

    and other environmental factors. This can be achieved by using a combination of
    image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to pre-

    process images before they are input into the weed detection model [34]. Another
    challenge is ensuring that the system can generalize to new images that it

    has not seen before. This can be achieved by using a combination of data augmentation
    techniques and transfer learning, which involves using a pre-trained

    model as a starting point for training a new model on a smaller dataset. Several
    different types of machine learning algorithms can be used for weed

    detection, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), support vector machines
    (SVMs), and decision trees. Each of these algorithms has its strengths

    and weaknesses, and the choice of algorithm will depend on the speci¦c requirements
    of the application [35]. In conclusion, weed detection using machine

    learning has the potential to revolutionize agriculture by providing a fast, accurate,
    and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional weed management

    techniques. While there are still several challenges that must be addressed, advances
    in computer vision and machine learning are making this technology

    increasingly accessible to farmers and researchers alike.

    Crop yield prediction: Crop yield prediction is a crucial task in agriculture
    as it helps farmers and agricultural experts to make informed decisions about
    crop

    production, resource management, and market supply. Traditionally, crop yield
    prediction has been done using various statistical models and methods, but

    with the recent advancements in machine learning, it has become possible to predict
    crop yields more accurately using data-driven approaches. Machine

    learning has proven to be a valuable tool in agriculture and has the potential
    to revolutionize the industry by making it more e¨cient and sustainable. The

    main objective of crop yield prediction using machine learning is to develop models
    that can accurately estimate the yield of a particular crop in a speci¦c

    area based on various factors such as weather conditions, soil properties, and
    agricultural practices. Machine learning models for crop yield prediction

    typically use large datasets of historical weather and crop data to train the
    model and make predictions for the future. One of the most common approaches

    for crop yield prediction is supervised learning, where the model is trained using
    labelled data, which includes both input features (such as temperature,

    rainfall, and soil type) and

    the corresponding crop yield. Supervised learning algorithms such as regression,
    decision trees, and neural networks are commonly used for crop yield

    prediction [36]. These algorithms can learn the relationship between the input
    features and the output variable (crop yield) and make accurate predictions for

    new data. Another approach for crop yield prediction is unsupervised learning,
    where the model is trained on unlabelled data to identify patterns and

    relationships in the data. Clustering algorithms such as k-means clustering and
    hierarchical clustering are commonly used in unsupervised learning for crop

    yield prediction. These algorithms can group similar data points based on their
    characteristics and help identify areas with similar crop yield patterns. In recent

    years, deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
    recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been applied to crop yield

    prediction. CNNs are particularly useful for analysing spatial data such as satellite
    images to identify crop types, growth stages, and yield potential [37]. RNNs

    are well-suited for time series data such as historical weather data, which can
    be used to predict future weather patterns and their impact on crop yields.

    Page 10/20

    One of the key challenges in crop yield prediction using machine learning is the
    availability and quality of data. Historical weather and crop data may not be

    readily available or may be incomplete, making it di¨cult to train accurate models.
    Moreover, the data may be biased or outdated, leading to inaccurate

    predictions. Another challenge is the interpretation of the machine learning models,
    which can be complex and di¨cult to understand for non-experts.

    Therefore, it is important to have a clear understanding of the data and the machine
    learning models used for crop yield prediction. In conclusion, crop yield

    prediction using machine learning is a promising approach to improving the e¨ciency
    and sustainability of agriculture. With the right data and machine

    learning models, it is possible to accurately predict crop yields and make informed
    decisions about crop production and resource management. However, there

    are challenges in data availability, model interpretation, and practical implementation
    that need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of machine

    learning in agriculture.

    Farm management: Farm management is a complex process that involves numerous tasks,
    such as planting, harvesting, pest control, and irrigation, among

    others. With the advent of machine learning and arti¦cial intelligence, farmers
    can use technology to optimize their operations and improve their yield.

    Machine learning is a subset of arti¦cial intelligence that enables computer systems
    to learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that data.

    In the context of farm management, machine learning can be used to analyze various
    data sources, including weather patterns, soil conditions, and crop

    growth, among others. One way in which machine learning can be used in farm management
    is by analysing satellite imagery to monitor crop health and

    growth. By analyzing changes in vegetation density and color, machine learning
    algorithms can predict crop yields, identify areas of the farm that require

    attention, and provide recommendations for irrigation and fertilization [38].
    Another application of machine learning in farm management is in predicting

    weather patterns and their impact on crop growth. By analyzing historical weather
    data and current weather patterns, machine learning algorithms can predict

    future weather patterns and provide farmers with recommendations on how to adjust
    their operations to minimize the impact of adverse weather conditions.

    In addition, machine learning can be used to optimize irrigation and fertilization
    schedules by analyzing soil data and plant growth patterns. By analyzing the

    nutrient content of the soil and the growth rate of the plants, machine learning
    algorithms can provide farmers with recommendations on the optimal amount

    and timing of irrigation and fertilization. Machine learning can also be used
    to predict pest and disease outbreaks and provide farmers with recommendations

    on how to prevent or mitigate them [39]. By analyzing historical data on pest
    and disease outbreaks, as well as current weather and soil conditions, machine

    learning algorithms can predict the likelihood of an outbreak and provide farmers
    with recommendations on how to prevent or mitigate it. In conclusion,

    machine learning has the potential to revolutionize farm management by providing
    farmers with valuable insights and recommendations on how to optimize

    their operations and improve their yield. By analyzing various data sources, including
    weather patterns, soil conditions, and crop growth, machine learning

    algorithms can provide farmers with

    recommendations on irrigation, fertilization, pest control, and other key aspects
    of farm management, enabling them to make more informed decisions and

    improve their bottom line [40]. There are several advantages of using machine
    learning in agriculture, some of which include:

    Increased E¨ciency: Machine learning algorithms can help farmers and other agriculture
    stakeholders optimize their operations by reducing the time and

    effort required to perform tasks such as crop monitoring, disease detection, and
    yield forecasting. This can help to increase overall e¨ciency and reduce

    costs.

    Improved Crop Yields: Machine learning algorithms can help farmers predict crop
    yields by analyzing a wide range of data, including weather patterns, soil

    moisture, and historical crop yields. By predicting yields more accurately, farmers
    can make better decisions about when to plant and harvest crops, leading to

    increased yields.

    Enhanced Resource Management: Machine learning algorithms can help farmers manage
    resources such as water, fertilizer, and pesticides more e¨ciently.

    By analyzing data on crop growth and soil conditions, these algorithms can optimize
    resource usage, reducing waste and maximizing productivity.

    Early Disease Detection: Machine learning algorithms can analyze data from sensors
    and other sources to detect signs of plant diseases early. This allows

    farmers to take proactive measures to prevent the spread of disease, minimizing
    the impact on crop yields.

    Precision Agriculture: Machine learning can help farmers to target speci¦c areas
    of their ¦elds that require more attention, allowing for more precise

    application of resources such as fertilizer and pesticides. This can reduce waste
    and improve overall crop health.

    Overall, the use of machine learning in agriculture has the potential to revolutionize
    the way that crops are grown and managed, leading to more e¨cient,

    sustainable, and productive farming practices.

    IV. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM

    The proposed system involves machine learning with random forest optimization
    to detect various parameters such as crop yield, disease prediction, weed

    detection, etc. The proposed system is shown in ¦gure 3.

    1. Data gathering: Data gathering is an essential step in machine learning, and
    it is particularly crucial when building a model to detect crop yield using the

    random forest algorithm. The quality and quantity of data used to train the model
    can signi¦cantly affect its accuracy and ability to make accurate

    predictions. To gather data for crop yield detection using random forests, one
    must collect data on various environmental factors that affect crop growth and

    yield, such as soil type, temperature, rainfall, sunlight, and fertilizers used.
    The data must be collected from different farms, regions, and seasons to ensure
    a

    diverse dataset. Once the data is collected, it must be preprocessed, cleaned,
    and prepared for training the random forest model. The dataset should be split

    into training, validation, and testing sets to prevent over¦tting and ensure the
    model''s generalizability. The random forest algorithm is a powerful tool for
    crop

    yield detection as it can handle high- dimensional datasets with non-linear relationships
    between variables. It works by creating multiple decision trees and

    combining them to make predictions. Each tree is trained on a random subset of
    the features and a subset of the training data to reduce the risk of over¦tting

    Page 11/20

    [41]. Overall, data gathering is a critical step in machine learning using the
    random forest algorithm to detect crop yield. By collecting high-quality and diverse

    data, preprocessing it, and training the model, we can accurately predict crop
    yield and optimize farming practices for improved crop production. The predicted

    data set is observed from a village to detect the crop yield as shown in ¦gure
    4. At the settlement, the information is taken into account as latitude varies
    from

    place to place. To operate the system, information on the crop, the climate in
    a speci¦c village, and the region are three necessary elements.

    1. Data processing: In machine learning, data processing is a critical stage that
    involves transforming raw data into a format that can be easily analysed by

    algorithms. The data processing stage typically includes several steps, such as
    data cleaning, data transformation, feature extraction, and data splitting. Data

    cleaning involves removing any irrelevant or duplicate data, correcting errors,
    and handling missing data. Data transformation involves scaling, normalizing,
    or

    encoding the data to ensure that it is in a standardized format. Feature extraction
    involves selecting the most relevant features that have a strong correlation

    with the target variable [42]. After completing these steps, the data is usually
    divided into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used
    to train

    the machine learning model, while the validation set is used to evaluate the model''s
    performance during training. Finally, the testing set is used to evaluate the

    model''s performance on unseen data. Overall, the data processing stage is essential
    for ensuring the quality of the data and the accuracy of the machine

    learning model [43]. Proper data processing can lead to better model performance,
    faster training times, and more accurate predictions. The testing and

    training phase is implemented in Matlab as shown below:

    2. Feature extraction: A crucial stage in machine learning is feature extraction,
    which entails choosing and manipulating pertinent information from raw data

    to produce instructive features for predictive models. Features like soil type,
    weather patterns, and crop health can all be identi¦ed and studied using feature

    extraction techniques to increase production in agriculture [44]. Some common
    techniques for feature extraction in agriculture include:

    Remote sensing: Using satellites or drones to capture images of crop ¦elds, which
    can then be analysed to extract features such as vegetation index,

    crop growth stage, and soil moisture.

    Sensor data: Collect data from sensors such as soil moisture sensors, temperature
    sensors, and weather stations to extract features such as

    temperature, humidity, rainfall, and soil nutrients.

    Data fusion: Combining data from multiple sources, such as remote sensing and
    sensor data, to create more informative features for predictive modelling.

    Data pre-processing: Transforming raw data into more useful features, such as
    scaling, normalization, and dimensionality reduction techniques. By using

    feature extraction techniques in agriculture, machine learning models can be trained
    to predict crop yields, identify areas for improvement, and optimize

    resource allocation, leading to improved productivity and pro¦tability for farmers.

    3. Model selection: Model selection is an important step in machine learning in
    agriculture to improve productivity. It involves choosing the most appropriate

    machine learning algorithm and model for a speci¦c agricultural problem. Here
    are some key considerations for model selection in agriculture:

    Data quality: The quality and quantity of data available are critical for selecting
    an

    appropriate machine learning algorithm and model. Ensure that the data is representative, unbiased, and of high quality.

    Complexity: Agricultural systems can be complex, with many variables and interactions. Consider the
    complexity of the problem when selecting a model.

    Simple models such as linear regression may work for simple problems, while more
    complex models such as neural networks or decision trees may be needed

    for more complex problems. Interpretability: Interpretability is important in agriculture, as it allows for the understanding of the model''s decision-

    making process. More interpretable models, such as decision trees, may be preferred
    over less interpretable models such as neural networks.

    Performance: The performance of the model is a key consideration. Evaluate the model''s performance
    using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision,

    recall, and F1 score. Consider the trade-off between model performance and interpretability.

    Scalability: Consider the scalability of the model, as agricultural systems often
    involve large amounts of data. Models that can handle large volumes of data,

    such as deep learning models, may be preferred. Overall, selecting the right machine
    learning model can help improve agricultural productivity by enabling

    better decision-making, predicting crop yields, detecting disease outbreaks, and
    optimizing resource allocation. Here random forest algorithm is initiated to

    enhance productivity.

    4. Optimization algorithm: Random Forest is a machine-learning algorithm that
    can be used for classi¦cation and regression tasks. While it can be applied to

    various ¦elds, including agriculture, it is not speci¦cally designed to extract
    maximum yield in agriculture. That being said, Random Forests can be used in

    agriculture to make predictions based on input variables such as soil type, weather
    conditions, and crop variety. For example, a Random Forest model could be

    Page 12/20

    trained to predict crop yield based on factors such as temperature, rainfall,
    soil pH, and fertilizer application rates. The model could then be used to optimize

    crop management decisions, such as adjusting irrigation schedules, choosing optimal
    planting dates, and selecting the most effective fertilizers and

    pesticides. To train a Random Forest model for agricultural applications, data
    must ¦rst be collected and pre-processed [45]. This might involve gathering data

    on crop yield, weather conditions, soil properties, and other relevant factors
    from past growing seasons. Once the data is collected, it can be split into training

    and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model. The Random Forest algorithm
    works by creating a multitude of decision trees, each trained on a

    subset of the data. The algorithm randomly selects a subset of the available features
    at each split point, which helps to reduce over¦tting and improve

    generalization. During training, the algorithm measures the accuracy of each decision
    tree on the training set and uses this information to build a consensus

    model that combines the predictions of all the trees as shown below:

    In this code, we ¦rst load the dataset and split it into training and testing
    sets using the divider and function. The optimized hyperparameters (x_opt) are
    used

    to train the ¦nal random forest model using the TreeBagger function. The model
    is then used to predict the test set and the accuracy of the model is calculated

    as the RMSE. Note that this code assumes that the crop_yield_data.mat ¦le contains
    a matrix X of features and a vector y of corresponding yields. The

    hyperparameters being optimized are the minimum leaf size (x(1)), the number of
    variables to sample (x(2)), and the maximum number of splits (x(3)). Once

    the model is trained, it can be used to predict crop yield based on input variables
    such as weather data and soil properties [46]. The accuracy of the model can

    be evaluated using the testing set, and adjustments can be made to improve its
    performance. In summary, Random Forests can be used in agriculture to

    predict crop yield and optimize management decisions. To train a Random Forest
    model for agricultural applications, data must be collected and pre-

    processed, and the model must be evaluated using a testing set as represented
    in ¦gure 5.

    5. Model evaluation: The model evaluation process in machine learning (ML) involves
    assessing the performance of a trained model on a set of test data to

    determine its accuracy, precision, recall, and other evaluation metrics. In the
    context of agriculture, one popular ML algorithm is the Random Forest algorithm,

    which is commonly used for tasks such as crop yield prediction, pest detection,
    and soil quality assessment. Here is a step-by-step process for evaluating a

    Random Forest model in agriculture:

    Collect and preprocess data: Collect data related to the agricultural problem
    at hand, such as soil data, weather data, crop growth data, etc. Preprocess

    the data by removing missing values, scaling features, and converting categorical variables into
    numeric form.

    Split the data: Split the preprocessed data into two parts: training data and
    test data. The training data is used to train the Random Forest model, while the
    test

    data is used to evaluate the model''s performance.

    Train the model: Train the Random Forest model on the training data. The model
    should be tuned to obtain the best results.

    Test the model: Test the model on the test data. The test data should be completely
    separate from the training data to avoid bias.

    Evaluate the model: Evaluate the performance of the model using various evaluation
    metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix,

    etc. These metrics will provide insight into how well the model is performing
    and whether it is suitable for the given agricultural problem. Adjust the model: 

    Based on the evaluation results, adjust the model parameters or the preprocessing
    steps to improve the model''s performance.

    Finalize the model: After obtaining satisfactory results, ¦nalize the model and
    deploy it for practical use. Overall, the model evaluation process in MI using

    Random Forest in agriculture involves collecting and preprocessing data, splitting
    it into training and test data, training and testing the model, evaluating its

    performance using various metrics, and adjusting the model as needed to achieve
    optimal results.

    6. Performance analysis and outcome: The proposed system is applied in Matlab
    Simulink to assess the optimum results as demonstrated in ¦gure 6.

    The confusion matrix is a performance evaluation tool that is widely used in machine
    learning to measure the accuracy of a model''s predictions. In the context

    of a random forest algorithm for agricultural yield enhancement, a confusion matrix
    can be used to evaluate the accuracy of the model in predicting crop yield

    based on a set of input variables such as soil type, weather conditions, and crop
    variety. 

    The confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classi¦cation
    model by comparing the actual and predicted values [47]. 

    It consists of four different components: true positive (TP), true negative (TN),
    false positive (FP), and false negative (FN1).

    In the context of agricultural yield enhancement, these components can be de¦ned
    as follows:

    True positive (TP): The number of times the model correctly predicted a high-yield crop when the
    actual yield was high.

    True negative (TN): The number of times the model correctly predicted a low-yield crop when the
    actual yield was low.

    False positive (FP): The number of times the model incorrectly predicted a high-yield crop when the
    actual yield was low.

    False negative (FN): The number of times the model incorrectly predicted a low-yield crop when the
    actual yield was high.

    The confusion matrix can be used to calculate several performance metrics for
    the model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics can

    provide insights into how well the model is performing and can help identify areas
    for improvement.

    Algorithm description

    CNN

    The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm has shown great potential in
    various ¦elds, including agriculture crop yield prediction.

    CNNs can learn complex patterns and relationships in high- dimensional data, making
    them suitable for analyzing crop images and

    predicting yield. In agriculture crop yield prediction, CNNs are used to analyze
    crop images captured by drones or other aerial vehicles. The

    images are pre-processed and then fed into the CNN to extract features and learn
    patterns. The CNN then makes predictions on the yield

    based on the features extracted from the images [48]. CNNs have been used to predict
    crop yields for various crops, including maize, wheat,

    and rice. The predictions made by CNNs are accurate and reliable and can help
    farmers make informed decisions about crop management.

    Overall, CNNs have the potential to revolutionize agriculture by providing accurate
    crop yield predictions, which can help farmers optimize

    crop management practices and increase crop yields.

    SVM

    Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm that can be used
    in agriculture to predict crop yield. SVM is a supervised

    learning technique that is used for classi¦cation and regression analysis. It
    works by ¦nding the best decision boundary that separates the

    data points into different classes or predicts the value of the target variable.
    In agriculture, SVM can be used to predict crop yield based on

    various input features such as soil quality, weather conditions, and farming practices.
    The algorithm can analyze these features and create

    a model that can predict the crop yield for a given set of input data [49]. The
    use of SVM in agriculture can help farmers make informed

    decisions about planting and harvesting crops. By analyzing historical data, SVM
    can predict the optimal time to plant a crop, the best

    fertilizers to use, and the ideal harvesting time. This can help farmers increase
    their crop yields and reduce the risk of crop failure.

    RNN

    Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of deep learning algorithm that can be
    used in agriculture to predict crop yields. RNNs are

    particularly useful for time-series data, where the data points are collected
    at regular intervals, such as daily or monthly. In agriculture, RNNs

    can be used to analyze a variety of factors that affect crop yields, including
    weather patterns, soil moisture, and fertilizer usage. By

    analyzing this data over time, RNNs can identify patterns and make predictions
    about future crop yields.

    RNNs work by processing inputs sequentially, with each new input being in§uenced
    by the previous inputs [50]. This allows the model to

    capture the temporal dependencies between the data points, which is important
    in time-series analysis. The output of an RNN is a prediction

    of the next value in the sequence. Overall, the use of RNN algorithms in agriculture
    can help farmers make more informed decisions about

    when to plant and harvest their crops, as well as how much fertilizer to apply
    and how often to water their crops. By predicting crop yields

    more accurately, farmers can increase their productivity and pro¦tability, while
    also reducing waste and environmental impact.

    Regression

    algorithm

    To forecast crop yield, regression methods can be employed in agriculture. These
    algorithms can examine several variables that affect

    agricultural output, including weather patterns, soil quality, and fertilizer
    application rates. The program analyses past crop yield data as

    well as data on the variables that affect crop output to forecast crop yield in
    the future. Farmers may enhance crop yields and decrease

    waste by using this data to drive their decisions about when to plant, how much
    fertilizer to use, and when to harvest. Regression algorithms

    are useful for forecasting crop yields, and modern agriculture is using them more
    frequently.

    kNN

    The k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm is a machine learning technique used to
    classify data based on similarity measures. In agriculture,

    kNN can be used to predict crop yields by analyzing historical data on crop yields
    and environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall,

    and soil nutrient levels. To use the kNN algorithm in agriculture crop yield prediction,
    the ¦rst step is to gather relevant data on past crop

    yields and environmental factors for a given region. This data can be used to
    train the algorithm and create a model that can predict future

    crop yields based on new environmental data. Once the model is trained, it can
    be used to predict crop yields for a speci¦c location by

    comparing its environmental data to the historical data in the training set. The
    kNN algorithm identi¦es the k-nearest neighbors to the new

    data point and assigns a yield prediction based on the average yield of those
    neighbors. Using the kNN algorithm in agriculture crop yield

    prediction can help farmers optimize their crop production by providing accurate
    predictions of future crop yields. This information can be

    used to adjust crop management practices and make informed decisions about crop
    selection and planting schedules.

    Table I denotes the classi¦cation of the machine learning algorithm.

    Table II determines the crop yield prediction using various machine learning algorithms
    to obtain the optimum results. This shows that the random forest

    algorithm helps to obtain the optimum results. Numerous challenges in agriculture
    have been successfully solved using random forest algorithms. They are

    favored over many other algorithms for a variety of reasons.

    First of all, farmers can make better decisions because of random forest algorithms''
    high accuracy, which is crucial in agriculture. Farmers can properly

    forecast crop yields, spot disease outbreaks, and make better- informed decisions
    about irrigation and fertilizer use by employing random forest algorithms.

    Secondly, random forest algorithms are highly robust to outliers, noise, and missing
    data. This is particularly important in agriculture, where data can be noisy

    and incomplete due to various factors like weather conditions, soil quality, and
    pest attacks.

    Thirdly, random forest algorithms provide feature importance, which means that
    they can identify the most important variables that in§uence the outcome of

    a particular problem. This is helpful in agriculture, where farmers can use this
    information to focus their efforts on the most critical variables.

    Finally, random forest algorithms are scalable and can handle large datasets,
    making them suitable for agriculture, where large amounts of data are generated

    from various sources.

    Overall, the high accuracy, robustness, feature importance, and scalability of
    random forest algorithms make them an excellent choice for solving problems in

    agriculture.

    Future trends of AI in agriculture:

    The future of agriculture is being shaped by arti¦cial intelligence (AI) and machine
    learning (ML) technologies. These technologies have the potential to

    revolutionize the industry by improving crop yields, reducing waste, and making
    farming more e¨cient and sustainable One trend that is expected to gain

    traction is precision farming. By using AI and ML algorithms, farmers can monitor
    crop health, water usage, and soil quality in real-time, enabling them to

    make data-driven decisions and optimize resource allocation. This can lead to
    higher yields, lower costs, and reduced environmental impact. Another trend is

    the development of autonomous farming equipment. Self-driving tractors and other
    machines equipped with AI and ML algorithms can navigate ¦elds, detect

    and remove weeds, and plant crops with precision, reducing the need for human
    labor and increasing e¨ciency. AI-powered predictive analytics is also

    expected to play a signi¦cant role in agriculture. By analyzing historical data
    and real-time weather and soil conditions, farmers can predict crop yields and

    identify potential issues before they become signi¦cant problems. Overall, AI
    and ML technologies have the potential to transform agriculture, making it more

    sustainable, e¨cient, and productive. As these technologies continue to develop
    and become more accessible, they will help farmers address the challenges of

    feeding a growing global population while protecting the environment.

    VI. CONCLUSION

    Using machine learning in agriculture with optimization aims to raise crop yields,
    decrease resource waste, and boost farmer pro¦tability. For the best planting,

    irrigation, fertilization, and pest management practices, machine learning models
    can analyze a signi¦cant quantity of data on crop development, soil

    characteristics, weather patterns, and other factors. The agricultural process
    can be further enhanced by introducing optimization algorithms into the machine

    learning models to discover the optimum solutions to issues like crop rotation,
    water management, and harvesting schedules. This may result in less waste,

    more effective use of resources, and eventually higher yields and more pro¦tability
    for farmers. Overall, using machine learning and optimization in agriculture

    can help farmers overcome some of the di¨culties they encounter, including the
    need to produce more food with fewer resources and the rising need for

    sustainable farming methods.

    Abstract This research investigates the potential benefits of integrating machine
    learning algorithms and IoT sensors in modern agriculture. The focus is on optimizing
    crop production and reducing waste through informed decisions about planting,
    watering, and harvesting crops. The paper discusses the current state of machine
    learning and IoT in agriculture, highlighting key challenges and opportunities.
    It also presents experimental results that demonstrate the impact of changing
    labels on the accuracy of data analysis algorithms. The findings recommend that
    by analyzing wide-ranging data collected from farms, including real-time data
    from IoT sensors, farmers can make more informed verdicts about factors that affect
    crop growth. Eventually, the integration of these technologies can transform modern
    agriculture by increasing crop yields while minimizing waste. In our studies,
    we achieve a classification accuracy of 99.59% using the Bayes Net algorithm and
    99. 46% using Naïve Bayes Classifier, and Hoeffding Tree algorithms. Our results
    indicate that we achieved high accuracy results in our experiments in order to
    increase crop growth. Keywords crop prediction; machine learning; feature selection;

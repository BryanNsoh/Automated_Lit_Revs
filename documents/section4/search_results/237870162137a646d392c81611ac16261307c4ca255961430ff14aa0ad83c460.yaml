    \ recognizing applications in precision agricultural\nsystems that use data science\
    \ techniques as well as so-called machine learning techniques. Big data\nanalytics\
    \ have created various data-intensive decision-making opportunities. This study\
    \ reviews\nthe big data analysis practices in the agriculture industry to resolve\
    \ various problems to provide\nprospects and exciting ﬁelds of application in\
    \ China. In the successful implementation of precise\nfarming, the high-volume\
    \ and complicated data generated present challenges for the economic\ngrowth of\
    \ China. Emerging deep learning techniques seem promising and must be reinvented\n\
    to meet current challenges. Thus, this paper suggests a big data analytics agriculture\
    \ monitoring\nsystem (BDA-AMS) to ensure the highly accurate prediction of crop\
    \ yield in precision agriculture and\neconomic management using a deep learning\
    \ algorithm. The convolution neural network gathers\nthe raw images from UAVs\
    \ and performs early predictions of crop yield. The simulation analysis\nusing\
    \ an open-source agricultural dataset resulted in a high parameter–precision ratio\
    \ (98.8%), high\naccuracy (98.9%), a better performance ratio (95.5%), an improved\
    \ data transmission rate (97.8%),\na reduced power consumption ratio (18.8%),\
    \ and an enhanced weather forecasting ratio (94.8%),\nproduction density ratio\
    \ (98.8%), and reliability ratio (98.6%) compared to the baseline models.\nKeywords:\

    1. Introduction\n1.1. Background and Origin of the Research\nAs the speciﬁc sector\
    \ of economic growth develops, agriculture creates jobs in the\nlargely rural\
    \ communities in China. Agriculture is the most consistent word used to\nindicate\
    \ the various ways in which plants and domestic animals are provided with food\
    \ and\nthrough which other goods are produced for the global human population.\
    \ The agriculture\nsystem complements a very broad range of agriculturally integral\
    \ and descriptive activities,\nsuch as cultivation, domestication, crops, farming,\
    \ and vegetation, and proper handlings\nsuch as mixed food production, deforestation,\
    \ and new competition [1]. Agricultural\nanalysis and actual farming production\
    \ systems rely on and generate a host of internal and\nexternal data information\
    \ system resources as well as control economic management in\nChina. Agriculture\
    \ manufacturing provides possibilities in developed countries to pull\npeople\
    \ out of poverty and offers job options and food as well as other raw materials\
    \ [2].\nAgriculture provides more employment from agricultural machinery manufacturers,\
    \ food\nprocessing plants, logistics, utilities, and production, playing an important\
    \ part in the\nsupport and promotion of China’s economic management and representing\
    \ the backbone\nof everything [3,4].\nPrecision agriculture has now improved and\
    \ might continue to change farming man-\nagement, as farmers take the mixture\
    \ of resources, search lands, and inputs into account\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 2905.\

    Agronomy 2022, 12, 2905\n2 of 19\nregarding how they use conservation techniques,\
    \ how they should price their crops, and\nhow they consider the long-term scale\
    \ of their activities [5]. Several scientiﬁc contributions\ninvolve precision\
    \ agriculture (PA), particularly in terms of data collection strategies, data\n\
    analysis, high-sensitivity identiﬁcation, ﬁeld activity, and accurate agriculture\
    \ evaluation.\nPrecision agriculture has resulted in signiﬁcant data development\
    \ in agriculture, which\nhas challenged researchers and farmers to ﬁnd new ways\
    \ to analyze and use data for\nimproved decision-making [6,7]. Precision agriculture\
    \ uses data, web data, and stream\ndata from different sources, such as crop growth\
    \ monitors, agro-informatics websites, and\nsatellite images, for decision-making\
    \ and to predict agricultural big data interactions [8].\nThe function of unmanned\
    \ aerial vehicles (UAVs) is essential for fostering large-scale\nmonitoring and\
    \ data-acquiring applications in precision agriculture. They reduce the\ndependence\
    \ on non-existence or on the increased costs of third-party accessibility and\n\
    computing resources [9,10].\nBig data is an emerging concept that describes any\
    \ structured data, sub-data, and\nunstructured data that are capable of being\
    \ exploited. Big data are generated at the intersec-\ntion between geoprocessing,\
    \ ﬁeld development, climate, and consumer knowledge [11]. A\ncombination of technologies\
    \ and analytics are involved in big data applications in agricul-\nture [12].\
    \ Big data applications involve collecting, compiling, and promptly analyzing\
    \ new\ndata to enhance and guide analysts and farmers in making choices [13].\
    \ Geographic data\ndetails are site-speciﬁc information that is historically correlated\
    \ with precise cultivation,\nsuch as land-speciﬁc properties and crop yields.\
    \ Big data are always referred to as the\nnext big thing in many agriculture circles\
    \ [14]. Increasing information gathered on crop\nproduction at the farm level\
    \ (big soil data) and detailed weather data (big climate data)\nare forming the\
    \ backbone of precision agriculture technology and will help to develop the\n\
    agricultural economic management of China [15]. The design of big data technology\
    \ in\nagriculture can either guide farmers in helping long-organized supply chains\
    \ to become\nefﬁcient or can lead farmers to execute short production processes\
    \ along with distributors\nand the government [16,17]. Scale-neutral big data\
    \ technologies are being developed to\nprevent farmers from choosing one form\
    \ of agricultural production over another [18].\nAs large amounts of data are\
    \ collected to inform individual agriculture and ﬁelds, the\nexpansion of technology\
    \ makes them possible to be applied to different proportions of\nfarmers [19].\
    \ Big data analytics aims to create an effective decision-making framework that\n\
    functions as a guide to agricultural production. The present research will collect\
    \ focused\ncategories that will allow different types of consumers to obtain their\
    \ data [20,21]. The\nstudy of the varying factors affecting crop yield can be\
    \ based on big econometric data [22].\nWhile UAV contributions are well-known\
    \ and signiﬁcant for the development of sustain-\nable agricultural production,\
    \ incorporating these components into the perception layer is\nexpected to considerably\
    \ boost solutions for tracking, production analysis, forecasting, and\ndecision-making\
    \ [23,24].\n1.2. Literature Works\nMa Li et al. [25] proposed Agricultural Economic\
    \ Development (AED) in China. AED\nanalyzes the coupling properties and spatial–temporal\
    \ trends of agrarian labor shifts and\nrapidly urbanized economic growth through\
    \ empirical and structural analytical techniques\ncentered on framing regional-level\
    \ information from 1991, 2000, and 2010 collected in\nChina. In conclusion, several\
    \ suggestions for developing the central, secondary, and\nprimary economies and\
    \ the vitality of rural economies are made that are centered on\ncombined types\
    \ and spatially distributed features of economic–labor friction correlations.\n\
    Long Liang et al. [26] developed the agricultural subsidies assessment of cropping\n\
    system (ASACS). ASACS was used to evaluate lifecycle assessment (LCA) to determine\n\
    the environmental effects in Huantai County, which experiences high-density and\
    \ high-\nintensity cultivation when implementing the winter/summer corn replacement\
    \ method.\nOver the period from 1996 to 2012, there was a reduced energy capacity,\
    \ climate change\npotential acidiﬁcation ecotoxicity, and turbid possibility.\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 2905\n3 of 19\nWenjing Li et al. [27] discussed a hybrid modeling\
    \ approach (HMA). Their proposed\nHMA aims to investigate factors that decide\
    \ the acceptance of precision agriculture in-\nnovations in Chinese farming in\
    \ crop structures and makes suggestions for potential\ntechnology developments.\
    \ The requirements that make it easier for farmers to implement\nsuch technologies\
    \ were the best indicators. These factors must be taken into consideration\nby\
    \ policymakers and utility companies to promote innovations\nKeswani, B. et al.\
    \ [27] initialized the IoT and big data-based decision support (IoT-DSS)\nto produce\
    \ appropriate valve control commands. Precision agriculture requires production\n\
    changes in the region, sales growth, resource support, and environmental impact\
    \ according\nto an automated processor’s range of information and documentation.\
    \ The collection of\ninformation in real time is performed using the proposed\
    \ implementation technique of the\nIoT node tested in the region. An IoT-DSS system\
    \ is proposed to accumulate 17 global and\nenvironmental parameters when predicting\
    \ the possible impact on soil MC within 1 h. This\narticle discusses the system’s\
    \ entire architecture, the implementation approach, and the\nproposed IoT-based\
    \ DSS framework’s performance.\nSieverding, H., M. et al. [28] introduced an LCA\
    \ primer for the agricultural community.\nThe term LCA is commonly used to describe\
    \ several methods and analytical resources. Life-\ncycle analysis provides a transdisciplinary\
    \ method where teams with various competencies\nand experiences can better use\
    \ all occupations. This paper aims to provide the agricultural\npopulation and\
    \ the agriculturists associated with LCAs with an initial treatment. Agricul-\n\
    tural LCAs can differ greatly because agricultural products have multiple end\
    \ uses, are\ncomplex, and can be produced by various practices, resources, and\
    \ production systems.\nCrop LCAs are subject to different data points, aggregation\
    \ methods, production processes\nand facilities, yields, and analytical assumptions.\n\
    Mohapatra, A. G. et al. [29] deliberated smart data-based decision support (SDSS)\
    \ by\nconsidering the temperature, soil, water, crop information, and agriculture\
    \ quality and\nuniformity from the challenging information-based systems currently\
    \ being maintained.\nThis work (SDSS) was carried out alongside DSS to produce\
    \ accurate SMS alerts using\ninterfaces between the GPS module and an efﬁcient\
    \ heating irrigation control method.\nThe farm data that are aggregated in real\
    \ time are introduced to the radial basis model’s\nneural network function. The\
    \ soil data are supported by the DSS model for the appropriate\ngeneration of\
    \ SMS notiﬁcations to the farmer’s mobile device. The proposed smart DSS\nsystem\
    \ reduces the amount of wastewater resulting from precipitation by considering\n\
    temperature, land, water, and crop data.\nPham, T. N et al. [30] indicated that\
    \ many diseases affect the quality of fruits and grains\nand pose a serious threat\
    \ to global food security, while convolutional neural networks\n(CNN) and artiﬁcial\
    \ neural networks (ANN) provide fast and accurate tools for identifying\nplant\
    \ diseases. A list of multiple measurement-related features representing blobs\
    \ was\nchosen and then sorted using a wrapper-based feature selection method based\
    \ on a hybrid\ntechnique based on the model’s effectiveness. They preferred the\
    \ application that used an\nANN input, and their ﬁndings were compared to those\
    \ from a different methodology that\nsuccessfully used CNN models that had been\
    \ improved by transfer learning. The results\nshowed that their methodology can\
    \ be applied to reduced devices such as smartphones to\nsupport farmers on the\
    \ land.\nBhat, S. A et al. [31] introduced the current big data applications used\
    \ in smart agricul-\nture and some of the challenges of big data technology in\
    \ the agricultural sector. This work\ncompared and discussed the computational\
    \ characteristics and limitations of different ma-\nchine learning (ML) techniques\
    \ in precision agriculture. Most of these big data applications\nare applicable\
    \ to large industrial farms, and very little work has been carried out on small\n\
    farms in the developing world.\nBased on this literature review, there are some\
    \ issues with existing methods. Hence, in\nthis paper, BDA-AMS has been proposed\
    \ to identify the crop growth level and to improve\nproduction. Big data can be\
    \ used to create various data-intensive decision-making opportunities.\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 2905\n4 of 19\nBig data analysis has become an integral part of agricultural\
    \ economic management\nand has played an important role in crop production, agricultural\
    \ product processing,\ntransportation and storage, and safety prevention, and\
    \ has largely improved the efﬁciency\nof management in precision agriculture.\
    \ Through big data analysis, management depart-\nments are able to quickly integrate\
    \ resources, improving the efﬁciency of the management\nof the agricultural economy\
    \ and laying a good foundation for agricultural development.\n2. Big Data Analytics-Initiated\
    \ Agriculture Monitoring System (BDA-AMS)\n2.1. Reasons for System Design\nThis\
    \ paper discusses precision agriculture using big data analysis for crop yield\n\
    prediction, reducing labor, and improving agriculture monitoring systems to enhance\n\
    China’s economic management. Big data analytics in agriculture provide meaningful\n\
    insight to advance weather decisions, improve crop efﬁciency, and reduce the possible\n\
    usage of fertilizers and pesticide costs. The management of the social and economic\
    \ growth\nof China mainly depends on precision agriculture and crop yield production.\
    \ The details of\nagriculture regarding precision spraying and the details of\
    \ crop yield are stored on a cloud\nplatform in which precision agriculture and\
    \ agriculture monitoring systems are used to\ndevelop China’s economic management.\n\
    Various big data sources in precision agriculture use UAV components with organized\n\
    and unstructured data types. In agriculture, big data applies to the huge amount\
    \ of data\ngenerated from social and measured agricultural work. The processing\
    \ and management\nof big data is a difﬁcult challenge across the traditional platforms\
    \ and methodologies\nused to manage China’s economic condition. Big data analysis\
    \ and UAV solutions can\nsupport farm production companies and departments in\
    \ carrying out agricultural growth\nand productivity analyses, supporting expected\
    \ agriculture trends, and identifying social\nstatus. Big data analysis and ICT\
    \ applications can take real-time management measures\nin precision agriculture.\
    \ Knowledge of big historical information can be mined, and\ntrends can be discovered\
    \ to forecast harmful agriculture events. This paper suggests a\nbig data analytics-initiated\
    \ agriculture monitoring system (BDA-AMS) to ensure high-\nprecision crop yield\
    \ predictions using a deep learning algorithm based on the social and\neconomic\
    \ background.\n2.2. BDA-AMS’ Basic Framework and Main Principles\nBDA-AMS’ basic\
    \ framework is roughly expressed in Figures 1 and 2.\nFigure 1 demonstrates cloud\
    \ computing-based precision agriculture. In all ways,\nagricultural activities\
    \ are responsible for a substantial amount of data input/production as\nwell as\
    \ remote sensing data and use much of their external information to direct farmers’\n\
    decisions through the use of weather data and satellite images. Usually, three\
    \ features of\nlarge agricultural concept data, including volume, variation, and\
    \ velocity, are employed.\nIn other words, the variety of data obtained in massive\
    \ quantities due to high speed from\nagricultural activities can be called big\
    \ data. In the interest of big agricultural data, the data\nproduced from distributed\
    \ resources and constrained sources to be extracted, processed,\nand analyzed\
    \ to cloud computing in agriculture can provide analysts and decision-makers\n\
    with massive solutions to solve economic problems. The beneﬁt of the cloud is\
    \ that it\nis capable of gathering and centering complete data independent of\
    \ their origin from\nspecial blocks during extensive data management processes\
    \ for detailed processing, such\nthat valuable information is recorded to maintain\
    \ the related economic issues. This can\nbe achieved using new database architectures,\
    \ including research methods, databases,\nand distributed storage, when processing\
    \ extensive information to spread loads across\nseveral nodes using the maximum\
    \ abstraction of the parallel mechanism. Using precision\nagriculture and the\
    \ crop production to predict the agricultural economic management is\nutilized\
    \ with the data obtained from the database server and the remote user, as illustrated\n\
    in Figure 2.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 2905\n5 of 19\nAgronomy 2022, 12, x FOR PEER\

    WSNs in the agricultural ﬁeld can contribute to farm precision and to various\

    \ forecast affects the success of a farmer’s decisions, and forecasts can help\n\
    us to make conﬁdent choices every day. These choices include crop irrigation,\
    \ implantation\ntime, and days appropriate for ﬁeldwork, and farmers’ decisions\
    \ can lead to viable crops\nor failures. In agriculture, the climate is the most\
    \ inﬂuential factor, and no crop model\ncan be created without considering the\
    \ atmosphere. Various weather forecasts evaluate\nagriculture and predict yield,\
    \ disaster management, and various other ﬁelds. In weather\nforecasting, different\
    \ machine learning algorithms, including support vector machines\nand soft computing\
    \ methods, have been used for all the above reasons. Table 2 shows the\nweather\

    \ Production Density (%)\nThe effects of climate change on crop production have\
    \ been proposed, and an enforced\nfacts system for agriculture is essential for\
    \ sustainable development. The production\ndensity determines the accessible amount\
    \ of product used to encourage increased food\nsafety and crop production and\
    \ creates a wealth of alternative crop options. There are\nmultiple advantages\
    \ of the nutritious food advice from big data for the end-users of the\nmethod,\
    \ and various analyses are precious for nutritionally based vegetable production\n\
    and delivery systems that are completely dependent on economic management. Plant\
    \ input\nand crop values have made it necessary for farmers to use the information\
    \ and to make\ndifﬁcult choices regarding agriculture for the existing crop, soil,\
    \ and environmental data.\nThe analysis of the new production data shows optimized\
    \ production and farming that is\nmore vulnerable to climate change. Table 3 shows\

    \ yield predictions using a deep learning\nalgorithm to achieve the following\
    \ parameters: a precision ratio, high accuracy, a better\nperformance ratio, an\
    \ improved data transmission rate, a reduced power consumption\nratio, an enhanced\

    \ (SDSS), and\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) and artiﬁcial neural network\
    \ (ANN) methods.\n4. Conclusions and Future Work\nPredictive analyses can be utilized\
    \ for making smart agricultural decisions by gath-\nering data on temperature,\
    \ soil and air quality, crop growth, equipment, labor costs, and\navailability\
    \ in real-time. This is called precision agriculture. Big data can play an essential\n\
    role in managing the real-time data collection of massive streaming data in precision\
    \ agri-\nculture. With the growing demands for the scale of big data, data analysis\
    \ reliability and\nperformance are challenges. Farmers must move away from traditional\
    \ agricultural meth-\nods to precision agriculture to improve farm productivity\
    \ and to maintain healthier food\nsupplies. Precision agriculture operates in\
    \ collaboration with information technologies to\nimprove agricultural techniques.\
    \ This paper proposed BDA-AMS to ensure high-precision\npredictions for crop yield\
    \ to improve the economic management of China by utilizing a deep\nlearning algorithm.\
    \ The neural network gathers raw images from UAVs and predicts crop\nyield at\
    \ an early point. Thus, the experimental results show that the proposed BDA-AMS\n\
    is able to predict crop yield, reduce labor, and improve agriculture monitoring\
    \ systems.\nThe convolutional neural network gathers the raw images from the UAVs\
    \ and performs\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 2905\n18 of 19\nearly predictions of crop yield\
    \ to achieve the following parameters: a high parameter preci-\nsion ratio (98.8%),\
    \ high accuracy (98.9%), a better performance ratio (95.5%), an improved\ndata\
    \ transmission rate (97.8%), a reduced power consumption ratio (18.8%), and an\
    \ en-\nhanced weather forecasting ratio (94.8%), production density ratio (98.8%),\
    \ mean absolute\npercentage ratio (96.2%), and reliability ratio (98.6%), when\
    \ compared to other methods.\nAuthor Contributions: C.S. and W.M. designed and\

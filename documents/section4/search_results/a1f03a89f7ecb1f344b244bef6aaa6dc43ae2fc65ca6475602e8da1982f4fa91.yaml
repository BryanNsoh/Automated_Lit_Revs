    in agro-industry and environment during 2006–2016. • Clustering of IoT applications
    into four domains: monitoring, control, prediction, and logistics. • Visualization
    of key technologies used to develop the IoT applications. • Discussion of trends
    and open challenges. • Proposal of an IoT architecture for agro-industrial and
    environmental applications based on the research findings. Abstract This paper
    reviews agro-industrial and environmental applications that are using Internet
    of Things (IoT). It is motivated by the need to identify application areas, trends,
    architectures and open challenges in these two fields. The underlying survey was
    developed following a systematic literature review using academic documents written
    in English and published in peer-reviewed venues from 2006 to 2016. Selected references
    were clustered into four application domains corresponding to: monitoring, control,
    logistics, and prediction. Implementation-specific details from each selected
    reference were compiled to create usage distributions of sensors, actuators, power
    sources, edge computing modules, communication technologies, storage solutions,
    and visualization strategies. Finally, the results from the review were compiled
    into an IoT architecture that represents a wide range of current solutions in
    agro-industrial and environmental fields. Previous article in issue Next article

    literature review 1. Introduction The widespread of Internet in the last two decades
    brought countless benefits to citizens and organizations around the world. Arguably
    the most important benefit was the ability to consume and produce data and services
    in real time. Recently, the Internet of Things is promising to bring the same
    benefits to everyday objects, giving us a way to extend our perception and our
    ability to modify the environment around us. In this context, agro-industrial
    and environmental fields are ideal candidates for the deployment of IoT solutions
    because they occur in wide areas that need to be continuously monitored and controlled.
    At the same time, IoT opens new opportunities beyond ground floor automation when
    the collected data are used to feed machine learning algorithms to provide predictions
    (Saville et al., 2015), easing decision planning and decision making for owners,
    managers, and policy makers. IoT can be used at different levels in the agro-industrial
    production chain (Medela et al., 2013). It can help to evaluate field variables
    such as soil state, atmospheric conditions, and biomass of plants or animals.
    It can also be used to assess and control variables such as temperature, humidity,
    vibration, and shock during the product transport (Pang et al., 2015). It can
    be used to monitor and predict the product state and its demand on shelves or
    inside refrigerators. In addition, it can provide information to the final user/consumer
    about the origin and properties of the product. The IoT applied to the agro-industry
    can contribute to create an informed, connected, developed and adaptable rural
    community. Under the IoT paradigm, low-cost electronic devices can improve human
    interaction with the physical world, and the computing power and software available
    on the Internet can provide valuable analytics. In summary, IoT can be an important
    tool in the years to come for people interacting within an agro-industrial system:
    suppliers, farmers, technicians, distributors, business men, consumers, and government
    representatives. IoT can be incorporated into environmental applications to produce
    dense and real-time maps of air and water pollution, noise level (Torres-Ruiz
    et al., 2016, Hachem et al., 2015), temperature, and harmful radiation among others.
    It can be used to collect and store environmental records, check the compliance
    of environmental variables with local policies, trigger alerts, or send recommendation
    messages to citizens and authorities (Liu et al., 2013). Once the data reach the
    cloud, governments can feed predictive models to forecast environmental variables,
    and identify and track pollution sources over time and space, ultimately leading
    to faster and better decisions to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all
    citizens. Based on the potential of IoT applications in agro-industrial and environmental
    fields described in the previous paragraphs, this paper aims to identify the current
    state of solutions in these fields, as well as the trends, architectures, technologies
    and open challenges. This paper uses a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) based
    on a methodology proposed by Kitchenham and Charters (2007), in order to make
    it unbiased in terms of information selection, processing, and presentation of
    results. The paper is structured as follows. Sections 2 Planning, 3 Conduction,
    4 Results describe the stages of planning, conduction, and results of the SLR.
    Section 5 outlines some recent works that were published online after the SLR
    was concluded. Section 6 includes a discussion of the obtained results, and Section
    7 presents the conclusions from this study. 2. Planning During this stage of the
    SLR, the protocol was defined. This included: research questions, search strategies,
    selection criteria, data mining and synthesis methodologies. For this study, the
    two research questions considered were: 1. What are the main technological solutions
    of the Internet of Things in agro-industrial and environmental fields? 2. Which
    infrastructure and technology are using the main solutions of IoT in agro-industrial
    and environmental fields? To collect information, authors performed an Internet
    search using various academic digital libraries and search engines. Obtained results
    were manually compiled in order to select the best information sources to answer
    the two research questions. After analyzing the results, digital libraries and
    search engines described in Table 1 were chosen based on their scientific and
    technical content, as well as their close relationship to areas of knowledge associated
    with the objective of this paper. Table 1. Information sources used for the search

    Search Engine https://scholar.google.com/ The next step was to define search terms
    and a consistent procedure to seek scientific and technical documentation in the
    digital libraries and search engines. To define the search terms, a set of keywords
    was selected from the research questions to create two groups of words which are
    shown in Table 2. Each group contained consolidated expressions with synonyms
    or terms with related meaning. Group 1 included words associated with the Internet
    of Things, while Group 2 contained a set of terms related to the agro-industry
    and environment. Logical operators supported by the advanced search of digital
    libraries were used to construct search strings, based on the two research questions,
    combining terms from Groups 1 and 2 of Table 2. The general structure of the search
    queries that were applied to the information sources is presented in Table 3.

    order to ensure the quality of papers, only those that passed the following criteria
    were considered in the reviewing process. • Documents published in peer-reviewed
    conferences, peer-reviewed journals, papers from computer science or engineering
    organizations, patents, or technical reports. • Documents published in English.
    • Documents published between 2006 and 2016 (both years inclusive). If the main
    topic of a given paper was irrelevant or if it was outside the scope of this study,
    it was deleted. Then, a selection criterion was applied in order to reduce the
    number of papers found during the search and to get a small number of high-quality
    sources that could be used to answer the research questions. This involved using
    inclusion criteria (IC) and quality criteria (QC), which were defined in a three-phase
    process. • IC based on abstracts: in this phase, authors discarded papers found
    in the search stage based on the information provided in their abstracts. Papers
    that satisfied the first inclusion criterion were kept for further processing,
    i.e. papers that discussed IoT solutions applied to agro-industry and environment.
    Papers with little relevant information in their abstract were temporarily kept
    in the list and were processed in the next stage. It is important to highlight
    that quality criteria were not considered in this phase. • IC based on full reading:
    in this phase, papers that did not address the search terms shown in Table 2 were
    removed. This means that even though those papers contained the search terms in
    their abstract, they only represented minor aspects of them. • IC based on quality
    analysis: in this phase, a quality analysis was applied to remaining papers and
    those that did not comply any of the following four quality criteria (QC) were
    discarded: – QC1: Does the study present a comprehensive solution of IoT for agro-industry
    or environment? – QC2: Does the paper show details of the infrastructure and/or
    technologies used to implement the proposed solution? – QC3: Does the paper present
    a state of the art or related work? – QC4: Does the paper present an analysis
    of the results? The next stage of the SLR was data mining and synthesis. The goal
    here was to extract the information needed to answer the research questions in
    an objective manner. The information fields extracted for each study are presented
    in Table 4. Table 4. Form used to extract data for each study. Data retrieved

    in the previous section was used to search, select and evaluate preliminary papers.
    For the search process, the query defined in Table 3 was passed to information
    sources given in Table 1. The search was limited to title, abstract and keywords.
    Fig. 1 illustrates the conduction process discriminated by the academic database
    and search engine used, highlighting the key steps followed to select relevant
    studies for this review. Initially, 3578 studies were recovered from electronic
    databases. Firstly, duplicates were excluded, i.e. studies available in more than
    one database, eliminating 849 copies. Out of the 2729 remaining studies, 2652
    were initially screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria applied to the
    title, abstract, and keywords. These papers were marked to be downloaded, and
    references that could not be retrieved were discarded. Afterward, these studies
    were evaluated using quality criteria obtaining 720 studies. These studies were
    used to extract the data defined in Table 4. Finally, only 72 main studies were
    selected based on their quality for the final conduction phase and used to extract
    results presented in the next section. Download : Download high-res image (236KB)

    main studies. It is worth to note that more than 90% of included papers were retrieved
    from two sources: IEEExplore (76.4%) and Scopus (13.9%). In contrast, the least
    effective sources of information were Microsoft Academic Search and Microsoft
    Academic. They retrieved 668 papers during the first stage of the conduction phase
    (representing 25.2% of all retrieved papers, and only behind IEEExplore with 45%).
    However, only 3.1% of them were included for the next reviewing phase, a number
    well below the 39.8% of papers included from IEEExplore. These facts can be explained
    because IEEExplore and Scopus have complete and usable advanced search systems
    and they have been operating continuously unlike Microsoft’s counterpart (Sinha
    et al., 2015a). Fig. 2 enumerates the number of primary studies classified by
    publication year. It can be seen that most of the selected papers were published
    between 2012 and 2016. It should be highlighted that the small number of papers
    shown in 2016 can be explained because the initial search was made in April of
    that year. Download : Download high-res image (127KB) Download : Download full-size

    results of the SLR in order to answer the two research questions based on the
    information extracted from main studies selected. 4.1. Answer to the first research
    question To identify the main technological solutions of IoT in agro-industry
    and environmental fields, studies were grouped into four technological domains,
    corresponding to: (1) monitoring, (2) control, (3) prediction and (4) logistics.
    Results are summarized in Table 5 and illustrated in Fig. 4. From this figure,
    it can be seen that most of the selected studies were focused on monitoring (62%),
    followed by control (25%), logistics (7%), and prediction (6%). Table 5. Clustering

    image Fig. 4. Distribution of papers selected by application domain. Selected
    papers grouped in the monitoring domain dealt with remote sensing of physical
    and environmental parameters gathered in scenarios such as crops and farms using
    a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The main goal of this domain was the acquisition
    of information without an operator and its transmission to a server or data center
    for processing and visualization. Integrated monitoring tools made it possible
    to maintain a continuous communication with the deployed WSN, and access stored
    data through the Internet. Hence, smart agriculture based on IoT adds value to
    farmers by helping them to collect relevant data from crops and farms using sensor
    devices. Some IoT setups could display, process and analyze remote data applying
    cloud services in order to provide new insights and recommendations for better
    decision-making. IoT solutions categorized in monitoring domain can be divided
    into three architectural layers (Zou, 2014): (i) a perception layer supported
    by a WSN; (ii) a network layer where the sensor information travels a long distance
    using different protocols and Gateways, and (iii) an application layer that includes
    a web server and a database. Moreover, IoT solutions grouped in this domain are
    interested in monitoring several types of physical variables depending on the
    subdomain to which they belong. Specifically, the following subdomains were identified:
    air monitoring (34.5%), soil monitoring (27.3%), water monitoring (16.4%), plant
    monitoring (10.9%), and others (10.9%) which include areas such as aquaculture
    and animal monitoring. It is worth to highlight that most of the selected studies
    retrieved in this SLR can be categorized in more than one subdomain. For instance,
    the system proposed in Zou (2014) is used for online crop growth monitoring and
    it captures different types of variables such as: temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, CO2, luminosity, pH of water, and images. Some representative examples
    of IoT applications categorized in the monitoring domain are described below.
    • Air monitoring: this subdomain aimed to provide periodic or continuous measurements,
    evaluating and determining environmental parameters or pollution levels in order
    to prevent negative and damaging effects. It also included the forecasting of
    possible changes in the ecosystem or the biosphere as a whole. For instance, in
    Watthanawisuth et al. (2009) authors described an agricultural IoT solution which
    can be categorized in the air monitoring subdomain. In this solution, authors
    proposed a real-time monitoring system of micro climate based on a WSN. The solution
    included temperature and relative humidity sensors (SHT15) powered by solar panels
    and supported by ZigBee communication technology. Another air monitoring IoT solution
    is GEMS (Lu et al., 2010), which proposed an environmental monitoring system based
    on GPRS technology for monitoring apple orchards. This system was tested on five
    different regions of China over a 2-year period by monitoring variables such as
    relative humidity, temperature, and radiation. • Soil monitoring: papers classified
    in this subdomain such as (Chen et al., 2014, Mafuta et al., 2012) proposed systems
    for monitoring multi-layer soil temperature and moisture in a farmland fields
    using WSN. These systems are supported by communication technologies such as ZigBee,
    GPRS and Internet, where user interaction with the system is handled by a web
    application. • Water monitoring: primary studies categorized in this subdomain
    intend to monitor water pollution or water quality by sensing chemicals, pH, and
    temperature, which can alter the natural state of water. An example of this subdomain
    is presented in Postolache et al. (2013), where authors proposed an IoT solution
    for water quality assessment through the measurement of conductivity, temperature,
    and turbidity. The solution is based on a WSN architecture that combines low-cost
    sensing devices and monitoring of multiple parameters of water quality of shallow
    waters (lakes, estuaries, rivers) in urban areas. Similarly, (Xijun et al., 2009)
    proposed a WSN system for monitoring water level and rainfall in irrigation systems.
    • Plant monitoring: The LOFAR-agro Project (Langendoen et al., 2006) is an example
    of plant or crop monitoring. This project aimed to protect a potato crop against
    phytophthora (a genus of water mold) by monitoring the microclimate (humidity
    and temperature) using a large-scale WSN. The system intended to generate a policy
    to protect the crop against the fungal disease based on the collected data. In
    Fourati et al. (2014), authors propose a Web-based decision support system communicating
    with a WSN for irrigation scheduling in olive fields. For this purpose, authors
    use sensors to measure humidity, solar radiation, temperature, and rain. • Animal
    monitoring: This subdomain referred to animal tracking for both wildlife and animal
    husbandry activities. A research belonging to this subdomain was a delay-tolerant
    WSN for the monitoring and tracking of six horses presented in Ehsan et al. (2012).
    For this purpose, authors developed necklaces that acquired information about
    horses’ position and speed at a given time, and transmitted such logs to fixed
    nodes when they were close to its coverage area. Another example of animal monitoring
    was given by Jain et al. (2008), where an IoT solution was responsible for monitoring
    the behavior and migration patterns of Swamp Deers, obtaining information of the
    animal position and the climate at the same time. Papers selected and grouped
    under the domain of control use remote actuator devices deployed on-site. Unlike
    monitoring domain applications, which handle information in one-way, applications
    categorized in control use a two-way information channel. This means that a new
    level of communication was added, and commands could be sent back to the field.
    In this case, information from the server or data center traveled to a Wireless
    Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN) in order to control a set of actuator devices
    to modify the state of the process or environment. Commands were sent through
    a human–computer interface or as a result of a decision algorithm supported by
    analytic modules. Actuator devices included valves, pumps, humidifiers, and alarms
    among others. Many of these systems aimed to optimize the usage of water, fertilizers,
    and pesticides based on information provided by weather prediction systems and
    on-site WSN. Solutions in this domain could help farmers to reduce water consumption
    and waste by scheduling irrigation times and quantities according to the state
    of the crop and its growth cycle. Control systems were programmed to be adaptive,
    for instance, switching off sprinkler if rain was detected. Overall, solutions
    with control systems could save money to the farmer and provide at the same time
    valuable insights about the consumption of water, fertilizers, pesticides, and
    electricity. Actuator devices used by IoT solutions grouped in the control domain
    depended heavily on the subdomain to which they belonged. In this paper, the following
    subdomains were considered: irrigation (72.22%), fertilizers (5.56%), pesticides
    (5.56%), illumination (5.56%), and access control (5.56%). During the review,
    it was found that some studies used actuators in the domain of logistics (5.56%).
    Representative examples of IoT applications categorized in the control domain
    are described next. • Irrigation control: A precision irrigation solution based
    on wireless sensor network was proposed by Kanoun et al. (2014). The main challenge
    of that study was to create an automated irrigation system which could reduce
    water waste, saving energy, time, and money. This system was built using three
    nodes based on the TelosB mote: (i) a node to measure soil moisture and soil temperature;
    (ii) a node to measure environmental parameters such as air temperature, air humidity,
    wind speed and brightness; and (iii) a node that was connected to a valve for
    irrigation control. Data were transmitted to a base station for storage and were
    sent to the farmer’s PC to allow him to take action. Another precision irrigation
    IoT system was proposed by Jiao et al. (2014). This included an environmental
    monitoring system for agricultural management, as well as the implementation of
    precision dripping. The system considered an IoT ecosystem divided into three
    layers corresponding to sensing, transmission, and application. A WSN was used
    to perceive environmental information in real time within a tomato greenhouse,
    to later transmit the data to a remote server management system. In Shuwen and
    Changli (2015) researchers described a remote farmland irrigation monitoring solution
    based on ZigBee. The system included a solar-powered irrigation control system
    that also monitored air temperature, humidity and soil temperature. • Fertilizer
    and pesticide control: IoT solutions categorized in this subdomain applied conservation
    practices to improve nutrient usage, efficiency, crop quality, overall yield,
    and economic return while reducing off-site transport of nutrients. In Pahuja
    et al. (2013), authors developed an online micro-climate monitoring and control
    system for greenhouses. The system was supported by a WSN to gather and analyze
    plant-related sensor data to produce actions to control the climate, fertilization,
    irrigation, and pests. • Illumination control: authors in Yoo et al. (2007) described
    an automated agriculture system based on WSN for monitoring greenhouses used to
    grow melons and cabbages. The system monitored the growing process of crops and
    controlled the greenhouse’s environment. Some of the variables measured included
    ambient light, temperature, and humidity. For the greenhouse with melons, the
    system could control the illumination by changing the light state through a relay.
    • Access control: An agricultural intrusion detection system was presented in
    Roy et al. (2015). The proposed system generated alarms in the farmers house and
    sent a text message to the farmer’s mobile phone when an intruder entered the
    crop field. Selected papers categorized in the prediction domain were focused
    on providing knowledge and tools to farmers to support decision making. They had
    specific modules for these tasks in their architecture, and their predicted variables
    were grouped as follows: environmental conditions (42.86%), production estimation
    (42.86%), and crop growth (14.29%). • Environmental conditions: A representative
    example of environmental condition prediction is proposed in Khandani and Kalantari
    (2009), where authors described a design methodology to determine the spatial
    sampling of humidity sensors for the soil within a WSN. They used a historical
    database of dense soil-humidity measurements to determine the behavior of the
    2D correlation that exists between the measurements of nearby sensors. This was
    used later to find the largest spatial sampling that ensured a user-defined variance
    for the estimation on any given point of interest in the space. Authors found
    that the spatial correlation function decays exponentially with the distance between
    sensors. Another example of the prediction of environmental conditions was presented
    in Luan et al. (2015), which described a system that integrates drought monitoring
    and forecasting as well as irrigation prediction using IoT. • Production estimation:
    Authors in Lee et al. (2013) presented an IoT-based agricultural production system
    for stabilizing supply and demand of agricultural products. They achieved this
    goal by sensing environmental variables and by developing a prediction system
    for the growth and yield of crops. In a different application, (Saville et al.,
    2015) introduced a real-time estimation system for fixed-net fishery using ultrasonic
    sensors and supervised learning. • Crop growth: a dynamic analysis of farmlands
    using mobile sensors was presented in Lee et al. (2012). The developed system
    aimed to establish growth-control plans for grapes, and viticulture activities.
    The last domain used to categorize selected studies was logistics. Logistics in
    agriculture refers to the physical flow of entities and related information from
    producer to consumer to satisfy consumer demand. It includes: agricultural production,
    acquisition, transportation, storage, loading and unloading, handling, packaging,
    distribution, and related activities. Some objectives of logistics in agriculture
    include: adding value to agricultural products, saving money in distribution costs,
    improving shipping efficiency, reducing unnecessary losses, and to some extent,
    avoiding risks (Liping, 2012). Primary studies in logistics were further divided
    in: production (55.6%), commerce (22.2%) and transport(22.2%). The next paragraphs
    include representative studies of each subdomain. • Production: in Feng et al.
    (2012) researchers proposed an intelligent system for monitoring an apple orchard
    that implemented suggestions based on data. The system aimed to reduce management
    costs of apple orchards, improve apple quality, and provide detailed, comprehensive
    and accurate electronic information for planting works, pest warnings, and production-quality
    tracking of apples. The system included WSN using Zigbee, GPRS, and IoT providing
    detailed monitoring data of apple growth for agricultural cooperatives, to support
    for decision making in farming. • Commerce: (Li et al., 2013) presented an information
    system for agriculture based on IoT which used a distributed architecture. In
    that study, tracking and tracing of the whole agricultural production process
    were made with distributed IoT servers. Moreover, an information-discovery system
    was designed to implement, capture, standardize, manage, locate, and query business
    data from agricultural production. The system also allowed consumers to query
    information of agricultural products to verify their authenticity and quality.
    • Transport: A representative example of this subdomain is presented in Pang et
    al. (2015), where an IoT architecture was proposed for the food-production and
    commercialization chain. This paper dealt with logistics involved in the transportation
    of melons from Brazil to Sweden in a journey that takes 46 days. Sensor nodes
    measured conditions in the environment including oxygen, carbon dioxide, ethylene,
    temperature, humidity, and mechanical stress, such as vibrations, tilts, and shocks.

    selected by application subdomain. 4.2. Answer to the second research question
    Infrastructure and technology used by selected IoT solutions in agro-industrial
    and environmental fields were organized in seven groups, corresponding to: (i)
    sensing variables, (ii) actuator devices, (iii) power sources, (iv) communication
    technologies, (v) edge computing technologies (Shi et al., 2016), (vi) storage
    strategies, and (vii) visualization strategies. • Sensing variables: about 26%
    of analyzed studies sense temperature, followed by humidity, physicochemical properties,
    and radiation with 16%, 11%, and 10%, respectively. Particularly, temperature
    and physicochemical sensors are distributed in all subdomains as it can be seen
    in Fig. 6. Similarly, 55% of sensors are used for air monitoring. Thus, air temperature
    and humidity, soil moisture and solar radiation, can be considered universal variables
    in agricultural applications. Download : Download high-res image (324KB) Download

    studies is shown in Fig. 7. It can be stated that there are far fewer actuator
    devices than sensors currently being used in these studies and that most of them
    are concentrated in applications of control and logistics. In fact, more than
    60% of actuators reported were found in irrigation processes. Download : Download

    device used. • Power sources: currently, most monitoring applications prefer rechargeable
    batteries connected to solar panels, which offer a simple but sustainable energy
    supply. In contrast, control applications that typically have demanding energy
    requirements prefer the electrical grid. These trends can be appreciated in Fig.
    8. Recent power sources, such as electromagnetic or vibration harvesters were
    not found in selected studies showing that these approaches must mature and gain
    popularity for agricultural and environmental applications. Download : Download

    • Communication technologies: Fig. 9 shows that most studies (40%) used Wireless
    Personal Area Network (WPAN) protocols such as Bluetooth and ZigBee, followed
    by Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN) with 36% of the studies mainly supported
    by cellular technologies (GPRS/GSM/3G/4G). Meanwhile, the near-field communication,
    which is relatively new, has started to emerge in some field applications. Download

    technologies. • Edge computing technologies: microcontroller platforms were chosen
    in more than half of the applications reviewed. Interestingly, Single Board Computers
    (SBC) are not yet appropriate for edge computing in IoT agricultural applications.
    The complete distribution of edge computing technologies is shown in Fig. 10.

    it is clear that even though Cloud storage represents a key service for IoT systems,
    only 7.32% of selected studies used it. This shows that most researchers preferred
    their own data-storage implementation. Download : Download high-res image (78KB)

    strategies: Fig. 12 shows the distribution of three different visualization strategies:
    web, mobile and local, in four subdomains: monitoring, control, prediction, and
    logistics. It can be stated that web-based solutions were the preferred strategy
    to visualize reports in all subdomains of applications. Download : Download high-res

    Most of the selected works do not address security issues explicitly and leave
    them on a side. However, some efforts in this domain were found. For instance,
    (Jardak et al., 2009) described the design of a WSN that implemented a RANdom
    SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) filter to eliminate inconsistent sensor-node data due
    to the presence of faulty or malicious nodes in the network. Sun et al. (2012)
    presented a dam monitoring system where users needed to sign in through the main
    interface in order to validate their credentials. Tao et al. (2014) selected AppWeb
    as the embedded Web server for the IoT Gateway of an intelligent granary management
    system because it could add the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to enable
    encrypted data connection. This was valuable because the network information was
    vulnerable as it came from a wireless channel. Kuroda et al. (2015) proposed a
    WSN with easy-to-use secure communication that was implemented using Zero-admin
    encrypt/decrypt functions at the MAC level with the Advanced Encryption Standard
    (AES-128), which enabled automatic encryption/decryption of messages between each
    sensor node and the coordinator node. 5. Recent works The following paragraphs
    are devoted to introducing some recent and representative works that were available
    online between May 2016 and July 2017, beyond the initial scope of the SLR process
    described so far. They cover areas such as communications, energy management,
    monitoring and logistics for agro-industrial and environmental applications. 5.1.
    Communications Low-power WAN (LPWAN) technologies such as SigFox, LoRa, narrowband
    IoT and others are becoming popular within IoT applications due to its reduced
    energy requirements, wide coverage range, and low-cost when compared to other
    long-distance technologies according to Barrachina-Muñoz et al. (2017). For example,
    in a recent survey by Sinha et al. (2017), authors found that LoRa is the best
    option for smart agriculture applications. In Lukas et al. (2015), authors designed
    a long-range water level monitoring system for troughs using a WSN based on LoRa
    transceivers, allowing the cattleman to observe water availability for livestock
    even when the barn was 1 or 3 km away. In a different application, (Pham et al.,
    2016) proposed an IoT framework to contribute to rural development implementing
    agricultural applications supported by open-source hardware and long-range communication
    devices. The first deployment of this solution used LoRa transceivers since rural
    villages were located in remote areas and it was convenient to have a low-cost
    and non-proprietary infrastructure. 5.2. Energy management One of the main requirements
    for devices used in IoT projects is that they must be energy-efficient according
    to Borgia (2014). This is particularly important for pervasive solutions deployed
    outdoors that can not be powered from the electric grid nor regularly maintained
    because they are installed in difficult or remote environments. In WSN scenarios,
    the current challenge is to develop multi-source energy harvesters and ultra-efficient
    sensors to create battery-free solutions, (Shaikh and Zeadally, 2016). These considerations
    are very important for IoT solutions for agro-industrial and environmental problems
    as recharging batteries is not practical and ambient energy sources are usually
    available. In terms of smart energy control for IoT projects, (Wang et al., 2016)
    proposed a novel energy management strategy for solar powered devices that intend
    to power the load directly from the solar cell, avoiding power converters and
    energy storage elements that contribute to energy losses, greater weight/volume
    ratio, and higher price. Another trend that is likely to continue is the development
    of self-power devices, such as the soil water content sensor for an autonomous
    landslide surveillance system designed by Lu et al. (2016). In this case, the
    sensor used the soil moisture to power itself making it suitable for large scale
    deployments. Marjanović et al. (2016) described a cloud-based decision-making
    mechanism for managing sensor data acquisition that is applicable to collaborative
    sensing solutions using distributed sensors, like mobile devices, to efficiently
    monitor large geographical areas. The system selected which sensors had to upload
    the information to the cloud to prevent the acquisition of redundant information
    from other nearby sensors for a specific coverage area, maintaining a spatial
    sampling quality and reducing in this way the battery depletion of the devices.
    5.3. Monitoring Recent environmental monitoring solutions are now offering additional
    capabilities in terms of decision making and management. For example, (Giorgetti
    et al., 2016) proposed a custom-made landslide risk monitoring system based on
    a WSN that allows fast deployments in hostile environments without human intervention
    because the system is able to deal with node failure and poor-quality communication
    links reorganizing the network by itself. Wong and Kerkez (2016) presented a Web
    service and real-time data architecture that includes an adaptive controller that
    updates the parameters of each sensing node within a WSN based on a previously
    defined policy. Zheng et al. (2016) proposed an IoT management system to protect
    the ecological and environmental quality while building an artificial river where
    nature and city converge. The system monitored key elements like soil, water,
    atmosphere, and wind at a high spatial resolution over a large area. Edwards-Murphy
    et al. (2016) introduced a beehive monitoring system that collects internal and
    external data to describe the status of the bee colony from a set of possible
    states using a classification algorithm based on decision trees. This information
    was used to determine if a visit to the beehive was required or not. As an additional
    result, authors found a strong correlation between the beehive status and the
    short-term rain forecast. Overall, this study is relevant for agriculture because
    crop pollination depends on honey bees. Sarangi et al. (2016) presented a framework
    for an automated crop-disease advisory service that integrates the interoperability
    of an IoT web repository with an agricultural advisory call center. The implemented
    system processes images of the diseased plant sent by the farmer, and then it
    provides the plant diagnosis and the corresponding management recommendation for
    the disease. 5.4. Logistics Food safety and quality control in logistics are emerging
    as IoT agribusiness areas in response to the demand from businesses and end consumers
    to obtain real-time information about food supply chain and “farm-to-fork” traceability.
    For instance, (Ruan and Shi, 2016) presented an IoT framework to assess the fruit
    freshness on e-commerce deliveries, which is a non-traditional retail service
    that faces unique challenges in transportation due to the product perishability
    and expensive logistics. Similarly, (Liu et al., 2016) introduced a pilot project
    using IoT to monitor food safety throughout the product life cycle, helping authorities
    and consumers to trace the food and make better decisions before buying it. In
    a related work, (Wang and Yue, 2017) proposed an early-warning system for food
    safety that automatically warns about product quality risks and incidents by sharing
    and centralizing information among supply chains. Lastly, (Capello et al., 2016)
    developed a business-to-business monitoring service based on IoT that provides
    geo-located information (humidity and temperature) about food storage and transportation
    without a vendor lock-in infrastructure. 6. Discussion 6.1. Limitations and open
    challenges After analyzing the difficulties and limitations described in selected
    papers from the SLR, the following list summarizes a few insights that aim to
    contribute to the mass adoption of IoT solutions in agricultural and environmental
    fields. • Stronger standardization: it will help to improve compatibility among
    different vendors and to ensure stronger security measures across the entire IoT
    stack, starting from field devices all the way up to cloud providers and end-user
    interfaces (Pang et al., 2015). • Better power management: it will increase the
    endurance of IoT solutions because nowadays the main factor limiting the lifespan
    of IoT deployments is energy depletion (Jain et al., 2008, Chen et al., 2014,
    Islam et al., 2014, Diedrichs et al., 2014). The lifespan can be improved by lowering
    the power consumption of each electronic module, including energy harvesters,
    and using alternative power storage mechanisms as replacements of rechargeable
    batteries, which affect the expiration date of deployed devices. • Security: a
    major challenge in the realization of the IoT in agriculture is the security problem
    (Jiang and Zhang, 2013), and the few works that consider it only incorporate fragmented
    strategies to mitigate it. Therefore, it is evident that there is a need for agro-industrial
    and environmental IoT solutions that address end-to-end information security and
    physical integrity of field devices. • Design using modular hardware and software:
    it will enable a greater degree of reuse and customization for the end user (Pang
    et al., 2015). • Improve unit cost: even though the cost of embedded computing
    platforms have been decreasing sharply, the same is not true for high-quality
    sensors and actuators. In order to deploy IoT solutions with hundreds and possibly
    thousands of nodes, the overall hardware, Internet access and international data
    roaming costs have to be reduced even further (Pang et al., 2015). • Aim for a
    good compatibility with legacy infrastructure: similarly to what has happened
    in industrial automation, it is important to deliver IoT solutions that can be
    integrated with the customer’s existing infrastructure such as specialized equipment,
    field machines, and software. • Consider scalability early on: with an increasing
    number of devices in large deployments, data synchronization and data reliability
    become critical (Diedrichs et al., 2014). • Adopt good practices of software engineering:
    as the scale and endurance of deployed IoT solutions grow, the time and effort
    devoted to analyzing generated data, refining the code, and adding new features
    will explode unless the software is well designed and documented (Hussain et al.,
    2006, Jayaraman et al., 2015a). • Improve robustness for field deployments: commercial
    IoT solution should be able to handle strong changes in temperature, humidity,
    and illumination to deal with seasonal changes and worldwide climate variability.
    • User-centered design: the installation and management of corresponding IoT nodes
    should be straight forward for non-expert users. Additionally, the hardware must
    require very little or none human maintenance during its lifespan, and the underlying
    communication network should be intelligent enough to reconfigure or heal itself
    in the case of a node failure. • Contribute to the IoT the ecosystem: there is
    a noticeable void in the literature on how to improve and adapt IoT solutions
    for real-world applications beyond simple prototypes (Chen et al., 2015). • Sustainable
    practices: even if the most humble predictions about the worldwide adoption of
    IoT devices become a reality, recycling strategies will have to be taken into
    account for new solutions deployed on the field, as an integral part of the product
    life cycle to reduce the environmental impact. 6.2. Proposed architecture To summarize
    the findings of this study, authors proposed the IoT architecture for agro-industrial
    and environmental applications that is illustrated in Fig. 13. This encapsulates
    most of the studies analyzed in this paper. The architecture has four main layers:
    physical, communication, service, and application. The physical layer includes
    perception and control. In perception, the main objective is to produce valuable
    data sensing field variables using a WSN. Data produced are sent to the communication
    layer through field gateways. Devices in the perception layer can be powered by
    batteries for short-term deployments or by solar panels because of their low-power
    consumption. In contrast, the control layer acts as a data sink, receiving information
    from a communication layer or a perception layer in the simplest case. Information
    received in the control layer alters the state of field actuators frequently requiring
    power from the electrical grid. In the middle of the perception and control layers
    there is a mobile robot that can be used when fixed devices are not the best option.
    In the communication layer, the objective is to move the information from the
    physical layer to the Internet, collecting data from IoT gateways based either
    on Ethernet or mobile networks (e.g: GPRS/3G/4G/NB-IoT and eventually 5G). This
    layer includes field gateways acting as interfaces between IoT gateways and transceivers
    using ZigBee, Bluetooth, NFC, WiFi, LoRA, or Sigfox. The service layer handles
    data ingestion from the communication layer, as well as their storage, analytics,
    visualization, and security. Finally, the application layer consumes services
    from the previous layer in the architecture and allows the user to handle monitoring,
    control, prediction, and logistics. Download : Download high-res image (717KB)

    review of IoT applications for agro-industrial and environmental fields. It was
    guided by a systematic literature review, and therefore the methodology and intermediate
    results obtained during the stages of planning, conduction, and results were reported
    in great detail. From 3578 initial studies extracted from electronic sources,
    72 main studies were selected based on their relevance to answer two research
    questions. Selected studies came from five continents, and Asian countries contributed
    to more than half of them. During this study, it was discovered that most of the
    research still focuses on monitoring applications (62%); however there is a growing
    interest in closing the loop by doing control (25%), and there are some preliminary
    solutions in logistics and prediction (13%) for agro-industrial and environmental
    applications using IoT. The temperature and humidity of the air, as well as the
    soil moisture and solar radiation can be recognized as universal variables measured
    in agricultural applications based on selected studies. Similarly, actuators such
    as valves, pumps, motors, sprinklers, humidifiers, and lamps were widely used
    in irrigation, fertilization, pesticide management, and illumination control.
    It was also observed that new energy sources and Cloud storage have not been widely
    adopted, showing that there are opportunities for research and development in
    these areas. Studies included in this paper provide a compact view of solutions
    proposed for agro-industrial and environmental problems during the last decade.
    It was found that most of them relied heavily on heterogeneous components and
    wireless sensor networks. However, it seems reasonable to assume that future solutions
    will need to fully embrace Cloud services and new ways of connectivity in order
    to get the benefits of a truly connected and smart IoT ecosystem. Acknowledgements

    Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: The Algerian economy is
    currently experiencing a significant deterioration because of its dependence on
    oil revenues, which drops in prices recently. Therefore, it is necessary to revive
    the Algerian economy with other important sectors, mainly agricultural sector
    especially in the south of Algeria. The southern Algeria Contain all necessary
    conditions for agriculture, which are the large agricultural areas, water resources
    and good illumination (sunlight).The mismanagement of irrigation water affects
    negatively the agricultural production of Algeria because of the shortage of irrigation
    water. Thus, with the benefit of the Internet of Things and the smart technologies,
    we will propose in this paper a new strategy for smart irrigation in southern
    Algeria regions, to optimize the water consumption, and to provide a remote control
    and monitoring for the irrigation system. Tests were realized to prove the validity
    of our proposed system by using Contiki-Cooja simulator. Published in: 2015 Fourth

    IEEE Conference Location: Luton, UK SECTION I. Introduction Recently, the Algerian
    economy starts to decline due to the drop in oil prices. The decline in oil prices
    shows the dependence and vulnerability of a system built on the only resource
    of the hydrocarbon sector. In this case, it is urgent to develop other sectors
    of the economy to reduce the dependence on hydrocarbons. Agriculture is a strategic
    and important sector for economic development, especially in southern Algeria.
    This Saharan and semi-arid region has all conditions required for agriculture;
    there are wide agricultural surfaces, sun light and large water resources. Agricultural
    production, including livestock production, consumes more fresh water than any
    other activity in the world. Agricultural irrigation accounts for 85% of the consumed
    fresh water over the planet, and this percentage will continue to be dominant
    in water consumption due to population growth and the increasing of demand for
    food [1]. In general, poor irrigation management affects agricultural production,
    for this purpose it is necessary to develop strategies to optimize irrigation.
    An automated irrigation system is designed to monitor and control the various
    factors derived from an agricultural field such as humidity, water level, temperature,
    and human interaction. This system is generally composed of controllers and a
    wireless sensor network using ZigBee as the transmission technology for detecting
    values of an agricultural field. The sensors gather the various agricultural factors
    in real time and transmit them using Internet of Thing (IoT) applications [2].
    The control architecture of smart agriculture based on cloud computing and IOT
    is presented in [3]. The integration of modern technology in irrigation management
    system is one of the ways to improve the irrigation processes to optimize the
    use of water, electricity consumption and labor costs. In this regard, with the
    new technology and the development of the Internet and the Internet of Things,
    we will propose in this paper a strategy for smart irrigation in southern Algeria
    regions based on the use of the Internet of Things and new communication technologies.
    In this paper, this new scheme proposed for intelligent irrigation using IoT is
    an extension of our already attendant solution [4]. This new mechanism allows
    the farmer to monitor and manage agricultural area using smart phones via Internet.
    The rest of paper is organized as follow: in section 2 we will present generality
    about basic notions of Internet of Things, the section 3 presents current state
    of information and communication technology (ICT) in Algeria, our proposed approach
    will be presented in section 4 and finally, a conclusion and proposed perspectives
    of this work will be presented in section 5. SECTION II. Generality A. Internet
    of Things (IoT) The term “Internet of Things” was first used by the Massachusetts
    Institute of Technology in the year 1999[5]. There are several definitions of
    the Internet of Things. Definitions focus on technical aspects of IoT when the
    other based on the applications and functionalities. Some definition defined IoT
    as “an extension of the current Internet to all objects that can communicate directly
    or indirectly with electronic equipment and connected to the Internet”[6]. Other
    defied as “a novel paradigm that is rapidly gaining ground in the scenario of
    modern wireless telecommunications. The basic idea of this concept is the pervasive
    presence around us of a variety of things or objects - such as Radio-Frequency
    IDentification (RFID) tags, sensors, actuators, mobile phones, etc. - which, through
    unique addressing schemes, are able to interact with each other and cooperate
    with their neighbors to reach common goals”[7]. B. The Application Domains of
    IoT According to the definition of IoT, this technology can be applied in all
    domains possible but in reality IoT applied in specific domains. We categorize
    this application into four application domains: 1) Daily Life A Smartphone become
    a necessity in our life, several application for Apple iOS, Google Android and
    Windows Phone operating can be used for interfacing sensors measuring various
    parameters, which implies that facilitate the use of the concept of IoT in our
    daily life [8]. The use of IOT in daily live appear in several application such
    as control of home equipment such as air conditioners, refrigerators, washing
    machines, etc [8]. Sensors and actuators distributed in houses and offices can
    make our life more comfortable in several aspects, and domestic incidents can
    be avoided with appropriate monitoring and alarm systems, etc. [7]. Other application
    necessary of IoT like for losses, IoT can be helped to find objects that we don''t
    remember where have been left. Or in thefts an application similar to the previous
    one may leave the user to know if some objects are moved from a restricted area
    which would indicate that the object is being stolen [7]. 2) Transportation and
    Mobility Transport domain is one of most important domains, and one of the most
    complicated domains. Urban traffic is the main contributor to traffic noise pollution
    and a major contributor to urban air quality degradation and greenhouse gas emissions.
    Traffic congestion directly imposes significant costs on economic and social activities
    in most cities [8]. Advanced cars, trains, buses as well as bicycles along with
    roads and/or rails are becoming more instrumented with sensors, actuators, and
    processing power. Roads themselves are also equipped with tags and sensors that
    send important information to traffic control sites to better route the traffic,
    provide the tourist with appropriate transportation information. In this domain
    exist several applications such us assisted driving offer collision avoidance
    systems and monitoring of transportation of hazardous materials, or mobile ticketing
    and augmented maps [7]. 3) Work Environment In this domain they are several uses
    of IoT such us Industrial plants, enterprise, logistics, etc. Sensors have always
    been a part of the factory setup for security, automation, climate control, etc.
    Which ultimately will be replaced by a wireless system giving the opportunity
    to make changes to the configuration whenever necessary? It is nothing but a subnet
    IoT dedicated to the maintenance of the plant [8]. In industrial plants, IoT also
    contribute to improving the automation of industrial plants with a massive deployment
    of RFID tags associated with production parts. An event is generated by the reader
    with all the necessary data, such as RFID number, and stored on the network. The
    machine / robot is notified by the event and picks up part of the production [7].
    Logistics is a work domain but also attached to the transport domain including
    the management of transport offers good logistics management. With the application
    of IoT can improve these domains to offers the best customer services. 4) Others
    Utilities Other domains are necessary need the IoT as a Healthcare domain, military
    and smart environment, etc. In the military domain smart objects can protect the
    lives of people. In another side many benefits of IoT technologies in healthcare
    and resulting applications can be grouped essentially of: tracking objects and
    people, the identification and authentication of people, automatic data collection
    and sensing of sickness [7]. One of the major IoT application areas that are already
    drawing attention is Smart Environment IoT. There are several test beds being
    implemented and many more planned in the coming years. Other use of the IoT is
    Smart museum and gym and Monitoring environmental parameters. Smart museum and
    gym as to smart leisure environments, the museum and the gym are two representative
    examples where the IoT technologies can help in exploiting their facilities at
    the best. Monitoring environmental parameters perishable goods such as fruits,
    fresh-cut produce, meat, and dairy products are vital parts of our nutrition.
    From the production to the consumption sites thousands of kilometers or even more
    are covered and during the transportation the conservation status need to be monitored
    to avoid uncertainty in quality levels for distribution decisions. Pervasive computing
    and sensor technologies offer great potential for improving the efficiency of
    the food supply chain [3]. C. The Protocols Layer of the IoT Protocols layer of
    the IoT consists of 4 main layers: a) Physical and Data Link Layers The most common
    physical layer protocols used (10,100, 1G) WiFi (802.11b, g, n), GSM, 3G, LTE,
    4G, IEEE 802.15.4, PLC, etc. b) Network Layer The protocols of this layer are
    IPv6, RPL. • Routing Protocol for Low and Lossy Networks (RPL) The Internet Engineering
    Task Force (IETF) formed a new Working Group called ROLL (Routing Over Low-power
    and Lossy networks) in 2008[6] which was defined a new protocol RPL to solve de
    problem of Low power and Lossy Networks (LLN). Algorithmic and protocolary foundations
    of RPL described in RFC 6550[10]. RPL was developed from four sets of requirements
    that represent the four main foreseen uses of WSN: Home Automation, Building Automation,
    Industrial and Urban environments [15]. RPL is a Distance Vector IPv6 routing
    protocol for LLNs that specifies how to build a Destination Oriented Directed
    Acyclic Graph (DoDAG) using an objective function and a set of metrics/constraints
    [9]. The objective functions to adapt the generic behavior to a particular environment
    and specify more precisely the rules of construction of DoDAG [11]. RPL is based
    on the topological concept of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). The DAG defines
    a tree-like structure that specifies the default routes between nodes in the LLN.
    However, a DAG structure is more than a typical tree in the sense that a node
    might associate to multiple parent nodes in the DAG, in contrast to classical
    trees where only one parent is allowed. More specifically, RPL organizes nodes
    as Destination-Oriented DAGs (DODAGs), where most popular destination nodes (i.e.
    sinks) or those providing a default route to the Internet (i.e. gateways) act
    as the roots of the DAGs. A network may consist of one or several DODAGs, which
    form together an RPL instance identified by a unique ID, called RPLInstanceID.
    RPL defines three types of nodes: Low Power and Lossy Border Routers (LBRs): it
    refers to the root of a DODAG that represents a collection point in the network
    and has the ability to construct a DAG. The LBR also acts as a gateway (or edge
    router) between the Internet and the LLN. Router: it refers to a device that can
    forward and generate traffic. Such a router does not have the ability to create
    a new DAG, but associate to an existing one. Host: it refers to an end-device
    that is capable of generating data traffic, but is not able to forward traffic
    [14]. c) Transport Layer There are two protocols: TCP, UDP. d) Application Layer
    There are several protocols in this layer but the most important protocols are:
    HTTP (TCP), CoAP (UDP). Appear of IoT and the limits of IP architecture obliged
    to define new protocols and an adaptive layer. • Constrained Application Protocol
    CoAP The IETF Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is an application-layer
    protocol designed to provide a REST-like interface [16]. The CoAP protocol can
    remove HTTP limitations constrained environment while ensuring high compatibility
    with existing. It is relatively easy to turn HTTP requests in CoAP queries. A
    old device connected to an IPv4 network may well request access to a resource
    on a connected server to an IPv6 network and gateway translates between the two
    worlds [11]. Thus the side of a sensor network, we can use the protocol stack
    CoAP / UDP / 6LoWPAN for IPv6 auto configuration properties and the small size
    of the battery, and it will keep the Internet side HTTP stack / TCP / IPv4 which
    is present on all devices. If, for example, an iPhone wants to know the temperature
    measured by a sensor, it will send its HTTP request, it will be transformed into
    CoAP by a bridge, and the answer may be stored for a period specified by the sensor
    in the gateway. If another device on the Internet requires the same value during
    this time interval, it will not be necessary to propagate the query to the sensor
    [11]. • CoAP vs HTTP CoAP is network-oriented protocol, using similar features
    to HTTP but also allows for low overhead, multicast, etc. As HTTP protocol is
    a long-term successful standard, it can use small script to integrate various
    resources and services. Interoperation provided by HTTP is the key point of IoT,
    for this, http is employed in application level. However, HTTP is based on TCP
    protocol using point to point (p2p) communication model that not suitable for
    notification push services. Also, for constrained devices, HTTP is too complex.
    Unlike HTTP based protocols, CoAP operates over UDP instead of using complex congestion
    control as in TCP [12]. CoAP is based on REST architecture, which is a general
    design for accessing Internet resources. In order to overcome disadvantage in
    constrained resource, CoAP need to optimize the length of datagram and provide
    reliable communication. On one side, CoAP provides URI, REST method such as GET,
    POST, PUT, and DELETE. On the other side, based on lightweight UDP protocol, CoAP
    allows IP multicast, which satisfies group communication for IoT. To compensate
    for the unreliability of UDP protocol, CoAP defines a retransmission mechanism
    and provides resource discovery mechanism with resource description [13]. e) A
    Version of IPv6 Adapted to Constrained Networks 6LoWPAN In 2005, the IETF chartered
    the IPv6 over Low Power, Wireless Networks (6LoWPAN) working group to standardize
    adaptations oflPv6 over mesh networks composed of low-power, wireless links [9].
    The difference in size of the package IPv6 and datagram of IEEE 802.15.4 obliged
    6LoWPAN group to define encapsulation and header compression mechanisms that allow
    IPv6 packets to be sent to and received from over IEEE 802.15.4 based networks.
    SECTION III. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in Algeria Algeria
    wants to position itself as one of the strongholds of the wireless Internet in
    the Maghreb. The development of Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity), WiMax (Worldwide Interoperability
    for Microwave Access) is a wireless data transmission standard, with a theoretical
    speed of 70 megabits per second, the equivalent of hundreds of ADSL (Asymmetric
    Digital Subscriber Line) connections with range of 50 kilometers. This wireless
    radio technology that aims to connect any wireless equipment: access points Wi-Fi,
    IP phone, mobile phone. The commercialization of wireless telephony in fixed mode
    (4G LTE) has just started through all the capitals of the 48 provinces of the
    country with a gradual roll in each province. This new generation of wireless
    technology used in the majority of developed countries to provid users a remote
    and speed access to the Internet that not depend on fixed phone lines as ADSL
    and with a higher performance, as the incumbent Algeria Telecom has launched this
    technology. Choosing the 4G LTE was motivated to its flexibility, easy to deploy
    and competitiveness. SECTION IV. Our Approach A. The System Design The communications
    technologies in the Internet of Things is developing rapidly in recent years so
    it can meet the demands of the connections between the physical world “things”
    and “human”. Thus, the use of smartphones helps to handle remote objects via Internet.
    Our approach proposed in this paper is mainly based on our system for irrigation
    shown in [4]. The difference is that here we have used the technologies of the
    Internet of things for smart irrigation management in southern Algeria via the
    Internet, and using smart phones. As shown in figure 1, this system consists of:
    wireless sensor network system, the 6LoWPAN smart gateway that connects the Zigbee
    network with the internet via mobile communication network (4G LTE). The sensors
    placed in the agricultural field, measure continuously the soil moisture values,
    the water tank level and the water well level, then send these values through
    a ZigBee mesh network to a smart gateway (Generic IoT Border Router Wireless Br
    1000), those information are then sent via a mobile data communication 4G LTE
    network to a web service that uses intelligent software application to automatically
    analyze the data and act according to the obtained results, by selective activation
    of controllers as needed. The routing protocol used in this proposed design is
    the RPL protocol. The outputs results and irrigation recommendations are presented
    to the user on a smart phone web application using CoAP or HTTPs interfaces. Our
    system focuses on the following performance objectives to ensure its widespread
    adoption by farmers: The system is easy to deploy, to use, and facilitates planning
    of irrigation tasks. The system is modular and flexible, making it easy to maintain
    The system design is robust and reliable. Fig. 1. The system design. Show All
    The Smart gateway connects the two parts of our system (the first part: the wireless
    sensor networks and controllers, the second parts: is the internet and smartphones),
    it is the 6LoWPAN Border Router translates between the two standardized protocol
    stacks. In addition it is an application level gateway for other IoT protocols
    such as Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread, and ZigBee. WLAN or LTE may be used for
    the uplink to the Internet [17]. B. Communication in Our System The network of
    our system consists of several tiny devices (sensors, microcontrollers, smart
    gateway) that communicate with themselves via a Low and Lossy networks (LLNs),
    using the routing protocol dedicated to this type of network called RPL (Routing
    protocol for Low and Lossy networks). This LLN network is connected to the internet
    by a smart 6lowpan gateway that represents the root of the RPL, as it shown in
    figure 2. The construction of DODAG involves two phases. Phase 1. Creating the
    up paths (from the root to the nodes): The smart gateway sends a DIO message (DAG
    Information Object) to its neighbors which are (coordinators nodes, sensors detection
    of the water level and the controller of the electric pump) for the construction
    of DODAG. Each one of these neighbors in turn send a DIO message to its neighbors
    in each irrigation area for the creation of the DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graph).
    Phase 2. Creating the down paths (from the nodes to the root): Each node in the
    network when receiving the DIO Message send a DAO message (Destination Advertisement
    Object) to its root for creating paths to the root and filling tables routing.
    The soil moisture sensors measure soil moisture, these values must be sent to
    the root nodes of sub-DAGs (coordinators nodes). Each soil moisture sensor sends
    the measured values to his favorite parent until the reception of these values
    by the coordinator node, this latter calculates the average of the received values
    and send them to the smart gateway. Fig. 2. The system communication. Show All
    The sensors detection of the water level measure the water level in the well and
    in the tank, also send these measured values to the smart gateway. The smart gateway
    sends the received values (soil moisture values and water level values) via a
    mobile communication network (4G LTE) to the farmer. The farmer can check the
    soil moisture values, and also water level in the tank and in the well with smart
    phone application that connect directly to the smart gateway using http or CoAP
    protocols. Therefore, the farmer may decide either the irrigation of dry areas
    or filling the tank by sending a response to the gateway, which represent an intermediate
    that send this response to the coordinator node in order to control the opening
    and closing of the solenoid valves or to electric pump controller in order to
    activate or deactivate the electric pump in the well according to the specific
    needs. In the case where the values of soil moisture or the values of the water
    level in the tank are critical which means that areas are dry or the water level
    in the tank is minimum, our system will automatically pass to standalone mode
    (our proposed system in [4]), which makes our system tolerant to faults. SECTION
    V. Simulation and Discussion of Result In order to validate the Performance of
    our approach by simulation, we use Cooja simulator provided by Contiki, which
    unlike most simulators also allows real hardware platforms to be emulated [18].
    This simulation is about how the network converged and stabilized using the RPL
    protocol and OFO implementation of ContikiRPL. The simulation scripts consists
    of RPL sender nodes and LLN Border Router (LBR) programs which are emulated as
    Tmote sky nodes and derived from Cooja and uIPv6 module including UDP, ICMPv6,
    IPv6, SICSLoWPAN and Rime of the Contiki kernel [19] [20]. With the help of the
    CollectView tool [21] provided by Cooja, the following metrics could be observed:
    The time taken to find the first source-destination pair in the whole network;
    The time taken for the network to fully converge when all nodes join the network
    tree; The time taken for the network to fully stabilize after convergence, the
    time taken for the Estimated Transmission Count (ETX) value for each node. As
    shown in figure 3, our network consists of 15 RPL nodes; deployed in an irrigation
    land which composed of 3 areas, where each area consist of 4 RPL sender nodes,
    and the RPL sender nodes in the tank and in the well, all these nodes are connected
    to The RPL border router, and this router is used in order to interface a regular
    IP network with an RPL 6LoWPAN network. Fig. 3. The network simulation in cooja.
    Show All Figures 4 and 5, presents the network tree and the communication between
    DAGs roots (node 2.2, node 3.3, node 4.4, node 5.5, node 6.6) and DODAG root (RPL
    border router node 1.1). Fig. 4. Communication between nodes. Show All Fig. 5.
    The network tree. Show All All data collected by the wireless sensor network are
    used by the system to handle an intelligent, automated irrigation of vegetation
    (by saving water and energy use) and can be accessed in real time via a web application
    in smartphones, which can also send alerts and commands when the ground is too
    dry or a lack of water in the basin and offer suggestions to maximize plant health.
    These first results obtained by simulation using the Cooja simulator are satisfactory,
    especially in routing information by RPL and COAP protocols. This will encourage
    us to go further towards creating a web application in smartphones to complete
    all the proposed system and facilitate the tasks of the farmers for a good monitoring
    of their agriculture. Also, we hope that this approach will be very beneficial
    if we can experiment it in the fields of agriculture especially in Saharan and
    arid areas such as the south of Algeria. SECTION VI. Conclusion The intelligent
    technologies play a very important role for an effective management of irrigation,
    we have proposed in this article a smart irrigation system for a Saharan area
    like the south of Algeria. This proposed system is based on ICT and IoT technologies.
    Using these technologies, the control of irrigation will be ensured at low cost
    and high accuracy. Our proposed system facilitates the irrigation tasks and optimizes
    the costs in term of minimizing the water consummation and reducing the cost of
    the working force. The validation of the proposed approach by simulation showed

    Abstract Information about human social activities and relationships are exploited
    by an ever increasing number of proposed applications and protocols in several
    scenarios, given the consequent increase in the system performance. Examples are
    data transmission over delay tolerant networks, content recommendation in search
    engines, and advertisement of products and services. An emerging field where social
    networks are being exploited is the Internet of Things, where smart objects connect
    to the network to bring the real world into the virtual dimension. Objects capable
    to communicate on social network sites are able to enter into their owners’ social
    loop so as to automatically publish information of interest for selected communities
    of people and to perform some related automatic actions. In so doing, not only
    can objects be part of the human social networks but they can also build their
    own social network. As a consequence, interactions among them can be fostered
    towards the development of complex services for the direct benefit of people.
    Accordingly, objects mimic the human behavior towards a scalable and effective
    service discovery and composition as well as trustworthiness management. On the
    basis of the importance achieved by this trend in the last couple of years, in
    this paper we intend to review the adopted approaches towards the exploitation
    of social network concepts by the Internet of Things, the technologies behind
    these, and the potentialities. Previous article in issue Next article in issue
    Keywords Internet of ThingsSocial networksSmart objects 1. Introduction The number
    of objects that are currently accessing the Internet, side-by-side to human beings
    to advertise, search for, and accessing enhanced services is growing exponentially.
    Among them are sensors, actuators, wireless and mobile devices, or simply every-day-life
    objects enhanced with capabilities to interact with the external world through
    the Internet. This is a clear signal that the much-vaunted (and sometime abused)
    Internet of Things paradigm is already turned into a reality on which there is
    a strong convergence of the interests of researchers, users, and industries. As
    a main effect, we have today a new approach available to build enhanced applications
    and services involving the communications among objects on the Internet to the
    service of the human beings. Several studies have focused their attention to the
    definition of architectural models and solutions towards the use and the inter-connection
    of Web-enabled objects using open protocols and well-known architectural styles,
    REST and SOAP based Web services (such as, [1], [2]). As a consequence, the obvious
    evolutionary step of the IoT is the so called Web of Things (WoTs) that envisages
    new scenarios and applications where Internet enabled objects become active actors
    and peers in the Web. Sample services, applicable to Smart Cities or Smart Homes,
    are given below: • The car driver knows about the status of her car and of the
    roads on the path towards her destination. Such awareness is achieved by accessing,
    through her mobile phone (or through any communication technology in her car),
    web services that are fed by data collected from sensors scattered both in her
    car and in the areas of interest. • The domestic appliances may be accessed by
    the owner through web services from remote sites and some actions can be performed
    on them to prepare comfortable conditions for a better welcome home. • Eco-compatible
    houses may be equipped with controllers and sensors able to measure the local
    energy production and consumption and manageable through web services towards
    a reduction of the environmental impact. Besides the obvious advantages of the
    depicted sample scenarios, one cannot hide the doubts on the ability of the proposed
    solutions to effectively harness the full potential of the new paradigm without
    colliding with the limitations of the current Web service platforms in the presence
    of trillions of additional actors (objects, precisely). In our opinion, Web of
    Things is a paradigm which goes in the right direction but is not the solution
    to the cited issues. To foster resource visibility, service discovery, object
    reputation assessment, source crowding, and service composition in a Web populated
    by people and countless things there is the necessity to strongly push towards
    solutions that exploit concepts directly derived from the sole platforms that
    currently seem to be able to effectively allow peer-to-peer exchanges among huge
    numbers of actors, i.e., Social Networks. Even if several aspects of the social
    networking among humans cannot be directly applied to the objects’ world due to
    the specific distinctive characteristics (e. g., high heterogeneity and limited
    intelligence), such a need has brought to a substantial convergence of the “Internet
    of Things” and “Social Networks” domains. Interesting ideas have recently appeared
    in the IoT arena, which testify to the interests in Social Network oriented solutions
    for the Internet of Things. People at the User Experience Lab at Ericsson Research
    started from the idea that the complexity of network solutions that underlie the
    Internet of Things are hardly understood (and mentally accepted) by all users.
    Thus, it is wise to make this complexity completely transparent during the user-thing
    interactions. Differently, the concept of “friendship” and ‘social relations’
    are understood by virtually everyone, as they are intuitive concepts. As a consequence,
    they proposed a solution to both the practical scalability and understand-ability
    issues which is simply “dressing” a network of things as if it was a social network
    [3]. They have been the first to introduce the concept of “Social Web of Things”
    and also made some applications’ prototypes. Further studies and implementations
    of this concept have been carried out around the world. An example is given by
    the work in [4], where the authors propose a Social Web of Thing Framework based
    on the Restful Web Service and Social Networks, discuss the relevant key technologies
    and use cases, and introduce a case study named MagicHome. Furthermore, even a
    prototype of a scalable architecture for a large scale social Web of Things for
    smart objects and services, named Paraimpu, has been developed [5]. In line with
    this evolutionary path, but from a different perspective, the authors of [6],
    [7] introduce the concept of Social Internet of Things. In analogy with the social
    networks of human beings, they (i) define of a notion of social relationship among
    objects, (ii) design a reference architectural model implementing a social Internet
    of Things based on codified inter-object relationships, (iii) analyze the social
    network structure, which derives from the objects interactions based on the defined
    social relationships. The examples above make us realize that the time is ripe
    for a serious reflection on the possible ways of integrating objects into social
    networks, whether they are shared with those of their owners or they are independent
    and autonomous. Aim of the present paper is to analyze the potentials of a synergic
    use of Social Networks and Internet of Things concepts towards the deployment
    of effective service platforms able to face the future challenges of a future
    world of trillions of inter-connected objects. We will illustrate the main solutions
    that are appearing in the IoT arena to let things enter the so called “social
    loop” and compare their points of strength and their weaknesses by also highlighting
    their technological requirements and architectures. This paper is organized as
    follows. In Section 2 we present the technologies behind the Web of Things as
    one of the prevailing approaches towards the integration of the objects into the
    Internet. In Section 3, we describe how this paradigm can be extended by providing
    the things with the capabilities to take part to the human social activities on
    relevant social network websites. In Section 4 we describe a complementary approach
    that allows objects to build their own social networks, so that interactions among
    them can be fostered towards the development of complex services. In Section 5
    we present the ongoing projects that come out from the concepts described in the
    previous sections. Finally, in Section 6 we draw final conclusions. 2. Web of
    Things paradigm and technologies The ongoing evolution of the Internet of Things
    towards the Web of Things (WoTs), where Web-enabled smart objects connect and
    communicate with each other by using the Web, has raised several research issues
    ranging from the adoption of the right protocol and communication paradigms to
    the choice of the most suitable architectural styles. WoT was not born as a field
    in academic research but rather as the attempt to build an ecosystem from an heterogeneous
    variety of services and products, often not conceived in a way to interoperate.
    Several efforts have focused their attention to the definition of architectural
    models and solutions, towards the use and the interconnection of Web-enabled objects,
    which exploit open protocols and well-known architectural styles, such as Representational
    State Transfer (REST) and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) based Web services.
    In [8], an architecture is defined for the development of composite applications,
    to interconnect physical devices, on top of the open and simple standards that
    made the success of the Web (REST, XML, HTTP, or Atom). The layered architecture
    is composed as follows: • Device accessibility layer: a layer that from the application
    point of view enables consistent access to all kinds of connected objects. • Find-ability
    layer: a layer that, given an ecosystem of billions of smart things, allows for
    finding their services. • Sharing layer: although device accessibility and find-ability
    can technically allow for sharing data too, this layer is specifically designed
    to manage a social circle authentication, based on accounting and authorization
    procedures. • Composition layer: a layer that enables users to create composite
    applications on top of smart things. The overall goal of this layered architecture
    is to facilitate the integration of smart things with existing services on the
    Web and to facilitate the creation of Web applications by using smart things.
    The layers above are not directly mapped onto the ISO OSI model, but are rather
    useful to understand the foundations of WoT as an ecosystem. The next subsections
    analyze the main aspects relevant to the design choices for architecting the WoT.
    These include: the architectural style (SOAP/REST), the degree of centralization,
    the device/thing degree of accessibility to the network, and the ways in which
    data, services and objects can be composed together. 2.1. SOA(P) vs. REST The
    choice between the SOAP and the REST software architecture styles deserves a deeper
    investigation. In [9] the authors go towards the definition of an architecture
    where devices are viewed as services, in order to integrate a wide range of physical
    devices into distributed IT enterprise systems adopting a Service-Oriented Architecture
    (SOA). In a similar way, the projects WS4D7 and SOCRADES [10] apply a SOA approach
    to the context of embedded networks. Moreover, existing standards for Web Services
    (WSs), focused on embedded devices, such as Device Profile for Web Services (DPWSs)
    [11], confirm a real consensus and effort towards a SOAP-based WoT. On the other
    side, some recent research works (i.e. [12], [13], [14]) adopt REST for IoT/WoT
    architectures. According to the experience documented in [13], the programmatic
    complexity of SOAP based services is not well-suited for the end-user to create
    ad hoc applications, while the authors of [14] state that, in many cases, the
    SOAP complexity becomes superfluous whereas RESTful services can support “a la
    Mash-up” integrations. In a RESTful architecture, the main resources, such as
    entities, collections, or anything else that is worth being represented in the
    application domain, are uniquely identified by its own URI. The reference methods
    - in this case, the HTTP verbs - are mapped onto application semantics in a very
    simple and straightforward way. Many new Internet companies (see the trends in
    Fig. 1) that face the market, often prefer to provide their services through a
    RESTful API rather than a solution based on SOAP. This suggests that, probably,
    REST is more immediate and less expensive for rapid prototyping. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. REST API vs. SOAP API in Google trends. The main advantages
    of REST web services can be summarized as it follows: • Lightweight – not a lot
    of extra XML markup. • Human Readable Results – in some cases (i.e., a GET request
    of a resource representation), RESTful services can be directly invoked by typing
    the URL in a common web browser. • Easy to build – no toolkits required. SOAP
    also has some advantages mainly related to the formal definition of service interfaces:
    • Easy to consume – clients can be automatically generated on the basis of the
    exact specification provided in the WSDL document. • Rigid – type checking adheres
    to a programming contract and XML schemas are provided for data exchanged to filter
    unacceptable inputs/outputs. • Development tools and business process definition
    (e.g., BPEL language). Even if the locution “Web Service” was often associated
    to the SOAP stack, this is not the way the Web works. Whereas SOAP is aimed at
    the next phase of Internet development defining a set of brand new specifications,
    REST is more the realization that the existing principles and protocols of the
    Web are already there to create robust Web services. Summarizing, even if the
    strong type checking of SOAP based Web services is a plus, in the context of the
    IoT, the RESTful Web Services have some advantages over SOAP such as less overhead,
    less parsing complexity, statelessness, and tighter integration with existing
    HTTP. Moreover, the RESTful protocol called CoAP [15] is similar to HTTP but re-designed
    especially for devices with small footprint and constrained computing environments.
    According to the recent studies mentioned in this paper it seems that the use
    of standards like CoAP and EXI and web paradigms are the key factors for extending
    the Internet making the vision of the IoT become reality. 2.2. Device accessibilty
    It is useful to explore how things can be classified according to their computation
    and communication capabilities. The following list provides a coarse classification:
    • Virtual Things. Like web sites, e-mail boxes and social networks, just to mention
    some. These “objects” can be easily wrapped and then referenced in a HTTP addressing
    space like resources (REST) or like services (WSDL) or they already provide such
    abstractions and interfaces. • HTTP-enabled Smart Appliances. Like wireless printers,
    networked screens, and smartphones. These are already equipped with a network
    connection and a complete HTTP stack but usually do not provide a WS stack; thus,
    it is necessary to deploy a proxy or to install a minimal WS stack in the device,
    where possible. Usually, HTTP-enabled objects are not able to receive incoming
    requests from outside. In many cases, they are deployed under firewall restrictions
    and only can act as clients. One possibility is to deploy in the middle a relay
    like YALER [16], which enables secure Web access to embedded systems behind a
    firewall/NAT/network gateway. A simple HTTP handshake makes a Web service running
    on the hidden device accessible from any HTTP client. Another option is WebSocket,
    which provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
    The WebSocket API is being standardized by the W3C, and the WebSocket protocol
    has been standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455. • Internet-enabled Things that
    are not equipped with a complete HTTP stack but can still communicate at the TCP/IP
    or UDP/IP level. For those objects it is straightforward to build a HTTP wrapper
    and a WS stack as a proxy. A viable protocol alternative to HTTP is CoAP [15].
    CoAP could be viewed as a compression or redesign of HTTP by taking power, memory,
    and computation constraints into account. Just like HTTP, which is designed as
    a transfer protocol for traditional web media content, CoAP is redesigned as a
    transfer protocol for devices to implement interoperations. • Network-enabled
    Things that cannot communicate over IP networks, but still can communicate with
    different protocols like ZigBee, Bluetooth or X10. For those objects a proxy can
    be deployed to present them in the HTTP addressing space, by also using WS technology
    standards. A viable solution to extend IP also to small devices that usually are
    not equipped with IP-stack is 6LoWPAN [17]. • Things not digitally enabled, bare
    physical objects. For these objects a digital counterpart must be built and published
    online. RFID or barcode sticks can be used to interface these objects with devices
    and networks. 2.3. Centralized vs. decentralized Decentralized architectures have
    a number of theoretical advantages, such as single-point-of-failure robustness
    and privacy/anonymity enforcing capability. When analyzing the Web, one discovers
    that (i) the degree of decentralization is quite low, (ii) the prominent topology
    is client–server, and (iii) even if P2P networks have gained popularity in some
    application areas, the idea to move computation at the boundaries of the Internet
    is more a niche than a main stream. The distinction between client–server and
    P2P architectures is no longer a technological distinction, but a matter of governance.
    The so-called “clouds” often adopt their own solutions of P2P load-balancing and
    fault tolerance, but the control is centralized in the hands of one provider.
    Cloud computing and Software-as-a-Service demonstrate that large IT companies
    are concentrating computation inside large globally distributed infrastructures;
    thus, transforming personal computing in a mere user interface to remote computing
    services. Also, in the new field of Internet-enabled objects, we foresee that
    P2P connections between objects are unlikely to occur unless hard real-time and
    multimedia communications are involved. A centralized online service can speak
    multiple protocols and data formats on top of HTTP and can act as a broker to
    let services meet in a logical space; it can be a proxy of data coming from sources
    and can be a relay of data to consumer services; moreover, it can make data format
    adaptation where required. In other words, it can operate at all the layers described
    above, from device accessibility to composition. In a centralized WoT tool the
    workload is put at the extreme. Some applications need to have samples on every
    second, and even only one thousand sensors connected to a central server would
    produce 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 = 86400000 events per day. The load is structured
    in many small HTTP POST messages with a keep-alive connection. The requirements
    for a cloud-based Web of Things architecture (see Fig. 2) can be summarized as
    it follows: • C10 K+[18] capable web servers (C10 K + stands for 10,000 or more
    HTTP connections handled simultaneously, i.e. non-blocking servers that do not
    map every connection to a system thread); • database engine able to be horizontally
    partitioned over a grid of machines in a transparent way (sharding); • event handling
    and data processing delegated to a pool of worker processes distributed among
    multiple processors and even different machines. Download : Download full-size

    but insightful benchmark between a non-blocking web server, like Nginx, versus
    a thread-based server, like Apache, is presented. The plots show (Fig. 3, Fig.
    4) how the throughput of Nginx are still high even with a large number of connections
    and with a very low memory usage. Nevertheless, the WoT system designer must consider
    that to fully gain an advantage from a non-blocking Web server, all the components
    in the backend must be designed to be non-blocking as well. Download : Download

    (threaded) web servers [19]. 2.4. Smart objects in service orchestrations A big
    issue in composing objects/services to form an application logic, is how to ensure
    that data coming from a data source can be properly read and processed by a recipient
    data sink. The intuitive, but not widely practicable solution, is to adopt a rigorous
    set of data schemas shared by all participants. In this way connections could
    be handled with no pains because every object that consumes data is able to receive
    and to decide what to do with the data. Unfortunately, having a common set of
    data types defined and shared for all interconnected objects is far to be realistic.
    Objects are built from different manufacturers for vertical applications, often
    inside walled gardens or with small capabilities to interoperate with external
    entities. A more realistic assumption is to consider objects able to produce data
    in a format among those commonly encapsulated into HTTP messages. So we can expect
    that a data source can push a string containing either numbers or alphanumeric
    values, or more structured data like JSON objects or XML instances. As an example,
    Paraimpu [20] implements the concept of mapping as a couple of expressions in
    the form of (cond, repl), where cond is a boolean expression while the repl expression
    is a valid instance of the data type expected by the sink (the actuator). This
    approach can be subsumed in the more general IF-THEN paradigm applied to events,
    data and actions in the IoT. The online service called IFTTT (IF This Than That),
    although initially conceived for social networks and not for physical mashups,
    is the immediate proof-of-concept of how this mechanism can work. Also other sensor
    data collectors like COSM (former Pachube) implements the concept of trigger (IF
    condition on datum THEN post datum on URL). A more versatile approach is to use
    business process definition to declare a more complex composition logic. In the
    case of SOAP-based WoT mashups, interactions can be described in two ways: executable
    processes and abstract processes. Both can be modeled by BPEL. Executable processes
    model the actual behavior of a participant as interactions, while abstract processes
    describe the observable behavior and/or process template. BPEL extends the WS-∗
    interaction model to enable business transactions. BPEL defines an interoperable
    composition model that enables the extension of automated process integration
    both within and between businesses. Pintus et al. [21] also propose a SOA framework
    where smart things are described by using the WSDL standard, while logical connections
    between smart things are modeled as web services orchestrations by using the BPEL
    language. The availability of an API to be consumed by clients, of course, opens
    also the possibility to write third-party programs or scripts in arbitrary programming
    languages and build applications as a result of the composition of data coming
    from source objects, processed and transformed into actions for other smart objects.
    3. Adding the social aspect to WoT To date, IoT has been conceived as a top-down
    technology that silently takes the control of objects in a machine-to-machine
    internetworking with large benefit for logistics, manufacturing, and business
    productivity. On the other hand, the point we stress here is that for IoT/WoT
    to acquire some socialization value, end-users should be enabled to be active
    and creative in the definition of new relationships where smart things become
    either an instrument or a toy to share or to play with collaboratively. In this
    respect, it is important to provide users with enabling platforms, based on known
    and understandable metaphors, to manage, control and personalize the composition
    between sensor data and actions in the real life. In order to enable a wide adoption
    of WoT in all sectors of the society, the WoT architecture and its protocols should
    motivate every citizens to contribute to a growing number of devices and smart
    objects in order to build new streams of information available to the community.
    We can identify at least two generic use cases. The first one is the participatory
    sensing and the second one is the “device in a circle”. Participatory sensing
    applications use data of mobile sensor nodes collected in collaboration with the
    device owner. With the right tools, community groups may participate in campaigns
    to collect data on highly-focused topics, such as traffic patterns, pollution-safe
    routes for school buses, without waiting for an institutional body or private
    agency to perform the detection. For example, the NoiseTube project [22], started
    in 2008 at the Sony Computer Science Lab in Paris and currently hosted by the
    BrusSense Team at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, proposes a participative approach
    for monitoring noise pollution by involving the general public. For users to become
    active in the bottom-up construction of a participatory sensing scenario, aspects
    like trust, reputation, control of distributed devices and tracking of information
    flows must be appropriately adjusted to control what is happening with the information
    and devices contributed. The identities of users are not harvested and should
    be kept anonymous while on the other hands the management of reputation of the
    data produced must be deployed to allow the participatory sensing to become effective
    and discard malicious or irrelevant data. In the “device in the social circle”
    use case the social-ability is a key element to share and collaboratively use
    the smart things in the Web. Device accessibility layer and findability layer
    can technically allow sharing as well, but to manage physical objects in a social
    circle, features like authentication, accounting and authorization need to be
    properly designed and implemented. Integrating smart objects and main-stream social
    networks is another key aspect. Every WoT system who aims to become popular and
    adopted by users, should integrate and communicate with social media in some way.
    In some extent, existing social media are the precursor of the future social IoT
    because they have already faced a number of issues like privacy concerns, content
    moderation, insights visualization and so forth. The integration of Social media
    and Web of Things can occur in many ways: • User login/authentication: users can
    access a system by using existing credentials without building a brand new profile.
    Thanks to the Oauth protocol, the user is redirected to her/his preferred social
    tool to perform the login. This leads to the immediate benefit to have contacts/friends
    imported in the new system. In this way, it would be possible for a generic WoT
    site to connect its users with their Facebook or Twitter counterparts. • Social
    network as monitoring tool, for instance the IoT portal [23]: it allows users
    to quickly connect sensors and actuators to the system, and then create dashboard
    visualizations as Facebook applications. These applications allow users to share
    and monitor sensed data and control actuators in the real world. • Sensors/actuators:
    a social entity, such as user’s Facebook wall and the Twitter flow associated
    to an hashtag, can be considered a sensor or an actuator (or both) just like physical
    things in the implementation of virtual-to-physical mashups. For instance, the
    “device in the circle” could be a set of parking sensors and the social circle
    could be the list containing the customers’ contacts of a restaurant keeper. As
    an example, the restaurant manager can build a geographical selection of parking
    sensors in the neighborhood saving this selection as a datasource in her work
    space called “parkingSlots”. Then she can create a link between the selected datasource
    and her customer list using for instance his Facebook profile. In so doing, her
    customers will receive the number of free slots directly on their mobile or PC
    and decide to go there by car or by other means. As dual example, the “device
    in the circle” can be a device shared and controlled by means of social media,
    like for example, a multimedia installation, even on a large scale (e.g., night-time
    lighting of a skyscraper). The social circle may be the set of users of a certain
    social network that post messages to a certain topic (for example, a topic with
    a hash tag on twitter). Analytics based on text recognition (or even mood recognition)
    on tweets may trigger different actions on the installation (for example, the
    ignition with certain colors or with certain choreography). • The social dimension
    is useful for device/thing find-ability: the navigability of users’ profiles enables
    to discover objects shared by friends, but also to find new friends and new devices/things.
    4. Evolution of social Internet of Things 4.1. Objects that handle social relationships
    In the IoT, everything real becomes virtual, which means that each person and
    thing has a locatable, addressable, and readable counterpart on the Internet.
    These virtual entities can produce and consume services and collaborate toward
    a common goal. The car driver might know about the status of her car and of the
    roads towards her destination, thanks to the autonomous communications of the
    sensors and actuators in her car with those installed in other vehicles and along
    the road. The embedded system in a swimming pool could share its state with other
    virtual entities. All these scenarios are possible with an intense interaction
    between objects and related services, enabling the most powerful and fascinating
    applications. For instance, in [24] the authors introduce the idea of objects
    able to participate in conversations that were previously only available to humans.
    Those envisioned are objects aware of dynamic community structures, thus being
    able to develop a spontaneous networking infrastructure based on the information
    to be disseminated other than information on the objects themselves. Analogously,
    the research activities reported in [25] consider that, being things involved
    into the network together with people, social networks can be built based on the
    Internet of Things and are meaningful to investigate the relations and evolution
    of objects in IoT. Again, IoT and social network technologies and concepts are
    jointly exploited towards the development of tools that can make people’s lives
    easier. This time the idea is to use social networking elements in the Internet
    of Things to allow objects to autonomously establish social relationships. The
    driving motivation is that a social-oriented approach is expected to put forward
    the discovery, selection and composition of services and information provided
    by distributed objects and networks that have access to the physical world. The
    proposed social-oriented approach is characterized by the capabilities of the
    objects to autonomously establish social relationships of different kinds [24],
    [26], [7]. Within the resulting object social network, a key objective will be
    to publish information and services, find them, and discover novel resources to
    support the implementation of complex services and applications. This can be achieved
    in a trusty and efficient way by navigating a social network of “friend” objects,
    instead of relying on typical Internet discovery tools that cannot scale to billions
    of future devices. Indeed, social networking concepts have proven to be of great
    importance for handling the relationships among humans and, in the same way, these
    are expected to have a great impact on the management of services in the IoT.
    Specifically, in [7] the Social Internet of Things (SIoTs) has been proposed.
    According to this model, a set of forms of socialization among objects are foreseen
    as shown in Fig. 5. The parental object relationship is defined among similar
    objects, built in the same period by the same manufacturer (the role of family
    is played by the production batch). Moreover, objects can establish co-location
    object relationship and co-work object relationship, like humans do when they
    share personal (e.g., cohabitation) or public (e.g., work) experiences. A further
    type of relationship is defined for objects owned by the same user (mobile phones,
    game consoles, etc.), which is named ownership object relationship. The last relationship
    is established when objects come into contact, sporadically or continuously, for
    reasons purely related to relations among their owners (e.g., devices/sensors
    belonging to friends); it is named social object relationship. These relationships
    are created and updated on the basis of the objects features (such as: object
    type, computational power, mobility capabilities, brand) and activity (frequency
    in meeting the other objects, mainly). The parental and ownership relationships
    are determined by just the static characteristics of the object (or slowly varying
    characteristics): type, brand, ownership. The others are determined by the movement
    of the object and by the other nodes it encounters. The relationships’ management
    is implemented in the cloud, in the object gateways, and in the objects themselves,
    if capable of supporting the relevant logic. Clearly, the configuration of these
    functionalities is controlled by the object owner; accordingly, the resulting
    links are asymmetrical. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Sketch of
    the five types of relationships defined in the SIoT paradigm. To manage the resulting
    network and relationships, the foreseen SIoT architecture is made of four major
    components (among others). The Relationship management introduces into the SIoT
    the intelligence that allows objects to start, update, and terminate relationships.
    The selection of which friendship to accept is based on human control settings.
    Service discovery is finalized to find which objects can provide the required
    service in the same way humans seek for friendships and information. Indeed, to
    discover the service, the object queries its social relationship network. Service
    composition enables the interaction among objects. The service discovery exploits
    the object relationships to find the desired service, which is then activated
    by this component. Both a reactive and a proactive approach to service composition
    are envisaged. This component will also include the functionality of crowd information
    processing, to process the information obtained from different objects and obtain
    the most reliable answer to a query on the basis of different visions. Trustworthiness
    management is aimed at understanding how the information provided by other members
    has to be processed. 4.2. The SIoT architecture In [6], a possible SIoT architecture
    has been proposed, which follows the simple three-layer architectural model for
    IoT. In this model, the sensing layer is devoted to data acquisition and node
    collaboration in short-range and local networks. The network layer is aimed at
    transferring data across different networks. Finally, the application layer is
    where the IoT applications are deployed together with the middleware functionalities.
    The application layer is the key part in the SIoT, making this architectural proposal
    distinctive with respect to alternative solutions. It consists of three sub-layers,
    with the base sub-layer devoted to the database for the storage and management
    of the data and relevant descriptors, which record the social member profiles
    and their relationships, as well as the activities carried out by the objects
    in the real and virtual worlds. The component sub-layer works on top of the base
    sub-layer and implements the functionalities described in the previous subsection,
    i.e., relationship management, service discovery, service composition, trustworthiness
    management. The application layer is where the application are located, relying
    on the social-oriented behavior of the objects. With the intent to highlight the
    distinctive features of the SIoT architecture, in Fig. 6 we provide a mapping
    of the major SIoT components into the reference model provided in [27] by the
    IoT-A European research project, which represents a major effort in defining a
    reference architecture for the existing and future IoT solutions. In this figure,
    we show the five functional layers with the main functionalities in gray-colored
    boxes. In the upper layer are located the applications that are built on top of
    an implementation of the IoT-A architecture. This represents instances of the
    process execution and service orchestration, which indeed is used to combine different
    services (also provided by different system implementations) to implement complex
    services. The relevant APIs are also a key part of this layer. The virtual entity
    (VE) and information is the layer that maintains and organizes information related
    to physical entities, enabling search for services exposing resources associated
    to physical entities. Accordingly, it is intended to response to queries about
    a particular physical entity by providing with addresses of the service related
    to the physical entity. The lower layer, i.e., the IoT service and resource, links
    specific services to the related resources. It also notifies application software
    and services about events related to resources and corresponding physical entities.
    The Device connectivity and communication layer provides the set of methods and
    primitives for device connectivity and communication. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Major functionalities of the SIoT system (in blue color) in the
    IoT-A reference architecture. In Fig. 6, we have highlighted the main features
    of the SIoT solution. At the second layer, the SIoT system may require the extension
    of the object descriptions to support the creation and management of the social-oriented
    behavior and relationships, such as: owner ID; object position, which can be changing
    over the time depending on the object mobility features; power supply status,
    that defines whether the object is either battery-powered (and the battery power
    level is provided), socket-connected (and whether is currently connected or not),
    or it harvests power from the environment; amount of traffic generated in terms
    of number of connections and overall bit-rate. The objects could also be grouped
    into different classes, depending on their main characteristics, such as mobility,
    computational and communication capabilities, interfaces, sensing capabilities,
    power supply. At the third layer, the major part of the SIoT functionalities needs
    to be introduced. These also call for the definition of specific ontologies and
    semantic engines. The ontologies are used to represent a semantic view of the
    social activities, which is extracted through appropriate semantic engines. The
    objective is to provide a machine interpretable environment for representing attributes
    and operations of the IoT devices. Many works have already been conducted in this
    area, which could be partially used in the SIoT scenario, e.g., Ontology Web Language
    for Services (OWL-S) model, which has already been used as the basis of a semantic
    service modeling framework for the IoT [28], [29]. Accordingly, services are used
    as an interface that represents the IoT resources (i.e., the physical world devices)
    and provide an access to the functions and capabilities of these resources. Ontologies
    to manage and control heterogeneous systems have also been investigated in [27].
    This highlights that an automatic discovery will be impossible without ontological
    classification and semantic annotation processes. In [30], the importance of the
    ontology has been analyzed from a social network perspective as a format to represent
    the object information which is relevant to end users. Other approaches for creating
    semantic service descriptions could be used as described in [31]. These include:
    Semantic Annotations for WSDL (SAWSDL), Unified Service Description Language (USDL),
    Web Service Modelling Language (WSML), Web Service Modelling Ontology (WSMO),
    and Semantic Annotations for Representational State Transfer SA-REST [32]. The
    relationship management module is the one responsible to establish, update, and
    terminate the relationships among the objects in their virtual representation.
    It also elaborates the social network to facilitate the discovery of the services
    by identifying different clusters of resource relationships. Possible approaches
    are to make use of similarity measures and multi-scale renormalization and synergetic
    – self organization techniques. These should be embodied into the SIoT learners
    and adaptors of virtual resources following the cognitive networks paradigm. Consequently,
    an object social graph is built with objects that are linked by edges representing
    the established relationships, each one weighted by its computed degrees. This
    module is also responsible for calculating several topological features of the
    resource social graph such as: between-ness, closeness, degree/eigenvector hubs
    and authorities centrality measures. This allows for determining the most “central”
    nodes/resources, which is a key activity because the identified “central” nodes/resources
    will be those that control the data flows in SIoT and influence the rest of nodes/resources.
    By doing so, the “central” nodes will be marked as landmarks, representative for
    their local neighborhood. The service discovery functionality is key in the third
    layer, since it is needed to find which objects can provide a service requested
    in the target application. This functionality should be implemented into the SIoT
    system by following the rules the humans adopt to seek for friendships and for
    any information in the social networking services. The discovery will be guided
    by the object social graph as described above. The trust management module is
    the one responsible to address the inherent risks in transactions with no prior
    experience with regard to the reputation of every other node. In doing this, it
    exploits the resource social graph to build a reputation-based trust mechanism
    for the IoT that can effectively deal with certain types of malicious behavior
    that intend to mislead other nodes [33]. In such a scenario, two possible models
    for the implementation of the Trustworthiness management can be followed. One
    is the subjective trustworthiness, derived from a social point of view, where
    each node computes the trustworthiness of its friends on the basis of its own
    experience and on the basis of its friends’ experiences. If two nodes are not
    friends, then the trustworthiness is calculated by word of mouth through a chain
    of friendships. The other is the objective trustworthiness, obtained from P2P
    scenarios, where the information about each node is distributed and stored by
    making use of a DHT (Distributed Hash Table) structure. This information is visible
    to every node but is only managed by special nodes that we call Pre-Trusted Objects
    (PTOs). Finally, the service composition component enables the interaction between
    services provided by different objects to achieve complex services and applications.
    Most of the time, the interaction is related to an object that wishes either to
    retrieve an information about the real world or to find a specific service provided
    by another object. In fact, the main potential we see in deploying SIoT is its
    capability to foster such an information retrieval. 5. On-going projects The projects
    listed here bring together the technological aspects, related to the functionality
    offered by the so-called smart objects, with the social aspects. Projects in this
    list mainly fall into one of the three scenarios emerged from the previous sections:
    participatory sensing, device-in-the-circle, and devices-that-socialize. The tools
    to compose and build personalized and social application that merges together
    data from different sources belong to a field in continuous evolution and such
    tools are often the basis for other projects: they are mainly cloud-based because
    the cloud is always there, up and running, it is reachable from everywhere, and
    a large amount of application complexity can be moved from the target devices
    to the cloud components. Among these tools are: Ninja Blocks [34], IFTTT [35]
    and Paraimpu [36]. Ninja Blocks is a project started in 2012 from the crowdfunding
    platform Kickstarter.com. Ninja Blocks are cloud-based devices that can sense
    their environment and can act by controlling lights, power sockets, and other
    actuators. The system provides a tool to compose actions and sensing with common
    social web sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. Among the sensors there is
    also a camera. IFTTT is a San Francisco based startup whose service enables customers
    to create and share within minutes very simple applications that fit the “if this
    then that” rule. An example of application can be IF “someone tags me on Facebook
    picture” then “put the picture on my Dropbox”. IFTTT was initially conceived for
    Internet services and social media and only later, in June 2012, the service crossed
    over to the physical world by integrating with Belkin WeMo [37] devices allowing
    IFTTT rules to compose social media events with home automation. Paraimpu is a
    cloud-based research prototype from CRS4, which provides the functionality to
    manage smart Things and to compose them with services already on the Web to create
    personalized applications. Common DIY (Do It Yourself) boards like Arduino, can
    be easily integrated as the system automatically generates the code for these
    boards to produce/receive data. Paraimpu allows people to share smart things and
    devices in their social circle enabling social physical-virtual Web mash-ups.
    The availability of such tools is fostering the development of personalized and
    interesting installation. At the moment these are generated by a small niche of
    geeks and early adopters but, to some extent, pave the way for a future diffusion
    and adoption of smart things in everyday social life. Among the installations,
    here are reported three “device-in-the-circle” cases: • Jardimpu [38] (based on
    Arduino and Paraimpu) is an automated irrigation system based on the sensing of
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, light conditions, which is then used to
    control the level of water in some plant’s saucers (e.g. Dionaea Muscipula). This
    system is not an absolute novelty in the field of sensors-based garden irrigation,
    but it is one of the first examples of “social” gardening: people in the social
    circle can activate the drippers, can see plants in a live streaming, and can
    monitor their parameters. • TLight is a permanent installation created by the
    Quit group [39] and connected to the web thanks to Paraimpu, which allows everyone
    to change the color tones and the behavior of the lights placed on the top of
    the big glass tower of the T-Hotel in Cagliari. To interact with the lights, a
    twitter user can post a message on with hashtag:#thotel followed by any phrase
    containing one of the following words: red, blue, green, orange, yellow, white,
    cyan, purple, wave, different, couple, full, pulse e random. • Natural Fuse [40]
    is a social IoT game based on COSM [41]. Participants get a Natural Fuse unit
    which consists of a houseplant and a power socket. The amount of power available
    to the socket is limited by the capacity of the plant to offset the carbon footprint
    of the energy expended. If people cooperate on energy expenditure then the plants
    thrive (and everyone may use more energy). But if people do not cooperate, then
    the network starts to randomly kill plants. The electricity depends on the plants
    just as the plants depend on the electricity. The work carried on in the field
    of Social Web of Things by Ericsson also deserves a citation as “devices-that-socialize”
    use case. Researchers at Ericsson in fact are working on methods for connecting
    device into a social media platform for nodes that are not people. Recently they
    have presented at the Connected House exhibit, a social network interface that
    linked all of the different connected nodes in a home as well as trusted points
    in the public sphere. Another very popular project is Waze. Waze is a company
    based on Israel which developed a service called social-GPS. The service is aimed
    at avoid traffic, and it is based on a large community spread all over the world.
    It allows, through a smart phone equipped with GPS, to share real-time traffic
    information and help everyone to save time and fuel. Even if it does not make
    use of any exotic hardware but it totally relies on the smartphone functionalities,
    it is a perfect example of tool for participatory sensing. At the same time, it
    is also a case of “device-in-the-circle” because the connection with Facebook
    allows participants to see their friends on the map to coordinate arrival times
    to give or get rides or meet up with other participants. In the field of Smart
    Cities, the project CityScripts [42] is an experiment built on top of the SmartSantander
    [43] platform (with a base of 12,000 urban sensors deployed in the city of Santander).
    The CityScripts project is aimed at integrating and experimenting a Web of Things
    scenario in which sensors and actuators in the city have a digital counterpart
    and can be used by citizens to compose personal applications integrating sensor
    data with social networks and other online data sources. 6. Conclusions In this
    paper, we have reviewed the main approaches followed during the last years to
    make objects part of the human social loop and grant them a role within the human
    social network sites. This objective has been achieved by extending the paradigm
    of Web of Things to give things the capabilities to automatically post information
    on the social network sites and to be reached through these as well. A complementary
    approach is the one according to which objects have their own social network,
    which is independent from those of the humans but still controlled by them (albeit
    progressively less, as technologies progresses). The two approaches can be combined
    so that part of the information and actions of relevance for one social network
    type, that is the one where humans rule, can be exported/imported to/into the
    other one, where objects rule. Certainly, the objective of these approaches is
    to address the complexity in the management of the trillions of objects that will
    be connected to the network in a couple of years and to exploit their major potentialities.
    Through the presented survey of ongoing projects, we learned that the implementations
    deployed so far are limited in their potentialities. These only focus on specific
    applications and do not converge on an interoperable platform where social networking
    concepts are adopted as the major principles that drive the object interactions.

    and their citizens have led the largest changes that have been taking place continuously,
    especially since the transition from an agricultural economy to an industrial
    one. This phenomenon is especially significant from the mid-eighteenth century
    and it will become more intense if the predictions that establish that, around
    the year 2050, approximately 70% of the world population will concentrate in some
    type of city finally come true. With these boundary conditions, it is evident
    that the achievement of more efficient and sustainable cities is an unavoidable
    objective for which politicians, managers and technicians must work in order to
    guarantee the quality of life of their citizens. Although this paradigm of sustainability
    and efficiency has always been present in the managers of cities, it has not been
    until very recently that technology has made available to the responsible parties
    a plethora of possibilities that, when properly employed, translate into significant
    savings. At the same time, the day-to-day improvement of the citizens is consolidating
    a new urban concept in which the different processes and systems that occur in
    it are continuously monitored in both time and space. This paper reviews the evolution
    of one of the pioneering examples of such cities, Santander, where an Internet
    of the Things infrastructure was deployed a decade ago. In this time, multiple
    technologies and services have been developed and deployed in smart city pilots.
    The paper discusses the key lessons learnt from the digitalization of the city
    and the new challenges that have arisen as we were paving the way for a smarter
    and more liveable city. Similar content being viewed by others RETRACTED ARTICLE:

    access 13 June 2023 1 Introduction The smart city market is still largely fragmented,
    with vertical solutions dominating and horizontal solutions more mirroring experimental
    petri dishes rather than solutions to real problems. This results in below-critical
    mass efforts in standardisation and commodity solutions. Vendor lock-in thus dictates
    the landscape, resulting in lowering cities’ confidence that smart city strategies
    can achieve a major change. Conversely, the fragmentation of emerging IoT-enabled
    city platforms makes it difficult for entrepreneurs and SMEs to achieve economies
    of scale by replicating innovative solutions from one city to another. In this
    sense, planning to effectively meet the conditions and realities of a post-carbon,
    climate responsible world will require a shift in our current understanding of
    what constitutes good urban design and planning. Many of the practices that we
    now take for granted, such as planning cities around automobile transportation
    and zoning for single uses, will no longer be economically, environmentally, or
    culturally viable. Smart cities hold the potential to be a key driver and catalyst
    in creating a large-scale global IoT market of services and hardware [1]. However,
    the emerging smart city market faces specific challenges that act as barriers
    to growth, impeding rapid innovation and inhibiting widespread market adoption.
    In this paper we are reviewing the key lessons learnt gathered from the experience
    of a decade of developing and deploying smart city services in the city of Santander,
    Spain. Based on this, we are proposing some of the key challenges that should
    be addressed in order to bring the smart city paradigm a step forward. In this
    sense, we are foreseeing four key objectives that should be pursued: (1) Scaling
    city platforms without vendor and/or city lock-in; (2) Developing services that
    really meet citizens’ needs; (3) Guaranteeing resilient wireless connectivity
    in massive 5G scenarios; (4) Encouraging new high-value data sources beyond open
    data. The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes
    the history of the SmartSantander ecosystem consolidation by briefly sketching
    the projects that have been carried out and presenting how they have contributed
    to the evolution of the city. In the path that these projects have opened some
    fundamental lessons have been learnt, which are also summarized. In Sect. 3, the
    way forward is outlined by identifying the crucial challenges that have to be
    addressed in order to fulfil the aforementioned key objectives. The high-level
    framework for addressing these challenges is also presented. Finally, existing
    related work and initiatives already developing innovative solutions for these
    challenges are also reviewed in Sect. 3. Last but not least, some concluding remarks
    are highlighted in Sect. 4. 2 SmartSantander Lessons Learnt This section presents
    the three key pillars of the SmartSantander evolution and the three key lessons
    learnt that we have concluded. These lessons learnt are based on our developments
    around the SmartSantander concept evolution as a successful case of the implementation
    of the smart city paradigm. 2.1 SmartSantander Evolution The objectives of SmartSantander’s
    developments are two-fold as well as concurrent. As a testbed, it enables experimental
    assessment of cutting-edge scientific research. However, this testbed goes beyond
    the experimental validation of novel IoT technologies. It also aims at supporting
    the assessment of the socio-economical acceptance of new IoT solutions and the
    quantification of service usability and performance with end users in the loop.
    For instance, it simultaneously supports the trial and subsequent provisioning
    of smart city services. In the following subsections, a brief summary of three
    key factors that have structured the evolution of the SmartSantander approach
    is presented. 2.1.1 Massive Deployment of IoT Devices The deployment, influenced
    by Santander Municipality’s strategic smart-city service requirements, intentionally
    provided a concentration of IoT devices in the city centre (a 1 km2 area) in order
    to achieve the maximum possible impact on the citizens. Nonetheless, other city
    areas are also covered. Figure 1 shows an excerpt view of the deployment. The
    different markers represent the deployed nodes (e.g. illuminance, sound pressure
    level, ambient temperature, mobile nodes or car presence detection sensors). Fig.
    1 Santander IoT infrastructure deployment excerpt view Full size image The SmartSantander
    testbed is composed of around 3000 IEEE 802.15.4 devices, 200 GPRS modules and
    2000 joint NFC tag/QR code labels deployed both at static locations (streetlights,
    facades, bus stops) as well as on-board mobile vehicles (buses, taxis). Moreover,
    smartphones belonging to citizens who have downloaded the Pulso de la Ciudad App
    [2] are also part of the testbed infrastructure. To attract the widest interest
    and demonstrate its usefulness, the deployment of the IoT experimentation infrastructure
    has been undertaken to create interesting use-cases that will generate an impact.
    In this respect, application areas have been selected based on their high potential
    impact on the citizens. Diversity, dynamics and scale of the IoT environment are
    also taken into consideration in the selection of application use cases: Environmental
    Monitoring: Around 2000 IoT devices installed (mainly in the city centre), on
    lampposts and facades provide measurements of different environmental parameters,
    such as temperature, CO, noise or light). Mobile Environmental Monitoring: In
    order to extend the aforementioned environmental monitoring use case, apart from
    measuring at static points, devices located in vehicles retrieve environmental
    parameters (related to air pollution). Sensors are installed in 150 public vehicles,
    including buses, taxis and police cars. Outdoor Parking: Almost 400 parking sensors
    (based on ferromagnetic technology), buried under the asphalt, have been installed
    in the main parking areas of the city centre in order to detect parking site availability
    in these zones (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Smart City services examples at Santander Full
    size image Traffic Intensity Monitoring: Around 60 devices have been deployed
    at the main entrances to the city of Santander to measure the main traffic condition
    parameters, such as traffic volumes, road occupancy, and vehicle speed or queue
    length. Parks and gardens irrigation: In order to make irrigation as efficient
    as possible, around 50 devices have been deployed in two green zones of the city
    to monitor irrigation-related parameters such as moisture temperature and humidity,
    rain precipitation or wind conditions. NFC/QR tags: More than 2000 tags have been
    deployed and distributed throughout different strategic locations. These tags
    are mainly at transportation points (bus stops, taxi ranks, etc…), points of interest
    (monuments, etc…) and shops. All the information provided is online and can be
    updated at any time. Every time one of these tags is read, an observation is generated
    including information relating to the reader. Participatory sensing: In this scenario,
    mobile phones are used as sensing devices automatically feeding information from
    the device’s built-in sensors such as GPS, compass, noise or temperature into
    the SmartSantander platform. Users can also participate by manually reporting
    events or incidences occurring in the city, which will subsequently be propagated
    to other users who are subscribed to the respective type of events (Fig. 1). The
    deployment of IoT devices to compose the SmartSantander infrastructure has been
    motivated both by requirements for ‘in-situ’ experimentation and by the aforementioned
    smart city services. The details of the SmartSantander’s IoT devices regarding
    hardware specifications, deployment locations and network organization have been
    thoroughly described in [3, 4]. 2.1.2 Service Provision One of the instruments
    of the strategy of Santander for sustainable development has been starting and
    performing a progressive enhancement of its Smart City dimension. The SmartSantander
    project [5] has been a clear milestone that has opened a wide variety of research
    lines converting the city in a kind of urban laboratory. Within the objectives
    of this initiative, the improvement of the quality of municipality services is
    paramount but also the contribution to the reactivation of the regional economic
    fabric is a heavyweight aim. The facility was conceived not only to act as a testbed
    for research with IoT technologies, but also for the development and evaluation
    of IoT enabled Smart City services and applications. To build such facility, the
    project analysed, designed and developed several services that were ranked as
    a priority by the local authorities, regional government and end users, which
    are described next. Environmental Monitoring: Due to global warming, governments
    around the world are devoting significant effort and resources to the management
    of the environment. The city of Santander, likewise, is involved in this activity
    and it is trying to carry out an effective policy for environmental management.
    Parking Management: With the aim of reducing CO emissions and other pollutants,
    as well as petrol consumption, ICT are becoming a transversal enabler. Drivers
    looking for available parking places within the city may use both smartphone applications
    as well as panels installed in the city. Traffic intensity: The assessment and
    classification of vehicles in road traffic is mainly accomplished by inductive
    loops placed under the pavement. These inductive loops allow monitoring vehicle
    passing and provide us information on several parameters of the traffic (vehicle
    speed, traffic congestion and traffic accidents, among others). The information
    is sent to the SmartSantander platform. Parks and gardens irrigation: The service
    is aimed at complementing the automated irrigation systems currently deployed
    at parks and gardens within the city of Santander. It offers a wide data set acquired
    in a distributed way, gathering the information of interest from multiple locations
    within each area. Agricultural IoT devices and weather stations have been deployed
    in three major parks of Santander. All the information captured by the sensors
    is sent to the SmartSantander platform and merged on an application that provides
    parks management technicians with accurate information on the green areas status.
    Tourist and Cultural information: In the majority of cities, there is a huge amount
    of information that may be of interest for tourists and citizens, but it is not
    readily accessible because it is so disperse. To avoid that, a service has been
    implemented to unify the way to access all data sources and presenting them in
    a context-sensitive, location-aware manner to the end users using Augmented Reality
    (AR) technology (Fig. 2). The service includes information about more than 2700
    places in the city of Santander, classified in different categories: beaches,
    parks and gardens, monuments, buildings, tourist offices, shops, art galleries,
    libraries, bus stops, taxi ranks, bicycle hire points, parking lots and sports
    centres. Furthermore, it allows real-time access to traffic and beach cameras,
    weather reports and forecasts, public bus information and bike hire service, generating
    a unique ecosystem for end users when moving around the city. Participatory Sensing:
    The service aims at exploiting the use of citizens’ smartphones to make people
    to take an active role in the generation of data for the SmartSantander Platform.
    Citizens, Santander City Council and the local newspaper are connected through
    the SmartSantander platform so that they can report, share and be notified of
    events happening in the city. Users also utilise their mobile phones to send physical
    sensing information, e.g. GPS coordinates, compass, environmental data such as
    noise, temperature, etc., feeding this information into the same platform. Municipal
    services were reorganized to adopt this application as the main way to report
    incidences. This has permitted to improve the response time to the citizen claims
    reducing the time to find out a solution for an incidence from 40.76 to 13.2 days.
    2.1.3 Co-creation Co-creation as a strategy where diverse stakeholders collaborate
    and produce a mutually beneficial product/service together was a crucial element
    of SmartSantander development. The SmartSantander facility provides the possibility
    that different stakeholders within the smart cities can co-create new services
    and innovative applications that can be tested and validated under real conditions
    in the urban landscape. SmartSantander has accomplished the concept of co-creation
    by opening its infrastructure and platform to third-party developers, entrepreneurs
    and companies for them to try their novel ideas over a real-world environment
    where not only a real infrastructure is available but also a complete living lab
    has been created (i.e. real users, real policies, real impairments, etc.). The
    SmartSantander experimentation tier consists of various components (deployed services
    and applications, template applications or libraries) that facilitate the building
    of applications and services for experimentation with them. At this level, any
    experimenter might develop and deploy its own services (e.g., a website, a web
    service, a desktop application or a smartphone application) that interact with
    the platform through the Experimentation as a Service (EaaS) Application Programming
    Interfaces (API). All applications at this tier have to be authorized and users
    utilizing them (either experimenters or services’ users) can be authenticated
    and authorized to interact with the various services/assets exposed by the platform.
    On this level, SmartSantander’s facility provides a set of user interfaces that
    aims to facilitate the experimentation and co-creation activities: (1) a User
    Interface (UI) for discovering assets and the corresponding metadata associated
    to them like ranking and comments; (2) a portal for defining, managing and monitoring
    experiments during their life cycle; (3) Web and Smartphone Applications or Services
    for gathering annotations or any other data provided by the users; and (4) another
    UI for interacting with the different communities participating in each experiment.
    2.2 Lessons Learnt From the experience that have been gathered throughout the
    years of evolution of the SmartSantander ecosystem, we discuss in the following
    sub-sections three aspects that are crucial for the development of smart cities.
    2.2.1 Necessary Infrastructure Deployment The baseline fabric of a smart city
    is surely the infrastructure that it has deployed. In this respect, what is meant
    with a smart city is the creation of a system of systems that is conscious about
    itself and that can adapt to the situation dynamically. Basically, we want the
    city to behave as a smart living entity. For this to happen, it is necessary to
    have sensors that makes the system aware of what is going on in the city. Also
    actuators that receives the commands and modify its behaviour to optimize their
    performance. It is likewise necessary to have the networks that bring the information
    back and forward in a secure and reliable way and respecting the quality and grade
    of service required. Without this sensing, actuating and communicating infrastructure
    deployed, developing a smart city is simply not possible. However, as we have
    learnt from the experience gathered in Santander, two important aspects have to
    be observed during the necessary infrastructure deployment. Firstly, there is
    already a lot of infrastructure deployed in the city. It is possible that some
    of it could already be useful as the aforementioned smart city fabric. Other,
    might only need some adaptations to be part of it. In other words, most of the
    times it is not a clean-slate start when a city embarks itself into its smart
    transformation, thus, it is sensible to create a portfolio of “sensors”, “actuators”
    and “networks” that the city has. Secondly, it is not necessary that all the systems
    that encompass the city are equally smart (or even smart at all). Making all the
    city services smart at the same time is plainly non-sense. Gradual and cyclical
    infrastructure deployment is much more sensible. The infrastructure should be
    deployed according to the city priorities. Indeed, the procurement and physical
    deployment processes have a learning curve that is not negligible. 2.2.2 Multi-stakeholder
    Ecosystem Creation Cities are complex ecosystems participated by many actors with
    heterogeneous backgrounds, interests and/or expertise. Thus, while the main responsible
    and policy regulator is the city administration, the deployment of a smart city
    has to observe this multi-stakeholder nature of the city. Moreover, in general,
    cities’ challenges are analogous globally. Thus, the ecosystem created for one
    city should be reproducible in another widening even more the scope and multilateralism
    of potential stakeholders. In the creation of this multi-stakeholder ecosystem,
    the adoption of a Smart City Platform (cf. Fig. 3) is fundamental. It should leverage
    interoperability technologies to aggregate the underlying heterogeneous infrastructure
    and enable service and application development independently of the information
    providers and the technologies that they use. Fig. 3 Smart City multi-stakeholder
    platform deployed at Santander Full size image The existing utilities and municipality
    infrastructures provide a first abstraction level in terms of resource management
    and data handling. Making use of IoT technologies [6], advantage is taken from
    the pervasive presence around the city of information sources and actuators belonging
    to the utilities. These elements interact with each other and cooperate with their
    neighbours to reach common goals. In this sense, by generating virtual instances
    of real physical objects, it is possible to deploy services and applications,
    characterized by a high degree of autonomous data capture, event transfer, network
    connectivity and interoperability [7]. However, they are mainly vertical systems
    that are exclusively tailored to the city service they are supporting. Hence,
    it is necessary to provide adequate mechanisms for added-value services creation
    and execution. In the city utilities application domain, this should enable new
    business opportunities for 3rd parties that can reuse available city assets and
    existing services to create new ones with added value and thus generate new forms
    of revenue. The later requires changing data sharing policies and making data
    generated seamlessly available to 3rd parties. To facilitate such development
    and deployment, an open API [8] framework is included in the envisioned ecosystem
    as one of its integral parts of our architecture. On top of this abstraction level,
    a service information model (described through a service catalogue) is provided
    to allow extending the traditional utility use cases towards new business scenarios.
    Different services can be combined through the service federation concept either
    by service re-use (by sticking to modular service development practices) or through
    creation of service mash-up resulting in relevant savings in terms of the Capital
    Expenditure (CAPEX) and Operation Expenditure (OPEX). Further on, the service
    framework can be supported over cloud-enabled technologies thus allowing assignment
    of resources in an elastic way, driven by demand, meeting Service Level Agreements
    (SLAs) and providing flexibility in the business requirements (e.g. the end user
    only pays for actual use or ICT resources). 2.2.3 Open Ecosystem Openness have
    been addressed on two main axes that are critical for the success of the deployment
    of smart city solutions with a global scope in mind. Firstly, standardization
    is crucial in the sense of breaking vendor lock-in as well as city lock-in. The
    first lock-in situation avoidance refers to the need for usable standards and
    an interoperable vendor ecosystem for IoT-enabled smart city solutions so that
    cities do not have to commit to a specific solution so there are no dependencies
    on a single vendor. The latter one refers to the necessity of APIs for accessing
    streamed data from IoT infrastructures that homogenize the availability of data
    sources and underlying data formats. This way developers and providers of IoT-based
    smart city services can deploy and operate a service, which has been initially
    developed for one city, to another, thus getting benefit from the opportunities
    that come from economies of scale. Secondly, open APIs are equally important to
    guarantee that no lock-in situation is produced. FIWARE [9] is a large ecosystem
    providing standardized APIs used in open-source implementations of generic enablers
    based on open specifications. FIWARE is now at the centre of the Open and Agile
    Smart Cities (OASC) initiative [10]. oneM2M [11], on the other hand, provides
    a global standard for IoT common service functionalities that are used by the
    emerging IoT services and products. oneM2M and FIWARE are two powerful existing
    ecosystems that are worth the effort to make them interoperable [12]. Indeed,
    in Santander this interoperability has been granted and it is possible, nowadays,
    to develop applications [13] that can transparently consume data from platforms
    that use any of this technologies as baseline. 3 Future Challenges Despite the
    advances in the implementation and deployment of novel technologies towards the
    realization of the smart city paradigm, globally, and in the city of Santander
    in particular, this is not a completed endeavour. Surely, the current scenario
    has addressed some of the original objectives, but it has become evident that
    there are large possibilities of enhancement for creating smarter cities. Figure
    4 summarizes the high-level framework to address the foreseen challenges and the
    establishment of novel business models based on the valuable data-streams that
    emanate from a full-blown smart city. The framework identifies the main tiers
    in which IoT-based smart city platforms are typically structured, namely IoT Infrastructure,
    IoT and Data Management and Data Marketplace. For each of these levels, key challenges
    and enabling technologies have been highlighted. Fig. 4 Smart City challenges
    high-level framework Full size image At the bottom layer, the IoT Infrastructure
    will be characterized by the heterogeneous communication technologies that will
    be available for best fitting the plethora of application domains. Additionally,
    muti-tenancy must be supported as the IoT deployments will come from both public
    and private domains and they should be handled under a common framework. Finally,
    distribution of infrastructure and intelligence is the only option to manage the
    complexity at this bottom layer. The second tier deals with the infrastructure
    management and more importantly with the data organization. On the one hand, it
    is of utmost importance that the underlying infrastructure is kept in good working
    order and guaranteeing this is not trivial considering its dimension and composition.
    On the other, the data produced has to be homogenized and its quality also guaranteed
    in order to make it easy and valuable to consume. Finally, the top layer handles
    the interaction with the services and applications that are based on the context
    information retrieved. The creation and maintenance of a data marketplace where
    data is organized in straightforwardly accessible offerings whose provenance and
    quality are systematically registered and guaranteed. Additionally, it has to
    provide the mechanisms to enable value exchanges among data providers and data
    consumers. These mechanisms have to be flexible enough to facilitate the adoption
    of different business models. Some of the challenges and development paths to
    implement this framework are depicted in the following sub-sections. 3.1 Adoption
    of Common APIs and Common Data Models Worldwide cities are involved in a digital
    revolution that will transform the way in which existing and new city systems
    are operated. However, optimizing the behaviour of any specific urban service
    has to be carried out taking into consideration the service itself as well as
    its interaction with adjacent services. This means that any solution aiming at
    achieving the autonomous city management paradigm is tightly coupled with the
    adoption of common frameworks, among in-city systems, which are able to guarantee
    systems interoperability. Furthermore, cities themselves are not isolated systems.
    They will interact one to the each other depending on different attributes. This
    implies that, eventually, optimizing some processes in one city without having
    in mind the adjacency to the others might result in inefficiencies [14]. Hence,
    interoperability among inter-city systems will become necessary. Not just in terms
    of pure optimization but also in terms of replicability. Moreover, it is necessary
    to highlight the multitude of actors that participate in the smart city services
    provision. This leads to heterogeneous service models and underlying infrastructure.
    In order to maximize the efficiency, exportability and horizontality of the cities
    digitalization, it is of utmost importance that the access to the data supporting
    the city services is homogenized, not only from a procedural viewpoint, but also
    from a syntactic and even semantic perspective. Standardization initiatives [15]
    as well as front-runner actors in the smart city ecosystem [9] are working on
    setting common APIs and data models that shall enable the necessary grounds for
    seamless data exchanges among data producers and data consumers. 3.2 Data, Network
    and Communications Reliability The next generation of communication networks and
    services, so-called 5G, will not only be an evolution of mobile broadband networks
    but it will also bring new unique network and service capabilities. Specifically,
    5G will be a key enabler for the Internet of Things by providing a platform to
    connect a massive number of sensors, rendering devices and actuators with stringent
    energy and transmission constraints. However, it is still open how to model these
    scenarios (mainly at the access network level), and which technologies (or combination
    of them) will be part of the future communication systems. 3.3 Data Marketplace
    In order to exploit data, the platform is required to provide data providers with
    means to decide and enforce how and with whom data is shared. In this sense, the
    data market place has to let data providers to define access policies based on
    both the particular data assets and the data consumer. In addition, considering
    the growing importance of data, such marketplace needs also to provide charging
    mechanisms, so that the data assets can be monetized. In this respect, pricing
    models are needed to assign cost to data assets. An appealing starting point can
    be the Black-Sholes model [16] used for options pricing modelling. Along with
    the different possibilities of sharing data, it is also necessary to provide different
    licensing levels and means for the data provider to ensure that a particular data
    asset is exploited under the negotiated conditions. Finally, it would be also
    desirable that the platform brings mechanisms to provide feedback concerning data
    quality, in order to implement reputation raking that can be afterwards exploited
    to better define the data sharing policies. 3.4 Opportunities Creation The vision
    of smart cities has been shaped, for long, by sales pitches of larger technology
    vendor and system integrators. Early “smart city 1.0” examples such as Masdar
    or Songdo have been technology- or marketing- driven rather than addressing typical
    operational and citizen needs. Other services often take the perspective of the
    city authorities, which is in many cases different from the one of the citizen.
    While there are significant cultural differences globally, from a European perspective,
    there is a lack of citizen voice in the current debate about IoT instrumentation.
    If smart city services are to make a real difference to citizens, and be accepted
    by the public, then citizens must play a strong role in their creation and design.
    Moreover, the smart city has to be promoted as a scenario where new business models
    are created around the exchange of data and the services that arise from this
    sharing. For example, cities are becoming the playground for the sharing economy
    [17]. The concentration of economic activity and ubiquity of technology in cities
    facilitate the rapid, location-based exchange of services and products among citizens
    (P2P), among businesses (B2B), and businesses to the crowd. Novel business concepts
    like the Commons Collaborative Economy [18] characterized by using data as the
    new key good for trading in the newly created digital marketplaces shall be able
    to: 1. Favour peer-to-peer relations -in contrast to the traditionally hierarchical
    command and contractual relationships. 2. Settle new value distribution and governance
    among the community of peers where profitability is not its main/unique driving
    force. 3. Leverage privacy-aware public infrastructure that results in the (generally)
    open access provision of commons resources that favour access, reproducibility
    and derivativeness. 3.5 Blockchain Technologies and its Impact on the Smart City
    Paradigm The first wave of smart city services have been predominantly developed
    around open data. Such data is in most cases shared if not considered sensitive,
    and the success of services developed on top is often only modest. Proprietary
    data sets such as IoT-generated data, closed organisational data or personal data
    have the potential to offer higher value for richer smart city services, but are
    not released for exploitation or not readily available. There is a lack of incentives,
    market confidence and trust for organisations and individuals to share new data
    sets as licensing models are not yet properly understood and developed, and key
    ecosystem foundation for such a market place are still missing. It is necessary
    to develop a security-by-design approach increasing the transparency of all the
    IoT asset governance flow shifting from the current paradigm of discrete centralized
    trusted authorities to a paradigm of liquid and decentralized trust of the network
    as a whole. In this shift, the creation of Blockchain platforms that can be employed
    following the “as a Service” paradigm will enable fully decentralised solutions
    delivering certified mechanisms to support the management of IoT devices, during
    their whole lifecycle. Blockchain-based distributed ledger concept offers provenance
    and quality of data guarantee, as well as reputation mechanisms for qualification
    of assets shared in a participatory fashion. The shifting from the current paradigm
    of discrete centralized trusted authorities to a paradigm of decentralized trust
    of the web as a whole responds to the consumers’ needs and to the providers’ demands.
    The first because they require reassurance of the data’s quality. The latter because
    they are reluctant to share some datasets due to uncertainty of how and for what
    purposes the data is used. 4 Conclusions Worldwide cities are involved in a digital
    transformation focused on sustainability and improving citizen’s quality of life.
    This digital transformation will make a reality the paradigm of an autonomous
    city meaning that relying on the massive amount of data as well as the appropriate
    machinery the city management platform will be able to run it near to the optimal
    operating point predicting any unexpected event making daily citizen''s life easier.
    While this paradigm of sustainability and efficiency has been always present for
    city administrators, digital transformation is opening new opportunities besides
    the optimization of the urban services that have been traditionally offer to its
    citizens (mobility, lighting, water distribution, waste management, etc.). Among
    these new opportunities, there is one, co-creation, with a large transformative
    potential from the economic and social viewpoint. Co-creation paradigm stands
    for the participatory creation of solutions and services among multiple stakeholders.
    In order to enable this scenario, cities have to set up a platform equipped with
    a set of highly intuitive tools and enablers that allow the design and implementation
    of novel services and, why not, so-called killer applications. For the platform
    to be valuable, it has to be fed by as many city assets, and the information that
    they generate, as possible. Moreover, it is of utmost importance to scale up the
    concept and federate such platform with other cities so that the creative process
    can be enriched and its impact enlarged. Another crucial aspect that has been
    highlighted is the need to include enablers associated to the incentives and rewards
    of participating, not only during the trial phases but also considering the long-term
    sustainability of the whole platform and smart city ecosystem. In this paper,
    we have reviewed the status of the SmartSantander ecosystem and the key features
    and lessons learnt through its evolution from a testbed for IoT experimentation
    to an open platform for co-creative innovation that is federated with other front-runner
    cities towards unleashing the potential of smart cities as social innovation hubs.
    Additionally, the challenges that have to be addressed in the short and medium
    term have been sketched. The path defined by these challenges is meant to establish
    a new economic model around the cities, bound to innovative exploitation of data
    exposed in a digital single market. References Balaji, S., Nathani, K., & Santhakumar,

    of agricultural process. • Agricultural process involves crop production as well
    as food supply chain. • Optimizing crop production requires real time monitoring
    of agricultural fields and yields. • Reducing intermediaries in the food supply
    chain increases farmers profit. • User-centric Internet of Things is a key enabler
    for realizing Smart Agriculture. Abstract Recent advancement in the technology
    has paved the way for the optimization of traditional industrial practices. Agriculture
    sector continues to serve as the backbone of the global economy. Moreover, it
    is required to cater the ever increasing demand for the food products arising
    due to rapid growth of global population. This urges for the modernization of
    traditional agricultural methodologies. Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential
    to become the key enabler for realizing the vision of Smart Agriculture. This
    paper proposes a user-centric IoT architecture for addressing the various issues
    faced in the agricultural domain. The proposed system allows the farmers to monitor
    their agricultural fields in real time and receive recommendations for producing
    good quality crops. The proposed architecture also optimizes the food supply chain
    in a manner that allows the farmers to maximize their overall profit on the sold
    goods. The applicability of the proposed architecture is evaluated using multiple
    uses cases encompassing the different aspects of the agriculture process. The
    paper also proposes a novel framework for smartphones that would facilitate the
    software engineers to develop applications required for implementing various functionality
    of the proposed system. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    1. Introduction Agriculture is one of the most important sector round the globe.
    In developing nations like India, agriculture contributes to about 15% of the
    GDP and is a vital source of the Indian Economy [1]. Few other countries that
    depends highly on agriculture for their GDP are Sierra Leone (60%), Chad (49.1%),
    Central African Republic (39.6%), etc. [52]. The World Bank data clearly depicts
    that more than one-fourth of the total employment at the global level relies on
    the agriculture sector [53]. The significance of the agriculture sector in terms
    of employment is more in the developing countries like India where approximately
    two-third of the population rely on agriculture for their income source. It is
    responsible for creating more than 50% of employment either directly or indirectly
    [1]. As per the prediction of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United
    Nation (FAO), the population of the world is expected to reach 8 billion by 2025
    and 9.6 billion by 2050 [2]. This is a clear indicator of the increase in the
    requirement of food production by 2050 at the global level. It is also required
    that the food products should be of high quality. This urges for the industrialization
    of the agricultural sector and employment of advanced technology for modernizing
    the agricultural process. The agricultural process comprises of multiple sub processes
    ranging from the production of crops to the delivery of the end products to the
    consumers. Several works in the existing literature have addressed the issues
    prevalent in the current agricultural practices. For instance, one of the key
    requirements for producing healthy crops is that of apt and timely supply of nutritional
    and water content in the agricultural fields [109]. This has been made possible
    through the real-time monitoring ability of the solutions equipped with sensors
    and actuators. The sensors are deployed in the agricultural fields where they
    continuously sense the environmental and soil conditions and transmit this information
    to the intelligent softwares residing either on the cloud or at the local level.
    These softwares are responsible for taking suitable decisions and controlling
    actuators like sprinklers, etc. so that the field conditions can be maintained
    in an automated fashion. Table 1 highlights the technology adoption scenario in
    the agriculture sector by some of the countries. Table 1. Technology Adoption
    Scenario in Agriculture. Region Technology Adoption Scenario Reference Argentina
    • Increasing employment of yield monitors, global positioning system (GPS) and
    satellite data. • Ranks second country with respect to the usage of yield monitors
    and fifth in terms of yield monitor density. [54,55] Australia • Employs GPS guidance
    for spraying or sowing of broad acre crops. • Increasing use of yield monitors.
    • Wide scale application of automatic guidance technology by the grain growing
    farmers • Approximately 20% increase in the technology adoption rate post 2008.
    [54,[56], [57], [58]] Brazil • Large scale adoption of Precision Agriculture by
    domestic (58%) and foreign (38%) sugar and ethanol firms. • Preferred technologies
    are GPS guidance with auto and manual control, satellite imaging, yield maps,
    variable rate fertilizing and liming, and georeferenced soil sampling. [[59],
    [60], [61]] Canada • 98% of surveyed farmers used GPS guidance, 84% at least one
    PA technology, 84% had combine with yield monitoring capability, 73% used auto
    section control, 75% intend to use more PA in the future [62] China • Tractor
    auto guidance was the most accepted technology and about 25% of the farmland was
    managed using PA [63] Europe • Fertilizing and spraying machines are equipped
    with PA technologies and smart or ISO-Bus enabled equipment. • Ratio of farms
    using GPS increased from 14% to 22%, soil mapping from 14% to 20%, variable rate
    application from 13% to 16% and yield mapping from 7% to 11% in 2009 compared
    to 2012. • Between 6.6% and 11.0% of surveyed farmers used PA mainly for data
    collection techniques such as GPS-based area measurement and soil sampling • Nitrogen
    sensors are used in about 20% of wheat fields primarily for nitrogen fertilizer
    application • Around 60% of UK farmers already use some sort of precision agriculture
    on their farms, although for the most part this simply means using GPS tractor
    steering [[64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69]] Japan • In rice farming, ground
    vehicles spray about 22% (in 2014) and the proportion of large-scale UAV plant
    protection has reached 36%. [70] South Africa • The number of yield monitors increased
    to more than 600, variable rate lime applications to 244, manual guidance systems
    to 200, and auto guidance to 60. [54,71] Turkey • About 310 combine harvesters
    are equipped with yield monitors. About 110 automatic steering systems and 25
    steering assistance systems were sold to the farmers. Number of variable rate
    applicators is less than 20. • GNSS-based auto guidance systems in Adana province.
    [[72], [73], [74], [75]] United States • Three most popular technologies were
    GPS guidance with auto control / auto steer (83%), GPS-enabled sprayer section
    control (74%) and GPS guidance with manual control (63%); 82% of the dealers offered
    PA services. • About 25% of peanut farms adopted GPS soil mapping and over 40%
    used auto steering; variable rate fertilizing had a higher adoption rate in peanut
    production at over 20% of farms than for many other crops. • In the 2005 survey,
    23% of cotton producers used GPS guidance as in 2013 survey, about 31% adopted
    auto section control and 59% auto guidance systems. • Until 2000s, adoption of
    different PA technologies varied up to 22% across major field crops. Tractor guidance
    grew faster than variable-rate application for all major field crops over the
    last 10 years. [[76], [77], [78]] Another key process in the agricultural domain
    is the selling off the grown products in the market. This is widely known as the
    food supply chain and involves a number of entities that act as intermediaries
    between the farmer and the final consumer. These intermediaries are responsible
    for about 75% of the total net margin accruing to the entire supply chain [1].
    Fig. 1 depicts a general food supply chain scenario. The complete process can
    be subdivided into a number of transactions. Farmers receive seeds and fertilizers
    from the suppliers required for the production of crops. The agro products produced
    by the farmers need to be sold in the market. The farmers have the choice of selling
    the food products either directly in the market designated as distribution centres
    or they can dispose of their produce to a local trader. The local traders act
    as the aggregators of the fresh food products acquired from different farmers.
    They arrange for all the necessary transportation vehicles and sell the aggregated
    food products at the distribution centres. The retailers procure these food products
    from the distribution centres and sell them to the end consumers. A study performed
    by Sidhu et al. in [35] deduced that farmers sell more than 90% of the grown crops
    to the local traders or the distribution centres while a small portion is sold
    to the retailers and consumers directly. Download : Download high-res image (291KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Food Supply Chain Scenario. The food
    supply chain has a number of shortcomings from the farmers’ point of view. As
    most of the farmers do not have sufficient resources for the storage and transportation
    of the produced crops, they tend to sell them to the local traders at a very low
    margin. Moreover, the farmers usually do not sell their crops directly in the
    market at the distribution centres. This can also be attributed to the fact that
    the rates at the distribution centres are not standardized and these farmers can
    be cheated and may be forced to sell their products at low cost. However, if the
    products are sold as per the favorable marketing condition, the farmers are expected
    to get a high return for their products. The work done in this paper is an attempt
    to minimize the various difficulties faced by the farmers in the agricultural
    sectors. This work proposes a user-centric Internet of Things (IoT) based architecture
    for facilitating the farmers to make use of the advanced technology for improving
    their crop production and increasing their profits in selling the products. IoT
    refers to a network of interconnected heterogeneous smart devices for delivering
    value added services to the society. The term “Internet of Things” was initially
    coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in the context of supply chain management. IoT
    ecosystem encompasses a wide variety of uniquely identifiable devices communicating
    using standard protocols and delivering value added services to the users [3].
    The contemporary applications of these IoT networks include a variety of domains,
    ranging from personalized applications like smart home, smart meeting room, etc.
    at one end to services such as smart healthcare, intelligent transportation, precision
    agriculture, etc., at the other end [4,5]. This rapid growth and adoption of the
    IoT technology is clearly visible in the Gartner estimates, which states that
    there will be nearly 26 billion devices on the IoT by 2020 [6]. IoT has been proved
    to be a vital component for implementing dynamic workflow adaptions [7,8]. The
    dynamic nature of the agricultural sector makes IoT the most suitable enabling
    technology for addressing various challenges prevalent in the current agricultural
    practices [[110], [111], [112],114,116]. The use of sensors in conjunction with
    the intelligent algorithms can provide smart recommendations to the farmers regarding
    the maintenance of the field quality in order to have high quality crops [9,108,113].
    Moreover, apart from the data generated by the IoT devices, user generated data
    can be a key player in transforming the traditional food supply chain to be more
    farmer friendly [115,117]. This can be realized from the fact, that if market
    rates along with the demand are made available to the farmer in real-time, he
    can make apt decision regarding the selling of the food products. This will save
    the time and effort of the farmer which would otherwise be invested in visiting
    different markets in person. This will also benefit the farmers in terms of profit
    by recommending the most favorable market for his products. The work proposed
    in this paper provides a base architecture for facilitating the incorporation
    of social dimension to the IoT based solutions for agriculture. The proposed work
    further proposes a conceptual framework for smart devices that can be used for
    leveraging the social aspects of the humans. The focal point of most of the existing
    works in the literature is limited to only certain aspects of the agricultural
    process. They either focus upon the real-time monitoring of the fields and crops
    along with the provision of providing quality control methods or they attempt
    to optimize the food supply chain component of the agricultural process. The work
    proposed in this paper, however, considers the agricultural process as a conglomerate
    of field and crop monitoring, food supply chain, transportations and logistics
    as well as optimized service recommendations. This research also in line with
    the previous works that suggest for a comprehensive conceptualization of spanning
    sustainability, perceived value and knowledge creation [79] in contrast to conceptualization
    of the perceived value as an indicator of only overall products benefits and value
    for money [80,81]. The proposed work also provides a conceptual framework for
    smart devices that can be utilized by the application developers for building
    socially aware IoT based solutions. Multiple use-case descriptions have been provided
    for demonstrating the applicability and efficiency of the proposed work. The employment
    of intelligent methodologies for optimized service recommendations in the proposed
    architecture shall, further, guide to researchers to develop more smart algorithms
    relevant to the agricultural domain. The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
    Section 2 provides the highlights of the related works present in the existing
    literature; Section 3 discusses the proposed work in detail outlining the analogy
    between the proposed architecture and the IoT ecosystem and providing a detailed
    description of the proposed system; Section 4 presents few uses cases encompassing
    the different aspects of the agricultural process; and finally, Section 5; concludes
    the paper and provides research directions to further improve the work proposed
    in this paper. 2. Related works The employment of technologies in the agriculture
    practices has been attributed to the Green Revolution in Mexico in the 1940s that
    catalyzed the increased use of high-yielding crop cultivars and inputs such as
    fertilizer and irrigation for meeting the rising demands of food [82]. There exists
    multitude of works in the literature that attempt to identify the potential factors
    of affecting the technology adoption in agriculture [[83], [84], [85], [86], [87],
    [88], [89]]. The identified factors can be summarized as: farm size, land tenure
    arrangements, access to credit and extension services, land and labour availability,
    human capital (education, gender, demographics), and farmer attitude towards risks
    and uncertainty. Results of few empirical studies [90,91] underscore the potential
    of improved agricultural technologies in enhancing productivity, income, and overall
    economic growth. The advancement in the sensing technology coupled with the reduction
    in the size of the devices as well as their cost can be considered as the most
    significant enablers of precision and micro-precision agriculture [10]. Several
    researchers have proposed different types of IoT based solutions to address the
    issues in the existing agricultural practice [11]. The ability to sense and analyze
    the production environment is critical for making precise decisions in order to
    optimize the agricultural practices so as to enhance the cultivars’ quality [12,108].
    The application of WSN techniques in the farming domain is proposed in [92]. The
    authors present a comprehensive study regarding the applicability of WSN in agriculture
    along with the various associated challenges. The authors in [13] proposed a fault
    tolerant and energy efficient WSN architecture for real time monitoring of the
    agricultural field conditions and for enhancing the crop quality and yield. The
    authors in [93] propose the employment of Photosynthetically Active Radiation
    (PAR) sensors fo non-destructive in-situ Leaf Area Index (LAI) assessment. Multiple
    researchers have proposed intelligent systems for greenhouse environment monitoring
    to reduce farming cost and energy consumptions [[14], [15], [16]]. Their proposed
    architectures encompassed wireless based remote intelligence for greenhouse control
    as an alternative to the traditional wired infrastructure. The authors in [15,17]
    proposed WSN based automated irrigation systems. The crux of their works is to
    determine the apt frequency and time of watering the fields depending upon the
    soil moisture conditions. This ensures efficient use of water and high quality
    crops. In order to address the energy consumption issue in the deployed systems,
    the low power Zigbee protocol is employed for communication. The applicability
    of the IoT concepts for controlled environment agriculture has also been explored
    in several works such as [[18], [19], [20], [21], [22]]. The authors in [94] proposed
    a framework for remotely monitoring the crops using wireless and internet communication.
    The main aim of their work is to emphasize upon the advantages of cultivating
    plants in a greenhouse instead of open fields. Several IoT based commercial platforms
    have been developed with the vision of modernizing and enhancing the effectiveness
    of farming process. These platforms have been summarized in Table 2. Table 2.

    activities and crops health status The IoT based solutions rely upon the data
    obtained from the end nodes (sensors/actuators) which needs to be analyzed in
    real-time. Storing such data locally and then transmitting it to the remote servers
    for analysis involves appreciable amount of time and the analysis and actuations
    may be delayed. To overcome such issues the authors in [[23], [24], [25]] proposed
    the use of cloud based infrastructure for real-time analysis of the collected
    data in a reliable, faster and efficient manner. The use of cloud infrastructure
    also reduces the storage cost at the local level. The benefits of using cloud
    computing techniques in conjunction with IoT for agriculture process is presented
    in [95]. The authors in [96,97] highlights the significance of precision farming
    systems. The study of authors in [97] attempts to identify the adoption aspects
    of precision farming constrained to various factors and farmers demographics.
    The obtained results clearly indicate the potential of the identified factors
    in increasing the rate of precision agriculture adoption by the farmers. A system
    for online precise irrigation scheduling (OpIRIS) for greenhouses is proposed
    in [26]. The proposed system includes a web-based application that communicates
    with the sensors installed in the greenhouses. The web application embeds intelligence
    for predicting the water requirements of the crops and providing information to
    the farmers regarding the irrigation and further nutritional requirements. The
    author in [27] used RFID devices in conjunction with the IoT and cloud infrastructure
    for load balancing and distributing the resources dynamically. The obtained results
    demonstrates significant improvement in the efficient use of resources. Balducci
    et al. in [98] focused upon the management of heterogeneous data obtained from
    multiple sensory sources. Their study also presented the potential profitability
    aspects of logging and exploiting the continuously generated dataset for achieving
    subjective goals. The authors specify the use of Regression Models and Neural
    Networks for data handling and decision making. The use of smartphones for obtaining
    various types of agricultural information is proposed in [99]. The authors also
    proposed the demonstration of advanced agricultural techniques through videos
    in order to create awareness with respect to the adoption of Precision Agriculture.
    IoT technology has the potential to become a key player in realizing the food
    supply chain traceability systems. Various issues pertaining to the food supply
    chain and their resolution using IoT has been discussed extensively in existing
    literature [28,29]. The most commonly used IoT device in food supply chain is
    the RFID which are enhanced barcodes and can be used for tracing the tracking
    the agricultural logistics. The contemporary researches have employed multiple
    sensors to augment the product status information recorded through the RFID [30,31].
    Owing to the heterogeneity and distributed architecture of the IoT, naming has
    been considered as an important aspect for real-time tracking of the food supply
    logistics [32]. The authors in [100] presented a framework for highlighting the
    technological drivers of IoT. They further proposed a methodology that employs
    IoT for facilitating the farmers to deliver the crops directly to the nearby customers.
    Virtualizing the food supply chains using the IoT concepts eradicates the need
    of physical proximity [11]. The amalgamation of advanced hardware technology and
    intelligent software agents has contributed a lot in the development of automated
    food supply chain management systems [[33], [34], [35], [36], [37]]. 3. Proposed
    methodolgy This section presents a detailed description of the proposed solution.
    The complete solution has been discussed in two parts: (i) First, an analogy of
    the solution with respect to the IoT topology has been provided, and (ii) Second,
    a detailed description of the proposed framework for achieving the required functionality
    has been discussed. A summarized view of the involved entities and the communication
    between them is provided in the latter part of this section. 3.1. Analogy of the
    proposed solution with the IoT ecosystem The complete IoT ecosystem has been divided
    into three main components viz. (i) Perception Layer, (ii) Communication Layer,
    and (iii) Intelligence or Control Layer [38]. Fig. 2 shows an overview of the
    IoT ecosystem with respect to these layers. The components of the proposed solution
    comprising each of these layers have been discussed in detail in following sub-sections.

    Fig. 2. IoT Ecosystem – Layered Representation. 3.1.1. Perception layer The Perception
    Layer is mainly responsible for acquiring data from the environment with the help
    of sensors. However, information gathering in the IoT ecosystem cannot be restricted
    to only sensory data. Users are an indispensable entity of the IoT ecosystem and
    are a rich source of data generation. Such data may correspond to either textual
    or graphical posts on the social media or even sharing of information such as
    user’s location in an explicit or implicit manner. The concept of the perception
    layer, hence, can be further extended to the data acquisition from the users through
    their smart devices, such as smartphones, smartwatches, etc. This work classifies
    the data gathering mechanisms into two broad categories depending upon the data
    source: (i) sensory data; (ii) user data. This section discusses the various types
    of information that can be obtained through various entities of the IoT Ecosystem.
    3.1.1.1. Sensory data Data obtained using sensors is termed as sensory data. Sensors
    are tiny electro-mechanical devices and can be used for obtaining information
    regarding: • Field and Weather Conditions: The quality of the crops depends mainly
    upon the soil and the atmospheric conditions in which they are being cultivated.
    The knowledge about the soil nutrients, moisture content, density of weeds and
    other factors responsible for the production of crops can help in reducing the
    use of chemical products such as herbicides, pesticides and other pollutants thereby
    reducing the environmental impact and increasing the productivity. Such type of
    information can be obtained using appropriate sensors such as meteorological sensors,
    photometric sensors, water sensors, dendrometers, biological sensors, weed seekers,
    Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), optical cameras, photosynthesis sensors,
    soil respiration or moisture sensors, hygrometers, Leaf Area index (LAI) sensors,
    etc. [39]. Sensors are resource constrained and low power devices that collect
    data from the surroundings. Data collected by these sensors is transmitted to
    a local gateway or coordinator which in turn would forward the data to cloud or
    other data centers for analysis and other services that need to be provided. •
    Logistics tracing and tracking: Another important aspect that can be addressed
    using sensors is that of logistics tracing and tracking. Logistics refer to the
    commercial activity of transporting goods to the customer and is a vital component
    of the food supply chain. The traceability of logistics is classified into three
    main categories: viz. linear, centralized and distributed [40,41]. The linear
    approach involves the sharing of the traceability data among the partners involved
    in the logistics transportation process. Every user involved in the supply chain
    captures the traceability information of the immediate buyer and supplier for
    each product. European General Food Law identifies this process as the “one step
    forward and one step back” principle [42]. The centralized approach for logistics
    tracing involves the use of shared databases for storing the traceability data.
    The national bovine animal registration systems in Europe [42] follows this centralized
    approach. The distributed approach requires the involved users to exchange the
    traceability data throughout the network of interconnected individual traceability
    systems. Information regarding the transport of raw materials from suppliers to
    the farmers, crops and pre-processed food items from farming fields to distribution
    centres and to the customer can be made available using the technology offered
    by the IoT paradigm. The “Electronic Product Code Information Services” (EPCIS)
    standard is used extensively in the food supply chain for implementing the distributed
    traceability systems [40,41,[43], [44], [45]]. The tracking systems based on EPCIS
    record the events of supply chain network and store them in either single or multiple
    repositories. These events can be retrieved upon requirement based on appropriate
    security policy [41,46]. The contents of these events comprise of product identity,
    the reason and the location of occurrence along with the timestamp. Such events
    are usually generated using AutoID technologies, such as RFID, bar codes, Optical
    Character Recognition (OCR), smart cards, etc. [47]. The architecture of the proposed
    solution employs a distributed approach for tracing and tracking mechanism. Vehicles
    used for transportation or the transported goods themselves may carry RFID and
    other devices for providing real-time information regarding the logistics. Tracing
    the logistics through user shared information is another aspect of the proposed
    system. 3.1.1.2. User data Users are an important component of the IoT ecosystem.
    Apart from the sensors, users themselves are an important source of information
    that can be utilized to enhance the quality of service being provided by the IoT
    based solution. These users have their social circles (professional and personal)
    that can be leveraged for efficient delivery of services. The addition of this
    social dimension to the IoT ecosystem allows for collaborative sharing of user
    data. The proposed system comprises of five major entities namely: (i) Supplier,
    (ii) Farmer, (iii) Transporter, (iv) Distribution Centres, and (v) Consumers.
    Information shared by each of these entities can be utilized to provide them with
    value added services using the proposed solution. • Information sharing by suppliers:
    The food supply chain initiates with the suppliers providing the necessary materials
    (fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, etc.) required by the farmers for growing crops.
    The suppliers can, as such, share information regarding the type of the products
    they are selling along with their estimated costs. This would help the farmers
    in identifying the suitable supplier for their requirements in less time. Moreover,
    even if the suppliers do not wish share the quotes publicly for the materials
    being sold, they may share their contact details which would help the farmers
    to connect with them for their enquiries in minimum time. • Information sharing
    by farmers: The type and quantity of the produced crop can be shared by the farmers
    so that intelligent recommendations may be shown to the consumers as per their
    requirements (discussed in Section 3.1.3). The availability of data such as field
    size along with the other sensory data corresponding to the field quality can
    be utilized for providing predictions regarding the types of the crops that can
    be sown and other measures required for ensuring the quality of the crops being
    produced. • Information sharing by consumers/distribution centres: Distribution
    centres and consumers may share their demands in terms of required quantity of
    the products, location of delivery, delivery deadlines, etc. Real-time availability
    of such information would benefit the farmers in deciding the distribution centre
    and consumer to whom they may sell their products. The consumers can share their
    contact details so that in case the farmer is capable of supplying the required
    goods may contact directly to the consumer, thereby eliminating the need of the
    intermediaries and getting apt prices for their products. • Information sharing
    by transporters: Transporters are indispensable part of the food supply chain
    as they are responsible for carrying the required products to the destination.
    Transportation incurs significant cost and as a result, adds to the final cost
    of the product being sold. Further, the availability of the transporters offering
    logistic services is in abundance and the rates charged by them vary among different
    transporters. Hence, it is required that the farmers or the shipment consignee
    must survey multiple transporter before selecting any. Manual survey in such cases
    becomes infeasible as it requires a lot of time and effort. As an alternative,
    the transporters can share the information regarding the services they are offering
    along with the rates being charged through electronic means so as to facilitate
    the farmers in selecting the best choice. • Location information: The information
    shared by all the user entities must be augmented with the location information
    for uninterrupted services. For instance: data shared by the farmers should include
    the location of the site/field from where the goods need to be picked. Similarly,
    consumer should provide the location of the site where the goods need to be delivered.
    Moreover, the locations of different distribution centres can help the farmers
    to decide where to sell their goods considering the distance of the distribution
    centre, cost incurred in transportation, demand quantity of goods and the rates
    being provided. Such location information can be manually shared by the concerned
    entities or can be obtained using GPS of their smart phones. Table 3 summarizes
    the various types of information obtained by the perception layer along with their
    source. Table 3. Information obtained in Perception Layer. Information Type Source

    service 3.1.2. Communication layer This layer is mainly responsible for transmitting
    the data in the IoT network and mainly deals with the protocols that need to be
    employed for local as well as global communication. The proposed solution classifies
    the communication layer into (i) Physical Communication layer, and (ii) Virtual
    Communication sub-layer. The role and responsibilities of these sublayers are
    discussed further in this section. 3.1.2.1. Physical communication sub-layer This
    sub-layer is concerned with the underlying protocols required to transmit the
    data from various sources across the IoT network. As discussed in Section 3.1.1,
    data obtained in perception layer comprises of sensory data and user data. User
    data can be shared using smartphones that are rich in computational power and
    energy and hence legacy protocols for the wireless networks can be employed for
    transmitting such type of data. The application layer data can be shared using
    suitable protocols such as REST, HTTP, etc. Sensors, in contrast, are resource
    constrained and low power devices. Protocols such as Zigbee, Bluetooth Low Energy,
    etc. that have been designed for such devices operating in a Personal Area Network
    (PAN) can be used for sharing data generated by these devices. Table 4 presents
    a highlight of the protocols for IoT based communication. Table 4. Protocols for

    devices; (i) Reduced Functional Device (RFD), and (ii) Fully Functional Device
    (FFD) [48]. RFDs are the end devices comprising of sensors/actuators while FFDs
    can play the role of Coordinator that is responsible for starting and managing
    the personal area network. FFDs may also be used as routers to extend the range
    of the personal area networks. Data collected by the end devices are sent to the
    coordinator via a router. The coordinator further transmits the data to a gateway
    device that is responsible for computation, analysis and further transmission
    of the data to the cloud. Computation and data analysis can be performed at a
    local level (Coordinator/Gateway) or at remote site or cloud. Fig. 3 represents
    the communication topology of the proposed solution. Download : Download high-res

    for the Proposed Architecture. 3.1.2.2. Virtual communication sub-layer The virtual
    communication sub-layer acts as an overlay network superimposed over the physical
    network. This implies that even though the users may think that they are directly
    connected to a remote user (virtual connection), however, in practice the communication
    between these two users may involve multiple routers, switches and other network
    components. The virtual connection between the different entities involved in
    the proposed system is shown in Fig. 4. For simplicity, the figure omits the networking
    details and focusses mainly upon the communicating entities. Download : Download

    between the IoT entities. Data from the sensors can be processed locally at the
    gateway or remotely at the cloud or remote data centres. This data is required
    to provide intelligent services and notifications to the users. Information shared
    by the suppliers is stored on the cloud and is used for recommending the most
    suitable supplier to farmers depending upon their requirements. Similarly, depending
    upon the customer demands or distribution centres requirements and quotes, intelligent
    notifications and recommendation services can be provided to the farmers. The
    location information of the customers and distribution centres can be used to
    provide suggestions regarding the shortest route available to them. These services
    have been discussed in detail in Section 4. 3.1.3. Intelligence layer This is
    the most vital layer and is responsible for providing intelligent services to
    the users based upon the data acquired in the Perception Layer and transmitted
    in the Communication Layer. Intelligence capability can be embedded at local or
    global level. The proposed solution is capable of delivering a number of intelligent
    services to the users in the context of agriculture and food supply chain. The
    services provided by the proposed architecture has been discussed below: • Crop
    Prediction: Data regarding the quality of the farming fields such assoil nutrients,
    moisture content, density of weeds, etc. along with the weather conditions is
    used for predicting the type of the crops that can be sown. Prediction can be
    further enhanced by incorporating the details of the requirements of the market.
    For instance, if the demand for a particular type of food product is high and
    if the agricultural fields has the potential to grow good quality of the required
    product, the predictions can recommend that particular product to the farmer with
    high priority. Further, real-time data regarding the status of crops can be utilized
    to develop predictions regarding the time of harvesting as well. • Real-time monitoring
    of agricultural fields: Sensors fixed at predefined locations at the fields, unmanned
    arial vehicles UAVs such drones mounted with sensors or even sensor mounted vehicles
    are capable of providing the real time information about the field conditions.
    For instance, flame sensors can be placed to issue warning message to the farmers
    if fire is detected. An accompanying mounted camera can also click a picture of
    the situation when fire was detected. The warning messages should be sent to the
    smartphones of the farmers so that the necessary measures can be taken to avoid
    the impact of the adverse conditions. Farmers can also receive the real-time data
    about the conditions of their crops and agricultural fields so as to prevent unwanted
    pests hampering the quality of the crops. • Intelligent Recommendation Services:
    These services refer to the intelligent recommendations as per the requirements
    of the user. For instance, data shared by the suppliers can be used to recommend
    the most apt choice to the farmer as per their requirements. Similarly, manually
    visiting the distribution centres is not feasible for the farmers due to a number
    of reasons. One of the prominent being non-standardized rates of the goods offered
    by the distribution centres. Farmers are usually unware of the rates fixed for
    each type of the crops and as such there is a chance that the farmer gets cheated
    by the people at distribution centre. Moreover, different distribution centres
    provide different rates for the same product. Another important factor that prevents
    the farmers from visiting different distribution centres is their distance. Farmers,
    usually, reside in rural areas while the distribution centres are in the cities.
    Manually visiting each distribution centres would require considerable amount
    of time, effort and money. Hence, online availability of such information would
    facilitate the farmers to select the most appropriate distribution centre for
    selling their good. The use of intelligent algorithms that consider factors such
    as demand, cost, distance, etc., to suggest the most suitable choice to the users
    further helps in saving the decision-making efforts of the farmers. The end consumers
    can also be provided with appropriate recommendations for procuring the goods
    directly from the farmers. Depending upon the required quantity and type of the
    products by the consumer, algorithms can be employed to mine and filter suitable
    farmers that are willing to sell their goods. This is made possible due to the
    information shared by the farmers about their crops and locations. Upon selecting
    a suitable choice the consumer can directly contact the farmer using the contact
    details provided by them. • Shortest Route Prediction: Considering that the location
    of the destination is available different mechanisms can be employed to suggest
    the shortest route to users for delivering the goods. Such mechanism may include
    use of web APIs such as Google Maps [49], Distance Calculator [50], GeoDataSource
    [51] and others. • Logistics Tracing and Tracking: Tracing and tracking services
    for the transported goods is an essential mechanism. Vehicles and goods equipped
    with RFID sensors can provide real time location information. This information
    is made available to the dispatcher and other stakeholders on demand. The proposed
    solution also provides the mechanism for implicit sharing of location using smartphones
    or other GPS embedded devices mounted on the goods or vehicles. 3.2. Proposed
    system model This section discusses the proposed framework for smart devices to
    realize the intelligent services for the agriculture practice. Fig. 5 provides
    a detailed overview of the proposed framework. The proposed framework can be utilized
    by the application developers for designing applications pertaining to specific
    use cases. The proposed framework allows the developers to leverage the functionalities
    required for achieving the concept of smart architecture. The different components
    of the framework have been discussed below: • User Profile Manager: This module
    is responsible for maintaining the user profile information, such as name, contact
    details, user location, and so on. The information is stored in the User profile
    database and is retrieved during recommendation services. • Contact List Manager:
    Contact list management refers to the addition of new contacts and updation or
    deletion of the existing contacts. The module offers the functionality similar
    to the contact management in smart mobile phones. Data entered through this module
    is stored in Phonebook database. • Contact Group Manager: This module is responsible
    for grouping the contacts as per the user preference. For instance, all the contacts
    of different logistic operators may be clubbed into one group. This would facilitate
    the information dissemination to the required group as per the user’s requirement.
    For instance, if the farmer wishes to hire a transport vehicle for the delivery
    of food product, he can upload his requirements on the mobile application which
    would in turn send this data as notifications to all the logistic operators existing
    in the group. • User Data Requirements Module: This serves as an interface to
    add the user requirements which would eventually be either uploaded on cloud portal
    or sent to specific users or groups. Adding a requirement may include the group
    name to which the user wants to send the information. The user can also specify
    the requirements as public indicating that the requirements will be published
    on the cloud portal from where every user can view the published information.
    This data is also saved in the User Requirements database for a specified period
    of time. • Notifications Module: This is unified module for displaying the notifications
    received on the mobile application. Notifications can be classified into different
    categories, such as (i) Field Conditions: Data received from sensors deployed
    in the agricultural field; (ii) Requirement Notifications: Information regarding
    the market demand or the demand of the consumers; and (iii) Recommendations: Suggestions
    obtained from the intelligent recommendation module. • Intelligent Recommendation
    Module: This serves as the intelligence core for the proposed framework. The intelligent
    services discussed in Section 3.1.3 is realized through this module. The module
    is responsible for providing intelligent recommendation so as to facilitate the
    decision making process of the users, such as the best option for selling the
    produced crops, or suggestion regarding improving the field quality in terms of
    nutrients or moisture, etc. The module interacts with the notification module
    for retrieving real time requirements received on the mobile applications and
    provides suggestions to the users as per the requirements. • Network Interface:
    This serves as an interface to the network and is responsible for the transmission
    and reception of the messages to and fro the network. • Cloud Portal: The cloud
    portal refers to a web-based application portal for storing the various types
    of data submitted by the user. Any information published on the cloud portal can
    be either for public or specific users. Users can synchronize their mobile application
    to fetch the latest requirements posted by the distribution centres in the market
    regarding the cost of the products and their demand or the customers regarding
    their requirements. Real-time rates and the product demand in the market can be
    obtained from this portal and can be used to provide intelligent recommendations
    to the user. Download : Download high-res image (406KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. Proposed Framework. 4. Use-cases description The concept of social
    network of things can benefit the stakeholders in a number of ways. This section
    discusses the various scenarios where the proposed concept can facilitate the
    users in terms of effort and time. The scenarios discussed in this section covers
    the different aspects of agriculture ranging from procurement of raw products
    from the supplier to the selling of the agriculture product to the customers.
    4.1. Use Case 1: procuring raw materials from the farmers The initial stage of
    farming starts with the decision of the type of crops that can be grown and the
    materials required for good quality crops. Decision regarding the type of crops
    to be grown depends upon a number of factors including the climatic and field
    conditions, demand of the crop in the market, etc. The sensors installed in the
    fields acquire different types of information regarding the field conditions,
    the weather conditions can be obtained by either using sensors or the third party
    services. This information is aggregated by the coordinators and transmitted through
    the gateway to both the service running on the cloud as well as to the smartphones
    of the farmers. The Notification Module is responsible for displaying the received
    information as notifications on the smartphones. The demand of various crops in
    the market is availed from the information shared the distribution centres and
    stored in the repository residing on cloud. The Intelligent Recommendation Module
    uses relevant algorithms for data aggregation and service composition for recommending
    the type of the product most suited as per the conditions. This information is
    directly made available to the farmers through the Notification Module of the
    proposed framework. The recommendation algorithms can either be executed on the
    cloud or on the users’ smartphone. Once the type of crop has been decided, the
    next stage is to procure different materials required for growing the crop. This
    includes seeds, fertilizers, etc. A farmer can upload his requirements regarding
    the material type and the quantity required on his mobile application using the
    User Data Requirements Module. This information is shared among the different
    raw material suppliers and they are presented with an option to quote their rates.
    The quoted rates are displayed on the farmer’s smartphone application through
    the Notification Module. The farmer can then select the most suitable supplier
    as per his preference and contact him using the details shared by the raw material
    supplier. This would not only save the farmer’s time and effort for procuring
    the material but would also enable them to get the best rates for the procured
    goods. 4.2. Use case 2: farmer and customer Getting directly in touch with the
    end customer can be a boon for the farmers since the cost incurred by the intermediaries
    will be avoided leading to an overall increase in the farmer as well as customer
    benefits. Fig. 6 shows the information exchange between the farmers’ and the customer’s
    smart device. Initially, consider Farmer 1 made a transaction with a Customer
    XYZ. Upon successful transaction, the information of the Customer XYZ is added
    to the contact list maintained in Farmer 1′s smartphone using the Contact List
    Manager module. Similarly, upon interacting with different farmers, the information
    of the Customer XYZ is stored in all the corresponding farmer’s smartphone device.
    All the customers whose details are stored in the farmers’ mobile application
    is grouped under the Costumer Tag using the Contact Group Manager. Similarly,
    when a customer saves the information of different famers in his mobile application
    they will be grouped under the Farmer Tag by the Contact Group Manager. In future,
    if the Customer XYZ decides to purchase agricultural goods, he may upload the
    requirements along with other details in the application installed in his smartphone
    device using the User Data Requirements Module. This information regarding the
    requirements of the customer is used by the Intelligent Recommendation Module
    for providing the list of potential farmers capable of supplying the required
    product. The module shall fetch the details of farmers stored under the Farmer
    Tag from the Contact Group Manager. The application will then mine the relevant
    farmers capable of supplying the required goods and those farmers existing in
    the contact list of the customer shall receive a notification on their mobile
    application through the Notifications Module informing them about the requirements
    of the Customer XYZ. Fig. 6 shows an instance of the scenario where Farmer 1 and
    Farmer 2 receive the notification about the Customer XYZ requirements and are
    provided with an option to quote their rates. When the farmers quote their corresponding
    rates for the required goods using the Submit Requirement Notification Response
    module, Customer XYZ can view the rates quoted by the different famers on his
    mobile application. The customer can then manually select a farmer to view his
    details, and can contact him directly for further confirmations. If the farmer
    agrees to supply the required products, he needs to confirm the deal on his mobile
    application portal after which the customer will receive a success acknowledgement
    of the transaction, as shown in Fig. 6. This would allow the farmer to sell their
    products directly to customer without going through the distribution centres.
    This would also allow the customer to get goods at cheaper price than the retailer
    rates. Download : Download high-res image (406KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Farmer-Customer interaction using the proposed framework. 4.3. Use
    case 3: farmer and logistics operator Once the farmer has finalized the deal with
    the customer, he needs to transport the goods to the customer. The transport facility
    can be arranged by the customer as well as the farmer depending upon the terms
    agreed in the deal. Fig. 7 depicts the scenario where the transportation is arranged
    by the farmers themselves. As in case with the customers, the farmers can have
    a separate group for storing the contact details of various logistic operators
    using Contact List Manager and Contact Group Manager. A farmer uploads his requirements
    regarding the quantity of the goods that need to be transported along with the
    location details and the date by which the goods should reach the designated locations.
    Different logistic operators receive the notification about the requirements of
    the farmer through Notifications Module and they are required to quote their rates
    using Submit Requirement Notification Response module of the proposed framework.
    The Notifications Module on the farmer’s mobile application displays the rates
    quoted by different logistics operators. He may then select the most suitable
    operator and can contact him using the contact details uploaded by the logistics
    operator in the User Profile Manage component of the framework. Upon successful
    confirmation of the logistics operator, the operator sends the details of the
    vehicle to be used for transportation as well as that of the driver responsible
    for transporting the goods. The contact details of the farmer and the customer
    is sent to the driver as well. The application will automatically add the driver’s
    information in the friends list of the farmer and the farmer’s information in
    the friends list of the driver. When the driver starts from the source location,
    the real time location sharing of the vehicle will be automatically turned on
    and the farmer can receive the location information the transported goods. When
    the consignment is received by the customer the real time location sharing of
    the vehicle is automatically turned off for the stakeholders involved in this
    transaction. This application of the social network of thigs concept clearly eliminates
    the requirement of having extra RFIDs or other sensors installed on the vehicles
    for location tracking. The concept of location sharing is applicable between the
    customer and the vehicle driver as well. This implies that the customer will also
    receive the real time location of the transported goods. Download : Download high-res

    interaction using the proposed framework. 4.4. Use case 4: intelligent recommendations
    The agricultural product, once harvested, is sold in the market for the consumption
    by the customers. This process, in its current state, involves multiple entities.
    For instance, the farmer sells the goods to the local broker who will arrange
    for the transportation and will sell the goods to the distribution centre. These
    distribution centers quote rates for the products as per the demand in the market.
    The standard rates of the goods are not available with the farmers. This allows
    the local brokers to purchase the goods from the farmers at a meagre expense and
    they sell the same goods at higher price to the distribution centers. It is also
    not feasible for the farmer to manually visit the different distribution centres
    to sell their goods, since these distribution centres are located in urban areas
    far from the farmer’s field. The proposed system is capable of recommending various
    services to user as per the requirement. An important application of the proposed
    solution is to facilitate the farmers to sell their goods directly at these distribution
    centres. A farmer is required to upload the product information such as crop type,
    crop quantity, etc. which he wants to sell at the distribution centre using the
    User Data Requirements Module. The Intelligent Recommendation Module of the proposed
    framework will capture the location of different distribution centres, demand
    of the agricultural goods and their quoted rates. This data can be then used to
    recommend the most suitable distribution centre to the farmer where he can sell
    his goods. The location information adds one more level of intelligence to the
    recommendation service by suggesting the most apt distribution centre in terms
    of cost as well as the distance of the distribution centre from the farmer’s location.
    Once the farmer finalizes the distribution centre, live traffic conditions can
    be utilized to suggest the shortest route to the distribution centre. Fig. 8 shows
    an instance where Farmer 1 needs to sell crop type X at the distribution centre.
    The farmer uploads the crop type and the quantity to be sold. The Intelligent
    Recommendation Module searches and suggests the list of different distribution
    centre in the order of their suitability index. Once the farmer selects a particular
    distribution centre, the module recommends the shortest route to the distribution
    centre as per the live traffic conditions. Download : Download high-res image

    the farmer selects a particular distribution centre, the module recommends the
    shortest route to the distribution centre as per the live traffic conditions.
    5. Discussion There exists a plethora of research regarding the applicability
    of IoT based systems for improving the traditional agricultural practices. However,
    the work proposed in this paper is an improvement over the existing works since
    it does not only relies upon the sensory data for providing the services to the
    user but it also incorporates the user centric data in terms of requirements and
    preferences of the user. Moreover, the proposed work also attempts to incorporate
    a certain level of social relations of the users in order to provide the right
    information at right time and at right place. The social relation refers to the
    type of relations that a humans share with other humans in the professional or
    personal domain. The conceptual architecture and framework proposed in this paper
    for incorporating social dimension to the IoT ecosystem has wide scope of application
    in the agricultural domain. This can be inferred from the various use case descriptions
    provided in Section 4. This section further presents logical justifications for
    the proposed work. Consider a farmer who has to sell his produce in the market
    say 50 kg of food product and that the invested amount by the famer is Rs. 5000.
    In the current scenario, where multiple intermediaries are involved in the food
    supply chain, the farmer is tempted to sell this product to local broker at say
    Rs. 6000. The broker will arrange for the transport facility and will sell this
    product at the distribution centre at a higher price say Rs. 10,000. These distribution
    centres will further sell this product to the retailers at a price that will be
    higher than 10,000. For simplicity, let us consider the distributers sell the
    product at Rs 15,000. This makes the Rs 5000 food product worth of Rs 15,000,
    i.e. Rs 300 per kg which was initially produced in Rs 100 per kg. Moreover, the
    farmer gained only Rs 1000 by selling 50 kg of product, i.e. Rs 10 per kg even
    when the consumer is paying Rs 300 per kg of the same product. In this context,
    the proposed architecture shall help the farmer to maximize his profit while allowing
    the consumers to purchase the product at a reasonable cost. This can be attributed
    to the fact that the proposed architecture shall allow the consumers to purchase
    the products directly from the farmer. Obviously, the required amount of product
    that needs to be purchased cannot be too small, since it would be infeasible for
    the farmer to ship a small quantity of the product to the customer place at low
    price. However, if it is feasible for the consumer, he can directly visit the
    famer for collecting the product. The proposed architecture also enables the farmer
    to select the most appropriate distribution centre for selling their products
    without investing too much effort and time in the process. Consider a famer needs
    to sell 50 kg of product at the distribution centre which can be 50 kms from his
    place. The rate at which the farmer will sell its product will vary from one distribution
    centre to another. Let us consider that distribution centre A is 50 km from the
    famer’s place and is will to purchase the product at Rs 100 per kg while distribution
    centre B is 70 km from the farmer’s place but is expected to purchase the product
    at Rs 150 per kg. This problem further elevates when the number of distribution
    centres increase with each having different price and distance. The amount of
    effort and time that the farmer has to invest for visiting each of these distribution
    centre before he makes his decision regarding the choice of distribution centre
    where he can sell the product is very high. In this context, the proposed work
    in this paper shall facilitate the farmer to obtain this information without having
    the need to visit each centre individually. Moreover, the proposed work will also
    assist the farmer in selecting the best option since the intelligent algorithms
    shall provide the farmer with a list of distribution centres ranked according
    to the farmer preferences, i.e. whether he needs to maximize the cost or minimize
    the distance. Another important contribution of the proposed work is that it will
    provide the farmers with the real time assessment of the agricultural field conditions
    that will help him in maintain the quality of the field and eventually the quality
    of the grown crops. Moreover, this information can also be analyzed for recommending
    the farmers with the type of food products that he can grow as per the conditions
    of the field. The demand of the crops in the market shall allow the farmer to
    grow the right type and quantity of product in order to minimize the wastage and
    loss which would otherwise incur if the products are in excess than the demand.
    6. Conclusions and future works The exponential rise in the global population
    has created an increased demand for the quantity as well as quality of the food
    products. This demand can be catered by modernizing the agricultural sector. IoT
    has the potential to optimize the traditional agricultural practices. The conjunction
    of smart devices with the intelligent algorithms can be a boon to the farmers.
    This paper proposes an IoT architecture for adding the smartness component to
    the agricultural sector. The proposed architecture relies upon the data obtained
    from the end devices comprising of not only sensors/actuators but also the farmers
    and other personnel involved in the agricultural process. Information regarding
    the quality of the agricultural fields is helpful for growing good quality crops.
    The architecture proposed in this paper provides real time monitoring of the agricultural
    fields so as to facilitate the farmers to supply the required nutrients to the
    crops in a timely manner. User generated data comprising of product demand and
    cost helps the farmers as well as consumers to obtain good quality products at
    optimal rates. The proposed architecture also takes care of the real-time tracing
    and tracking of the food supply logistics. The data being shared by the different
    entities involved in the proposed system can be collaborated to provided critical
    and value added recommendations for enhancing the efficiency of the agricultural
    practices. The discussed use cases clearly depicts the applicability of the proposed
    architecture in the various agricultural process scenario. However there are certain
    limitations of the work presented in this paper that needs to be addressed for
    enhancing the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. The architecture proposed
    in this paper relies upon the user generated data and as such storage of these
    large volumes of data is a key concern. Moreover, intelligent algorithms for searching
    relevant information in the IoT needs to be designed in order to minimize the
    delivery time of the services. Other aspects of the proposed architecture that
    require critical attention is that that security, privacy and trust management.
    This can be attributed to the fact that smart devices such as smart phones owned
    by the users are the storehouses of multiple types of personal and important information.
    These devices are assumed to work autonomously in the proposed architecture and
    hence are vulnerable to various types of security attacks. Further, the trust
    credentials of the shared information is also a significant concern since false
    information can misguide the users and reduce the efficiency of the recommendation
    services. Moreover, the heterogeneity of the devices in the IoT ecosystem needs
    to be addressed in order to ensure interoperability between the devices. References

    Under a Creative Commons license open access Highlights • A mapping framework
    is built connecting ReSOLVE with 4 IoT capabilities and 6Rs. • IoT-enabled tracking
    and monitoring capabilities dominates Loop model. • Optimize model is related
    to ‘Reduce’ by monitoring and optimization of IoT. • IoT provides virtual and
    dematerialized solutions, supporting ‘Redesign’ strategy. • IoT reduces the energy
    use of the Optimize and Loop business model with 20–30%. Abstract In recent years,
    circular business models (CBM) have become an inevitable requirement to foster
    improvements in environmental performance. However, the current literature rarely
    discusses the link between Internet of Things (IoT) and CBM. This paper first
    identifies four IoT capabilities including monitoring, tracking, optimization
    and design evolution for improving CBM performance based on the ReSOLVE framework.
    In a second step, a systematic literature review using the PRISMA approach analyzes
    how these capabilities contribute to 6 R and CBM through the CBM-6R and CBM-IoT
    cross-section heatmaps and relationship frameworks, followed by assessing the
    quantitative impacts of IoT on potential energy saving in CBM. Finally, challenges
    are analyzed for the realization of IoT-enabled CBM. The results show that the
    assessments of Loop and Optimize business models dominate current studies. IoT
    plays a significant role in these business models respectively through tracking,
    monitoring and optimization capabilities. While (quantitative) case studies for
    Virtualize, Exchange and Regenerate CBM are substantially needed. IoT holds the
    potential to reduce energy consumption by around 20–30% for referenced applications
    in the literature. However, the IoT hardware, software and protocol energy consumption,
    interoperability, security and financial investment might become main obstacles
    for the wider use of IoT in CBM. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    frameworkCircular business model 1. Introduction 1.1. Key concepts and a brief
    history of the IoT Since the birth of the internet in the early 1980s, attempts
    have been made to connect “Things” with the internet. In 1990, John Romkey created
    the first Internet ‘device’, a toaster that could be turned on and off via the
    Internet (Romkey, 2017). Paul Saffo gave the first brief description of sensors
    and how they could be used in connection with the internet in 1997 (Saffo, 1997).
    To describe this growing connection of sensors and similar devices providing real-time
    information via the internet, in 1999 the term “Internet of Things” was coined
    by Kevin Ashton, who was working in supply chain optimization and invented a new
    technology called Radio-frequency identification (RFID)-based item identification
    in the same year (Suresh et al., 2014). In 2003, Walmart deployed RFID in all
    its shops across the globe to measure product stocks and sales and support supply
    chain management (Harold, 2007). In 2005, International Telecommunication Union
    (ITU, 2005) regarded the IoT as a third wave of the world''s information industry
    transformation. In 2008, the Federal Communications Commission approved the usage
    of the “white space spectrum” (Suresh et al., 2014). Later, IT giants like Cisco,
    IBM and Ericsson took a lot of educational and commercial initiatives with IoT.
    Some countries, like China, listed the IoT as a strategic emerging technology
    in their long-term plans (MIIT, 2012). The IoT technology can be simply explained
    as a connection between humans - computers - things. It uses RFID, infrared sensors,
    global positioning systems, laser scanners and other information-sensing equipment
    to connect any item under internet protocol (IP) with a unique IP address for
    information exchange and communication, which can achieve intelligent positioning,
    tracking, monitoring and management of items. The systems architecture can, for
    instance, be based on the context of operations and processes in real-time scenarios.
    For instance, in a smart home, every electrical switch box could be connected
    with a smart phone so that it could be operated remotely. The HarmonyOS system
    recently created by Huawei uses full stack decoupling architecture that could
    even solve constraints issues on the boundary of software and hardware, thus making
    it possible for other collaborators to join the system (Chen and Matt, 2021).
    Altogether, the application boundary of the IoT has been expanded considerably.
    Such a scenario does not need a processor and a storage device installed in every
    switch box. It just needs a sensor to capture signals and process them (mostly
    switching ON/OFF). 1.2. Potentials by IoT technologies in CE in a finite world
    Avoiding overshooting of planetary boundaries for climate change (Rockström et
    al., 2009) and switching to more sustainable practices are among the greatest
    challenges of the 21st century. Any approach to reduce pressures requires simultaneous
    consideration of economic, social, and especially environmental aspects of industrial
    processes, as well as respective interactions along cradle-to-grave value chains
    of products and services (Ren et al., 2013). Important strategies to reduce critical
    raw material use are sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) and circular usage
    of products and materials (Manavalan and Jayakrishna, 2019). Seuring and Müller
    (2008) defined SSCM as “the management of material, information and capital flows
    as well as cooperation among companies along the supply chain, while taking goals
    from all three dimensions – environmental, economic and social into account which
    are derived from customer and stakeholder requirements.” Circularity adds a different
    perspective to SSCM as it tries to keep substances in closed loops. Unlike a linear
    economy that is based on a “take-make-dispose” model, CE promotes longevity, reparability,
    durability and recyclability of products with the aim of a full re-use of resources
    (Elisha, 2020). It therefore symbolizes a linear to loop transition for supply
    chains in sustainability (Schröder et al., 2019). In the industry 4.0 (I4.0) era,
    the IoT offers opportunities to foster CE in value chains through real-time monitoring
    of the resources inventory (Mohammadian, 2019). It can support the minimization
    of waste flows through product lifetime detection. As consequence material reuse
    and recycling processes can be optimized. In summary, IoT promotes a highly accurate,
    efficient and sound use of resources aimed at the shift from disposable to renewable
    resources paradigm, and facilitates the born and development of CBM (Ghisellini
    et al., 2016; Nižetić et al., 2020). Therefore, progress of IoT-enabled CBM has
    attracted academic researches, which have recently assessed the impact of I4.0
    technologies such as IoT on CBM with different conclusions (Rosa et al., 2019,
    2020). They discussed CBM and IoT from economic, social and environmental perspectives
    (Govindan and Hasanagic, 2018; Ding et al., 2023). Rejeb et al. (2022) reviewed
    how the IoT provides contributions and challenges in the CBM domain. They identified
    important drivers and provided a structured framework that exploring business
    and management-focused CE strategies based on IoT technologies. However, there
    is still a large gap between theory and practice (Gorissen et al., 2016). In particular,
    most small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are encountering unprecedented pressure
    to improve environmental performance. Since the adoption cost of the IoT could
    be tremendous, they might hesitate to seize IoT-enabled emission reduction opportunities
    based on their specific status (Ding et al., 2023; Awan et al., 2022a). This requires
    an in-depth understanding of the IoT capabilities and the characteristics of different
    CBMs to find their best intersection point. Besides, the circularity of IoT devices
    themselves should also be considered (Beier et al., 2018). Given these research
    gaps this paper addresses the following research questions. i) What are the (synergy)
    contributions of IoT capabilities under different CBM? ii) What are the carbon
    emission reduction potentials of the IoT in different CBM? iii) What are the obstacles
    for SMEs to adopt IoT in promoting circular strategies? The contributions of this
    paper are as follows: We used a pre-defined circular business framework (ReSOLVE)
    developed by Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF, 2015) to analyze the CBM-IoT context
    and linked it to 6 R principles to specifically map the IoT capabilities into
    each business practices. This visualizes how IoT contributes differently in each
    business model and provides information for us to describe the relationship between
    IoT capabilities, 6 R and CBM. Additionally, we quantitatively review the literature
    on how IoT can contribute to reducing environmental impacts under CBM and identify
    their obstacles. This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces the Prisma
    methodology we used as the method for the literature review, and the reasoning
    of paper selection. Section 3 reviews IoT''s role in CE, introduces the capabilities
    of IoT correlated with CBM and identifies its environmental opportunities. Section
    4 reflects on potential obstacles for IoT adjustment in CBM. Section 5 comprehensively
    summarizes our findings and concludes. Finally, section 6 outlines limitations
    and gives recommendations for future research. 2. Review approach: Prisma 2.1.
    Introduction of Prisma In June 2022, we conducted a literature search based on
    the checklist framework provided by the PRISMA-P guidelines (Moher et al., 2015).
    PRISMA was initially used in the medical field. Although other methods for conducting
    literature reviews and meta-analyses are available (Horvathova, 2012; Luederitz
    et al., 2016), PRISMA guidelines have become widely accepted as an approach to
    conduct transparent literature reviews. Recently they have been applied in the
    field of sustainability and CE research (Blanco et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2019;
    Zalk and Behrens, 2018; Aguilar-Hernandez et al., 2021). The latest PRISMA Abstract
    2020 (Page et al., 2021a, Page et al., 2021b) suggests discussing 5 main items
    in relation to 10 subcategories in a review. We refer to the checklist items listed
    in Table 1. Table 1. Major steps in Prisma Abstract 2020 (Page et al., 2021a,
    Page et al., 2021b). Section and Topic Item # Checklist item TITLE Title 1 Identify
    the report as a systematic review. BACKGROUND Objectives 2 Provide an explicit
    statement of the main objectives or questions. METHODS Eligibility criteria 3
    Specify the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the review. Information sources
    4 Specify the information sources (e.g., databases, search terms) used to identify
    studies. Risk of bias 5 Specify the methods used to assess risk of bias in the
    studies included. Synthesis of results 6 Specify the methods used to present and
    synthesize results. RESULTS Included studies 7 Give the total number of studies
    included and participants and summarize relevant characteristics of the studies.
    Synthesis of results 8 Present results for main outcomes, preferably indicating
    the number of studies included and participants for each. If a meta-analysis was
    carried out, report the summary estimate and confidence/credible interval. If
    comparing groups, indicate the direction of the effect (i.e., which group is favoured).
    DISCUSSION Limitations of evidence 9 Provide a brief summary of the limitations
    of the evidence included in the review (e.g., study risk of bias, inconsistency
    and imprecision). Interpretation 10 Provide a general interpretation of the results
    and important implications. These categories explain the search objectives and
    eligibility criteria, including the methods and reasons for including and excluding
    certain records (i.e. some papers do not contain the keywords checked for but
    have keywords with similar meanings, some papers contain the keywords but do not
    explain them in detail). Second, it describes the steps of the quantitative analysis,
    which includes collecting data from selected publications and harmonizing their
    values. Based on this framework, this literature review was conducted. 2.2. Classification
    of papers We use the 6 R concept (Joshi et al., 2006) to initially classify circularity
    strategies and related business models, as shown in Fig. 1. The 6 R concept discerns
    Reuse, Recycle, Reduce, Repair, Remanufacture and Redesign. Sihvonen and Ritola
    (2015) regarded the 6 R framework as the operational approaches and core principles
    of CE. Report of Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF, 2013) pointed out that discovering
    new paths to support CE under 6 R guidance – “an industrial system that is restorative
    or regenerative by intention and design” is becoming more and more vital against
    the background of Industrial 4.0 era. From a systems perspective, the combination
    of six operational approaches (6 R) enables new business models of CE at the macro
    level (Kirchherr et al., 2017). Download : Download high-res image (451KB) Download

    Based on these characteristics, the ReSOLVE framework further explains CE -- Preserve
    and enhance natural capital, optimize resource yields and foster system effectiveness,
    and classifies circular models based on the economic and resource impacts of major
    sectors (EMF, 2015). It offers a tool for generating circular strategies and growth
    initiatives. Jabbour et al. (2018) then connected Industry 4.0 technologies to
    six CBM proposed by the ReSOLVE framework, namely Regenerating, Share, Optimize,
    Loop, Virtualize and Exchange, to guide organizations through implementing the
    principles of the CE (EMF, 2015), as shown in Table 2. Most technologies own opportunities
    in specific areas, while the IoT can play a significant role to make such business
    models viable (Jabbour et al., 2018). Table 2. Explanation of six business models
    in ReSOLVE framework. Business models Explanation Regenerate This business model
    is based on a shift to renewable energy and materials. Biological cycles are used
    to enable the circulation of energy and materials, and to convert organic waste
    into sources of energy and raw material for other chains. Share Assets are shared
    between individuals (peer-to-peer sharing of privately owned products or public
    sharing of a pool of products). As a consequence, products should be designed
    to last longer by the producers, and maintenance should be available to allow
    the re-use and extension of product life. Optimize This business model requires
    organizations to use digital manufacturing technologies, such as IoT, automation,
    and big data to reduce waste in production systems across supply chains. As a
    result, organizations will benefit from increased performance. Loop This business
    model aims to promote the circularity of raw materials and energy. The design,
    production, and supply chain therefore have to be adjusted from the perspective
    of the entire life cycle. Virtualize This business model is service-focused which
    replaces physical with virtual and dematerialized products. Exchange It involves
    substituting old and non-renewable goods for advanced and renewable ones. While
    the exact terminology to describe IoT-related capabilities varies under different
    scenarios, we synthesized core capabilities of the technology as found in literature.
    Ingemarsdotter et al. (2019) suggests that IoT''s can support the development
    of circular business models via capabilities such as tracking, monitoring, control,
    optimization and design evolution, and stated that optimization often relies on
    the use of control capability. Therefore, we incorporated the control capability
    into optimization to reduce the list of relevant IoT capabilities to four, as
    shown in Table 3. Table 3. IoT capabilities that can support implementation of
    the ReSOLVE framework. IoT capabilities Definition of functions Tracking Available
    information for products'' identity, location, or unique composition. Monitoring
    Available information for products'' real-time condition, or environment. This
    includes alerts and notifications. Optimization Goal-based improvements of operations
    are controlled and optimized by using advanced algorithms. Design Evolution The
    design of a product can be upgraded based on data feedback from other lifecycle
    phases. This includes functional or routing upgrades. 2.2.1. Selection of papers
    On the basis of the discussion above, in order to systematically review the contribution
    of the IoT to circular economy business models, we used the following terms as
    a basis for the literature search in a Boolean operation -- Title, Abstract, Keyword
    = [“internet of things” AND (“circular economy” OR “circular business model” OR
    “sustainable supply chain”)]. In total, there were 432 papers available on Scopus
    and 142 papers available on Web of Science (WoS). We excluded duplicate records
    and papers that have no relation to any elements of the 6 R through browsing abstracts.
    Then, we further excluded papers with non-CBM descriptions discerned in the RESOLVE
    framework after browsing the full texts. In this way, 59 papers were retained
    to explore the contribution of the IoT to CBM, see Fig. 2. Download : Download
    high-res image (615KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Flowchart of
    selected publications in the review (status in June 2022). Then, a quantitative
    analysis of how the IoT reduces environmental impacts in CBM was conducted. For
    this, from the included papers we acquired 23 results that a) quantified impacts
    on energy-related indicators in circular economy (e.g., energy use or CO2 emissions)
    and b) compared these impacts before and after using IoT technology. 3. Review:
    impacts of the IoT on CBM 3.1. Descriptive results The retrieved 59 papers used
    for describing the contribution of the IoT to CBM can be categorized by journal,
    year of publication, and sector/application. Fig. 3 shows the number of articles
    published in different journals under the given search term and constraints. The
    number of papers published in the Journal of Cleaner Production, Sustainability
    and Computers in Industry appears to dominate. These journals make up 25.5% of
    the total share, which is much higher than that of other journals. The core fields
    covered by these journals include computer science, engineering and environmental
    science. The number of papers has increased significantly over time. Publications
    in the last 3 years occupy exceed 2/3 of the total share, which indicates a growing
    interest on this topic. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Numbers of IoT publications in different types of journals.
    Next, we use the framework developed by Maroli et al. (2021) to classify 59 papers
    into 4 major categories: reviews, theory studies, new designs and case studies.
    Reviews include pure review articles that classify and summarize previous studies.
    Theory studies generally analyze and discuss the proposed new framework for specific
    issues mainly based on surveying experts (Delphi) or questionnaires. New designs
    imply the development of a new mathematical model or a new protocol design for
    an IoT solution but without a real case to verify factual feasibility. Case studies
    further calculate or simulate the case and obtain reference results based on real
    or defined cases compared with the new design. A brief supplementary description
    of each article is also attached to this table to provide an overview of each
    research division. These classified papers are then categorized into six business
    models suggested by ReSOLVE framework (EMF, 2015). As shown in Fig. 4. Download

    Division of publications into the 6 ReSOLVE categories of CE business models.
    Over 60% of the papers describe the contribution of IoT to Loop and Optimize models.
    Both of these two models have higher potential impacts on manufacturing, transportation
    and storage, and IoT could thus promote significant business transformation within
    these sectors (EMF, 2015). As for Optimize, IoT helps to realize smart manufacturing
    and SSCM through improving decision-making plans to reduce the consumption of
    energy and resources. Most of the theoretical studies here explored and developed
    frameworks for low carbon footprints in different industries based on IoT capabilities
    of collecting, processing information more efficiently (Gružauskas et al., 2018;
    Chit et al., 2021; Ghoreishi and Happonen, 2022; Jagtap et al., 2021). The limited
    number of cases and new designs are usually process optimizations in enterprises,
    where IoT is used to develop intelligent production scheduling and logistics delivery
    models to promote green and sustainable development of intelligent manufacturing
    (Liao and Wang, 2019). In the Loop business model, most studies focused on waste
    management. Here, IoT is mainly used to realize waste collection optimization
    and more accuracy of decision support system for end-life products recycling (Bányai
    et al., 2019; Velvizhi et al., 2020; Al-Masri et al., 2018). Some theoretical
    studies designed CE–IoT-enabled ecosystems based on key enabling IoT technologies
    (Miaoudakis et al., 2020). Others combined it with LCA model to aid their processes
    of designing new products with low environmental impact (Zhang et al., 2020; de
    Oliveira and Soares, 2017). New designs and case studies validated IoT-enabled
    solutions based on products with different technical route characteristics, such
    as plastic waste and scrapped cars (Plakas et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2018), etc.
    Though the proportion of case studies is relatively low, only 11%. The remaining
    four business models account for only a small part of the articles. Among them,
    the sharing model generally relies on online platforms or apps supported by IoT,
    which brings the channel for products or information sharing between different
    stakeholders (Mastos et al., 2020). Virtualize and Exchange models usually demands
    extra technologies such as virtual world tools, digital twin (DT) and 3D printers
    to realize (Gustafson-Pearce and Grant, 2017; Despeisse et al., 2017; Rocca et
    al., 2020). 3.2. Connection of ReSOLVE framework with 6 R and IoT capabilities
    We further classified the papers in a number of matrices, considering the 6 R,
    IoT capabilities and Circular Business Model (CBM) categories discussed in section
    2. This results in a ‘heat map’ of the occurrences of CBM-IoT and CBM-6R cross-sections
    within the sample of 59 papers, see Fig. 5. Many papers describe multiple CBM-IoT
    and CBM-6R cross-sections. It should further be noted that while the categories
    are uniquely defined, they are not mutually exclusive. Below, we explored patterns
    for each of the CBM. 1. Loop business model Download : Download high-res image

    CBM-IoT cross-section occurrences. The findings show that IoT-enabled ‘Recycle’
    dominates, followed by ‘Remanufacture’ and ‘Repair’. Papers displaying Loop usually
    rely on tracking or monitoring capabilities, while optimization and design evolution
    are relatively unexplored. In terms of recycling, remanufacturing, and repairing,
    the adoption of novel Internet-based transactions can exploit information for
    faster and more sustainable collection of post-consumption products, they can
    be tracked using sensors, RFID tags, and barcodes (Al-Masri et al., 2018). As
    a consequence, organizations are able to remanufacture, or recycle components
    of products and packaging (Vanderroost et al., 2017; Gligoric et al., 2019). In
    line with the Redesign prospect, product designers need to incorporate environmental
    criteria into their design decisions. They can obtain data from an IoT-based product
    life cycle management system to aid their processes of sustainable design and
    development (Zhang et al., 2020; Chit et al., 2021; de Oliveira and Soares, 2017).
    Typical cases are listed in Table 4. 2. Optimize business model Table 4. Illustration
    of the use of IoT capabilities in the Loop model. IoT capabilities Representative
    examples Tracking A research project called POIROT, which exploits IoT technologies,
    aiming to realize a platform for the traceability of organic waste and transform
    it into inert, odorless and sanitized material (De Fazio et al., 2019). Monitoring
    An IoT-enabled decision support system for a CE model that addresses the uncertainty
    of a product''s residual value based on the life cycle monitored from the IoT
    sensors (Mboli et al., 2020). Optimization A system that combines intelligent
    transportation systems (RFIDs, sensors, cameras, actuators and surveillance systems)
    and an advanced decision system (incorporating data sharing between truck drivers
    in real time to perform dynamic route optimization) for efficient waste collection
    (Velvizhi et al., 2020). Most of the papers exploring Optimize models are highly
    related to IoT-enabled ‘Reduce’, which is mainly realized by monitoring and optimization
    capabilities, as shown in Appendix figure A1. Through data monitoring from processes
    and agents such as machines, the IoT increases the possibility of identifying
    potential failures, and predictive maintenance can reduce the waste of non-performing
    products (Venkatesh et al., 2020; Laskurain-Iturbe et al., 2021). Additionally,
    based on the demands of the production and consumption of resources, managers
    could monitor and Optimize production rates and the use of sensors as well as
    algorithms would enable them to automatically intervene in processes to reduce
    intermediate inventory (Ghoreishi and Happonen, 2022; Roy and Roy 2019; Awan et
    al., 2022b). The IoT with the combination of cloud computing and machine learning
    provides potential for complex and integrated data-driven process manufacturing
    models in terms of robustness and accuracy (Fisher et al., 2020). Typical cases
    are listed in Table 5. 3. Share business model Table 5. Illustration of the use
    of IoT capabilities in the Optimize model. IoT capabilities Representative examples
    Tracking RFID technology to tag and track fresh milk could reduce the amount of
    product shrinkage (Bottani et al., 2014). Monitoring Based on IoT sensors, energy
    and cost savings will be achieved as long as the state of the ideal ball mill
    is specifically analyzed and extended to the other ball mills. (Ma et al., 2020).
    Optimization Each node (including suppliers, wholesalers and retailers) could
    be involved in managing and optimizing its own performance in terms of production,
    deliveries and environmental compliance by using RFID tags and wireless sensor
    networks (Hofmann and Rüsch, 2017; Hasanova and Romanovs, 2020). Monitoring and
    tracking are main capabilities of IoT that contribute to sharing business model,
    they help in the product ‘Resign’ and ‘Recycle’ in order to achieve product lifetime
    extension, as shown in Appendix figure A2. Information on consumers'' behavior
    is collected through websites and apps, organizations can therefore both improve
    product design and provide a digital service for better utilization or replacement
    of equipment, and increase customer satisfaction (Rymaszewska et al., 2017; Ingemarsdotter
    et al., 2020). Moreover, the use of sensors in products allows performance monitoring
    - for instance, monitoring maintenance requirements - thereby allowing organizations
    to proactively provide a high quality of service to customers. As a consequence
    of monitoring products during consumer use, organizations can invest in extending
    product life spans by applying the 3Rs strategy (repair, reuse, and recycle).
    Typical cases are listed in Table 6. 4. Virtualize business model Table 6. Illustration
    of the use of IoT capabilities in the Share model. IoT capabilities Representative
    examples Tracking Cranfield University launched a shoe recycling project: it includes
    the design of an intelligent component (IoT) that tracks the condition of the
    shoes and identifies the need for replacement/upgrading. The modular design of
    the shoes allows them to be easily disassembled for refurbishing or recycling
    (Nobre and Tavares, 2017). Monitoring A cross-company IoT communication protocol
    has the potential to offer an automated negotiation ecosystem between scrap metal
    producers and waste collecting companies based on cost, demand etc. (Mastos et
    al., 2020). Optimization IoT helps to achieve a mutual visible inventory under
    business-to-business e-commerce models in real time, where average food inventory,
    amount of food waste, frequency of lateral inventory share and ordering from the
    main depot; customer service level in the network is optimized (Ekren et al.,
    2021). Since service is a core focus of Virtualize, using real-time data to monitor
    supply activities is important to enhance the customer experience. It also triggers
    the potential of IoT-enabled “Redesign” of the product or service with the help
    of design evolution capability. Through virtually designing, simulating, and optimizing
    the system and converting it on the real world, it is possible to achieve system
    reconfigurability through a change of both specific hardware (i.e., change of
    robot tools for disassembly activities), and software resources (i.e., robot program
    coding) (Sassanelli et al., 2021). The IoT enables connections between organizations,
    suppliers, and customers in order to offer services rather than physical products
    (Jabbour et al., 2018). In addition, the IoT is able to collect information on
    consumers’ behavior and features of past designs, which designers can use to improve
    service quality. Typical cases are listed in Table 7. 5. Exchange business model
    Table 7. Illustration of the use of IoT capabilities in the Virtualize model.
    IoT capabilities Representative examples Monitoring Gustafson-Pearce and Grant
    (2017) tested 3D Virtual World tools with multiple sources of ‘streamed’ data
    generated by IoT, to discover whether knowledge sharing and learning within a
    horizontal supply chain was effective and reduced greenhouse gas emissions related
    to business travel. Design evolution A platform that combines hybrid IoT and blockchain
    to provide interactive innovation in prefabricated housing construction among
    shareholders, who were involved in life-cycle value co-design via online channels
    (e.g., mobile apps) (Li et al., 2021). A platform installing IoT devices in a
    smart building to measure energy consumption and provide energy optimization consulting
    services for end-users and building managers (Sharma et al., 2021). IoT could
    provide a scenario of experience shopping from a mirror image, aiming to solve
    the distortion of consumer''s experience in traditional online shopping (Gao and
    Han, 2021). IoT integrates the manufacturing execution system (MES) to the DT
    by using a communication protocol, which is able to give commands to the MES from
    external sources and digitalize the CE practices (Rocca et al., 2020). This model
    could acquire strength by adopting additive manufacturing and IoT systems with
    monitoring capability (Despeisse et al., 2017). 3D printers are able to process
    renewable and sustainable production. Based on interaction between organizations
    and customers, some companies are able to manufacture customized products by using
    databases incorporating 3D printers, where IoT helps to save time and material
    use in additive manufacturing. These kinds of functions make IoT easier to achieve
    CE principles. Typical cases are listed in Table 8. 6. Regenerate business model
    Table 8. Illustration of the use of IoT capabilities in the Exchange model. IoT
    capabilities Representative examples Monitoring The additive manufacturing leads
    to reduced use of material, IoT-enabled 3D printers enable the recycling of small
    quantities of waste (Despeisse et al., 2017). Optimization IoTs are used for the
    identification of engineered disassemblers as well as the real-time status of
    reproducible resources to build efficient multi-target production planning in
    real-time by the seed swarm optimization algorithm (Chau et al., 2021). The model
    could benefit from IoT in the form of sensors and networks. The design, production
    and supply decisions of CE could be adjusted based on data provided by IoT (EMF,
    2016). This would make it possible to reduce unnecessary resource consumption
    to improve the productivity of harvests, and to extend the life cycle of the land
    use. Typical cases are listed in Table 9. Table 9. Illustration of the use of
    IoT capabilities in the Regenerate model. IoT capabilities Representative examples
    Monitoring To monitor, and control factors related to land management between
    crop rotation, to automate irrigation systems based on weather conditions in real
    time, and to manage the use of pesticides according to the health of plantations
    (EMF Report of Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2016). Optimization IoT allows real-time
    measurement of ceramic tile production, providing the capability to modify the
    composition of the ceramic bodies and the transport mix to maximize the use of
    local raw materials, reducing the distances between mines and the factory and
    by favoring rail transport (Garcia-Muiña et al., 2019). In all, the concept of
    6 R is gradually supported by IoT technology. It promotes the combination of 6
    R in different circular business practices (Kirchherr et al., 2017; Spaltini et
    al., 2021), and each business model represents a major circularity opportunity
    enabled by the IoT technology that is quite different from growth in the linear
    economy. Therefore, we selected main contributors of 6 R and CBM from the ‘heat
    map’ results, and then constructed a relationship framework that containing the
    conceptualization of 4 IoT capabilities, 6 R and ReSOLVE framework, as shown in
    Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res image (341KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Relationship framework for IoT enabled 6 R and CBM. As for IoT capabilities,
    the monitoring plays a significant role, which promotes most circular business
    models by jointly facilitating all 6Rs, followed by the optimization capability.
    And for the intermediate nodes of 6 R actions, Recycle and Redesign are the core
    CE principles linking upstream IoT capabilities and downstream circular strategies.
    In different ways, these actions all increase the utilization of physical assets,
    prolong their life, and shift resource use from finite to renewable sources. They
    potentially reinforce and accelerate the performance of the other actions, creating
    a compounding effect. 3.3. Quantitative analysis of how the use of IoT in CBMs
    reduces energy-related environmental impacts Within the collected papers, 20 papers
    provide quantitative data on how the use of IoT in CBMs can reduce environmental
    impacts. These papers provide 23 cases. We included them in our quantitative analysis
    for they mainly use energy savings as the primary measurement. Fig. 7 depicts
    how much energy is saved by using IoT in the six ReSOLVE business model categories
    (Virtualize is missing due to lack of data). The X-axis shows the ReSOLVE business
    model categories and their number of samples in each. The Y-axis represents the
    relative energy savings compared to a baseline scenario without IoT enhancement
    (i.e., the energy use in the baseline is set on 100%). Supplementary Table 2 contains
    a list of cases and their references. 1. Optimize business model Download : Download

    saving under different IoT-enabled CBM (CI = 95%). Most results show quantitative
    data from the Optimize business model (11 results). Here, big data of related
    resource objects is collected using IoT sensors. The resource allocation framework
    is then optimized using heuristic algorithms for specific consumption habits to
    prevent any unwanted negative environmental impact in scheduling issues (Liao
    and Wang, 2019). 2. Loop business model 6 results consider the Loop business model.
    IoT solutions enable the transition to a cyber-physical1 waste management system,
    and provide real-time information on waste generation, treatment, transportation,
    and material handling capacity in big random systems. Carbon emissions from collected
    and transported waste have been significantly reduced due to enhanced recycling
    (Velvizhi et al., 2020). 3. Share business model 4 results discuss the Share business
    model, where IoT lowers energy and resource waste in corporate processes by sharing
    information, products or services (Ekren et al., 2021). For instance, IoT facilitates
    the recording of food expiration dates and facilitates communal food sharing (Phiri
    and Trevorrow, 2019). 4. Regenerate and Exchange business model The Regenerate
    and Exchange models each have a single case. In Regenerate model, IoT is utilized
    for the identification of engineered disassemblers and the real-time status of
    regenerable resources in order to construct effective multi-target production
    planning (Garcia-Muiña et al., 2019). While in Exchange model, IoT assists in
    modifying the composition of the ceramic bodies and the transport mix to maximize
    the utilization of local raw materials (Chau et al., 2021). The effects of relative
    energy savings in the Optimize and Loop business models are evident and comparable,
    with corresponding mean value of 30% and 25%. It may be attributed to the parallels
    of the two models in leveraging IoT capabilities. With the difference that Optimize
    model utilizes more on the optimization capabilities, which may provide it with
    higher energy saving potential. Some measures in the Optimize model could even
    achieve energy savings of up to 70%. But the effect of the Share business model
    is highly variable, ranging from less than 20%–80%, with the majority of results
    falling closer to the lower end. The results of the remaining three models are
    limited. Nevertheless, they present oppotunities for further investigation. 4.
    Environmental drawbacks and other obstacles to the use of IoT in CBMs While reviewing
    the literature, as described above we found many ways of how IoT could support
    the implementation of circular CBMs. However, some of these references also highlighted
    environmental risks of IoT, or other obstacles to implementing and using IoT.
    These findings including related references are discussed below, and Table 10
    summarizes them. Table 10. Environmental drawbacks and other obstacles to the
    implementation of IoT. Type Drawbacks and obstacles Environmental Use of harmful
    substances and non-degradable resources Hardware power consumption IoT node software
    energy consumption IoT protocol energy efficiency Other Lack of standardization
    and technological knowledge among partners Data availability High financial investment
    Security of virtual platform Inadequate internet connectivity 4.1. Environmental
    drawbacks One of the drawbacks of IoT-enabled business models includes the energy
    use of IoT and related carbon emissions, such as IoT hardware, node software and
    protocol energy consumption (Fraga-Lamas et al., 2021). Hardware is the basis
    for the IoT network, and both hardware and software needs to be optimized together
    to re duce environmental burdens. Such optimizations are particularly important
    for certain digital signal processing tasks, including compression, feature extraction,
    or machine learning training. The IoT is also dependent on protocols that enable
    communicating between the various nodes and routing devices involved in an IoT
    network. In terms of software implementation, these protocols must be energy-efficient
    and should minimize the use of communication interfaces. Next to this, IoT equipment
    may result in difficult to process electronic waste. An example consists of RFID
    tags that are hazardous to the environment and are difficult to recycle (Yu et
    al., 2022). Another concern is that IoT enables mass customization. Customization
    makes it more difficult for another user to reuse or recycle an item (Birkel et
    al., 2019). A key observation is that many studies do not take into account such
    environmental drawbacks of implementing IoT technology (i.e., the impact of producing
    or using IoT devices, etc.). Some preliminary analyses have been presented in
    the literature. For instance, Mataloto et al. (2019) discovered that IoT devices
    (LoRa) for energy management systems require an annual energy usage of 5.2 kWh
    if applied in small buildings (16–40 m2). Bottani et al. (2014) assessed the environmental
    performance and burdens of the use of RFID tags in a fresh milk supply chain based
    on life cycle assessment (LCA) and found that the environmental costs of 1 million
    RFID tags are 32,900 kg CO2-eq in climate change potential, 23.9 kg P-eq in freshwater
    eutrophication, and 156 molc H + -eq in acidification potential. Comparatively
    to the existing studies, there is a dearth of papers that examine the positive
    and negative contributions of IoT to CBM via case studies or simulations. This
    involves not only a full examination of its production, transportation, disposal,
    and reuse synergies, but also an evaluation of the LCA of IoT components. 4.2.
    Other obstacles Next to environmental drawbacks the literature we reviewed gave
    some more general implementation obstacles with regard to the use of IoT in CBMs.
    Firstly, there is often a lack of structured data management processes to ensure
    the acquisition of high-quality data for industrial analysis (Ingemarsdotter et
    al., 2020). Due to the limited availability and variety of industrial data, evaluating
    and validating representative models of real-world systems can be difficult, i.e.,
    determining when sufficient data has been acquired to ensure the representativeness
    of a simulation framework. (Fisher et al., 2020). Secondly, the absence of standardization
    and guidance in implementing IoT across various businesses poses a concern. There
    can be a lack of regulations addressing data ownership among stakeholders (Astill
    et al., 2019). The wide implementation of CE strategies is contingent upon solving
    such data ownership issues. Thirdly, ensuring privacy and data security poses
    a challenge (Roy and Roy, 2019). End-users as intermediate nodes in the manufacturing
    and remanufacturing cycle and vulnerable firewall nodes can be susceptible to
    botnet assaults (Tuptuk and Hailes, 2018). One typical case is the IoT botnet
    Mirai, a malware that could target consumer electronics and home routers, turning
    them into a zombie remotely controlled bots that can be used in large-scale network
    attacks (Antonakakis et al., 2017). Such challenges may be solved by IoT projects
    funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research program, it includes the
    European Cloud Initiative, the GAIA-X initiative, as well as public-private partnerships
    such as the Smart Networks and Services JU and the AI, Big Data and Robotics (Calisti,
    2020). These projects are expected to use distributed AI, address security, privacy
    and trust requirements by design and allow for new de-centralized topologies and
    governance. In addition, it is challenging to rapidly design IoT-enabled products
    for interoperability, adaptability, and upgradability (Ingemarsdotter et al.,
    2020). Currently, potential solutions tend to point at blockchain technology.
    However, integrating blockchain within the IoT framework will also pose technical,
    infrastructure, energy consumption, interoperability and social regulatory issues
    (Feng et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Venkatesh et al., 2020). The last impediment
    are the limited resources small-scale enterprises can invest systematically in
    IoT technologies throughout their entire supply chains (Tan et al., 2020). 5.
    Conclusion and outlook This review has assessed the state-of-the-art relation
    of IoT and CBM from several perspectives. Based on the Prisma approach, this article
    reviews the literature on the IoT and CBMs that has been expanding significantly
    in recent years. Through the classification of their methods and contents, this
    paper constructed a mapping framework connecting the ReSOLVE concept with four
    IoT capabilities and the 6 R framework. It depicts the current research status
    of IoT supported CBMs and explains their contribution for enterprises from the
    perspective of 6 R with representative cases. IoT by its support of joint interoperability
    for system optimization, timely monitoring and tracking, has contributed to the
    enhancement of industrial efficiency, recycling, and the reduction of unnecessary
    material and energy use. These characteristics of IoT support the implementation
    and success of CBMs, particularly the Loop and Optimize CBMs. These conclusions
    are similar to those of previously published studies. However, the dynamic feedback
    potential of the IoT also proves to be vital for the “Redesign” of product or
    service concepts, especially for Virtualize, Share and Exchange models which have
    not been fully explored before. Therefore, we revealed potential directions based
    on these preliminary studies: For instance, in the Share approach, IoT helps to
    provide a sharing platform that enables consumers to share products, essentially
    providing the same amount of final services with a smaller product pool. The IoT
    also provides virtual and dematerialized options as service solutions rather than
    physical products with similar functions to achieve design evolution capability,
    supporting the “Redesign” CE strategy through the combination of other I4.0 technologies
    such as DT. The review of quantitative assessments suggests that IoT has the potential
    to reduce the energy consumption of the Optimize and Loop business model by about
    20–30%. By redesigning and integrating IoT and IoT-based algorithms into business
    operations, the energy efficiency of the system can be greatly increased. In addition,
    IoT can help to minimize waste generation and enhance efficiency of resource use.
    However, the widespread usage of IoT and related data processing activities in
    itself can lead to higher energy use and generation of e-waste, which often is
    difficult to recycle. IoT also poses a number of obstacles for its cross-business
    applications, including the difficulties of establishing universal standards for
    data processing, cybersecurity liability issues, and relatively high investment
    costs. These assessments of strengths and challenges of IoT can provide more intuitive
    information for SMEs investors who are interested in innovative technologies and
    circular development. 6. Limitations and recommendations This research has limitations
    as well. Firstly, given the fact that the research on the interaction between
    the IoT and CE is still in its infancy, most of the references discuss conceptual
    frameworks, models and theoretical evaluations, and just a few case studies. Most
    case studies only explore one or a few technical applications of IoT, these limits
    the value of meta-analyses as attempted in this paper. Particularly for the Virtualize,
    Exchange and Regenerate CBMs the number of available cases was low. We hence recommend
    a more systematic, quantitative analysis of case studies on how IoT can contribute
    to CBMs and environmental improvements. Secondly, the literature gives just limited
    information on the environmental drawbacks of IoT. Some studies on e.g., RFID
    suggest that their production and use generate just limited environmental damage
    (Jia et al., 2012). However, to analyze the environmental benefits and drawbacks
    of IoT comprehensively, further research is needed that should consider specific
    IoT application scenarios, material choices and future improvement potentials
    that may be available due to scale and learning effects. These could become the
    focal points of the future phase of IoT research. Declaration of competing interest

    produced by plant phenomics platforms. • Modular and highly expressive scientific
    workflows are designed to analyze datasets. • Scientific workflows are distributed
    over the Grid using an extensible middleware. • Provenance is managed to allow
    users understand results and ensure reproducibility. Abstract Plant phenotyping
    consists in the observation of physical and biochemical traits of plant genotypes
    in response to environmental conditions. Challenges, in particular in context
    of climate change and food security, are numerous. High-throughput platforms have
    been introduced to observe the dynamic growth of a large number of plants in different
    environmental conditions. Instead of considering a few genotypes at a time (as
    it is the case when phenomic traits are measured manually), such platforms make
    it possible to use completely new kinds of approaches. However, the datasets produced
    by such widely instrumented platforms are huge, constantly augmenting and produced
    by increasingly complex experiments, reaching a point where distributed computation
    is mandatory to extract knowledge from data. In this paper, we introduce InfraPhenoGrid,
    the infrastructure we designed and deploy to efficiently manage datasets produced
    by the PhenoArch plant phenomics platform in the context of the French Phenome
    Project. Our solution consists in deploying scientific workflows on a Grid using
    a middleware to pilot workflow executions. Our approach is user-friendly in the
    sense that despite the intrinsic complexity of the infrastructure, running scientific
    workflows and understanding results obtained (using provenance information) is
    kept as simple as possible for end-users. Previous article in issue Next article

    Biological research derives its findings from the proper analysis of experiments.
    However, over the last three decades, both throughput of experiments (from single
    observations to terabytes of sequences of images produced during a single day)
    and the breadth of questions studied (from single molecules to entire genomes)
    have increased tremendously. One of the main challenges remains to efficiently
    analyze, simulate and model such big datasets while keeping scientist users in
    the loop. In this paper we introduce InfraPhenoGrid, the infrastructure we designed
    and deployed to efficiently manage and analyze datasets produced by the PhenoArch
    plant phenomics platform. In this context, one difficulty remains to enable users
    to analyze, simulate and model increasingly huge datasets on a more frequent base.
    More precisely, the design of InfraPhenoGrid is driven by three needs, described
    here-after. First, management of large-scale experiments involving possibly large
    numbers of interlinked tools has to be supported. Users should be able to analyze
    and simulate complex structural-functional relationships of plant architectures,
    integrating multi-disciplinary models developed by different teams. Experiments
    should be easy to design by users and it is important that over time they can
    be changed, adapted to new needs (new analysis algorithms are constantly available),
    and then shared. As a result, the first brick of our infrastructure is a Scientific
    Workflow System. Second, each experiment can be replayed several times, varying
    datasets and/or parameter settings. Keeping track of the exact datasets and parameter
    settings used to produce a given result (provenance) is of paramount importance
    for scientists to ensure the results’ reproducibility and allow to properly interpret
    and understand them. The possibility of comparing results, obtained on several
    experiments when varying datasets and/or parameter settings are used, is another
    need directly associated with provenance. Consequently, the second brick of our
    infrastructure is a Provenance Layer. Last but not least, our infrastructure has
    to efficiently deal with the analysis of huge datasets, possibly acquired on multiple
    sites. Analysis may involve combining data produced by platforms with completely
    different kinds of data, including data obtained from public data sources. Data
    acquisition is fast compared to the time needed to analyze them. The size of datasets
    has reached a turning point at which local infrastructures are no longer sufficient
    to provide adequate computational power and storage facilities. Hence, distributed
    computation has become a major requirement. However, deploying jobs on a parallel
    environment might be complex for end users. Therefore the third brick of our infrastructure
    introduces a Middleware able to pilot the execution of jobs on parallel (Grid)
    environments. This paper is organized as follows: Section  2 introduces the precise
    context of this work, that is, the Phenome Project, PhenoArch platform and one
    use case of interest. Section  3 describes in detail the architecture of InfraPhenoGrid.
    Section  4 demonstrates the benefit of using our solution for managing plant phenomic
    datasets. Section  5 provides related work while Section  6 concludes the paper
    and draws perspectives. 2. Use case 2.1. The Phenome project and the PhenoArch
    platform Selecting genotypes that maintain and increase crop performance is a
    particularly challenging and important topic in the context of societal challenges
    such as climate change adaptation, food security and preserving natural resources.
    A large variety of tasks have to be performed to collect information on plant
    traits (called phenotyping), including measuring the size of the leaves, counting
    the number of tails…. Performing such tasks manually makes it impossible to consider
    more than a few plants at a time and it thus cruelly confines the kind of analyses
    that can be conducted. In the meantime, massive plant phenotyping in the field,
    that is, the evaluation of crop performance (yield) of millions of plants in a
    large range of environmental and climatic scenarios, has been very efficient for
    driving plant breeding. However plant breeding is now facing a stagnation of genetic
    progress in several species. New strategies, such as genomic selection, are now
    evolving to directly link the allelic composition of a genome, available at much
    higher throughput and lower cost than field phenotyping, to crop performance.
    The existence of large marker–environment interactions, i.e. the fact that a given
    combination of markers has very different genetic values depending on the climatic
    scenario, lead concomitantly to a revolution in phenotyping strategies. Such strategies
    aim to capture under controlled conditions, the genetic variability of plant responses
    to environmental factors for thousands of plants (reference panels), hence identifying
    more heritable traits for genomic selection. This first implies the necessity
    to automate quantification of a large number of traits, to characterize plant
    growth, plant development and plant functioning. Second, it requires a tight control
    or at least accurate measurement of environmental conditions as sensed by plants.
    It finally requires fluent and versatile interactions between data and continuously
    evolving plant response models. Such interactions are essential to be considered
    in the analysis of a given marker–environment interaction and in the integration
    of processes to predict genetic values of allelic combinations in different environment
    scenarios. High-throughput phenotyping platforms have thus been designed to allow
    growing and observing traits of a large number of plants. These platforms provide
    many measurements and imaging functionalities for different plant species grown
    in various environmental conditions. They potentially allow to assess the genetic
    variability of plant responses to environmental conditions using novel genetic
    approaches requiring a large number of genotypes. Nine of such platforms, distributed
    over various regions of France, are gathered in the Phenome project (Fig. 1).
    More precisely, Phenome consists of two controlled condition platforms (greenhouses
    with automated irrigation, control and temperature control) for 1900 plants, two
    field platforms (800 plots) equipped with environment control ( enrichment, automated
    rain shelters) and three larger field platforms (2000 plots) that use natural
    gradients of water availability or soil contents. All these platforms are equipped
    with environmental sensors and permit automated imaging of plants in one or multiple
    wavelengths (thus allowing functional analysis) using robots to convey plants
    (for green houses) or to carry instruments to automatically acquire data in the
    field (Phenomobile, drones). Finally two supporting omic platforms enable us to
    centralize and optimize high throughput metabolomic and structural measurements
    associated with the experiments. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Location
    of Phenome platforms, superimposed on a map of mean temperature in France. Phenome
    platforms are representative of the variability of temperature. They also represent
    different risks of water deficit. The work depicted in this paper is related to
    the PhenoArch platform,1 in the south of France (Montpellier). As depicted in
    Fig. 2, PhenoArch is composed of a conveyor belt storage structure of 28 lanes
    carrying 60 carts each (i.e. total of 1680 pots), and a conveyor belt system that
    feeds either the imaging or the watering units. The imaging unit consists of a
    3-D image acquisition cabin with top and side channel. Five water units consist
    of five weighing terminals and five high-precision watering pump-stations, as
    shown in Fig. 2. PhenoArch measures traits associated to the plants’ adaptation
    to climate change with a throughput of 1650 plants per day. Typical measured variables
    include the timing of the plant cycle (leaf appearance, duration of phenological
    phases), plant growth rate in terms of area and volume, plant organ expansion
    and plant morphology (angles, shape of leaves). The automated irrigation system
    allows to control various water supply scenarios and estimates the responses of
    these traits to water availability. Plants are imaged every day from 12 lateral
    and one apical view (20 000 images per day are produced), which allow reconstructing
    a digital ‘avatar’ of each plant of the platform. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Phenoarch phenotyping platform. Three main categories of workflows
    have to be executed: The first series of workflows is related to data acquisition
    in order to collect, describe, and organize datasets while being acquired. The
    second category consists in gathering, standardizing, and making available produced
    datasets. The third category aims at finding answers to research questions: analyzing
    results obtained and combining such data with other datasets to extract knowledge.
    Workflows then need to combine highly heterogeneous data, from very different
    sources such as manual samplings, readings, and human observations at different
    scales (populations, plants, organs, tissues, cells, etc.) and at different times
    and stages. Such data can be either comparative (mutant versus wild type), absolute
    (days to flowering of a cultivar) or relative (relative growth per day). Extensive
    connections to large sets of data types are also mandatory (seed stocks, genes,
    experimental methods, publications, etc.) leading to major data integration research
    questions  [1] and calling for a new generation of analysis tools. 2.2. Image
    analysis workflow As an example, we describe one of the elementary workflows,
    that mostly consists of an image analysis step targeting the estimation of plant
    leaf area. Most of the raw data (images) are indeed not used directly, but processed
    with an image analysis pipeline to get a trait, and then further analyzed with
    a response model. Analyzing images is part of the important steps of the experiments
    to be performed. It is shared between many workflows and used to produce the traits
    measurements. A very large variety of algorithms may be used to extract relevant
    information from image analysis. Dedicated plant phenotype commercial packages
    use basic functions to estimate total biovolume and leaf area for example. However
    current research provides a new landscape of algorithms. They make the link with
    ecophysiological models and allow to perform a more precise analysis of plant
    traits. In this context, it is particularly important to allow users to test and
    compare algorithms on their datasets. Despite its simplicity, this use case already
    illustrates one important characteristics of phenotyping analysis, that is the
    intrinsic dependency between data and models. Consecutively such workflows can
    then be completed by other workflows that couple data analysis with a model for
    analyzing the response of plant expansion rate to temperature and water availability
    or with an integrative model, in a simulation context. Furthermore, such a kind
    of in-silico experiment can be considered in much wider contexts. For instance,
    after an initial segmentation of organs in the image, the global architecture
    of the plant can be reconstructed. This 3D reconstruction can be interfaced with
    canopy-level models of light interception to gain access to physiological parameters
    like intercepted light and radiation use efficiency for example. Hence both geometrical
    parameters attached to a plant (e.g., leaf surface area) and physiological parameters
    (e.g., photosynthesis) can be tracked throughout time and correlated with genotypes.
    All these steps are particularly challenging and involve multi-disciplinary teams
    (biology, statistics, geometry, bioinformatics, computer science…). 2.3. User
    requirements In the introduction we have presented the three main high-level requirements
    we followed to design InfraPhenoGrid: (i) the ability for users to design and
    exchange experiments where a very large number of tools are interlinked (handled
    by a workflow management system), (ii) the ability for users to reproduce experiments
    and understand the result obtained by such experiments (handled by a provenance
    layer), and (iii) the ability to deal with large-scale experiments involving masses
    of data (handled by parallel computing environments). In this subsection we provide
    precision on the PhenoArch users’ requirements. A   Transparent, Familiar   and   Flexible   Working
    Environment: The classical users of the PhenoArch platform are bioinformaticians,
    mainly Python programmers (strongly involved in the design of Jupyter/IPython
    notebooks  [2], [3]), statisticians, image analysts and more generally modelers,
    all closely connected to the Plant community. They are already very familiar with
    the OpenAlea workflow system and in particular they are frequent users of some
    analysis tools and libraries provided by OpenAlea. InfraPhenoGrid should thus
    be designed to be as transparent as possible for users, that is, to allow them
    continuing working in the same environment. However, we want our infrastructure
    to be flexible to use other workflow systems and/or libraries both for our current
    users to discover them and to welcome next generation users. An   Adaptable Operational   Infrastructure:
    Faced with the amount of data to be analyzed, the computing infrastructure of
    InfraPhenoGrid has to be designed in an operational distributed infrastructure,
    already used in similar projects. While a National (European) and Open infrastructure
    has to be favored in a first time, InfraPhenoGrid should be adaptable to both
    Grid and Cloud solutions. A Reproducibility-Friendly Infrastructure: InfraPhenoGrid
    is a workflow infrastructure for plant scientists to analyze their datasets and
    understand them. Tracking data used and produced (Provenance) as well as the exact
    description and environments where the tools have been executed is a crucial need
    and should be done following international standards of the domain. InfraPhenoGrid
    should thus be Reproducibility-Friendly, welcoming to any plugins to export, visualize
    and analyze Provenance information and more generally any tool to enhance reproducibility
    of experiments. 3. InfraPhenoGrid architecture The InfraPhenoGrid we designed
    to manage and analyze plant phenotyping datasets is an infrastructure based on
    a number of layers of abstractions. First, computational methods for analysis
    and simulation are expressed by means of scientific workflows (in the OpenAlea
    workflow system). Second, a middleware (SciFloware) maps, manages and optimizes
    the execution of scientific workflows on distributed environments. Third, a provenance
    layer captures the workflow execution and reports it to users to further understand
    and explore results of the computation. Last, a large scale infrastructure, the
    Grid (France-Grilles) allows to have access to a shared, extensible and very large
    computational power and storage. France-Grilles makes use of two other important
    components, namely, DIRAC and iRODS. DIRAC (Distributed Infrastructure with Remote
    Agent Control)  [4] is a framework for distributed computing particularly well-suited
    to deal with large communities of users. iRODS (integrated Rule-Oriented Data
    System)  [5] is a scalable open-source data management software used by research
    organizations and government agencies worldwide. The focus of iRODS is data. It
    provides data discovery using a metadata catalog that describes every file, directory,
    and storage resource in the data grid. iRODS is also in charge of implementing
    data virtualization. (iRODS will be described in more details in Section  3.3)
    More precisely, the architecture of InfraPhenoGrid is depicted in Fig. 3. Circled
    numbers are related to steps described here-after. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. InfraPhenoGrid architecture. The user interacts with InfraPhenoGrid
    in a visual programming environment (step 1) by designing a workflow specification
    from scratch or by selecting an existing workflow in the library of available
    workflows. To run the workflow, the user has to select the datasets to be taken
    as input by the workflow at execution time. The distributed infrastructure is
    thus transparent for the end-user. Selecting a dataset in InfraPhenoGrid actually
    corresponds to sending a request to iRODS to concretely get the data (step 2).
    Resources have then to be allocated; this is performed by DIRAC (step 3). On each
    allocated worker or job, OpenAlea workflows are deployed by copying an image from
    iRODS so that an OpenAlea server is launched (step 4). OpenAlea servers then register
    to SciFloware (step 5) which is in charge to distribute computations of possible
    subparts of the workflow to the different OpenAlea servers (step 6). The workflow
    is then concretely executed on the Grid (step 7). At this stage, provenance information
    and all information on jobs are stored and available on iRODS. The next subsections
    present with more details and discuss the choices we made on the major components
    of InfraPhenoGrid, namely, the OpenAlea workflow system, the SciFloware middleware
    and the data management and provenance layer. 3.1. Scientific workflow management
    system: OpenAlea OpenAlea—A system targeted to the plant community. The OpenAlea
    scientific workflow system is a component-based architecture implemented as a
    set of pure Python packages  [6]. The visual programming environment and graphical
    user interface (GUI) is implemented using the PyQt toolkit, a Python binding to
    the Qt application framework. OpenAlea is portable and available on Linux, Windows,
    and MacOS/X. OpenAlea has been in constant use since 2004 by users of the French
    Plant science community but not only since the system has been downloaded 618
    000 times and the web site counts international 10 000 unique visitors a month
    according to the OpenAlea web repository (https://gforge.inria.fr). OpenAlea is
    distributed under a free software license (L-GPL) and maintained and developed
    by a group of 20 active developers from different research institutes and universities.
    Development is performed under a collaborative scheme with shared methodologies
    (best practices). Coding sprints are regularly organized by various sub-groups
    of developers (pair programming and test driven development) and scientists (biologists
    and mathematicians). OpenAlea tools (e.g., models, workflows, components) are
    published and shared on the web both through the main OpenAlea web repository
    and through web sites of groups which use and contribute to OpenAlea without being
    concretely partners of the OpenAlea project.2 As a consequence, more than 60 researchers
    have contributed to OpenAlea packages, in France and internationally, published
    through large meta-packages (e.g., Alinea to simulate ecophysiological and agronomical
    processes and VPlants to analyze, model and simulate plant architecture and its
    development) to ease the installation for end-users. The strong and long-term
    experience of PhenoArch users and their international collaborators with both
    using and developing workflows in OpenAlea made us choose OpenAlea as the workflow
    system for InfraPhenoGrid. The main technical features of OpenAlea are described
    here after. Using OpenAlea (Designing workflows). From an end-user point-of-view,
    the first feature of OpenAlea exploited is its visual programming environment
    (part A of Fig. 4) where users are provided with a set of predefined workflows
    and libraries of tools (part B of Fig. 4) to be combined to form new workflows.
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Main graphical user interface of OpenAlea.
    Users can design and interact with workflows in A. The package manager is in part
    B and provides users with the structured list of tools available and the list
    of existing workflows. On part C is the Python interpreter, where OpenAlea actors
    can be designed. Dotted lines denotes widgets. Users can create new wrapped tools
    by implementing them in Python (in part C of Fig. 4). Each tool and workflow is
    associated with some documentation and saved. Ports of actors are typed and widgets
    can be associated with data types to allow users interaction with the data. Workflow
    specification. From a more formal point-of-view, in OpenAlea, a workflow is classically
    represented as a directed multi-graph. Each node is called an actor and represents
    a task to be executed (a.k.a. component or activity). Each node has a name, a
    function object (a functor, a program, a Web Service or a composite actor), and
    an explicitly defined set of input and output ports. Directed edges are data links
    which connect output to input ports. While OpenAlea can be classically used to
    perform data analysis as in other workflow systems such as Galaxy  [7], Taverna  [8]
    or Kepler  [9], its originality lies in its ability to handle loops expressing
    retro-action  [10]. In other words, OpenAlea is able to deal with simulation and
    modeling. Iteration is handled by introducing a specific kind of actor, called
    dataflow variable . It allows to specify that, at a given port, an actor receives
    an unbound variable rather than a value. Connecting an X to an actor transforms
    a workflow into a lambda function. It allows to express higher-order programming
    providing control flow behavior using a set of algebraic operators. An algebraic
    operator is an actor that iterates over first-order function calls, and thus takes
    one or more functions as inputs. Ports that require a function have an associated
    semantic type Function. More precisely, the map operator is a higher-order function
    . Its arguments are a function (first port) and a set of elements of type (second
    input port). The map operator applies to each element of the set and returns the
    set of resulting elements of type . In Part A of Fig. 5, two implementations of
    the map operator are provided. The left workflow illustrates the map operator
    running on one single processor while the one on the right hand side illustrates
    the parallel map operator with the same workflow running on 4 processors. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Algebraic operators map (A left), parallel
    map (A right), and reduce (B). Similarly, the reduce operator takes a function
    of two variables and a sequence of elements and returns one element. while is
    an iteration operator that takes three inputs: an initial element , a Boolean
    function and function . It initializes a variable with and iteratively applies
    the function on while is true. Workflow execution. The execution of a given workflow
    in OpenAlea is launched in response to requests for data of one of its actors.
    Such an actor can satisfy the request when the upstream sub-workflow has been
    executed, that is, when all the relevant actors connected to its input ports have
    been executed. When such an actor has received its data on its input ports, it
    executes and places data on its output ports. OpenAlea has introduced -dataflow
    evaluation  [10] which differs from the classical evaluation if the workflow contains
    at least one dataflow variable . The execution is then decomposed into two stages.
    First, for each port of type Function, a sub-workflow is computed if the upstream
    sub-workflow contains at least one dataflow variable. This sub-workflow is defined
    by all the actors needed to produce the data on this port, i.e. the upstream sub-workflow
    and the connected output port. This sub-workflow is dynamically transformed into
    a function (i.e. an actor) of one or several variables corresponding to its dataflow
    variables. Second, the evaluation of this function by algebraic operators consists
    in replacing the variables by real data and evaluating the sub-workflow. Additionally,
    OpenAlea provides several optimizations in the orchestration of the workflow execution
    by allowing actors to be blocked and lazy. If an actor is blocked, the execution
    is not propagated to the upstream sub-workflow and if the actor is lazy, the execution
    is performed only if the actor’s inputs have not changed compared to its previous
    execution. This type of orchestration performs only the operations needed to produce
    the required result, executing the subset of the graph relevant to the output  [11].
    3.2. A middleware for parallel environments: SciFloware The choice of SciFloware.
    As stated in the user requirements, InfraPhenoGrid should be equipped with a system
    able to (i) hide the complexity of the computation and offer transparent access
    to data and tools for end-users, (ii) provide a flexible working environment by
    allowing several workflow systems to be used, (iii) be adaptable to pilot tasks
    both on Grid and Cloud infrastructures. Using and tuning such kind of systems
    remains a very difficult task. Our research groups have recently developed SciFloware,
    a generic lightweight middleware able to coordinate and pilot the tasks to be
    executed in a transparent way for the user. SciFloware is based on the Shared-data
    Overlay Network  [12] (SON) which follows a Software as a Service (SaaS) model,
    eliminating the need to install and maintain the software and allows users to
    run HPC programs through graphical interfaces (e.g., graphical interfaces of scientific
    workflow management systems). SciFloware has been chosen to be the InfraPhenoGrid
    middleware, because it was a system we are familiar with and it matched our demands
    on requirements. The technical features of SciFloware are described here after.
    Internal representation of workflows in SciFloware. SciFloware has been designed
    to allow interoperability of different workflow systems. In absence of standards
    to represent scientific workflows,3 SciFloware defines its own XML workflow specification
    to describe a master workflow. A master workflow is a meta-level workflow used
    to orchestrate and compose concrete workflows. Each workflow is run independently
    by different scientific workflow systems. As an example, in Fig. 6, the SciFloware
    master workflow consists of four steps, including steps and (sub-workflows of
    the master workflow) which are respectively executed by the X workflow system
    (for the a sub-workflow) and the OpenAlea workflow system (for the b sub-workflow).
    More precisely, SciFloware is responsible for (i) sending to workflow systems
    the execution of such two master sub-workflows with the right input data produced
    by the previous executed master workflow step, (ii) collecting output data generated
    at the end of each execution of the sub-workflows, and (iii) launching the execution
    of the last step of the master workflow with such collected data. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 6. SciFloware distributed middleware. While OpenAlea has
    been the first workflow system orchestrated by SciFloware (based on our user requirements),
    Galaxy  [7] and Taverna  [8] are currently under consideration (to play the role
    as “X workflow system” in Fig. 6). Algebraic expressions in SciFloware. SciFloware
    uses a relational data model and an algebraic language to represent data-intensive
    scientific workflows  [13]. Data flows are represented as relations and workflow
    nodes and activities as algebraic expressions. A relation is a set of tuples composed
    of basic attributes (e.g., int, float, string, file references). An algebraic
    expression consists of algebraic activities, additional operands, operators, input
    relations and output relations. It is comprised of a workflow, a program or an
    SQL expression, with input and output relation schemes. More precisely, SciFloware
    provides six algebraic operators: Map, SplitMap, Reduce, Filter, SRQuery and MRQuery.
    The semantics of these operators has been defined in  [13]. Software as a Service,
    communication with workflow systems. As previously stated, SciFloware is particularly
    modular, following the SAAS (“Software as a Service”) principle. SciFloware is
    a service-and-component-based distributed architecture and built from software
    components. Each component provides services to other components of the workflow.
    A service is a self-contained unit of functionality which exposes components through
    well-defined interfaces. SciFloware provides services that can be combined to
    build large distributed applications. In InfraPhenoGrid, SciFloware runs on a
    dedicated server and provides a registration service, where distributed workers
    can register themselves. Using a communication protocol, SciFloware distributes
    the computation among workers, with each worker running behind a dedicated server.
    The tech stack (e.g., authentification) is implemented using services and can
    easily be evolved further. More precisely, three main kinds of services are considered
    in SciFloware: algebraic operators, scientific workflow systems and the communication
    protocol between algebraic operators and workflow systems. SciFloware schedules
    the computation using algebraic operators. Services associated with these are
    managed by the SciFloware server. Each component has its own decentralized execution
    strategy, which allows to simply distribute the execution on several sites. A
    component type is associated with each algebraic operator. For example, the Map
    operator has an associated map type of component, with an input and output service
    for relations and a service to schedule activity among workers. As for workflow
    systems, each worker runs a service, running a workflow within a given workflow
    system. It receives a workflow description and input data IDs and returns the
    produced output data. On a Grid infrastructure, workers will run on different
    nodes, each one executing its own server to communicate with SciFloware. Eventually,
    a set of services have been defined to manage communication between SciFloware
    and different workflow systems. Using these, SciFloware can request the execution
    of a workflow on any workflow system server, or be notified at the end of the
    execution of an OpenAlea workflow. Other services manage database relationships
    and communication protocols. Fig. 7 illustrates a case where a component manages
    local task executions depending on a given algebraic operator. More precisely,
    in Fig. 7, the Map component distributes the computation among workers (OA servers,
    that is, OpenAlea servers) depending on its own scheduling policy. Download :

    on the Grid with SciFloware. SciFloware allows new components to be added and
    instantiated dynamically to extend the middleware. SciFloware Architecture. The
    SciFloware architecture is composed of the following components (see Fig. 8):
    • Algebraic Operators. For each algebraic operator, a specific component type
    is associated, which can be instantiated several times during the execution of
    a given workflow. • Execution Manager. The Execution Manager takes in a workflow
    specification and instantiates the needed components (i.e. workflows or part-of
    workflows), such as the algebraic components. A message is sent to trigger execution
    of the first workflow component. The Execution Manager also manages and runs the
    available OpenAlea servers. At each registration of an instance of an OpenAlea
    server, a worker component is added to the list of available workers. • Data Manager.
    The Data Manager provides workers with access to the storage database. Download

    SciFloware. The implementation of SciFloware is based on the Shared-data Overlay
    Network (SON)  [12], written in JAVA, fully integrated into the Eclipse environment
    and implemented on top of OSGi.4 The communication protocol between SciFloware
    and scientific workflow systems being run on different workers use a REST (Representational
    State Transfer) interface. The RESTfull communication protocol is used to register
    new workers, exchange the workflow specification and the data identifiers stored
    on iRODS and start and stop the execution. Each service in SciFloware is described
    using description files similar to the Web Service Definition Language (WSDL).
    Each SciFloware component has an associated description file defining the required
    and provided services. SON is used for the internal composition of SciFloware
    components. SON allows to build an application following the SAAS model (Software
    as a Service) using a set of components that can be executed in a distributed
    way (e.g., Peer-to-Peer) on a Grid or on a Cloud infrastructure. The SON middleware
    allows to define new component types by specifying the services offered by each
    type. During execution it allows to dynamically combine different component instances
    and to manage the life cycle of these components (create, init, stop,…). Concerning
    the authorization framework, SciFloware uses OAuth2  [14] to enable safe registration
    of the OpenAlea servers to SciFloware. The OAuth2 flow used is the Resource Owner
    Password Credentials Grant flow.5 During the deployment of the OpenAlea server,
    the user provides its SciFloware’s username and password. At startup, each OpenAlea
    server requests an access token from SciFloware using login authentication. After
    registration, all the communication between SciFloware and OpenAlea is mediated
    through iRODS, whose access requires authentication based on certificates delivered
    by the French Grid Certification Authority. As for the Data Manager component,
    it has been extended to support iRODS. The connection with iRODS is established
    using the REST interface. iRODS is the focus of the next subsection. Packaging
    OpenAlea into a virtual environment. OpenAlea and all its dependencies have been
    built and packaged into a virtual environment  [15] on a virtual machine. The
    operating system (i.e., a scientific Linux version 6) of the virtual machine is
    the same as the one deployed on each worker of the Grid. The virtual environment
    is packed and stored on iRODS. When a worker is reserved by DIRAC, the bundle
    is uploaded locally and uncompressed. A shell script updates the environment variables
    and an OpenAlea server is launched. This method has been preferred to virtualization
    (e.g., vagrant or docker  [16]) for performance reasons and because all the workers
    have the same operating system. The size of the compressed bundle containing all
    the packages and their dependencies is 210 MB. The latency (or delay) due to the
    copy of the bundle from iRODS and its installation is less than 1 min, while each
    worker is deployed once for a maximum of 24 h. 3.3. Data management and provenance
    Data management with iRODS. As previously stated, iRODS (v3.3) is an open-source
    data system chosen by France-Grilles for its ability to provide a technology enabling
    data and policy virtualization for multiple and geographically separated users  [17].
    iRODS federates distributed and heterogeneous data resources into a single logical
    file system and provides a modular interface to integrate new client-side applications.
    iRODS does not only allow the worker nodes of the grid infrastructure to access
    datasets but it provides end-users with access to data, through GUI, while enabling
    user to annotate such datasets with rich metadata. Both input data and the results
    of a scientific workflow computation associated with their provenance are stored
    on iRODS. This drastically reduces the volume of data to be transferred through
    SciFloware to launch a computation and retrieve its result (only the address of
    data in the central catalog has to be exchanged). We also implemented a communication
    protocol by file to bypass the limitations enforced by the Grid on network communications.
    Provenance Layer. One of the major aims of our infrastructure is to be reproducibility-friendly   [18].
    The starting point to make a scientific result reproducible is to keep track of
    the exact datasets and exact tools (including parameter settings) used to obtain
    a given data item. To answer such needs a Provenance Layer has been designed and
    implemented in our infrastructure. A layer currently has two main components:
    a provenance model, based on the W3C standard PROV  [19] and a notebook generator,
    able to automatically generate notebooks from some workflow executions. The Provenance
    layer is flexible in the sense that new modules taking in PROV data and making
    it possible to visualize and analyze provenance information can be integrated.
    While iRODS is in charge of concretely managing data, the provenance module reconstructs
    (by querying iRODS) the history of each data item. In other words, the provenance
    module is able to provide for each produced data item the exact series of workflow
    node executions, including the datasets used as input of such nodes. Such provenance
    information is represented according to the W3C PROV standard  [19]. Both prospective
    (the workflow specification) and retrospective (execution and datasets) provenance
    are stored. Notebooks generator. The second component of the provenance layer
    aims at helping the PhenoArch users understand the results they obtained by allowing
    them to visualize and interact with the main steps of the process used to produce
    such results. In other words, we want PhenoArch users to be able to interact and
    visualize (part of) the execution of some workflows to follow how some final results
    have been obtained. The current solution used by an increasing number of scientists
    to answer such kinds of need is to (manually) design notebooks using the Jupyter/IPython
    Notebook web application  [2]. From a developer point-of-view, a notebook is a
    JSON document (convertible into a number of open standard output formats including
    HTML, LaTeX, PDF … and which can be designed using a web-base user interface)
    containing an ordered list of input/output cells with iPython code able to generate
    text, mathematics, plots and rich media (images, video…). From an end-user point-of-view,
    a notebook is a rich web page, where code, text, mathematics, plots and multimedia
    (images, video…) can be displayed and interacted with. In particular any user
    can modify the input of a notebook cell to observe the impact of this change on
    the objects displayed (e.g., plots). In InfraPhenoGrid, we implement a notebook
    generator where a set of OpenAlea workflow executions are automatically converted
    into Jupyter/ IPython notebooks. More precisely, the generator (i) converts each
    OpenAlea workflow actor (natively coded in Python) into an IPython cell and (ii)
    queries iRODS to extract automatically information on input and output datasets
    respectively used and produced by the execution of each OpenAlea actor. Users
    can then visualize and interact with data used and produced during an execution.
    A concrete example of generated notebooks is provided in the next section (Results).
    4. Results In this section, we present the benefits of using InfraPhenoGrid in
    Plant Phenotyping by showing how the various components of our infrastructure
    make it possible to perform complex experiments on huge datasets. Designing workflow.
    Fig. 9 provides an example of a workflow designed and executed by our end-users
    to estimate the growth of a plant. Such a workflow starts with querying iRODS
    to get input data (“import image” node). In this concrete example, the 1407th
    individual plant of genotype A310 has been considered. As a consequence, “1407”
    and “A310” appears in the name of the actors of the workflow. The import image
    node returns a time series of images. Each acquisition, taken every two days,
    records pictures of the plant at various angles by rotating the plant. The node
    keys returns the order sets of the dates, while values returns a list of images
    corresponding to the different side views of the growing plant, along time. The
    map node applies the sub-workflow illustrated on Part B of Fig. 9 on each set
    of images of the time series. The result is a list of estimated areas of the individual
    plant over time. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Workflow. Part A
    represents the main workflow while Part B is a sub-workflow corresponding to the
    node “area estimation” of workflow A. Part C depicts one of the set of real images
    of a plant of a given genotype obtained from the imaging system of the phenoarch
    platform. D represents the binary image. E plots the growth of the plant. The
    node represents a dataflow variable and abstracts the sub-workflow (part B) as
    a function. The sub-workflow B implements a mean-shift algorithm. It receives
    the multiple views of the plant at a given time. All these views are combined
    (node cv_mean) using an OpenCV algorithm to separate the plant from the cabin
    background in the image. The macro_side_binarization node subtracts the cabin
    background of each image and the “green” pixels are counted (countNonZero). Again,
    the map algebraic operator is used to run the same treatment on a set of images.
    Note that the mean shift algorithm is only computed once due to lazy evaluation.
    The binary image (Part D) is produced by one execution of the macro_side_binarization
    for each lateral perspective image using an optimized HSV segmentation algorithm.
    Finally, the plant area node receives as input a number of “green pixels” for
    each plant and estimates, using a linear model, the plant area along its growth
    and development. The PyLabScatter node plots the graph of the growth of the plant
    (Part E) using the MatplotLib library  [20] wrapped within OpenAlea. Exploring
    alternative methods. OpenAlea is modular and allows users to easily test various
    alternative methods. In particular, several variations of sub-workflow B can be
    designed, resulting in the use of several Binarization algorithms (as mentioned
    in Table 1). The results obtained by such variations can then be compared (mainly
    qualitatively) by the user. Table 1. Execution time of the workflow illustrated
    in Fig. 9 with variations of sub-workflow B on one plant measured during one seasonal
    growth (5 weeks). This experiment gathered 124 images. Binarization algorithms
    Time (s) Adaptive threshold  [21] 62.1 HSV  [22] 85.7 Mean shift  [23] 73.9 Exploiting
    the Grid. Execution times of Binarization algorithms reported in Table 1 are related
    to one single plant of one single genotype for which 13 images have been collected
    during one month. The challenge then lies in considering 300 genotypes, with 1900
    plants in each genotype. Per day, a PhenoArch platform produces 20 000 images
    of 50 M, equivalent to 1To/day, 5To/week and 250 To/year. Without any distributed
    infrastructure, processing these huge amounts of data would take between 409 days
    and 565 days (depending on the strategy followed for the sub-workflow B). For
    this project, France-Grilles provides us with 32 000 logical process units. With
    only a subset of this resource (2%), the whole computation, scheduled by SciFloware,
    can be performed in less than 12 h (night time). Exploiting Provenance. During
    any execution, provenance data, that is, all the data items processed and produced
    (including intermediate and final images) are stored on iRODS. Based on this provenance
    information, IPython notebooks are automatically generated for each individual
    plant either at a given time, or for the entire growth period, or for a given
    genotype. Each cell of the notebook contains the script of the workflow node executed.
    The input/output data are direct references to the data produced and stored in
    iRODS. Very interestingly, users can upload a given notebook (see Fig. 10) with
    the corresponding data, and modify the execution parameters directly on their
    computer to visualize the impact of such modifications and better understand their
    results. Thus, biologists can explore the obtained results a posteriori to discover
    for instance why some outliers on the “growth curve” (see Fig. 9(E)) have appeared.
    Reasons for this situation may actually be numerous, including problems occurring
    during acquisition (e.g., the plant may have fallen…), limitation of the method
    used (bugs in the implementation…) or wrong set of parameters. Download : Download

    images displayed correspond to the plant before and after its binarization. The
    total number of pixels of the plant is 87 489, which is the last cell value. 5.
    Discussion In the last ten years, several approaches have been designed to distribute
    scientific workflows on parallel environments. Survey papers and books include  [24],
    [25], [26], [27]. While cloud computing is increasingly used to manage Life Science
    data, our project involves large numbers of production sites and collaborating
    users, and such numbers are growing over time, making Grid technologies particularly
    well-suited  [28]. More precisely, we wrap-up and discuss the four key aspects
    of our approach. First of all, the infrastructure we introduce in this paper works
    on a production environment with real and huge data sets produced on a daily basis.
    In Plant phenotyping, which is a field of growing importance in the context of
    climate change and food security  [29], [30], [31], complex datasets produced
    by high-throughput image based phenotyping platforms need to be combined with
    highly heterogeneous data. In particular, compared to classical bioinformatics
    (largely driven by molecular biology), the need in plant phenomics is on modeling,
    simulation, designing statistical approaches, and performing complex image analysis.
    This poses new challenges in data integration and calls for new kinds of analytical
    tools  [32], [33]. Second, the workflow system we use is well-established in the
    Plant community. It is well-known by our first generation users, and has very
    specific features, making it possible to perform both data analysis and simulation
    (retro-action loops, modeling) while allowing visualization of complex data. As
    shown previously in  [10], [6], OpenAlea belongs to the family of functional workflow
    systems (such as  [9], [34], [35], [36]). It provides a unique solution, which
    is able to extend the dataflow model of computation by introducing higher-order
    language constructs in a visual programming environment, thus allowing to design
    highly expressive workflows in a fully uniform way. Third, while the context of
    this work is data intensive and involves very complex experiments on huge datasets,
    we use a middleware approach to make the distribution and coordination of jobs
    transparent to the user. SciFloware is data-driven  [37] in the sense that its
    internal workflow language clearly separates the definition of data to be processed
    from the graph of activities to be applied to the data. This separation is particularly
    suited to scientific workflows where the same experiment has to be reused for
    analyzing different datasets without any change. Optimization in SciFloware focuses
    on two main aspects: it uses asynchronous messages to execute workflows on a distributed
    infrastructure such as Grid or Cloud  [37], [38]. Furthermore, while it uses generally
    coarse grain parallelism, it is able to exploit the fact that some workflow actors
    may be algebraic operators (i.e., some actors are not black-boxes) to optimize
    the workflow execution. Additionally, basing the SciFloware implementation on
    the middleware SON  [12] which follows the SAAS concept (Software as a Service)
    makes it very modular and flexible. Last but not least, we have developed a large
    series of reproducibility-friendly features. Our approach allows users to share
    their experiments in the spirit of  [39], understand and compare their results  [40]
    and possibly refine their analysis process to augment quality of their data sets.
    To do so, we have followed the recommendations and current standards on provenance  [41],
    [19] and introduced a generator of IPython/Jupyter notebooks  [2]. 6. Conclusion
    High-throughput phenotyping platforms provide a unique and particularly novel
    kind of solution to study the behavior of plants in context of climate change
    and food security. At the same time, size and complexity of datasets produced
    by such platforms are huge, constantly augmenting and the experiments to be performed
    are becoming increasingly complex, posing particularly novel challenges. This
    paper introduces the InfraPhenoGrid infrastructure we designed and deployed to
    efficiently manage the datasets produced by the PhenoArch plant phenomics platform
    in the context of the Phenome Project. Our solution consists in deploying scientific
    workflows on a Grid (France-Grilles) using a middleware to pilot workflow executions.
    InfraPhenoGrid is user-friendly in the sense that despite the intrinsic complexity
    of the infrastructure, running scientific workflows and understanding results
    obtained (using provenance information) is kept as simple as possible for end-users.
    Future work includes considering automatic transformation of scripts designed
    by scientists into OpenAlea scientific workflows to augment the size of the workflow
    library. We are also working on techniques to augment the reuse of workflows (and
    scripts) by guiding the design of such experiments  [42], [43]. Another very important
    point we are actively working on is the reproducibility of scientific results.
    From the data point-of-view, one of the main challenges lies in finding the right
    level of granularity at which visualizing and, to some extent, recording the data  [44].
    Currently, the complete datasets are kept while we investigate several techniques
    (inspired from  [42]) to reduce the amount of data stored while ensuring a good
    level of reproducibility. From the environment point-of-view, we are currently
    able to consider virtual machine techniques to reproduce a given experiment in
    the exact same conditions (same OS, software versions…). Ongoing work includes
    considering techniques to re-execute experiments in new environments, where upgraded
    versions of software are considered  [45]. Acknowledgments The authors acknowledge

    Abstract: In this contribution, an end to end system to enable user interaction
    with a distributed botanical university campus garden is designed, implemented
    and tested. The proposed system employs different wireless links to collect data
    related to different bio physiological parameters of both the vegetation mass
    and the surrounding environment. Detailed analysis of these multilevel communication
    links is performed by using deterministic volumetric wireless channel estimation
    and considering underground, near ground and over ground radio propagation conditions.
    An in-house developed technique enables accurate wireless channel characterization
    for complete campus scenario considering the multiple link types and all its composing
    elements. Node definition and network topology is thus obtained by wireless channel
    analysis of over ground, near ground and underground communication for both 868
    MHz and 2.4 GHz Wireless Sensor Networks in an inhomogeneous vegetation environment.
    Connectivity to enable user interaction as well as for telemetry and tele-control
    purposes within the campus is achieved by combining ZigBee and LoRaWAN transceivers
    with the corresponding sensor/actuator platforms. Coverage studies have been performed
    in order to assess communication capabilities in the set of multiple underground/near
    ground/over ground links, by means of deterministic channel analysis for the complete
    university campus location. Measurement results in lab environment as well as
    full system deployment are presented, showing good agreement with deterministic
    simulations. Moreover, system level tests have been performed over a physical
    campus cloud, providing adequate quality of experience metrics. The proposed solution
    is a scalable system that provides real time trees status monitoring by a cloud-based
    platform, enabling user interaction within a distributed botanical garden environment

    I. Introduction Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are being actively adopted as enablers
    for context monitoring within multiple applications and scenarios, such as environmental
    pollution [1], power grids [2], public safety [3] and agriculture [4]. However,
    the deployment of WSNs in applications focused in vegetation monitoring is challenging,
    considering inherent restrictions in terms of energy source availability, form
    factor and limited computational capacity [5]. In this sense, one of the main
    difficulties is to insure a reliable connection between nodes, especially in dense
    vegetation environments. The presence of foliage in the communication path has
    a direct impact in wireless communication system Quality of Service (QoS) values.
    This generally leads to node densification to increase coverage levels, especially
    in large areas, resulting in additional costs. Discrete scatters such as randomly
    distributed leaves, twigs, branches and tree trunks can cause attenuation, scattering,
    diffraction and absorption of the radiated waves. This severely constrains the
    design of wireless communication systems in inhomogeneous vegetation environments,
    given by the effect of foliage or multipath dispersion, among others [5]–[9].
    In order to provide communication capabilities within large coverage areas, wireless
    sensor networks provide moderate cost, flexible topology and constrained energy
    consumption. Among WSNs, LoRaWAN (Long-Range Wide-Area Network) is a long range,
    low power wireless platform that has become one of the main technologies for Internet
    of Things (IoT) networks worldwide [10], [11]. The works in [12]–[14] present
    the use of LoRaWAN technology in precision agriculture, especially in automate
    irrigation systems, climate and soil parameters monitoring. Moreover, in [15],
    [16] present LoRaWAN based smart sensing systems for environmental monitoring.
    In parallel, universities have been more aware with global warming and climate
    change issues, making more efforts to promote sustainability. The first step universities
    take toward sustainability is campus greening. Thus, campus landscape management
    is important for a green and sustainable campus [17], [18]. Campus Sustainability
    Assessments as Green Metric provide the result of online survey regarding the
    current condition and policies related to Green Campus and Sustainability in Universities
    all over the world [19]. Greenery has been even identified for stress reduction
    and emotional state balance in students [20]. In this context, the use of WSNs
    can provide more information about the state the green zones of the campus, not
    only for monitoring, but also for on-campus botanic tours in a more amenable fashion
    [21]. Considering the characteristics of a university campus in terms of size
    and the existence of multiple distributed sites/buildings, long range, low power
    platforms such as LoRaWAN enable telemetry, tele-control and interactive communication
    systems. The performance of systems that rely on WSNs depends on radio channel
    characterization and on whether vegetation is present or specific requirements
    in terms of underground or near to ground communications are required. In the
    literature, a ray-based model for scattering by tree branches has been developed
    in a pre-existent ray-tracing tool, validated with measurements results in campus
    scenario [22]. LoRa LPWAN measurements have been performed in IIUM campus to study
    the contribution to the path loss of five tree types for propagation channel modelling
    [23], and an IoT based system for water quality monitoring using WSN and RFID
    is deployed in the campus area of the University Sains Malaysia [24]. However,
    no references have been found which explore the complete set of underground, near
    ground and over ground communication links. Since trees monitoring requires measurements
    of various eco-physiological/biological parameters (e.g., stem water content,
    quality/quantity of foliage, soil parameters), sensors should be placed in specific
    locations as a function of vegetation type in order to obtain accurate readings.
    Different approaches have been described, such as a system for measuring the vegetation
    Leaf Area Index with ZigBee based WSN technology [25], a tree health condition
    monitoring system via LoRaWAN [26] or a NB-IoT based tree health monitoring system
    [27]. System deployment within this complex scenario requires accurate propagation
    modeling capabilities for underground, near ground and over-ground links, for
    both Line of Sight (LoS) and Non-Line of Sight (NLoS) cases. Therefore, it is
    compulsory to perform radio propagation analysis when deploying a WSN. The works
    in [28]–[30] analyse the effect of soil and present link quality characterization
    for underground to underground and underground to above ground communication.
    The possibility of using magnetic induction communication for wireless underground
    sensor network designed for irrigation control is addressed in [31]. The works
    in [32]–[34] present near-ground radio channel propagation in the presence of
    vegetation. Furthermore, path loss models for wireless sensor nodes deployed in
    short and tall grass environments are presented in [35], [36]. The works in [37]–[41]
    present wireless propagation measurements and path loss models for WSN in forest
    environments. Table 1 summarizes the research works related to the use of wireless
    communications in vegetation environments. TABLE 1 Related Work In this work,
    a distributed system implemented to enable user interaction with the distributed
    botanical garden at the university campus of the Public University of Navarre
    (UPNA) is presented. Node design and network deployment are optimized by means
    of detailed wireless propagation analysis considering complex operation conditions
    in underground, near ground and over ground communications. To this aim, specific
    characterization and simulation models have been implemented in the framework
    of an in-house implemented deterministic volumetric ray launching simulation tool,
    previously tested in different scenarios, including vegetation [42], [43]. In
    this way, coverage relations are obtained for each communication link type. To
    our knowledge, it is the first time to propose and test the characterization of
    all the communication link types (underground, near ground and over ground) by
    means of deterministic techniques. Experimental and system level validations with
    the implemented testbed have been carried out at the UPNA campus, located in the
    city of Pamplona, Spain. As a final stage, a monitoring distributed wireless system
    has been implemented for the UPNA campus botanical park in addition to the multilevel
    underground, near-ground and over-ground wireless link assessment. Thus the system
    is divided into multiple/seven ZigBee-based zonal collection networks which gather
    the information provided by the sensors deployed on trees, and a LoRaWAN campus-wide
    communication network which sends the information of each ZigBee network to a
    central gateway. The system is completed with the implementation of a real-time
    tree monitoring application, a cloud-based architecture, and a physical cloud
    infrastructure, all of the set allows performing in depth tests and analysis on
    campus premises. In Fig. 1, it is shown a schematic overview of the different
    tasks developed, as well as the results obtained in this work Fig. 1. FIGURE 1.
    Schematic overview of the tasks developed in relation with the design, implementation
    and analysis of the proposed UPNA Smart Campus system. Show All The paper is organized
    as follows. Section II describes wireless channel characterization for near ground,
    over ground and underground links. Section III presents the link analysis applied
    to provide wireless system planning, for LoRaWAN and ZigBee network nodes. System
    validation and end to end data transmission are discussed in Section IV. Concluding
    remarks are offered in Section V. SECTION II. Underground, Near-Ground and Over-Ground
    Wireless Channel Assessment in Campus Environment With the aim of optimizing both
    the design and deployment of the proposed distributed system, wireless channel
    analysis for the complete UPNA campus must be performed to determine coverage
    distributions thus providing the initial wireless system planning. In this section,
    once presented the campus scenario, the multiple level wireless link types are
    studied: underground, near-ground and over-ground links. Link types are defined
    based on the wireless node transmitter antenna height. A. Campus Environment Under
    Analysis The UPNA campus covers approximately a surface of 170000 m2 and a volume
    of over 5.1 million m3. It has one central building, one library building, seven
    department buildings and elements such as sitting benches and hundreds of trees.
    In fact, it contains 99 different species, a variety of different trees and a
    dozen relevant shrub species [44]. This vegetation mass harmonically surrounds
    the campus buildings and is distributed in various landscaped areas, with the
    aim of conforming a distributed botanical garden. As shown in Fig. 2, the campus
    is divided into five main parks: the Park of Navarre, the English Park, the Asian
    and European Park, the American, African and Oceanic Park and finally the Rectorate
    Park. FIGURE 2. Location of the five parks that conform the distributed botanical
    garden at the Public University of Navarre. Show All In this work, the seven main
    types of trees distributed in five of the total parks within the campus are considered:
    Yew trees, pine trees, olive trees, holly trees, arbutus trees, magnolias trees
    and holm oak trees. The tree types can be easily recognized because each one grows
    next to a university department building that bears its name. This setting constitutes
    a distributed botanical garden aimed to promote dissemination of agroforestry
    knowledge [44]. B. 3D Ray Launching Simulation Tool With the aim of providing
    in depth understanding of the behavior of the multilevel wireless links present
    in this complex environment, a 3D-RL algorithm has been employed. The 3D-RL algorithm
    has been implemented in-house, based on Geometrical Optics (GO) and Geometrical
    Theory of Diffraction (GTD), optimized with hybrid simulation techniques in order
    to reduce computational cost. As an example, the garden surrounding the Los Tejos
    building has been analyzed and the simulation scenario implemented. The scenario
    has 110 m in length, 31 m width and 15m height. Fig. 3a shows a real picture of
    the scenario, and Fig. 3b shows the 3D-RL simulation scenario. FIGURE 3. Garden
    scenario for simulation in the 3D Ray Launching Simulator (a) real view and (b)
    schematic view. Show All All the existing elements at the garden such as trunk
    trees, foliage, streetlights and grass have been taken into account in order to
    obtain accurate radio propagation estimations. To this extent, the frequency dispersive
    characteristics of the dielectric constant and conductivity of the materials for
    the specific operation frequency have been taken in consideration. Table 2 presents
    the material properties (dielectric constant and conductivity) of all the elements
    considered. TABLE 2 Material Properties for the 3D Ray Launching Simulation The
    dielectric constant ε r and conductivity σ of tree foliage varies with humidity
    h as per (1) and (2): ε rfoliage = σ foliage = 137 h 3 −69.688 h 2 +23.385h+1.4984
    1.1541 h 3 −0.5489 h 2 +0.1669h−0.0004 (1) (2) View Source For this study, 20%
    humidity level has been considered. Simulation results have been obtained for
    the complete scenario volume. As an example, RF power distribution planes for
    different receiver heights are presented in Fig. 4, for both 2.4 GHz (ZigBee)
    and 868 MHz (LoRaWAN) bands. In order to simulate near ground and over ground
    conditions, two different transmitter antenna heights were conf: 0.1m and 1.1m.
    Simulation parameters have been chosen to agree with the measurement equipment
    setup, which will be analyzed in the following subsection. FIGURE 4. Estimated
    RF power level distributions for 868 MHz for (a) Tx = 0.1m; (b) Tx = 1.1m; and
    for 2.4 GHz for (c) Tx = 0.1m; (d) Tx = 1.1m. Show All C. Near-Ground and Over-Ground
    Wireless Link Assessment As a first step to perform the analysis of the multiple
    communication link types, over-ground and near-ground propagation conditions were
    considered, since accurate measurements of tree’s eco-physiological/biological
    parameters requires sensors placed at different height on the tree. Therefore,
    the multiple positions of the nodes leading to the different link types have been
    included in the wireless channel analysis. Received power and Received Signal
    Strength Indicator (RSSI) values have been measured while transmitter nodes were
    placed at different heights T x of 0.1m and 1.1m from the ground, corresponding
    to usual operating conditions of devices in near to ground and over the ground
    locations, respectively. Both transmitters were communicating with both receiver
    nodes placed at the same heights resulting in a near-ground to near-ground communication,
    near-ground to over-ground communication, over-ground to near-ground communication
    and over-ground to over-ground communication schemes. Measurements have been performed
    along both LoS and NLoS link paths, as it is schematically shown in Fig. 5a. Thus,
    these experiments will determine communication QoS parameters between nodes attached
    to trees in Los Tejos garden (see Fig. 5b). The distance between two trees in
    the same row is approximately 6.5m, and the distance between two rows is 9.5m.
    Los Tejos was chosen owing to the complexity of the scenario in terms of vegetation
    density and location. Nodes were placed over, near and under the ground. FIGURE

    channel measurements have been performed using Libelium 868 MHz nodes, 2.4 GHz
    ZigBee nodes and a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) tuned at 2.4 GHz. Transmitted
    power of the ZigBee nodes was 25 dBm at 868 MHz and 17 dBm at 2.4 GHz. Received
    power measurements have been performed with an Agilent N9912 Field Fox portable
    spectrum analyzer. For the received power measurements at 2.4 GHz, an omnidirectional
    antenna has been connected to the VCO with a transmit power of 8.38 dBm. The RSSI
    has been measured using Libelium ZigBee nodes operating at 868 MHz and 2.4 GHz.
    Receiver sensitivity of the ZigBee nodes was −112 dBm at 868 MHz and −102 dBm
    at 2.4 GHz. Fig. 6 shows the received power and RSSI results for both transmitter
    and receiver placed at 0.1m and 1.1m from the ground, for LoS and NLoS path cases.
    It can be seen that over ground to over ground links exhibit the highest received
    power level, given by lower obstruction in such links. Measurements have been
    performed at a maximum distance of 65m in the case of 2.4GHz (Fig. 6c), to avoid
    unwanted effects of detected interferences in the 2.4GHz ISM band. FIGURE 6. (a)
    Received power and (b) RSSI (dBm) at different Tx and Rx heights for 868 MHz;
    (c) and (d) the same for 2.4 GHz. Show All Once the measurements were carried
    out, simulations were performed, in order to validate the presented 3D-RL tool.
    For that purpose, simulation and measurements results at 868 MHz are compared
    in Fig. 7. Both heights of T x =0.1 m and T x =1.1 are included. FIGURE 7. Comparison
    between the measured and the simulated results for 868 MHz radio frequency; (a)
    for Tx = 0.1m, and (b) Tx = 1.1m. Show All Table 3 summarizes the measurements
    vs. simulations results, with the obtained mean error and standard deviation.
    TABLE 3 Measurements vs. Simulations Comparison for Near-Ground and Overground
    Communication at 868 MHz Mean error values for received power estimations are
    given by using equation (3): x= ∑ n i=1 | P mi [dBm]− P si [dBm]| n (3) View Source
    with P m the measured received power, P s the simulated received power and n the
    number of the measurement points. As it can be observed in Table 3, higher errors
    occur when the transmitter (Tx) is placed on the ground (i.e. 0.1m) while lower
    errors appear when the transmitter is placed over-ground (i.e. at 1.1m height).
    These errors are further reduced in the case of over-ground to over-ground communication
    links (Tx and Rx at height of 1.1m. Large deviations in the estimation of received
    power levels mainly at closer distances to the transmitter as well as in the case
    of transmitter locations in near-ground configuration. This is given by the fact
    that near ground communications are influenced by phenomena such as surface wave
    coupling, which are not intrinsically considered following deterministic physical
    optics approach. Moreover, the implemented ground model considers a macroscopic
    homogeneous soil layer with dispersive material properties considered for a specific
    humidity level. Finally, a thin homogeneous grass layer has been implemented.
    Effects such as non-homogeneous soil/humidity distributions and small-scale diffraction
    and scattering effects from individual grass filaments increase average error
    values and will be considered in future models. D. Underground Wireless Link Assessment
    The use of underground nodes is required for soil parameters measurement (e.g.,
    moisture levels, scatterer density such as roots, rocks, etc.), which have a direct
    influence on tree health assessment. Radio propagation measurements have been
    performed to characterize communication links between a node placed underground
    and a node placed on the ground surface. In order to obtain accurate results,
    a container of 50/50/50 cm full of soil has been used, as depicted in Fig. 8.
    FIGURE 8. Schematic view of the measurement setup implemented for the underground
    link. Show All Received power, Delta RSSI (the difference between the received
    power and the RSSI), path loss and received packets in terms of the difference
    between the RSSI for propagation in both soil and air have been measured. Measurements
    were obtained for increments of 10 cm under the soil up to 50 cm of distance between
    the underground transmitter node and the receiver which is placed on the soil,
    as shown in Fig. 8. Measurement results are depicted in Fig. 9 plots. FIGURE 9.
    (a) Received power and Delta RSSI at 868 MHz and 2.4 GHz, (b) path loss at the
    same frequencies, (c) difference between the received packets RSSI for propagation
    in both soil and air at 868 MHz and (d) 2.4 GHz. Show All The results show that
    high losses are present at short distances, mainly given by the power extinction
    rate and the impedance mismatch between the node antenna and the surrounding soil
    medium. Impedance mismatching depends on the frequency dispersive dielectric constant
    values but also on the location conditions of the antenna/soil interfaces, which,
    in turn, also impact on both matching conditions (similar to the case of radome
    location with respect to an antenna radiating surface, owing to the existence
    of a stationary wave condition) and on the inter symbol interference [45], [46].
    Path losses are within the range of 55 dB to 72 dB at 868 MHz and in the range
    of 68 dB to 76 dB at 2.4GHz (see Table 4). Differences in losses can also be due
    to other factors, such as the surface wave coupling, which in the case of near
    ground communication are more relevant as operational frequency decreases, usually
    below the UHF/microwave range, out of the scope of the transceivers employed in
    this work. Another critical factor of influence is the transmitted waveform which
    should be specifically designed to counteract the effects of frequency dispersion
    to provide larger links [46]. Finally, although the measured losses for the underground
    links are high, it is important to note that the received RF power levels at 50cm
    distance/depth are greater than the sensitivity thresholds of the nodes, and therefore,
    adequate to enable a communication link between the underground and near-ground
    nodes, where all the transmitted packets are received. TABLE 4 Path Loss Range
    for Underground Communication SECTION III. Implementation of the Distributed Wireless
    System for the Monitoring of The Botanical Park Once the different wireless link
    types involved in the presented environment have been assessed, this section describes
    the radio planning tasks that validate the deployment of the LoRaWAN devices for
    the monitoring system of the botanical park of the UPNA campus. Due to the large
    size of the scenario to be covered, and the high number of wireless nodes that
    are necessary to monitor all the trees and shrub species, two differentiated wireless
    networks are proposed. On the one hand, since the area covered by the flora is
    extensive, instead of a unique network, several sub-networks have been proposed,
    based on ZigBee technology (see Fig. 10). ZigBee technology provides the possibility
    of having a large number of nodes within the same network (up to 65,000), therefore,
    the high number of present flora elements can be monitored in each sub-network,
    while at the same time allows scalability. ZigBee also allows mesh topology, which
    makes the network more robust against wireless link falls. Therefore, this study
    has focused on the LoRaWAN network, since its star topology needs point-to-point
    evaluation (beside the presence of obstacles such as buildings), while ZigBee’s
    mesh topology and the distances between ZigBee devices within a single sub-network
    are short and do not require extra radio planning tasks. FIGURE 10. Schematic
    view of the simulation scenario implemented to analyze the campus botanical monitoring
    system, in which each one of the LoRaWAN/ZigBee sub-networks is presented. Show
    All While ZigBee can be considered as a medium range wireless technology (which
    if low power consumption is wanted, the range becomes much shorter), a long range
    wireless technology has been proposed in order to send/transport the collected
    information of all the ZigBee sub-networks to a centralized gateway. For that
    purpose, three different technologies were assessed: NB-IoT, SigFox and LoRaWAN.
    All of them provided good coverage on campus, but even if LoRaWAN is the only
    one that needs the deployment of gateways (see Fig. 10), we opted for LoRaWAN
    because it does not require extra costs for the provided service after the deployment
    of the network, while SigFox and NB-IoT solutions require fee payments. The proposed
    LoRaWAN wireless network has been evaluated as follows. The 3D-RL simulation tool
    has been employed to obtain an optimized deployment for the LoRaWAN gateway. Once
    a placement for the LoRaWAN gateway is obtained based on simulations, LoRaWAN
    communication measurements between each garden with a specific tree type (where
    the ZigBee sub-networks are deployed) and the LoRaWAN gateway within the campus
    (the central node in Fig. 10) have been performed. As in the ZigBee case, different
    node heights have been considered. Received packets, RSSI and SNR were measured.
    A. 3D Ray Launching for LoRaWAN In order to provide full campus connectivity,
    the local sub-networks operate in conjunction with campus wide networks. Therefore,
    an additional deterministic radio planning study has been performed to obtain
    information about the feasibility of the proposed WSN for the whole campus. A
    view of the complete schematic campus model developed for the simulations is illustrated
    in Fig. 11. The campus of the Public University of Navarre scenario dimensions
    are 590 m long, 290 m width and 30 m height. FIGURE 11. Campus scenario for simulation
    in the 3D Ray Launching Simulator (a) real view and (b) schematic view and (c)
    a zoomed part of the scenario. Show All All the existing elements at the campus,
    such as trunk tree, foliage, streetlights, grass, benches, vehicles, and metallic
    elements, have been considered, making a simulation volume of 5.1 million m3.
    Table 5 presents the frequency dispersive material properties of the elements
    within the campus scenario. TABLE 5 3D RL Material Properties for the Campus Scenario
    Fig. 12 illustrates the coverage maps for receivers placed at different heights
    H 1 =2 m, H 2 =4 m and H 3 =6 m from the ground, and transmitters placed at Los
    Tejos building in Fig. 12 (a) and Las Encinas in Fig. 12 (b), at a height of 1.1
    m from the ground. It is worth noting that results have been obtained for the
    complete simulation volume, although they are represented in bi-dimensional constant
    height cut-plane for the sake of clarity. Los Tejos and Las Encinas buildings
    simulations results were chosen because of their locations within the campus context.
    FIGURE 12. Estimated RF power distribution planes obtained by 3D RL at different
    heights for a transmitter placed at (a) Los Tejos building, and (b) Las Encinas
    building. Show All Results show that coverage distributions at the height of 4m
    are better than the two other heights for both transmitters. Thus, placing the
    gateway at 4m from the ground provides higher received power levels and hence,
    communication link quality metrics with the nodes. Fig. 13 shows the coverage
    intersection of both transmitters. The results from transmitters placed at other
    buildings are compatible with this conclusion. FIGURE 13. Coverage intersection
    for transmitters placed at Los tejos and Las Encinas buildings. Show All B. LoRaWan
    Measurements In order to analyze and validate LoRaWan system deployment, The Thing
    Network (TTN) nodes have been attached to trees from all the seven types within
    the campus. Measurements have been conducted with the TTN nodes placed on the
    ground and at a height of 1.1m from the ground. The transmitted power and the
    sensitivity of the TTN nodes are 14 dBm and −148 dBm respectively. Following the
    simulations results and Fig. 13, the TTN gateway has been placed at the library,
    which is located at the center of the campus for an optimal communication link
    with all the deployed nodes. Fig. 2 illustrates the locations of the TTN nodes
    and gateway and Fig. 14 shows the deployed devices for the measurement campaigns.
    FIGURE 14. LoRaWAN system campaign: location of the different nodes within the
    campus, as well as the TTN gateway. Show All Received packets, RSSI and Signal-to-Noise
    Ratio (SNR) results have been obtained from direct communication between the TTN
    nodes in order to perform physical layer as well as preliminary system level validation.
    Fig. 15 depicts the results achieved for different node locations, placed at both
    0.1m and 1.1m from the ground, and the gateway placed at 4m from the ground. FIGURE
    15. Near ground and over ground TTN nodes to gateway results: (a) RSSI, (b) SNR,
    (c) received packets/RSSI and (d) received packets/SNR. Show All The results show
    that received power level are in general higher in over ground conditions, with
    an RSSI average difference in the order of 5-8dB between near ground and over
    ground links, consistent with losses given to ground/signal interaction. These
    results lead to improved performance in quality of experience metrics, such as
    those given by SNR and percentage of successful received packets. Hence, transceiver
    location within near ground leads to increased losses, which must be considered
    in the deployment phase to perform adequate coverage analysis and hence, optimal
    node location. SECTION IV. System Validation and Application Development Once
    a complete model for the different communication links within the distributed
    campus garden has been developed, a real scenario in terms of end users for trees
    monitoring within the campus has been tested for system validation. System validation
    is given by wireless communication between the sensor nodes and the Cayenne platform.
    The sensor nodes are communicating with the coordinator via ZigBee. Then, the
    coordinator sends data to the TTN gateway via LoRaWAN technology. The collected
    data is sent to the Cayenne platform for storage and display. A schema of all
    the communication steps for system validation is illustrated in Fig. 16. FIGURE
    16. (a) Functional diagram of the measurements system; (b) Developed application
    blocks and features. Show All Users can check the real time data of the tree parameters
    or revise the history of the last hour, day, week, month or year using cayenne’s
    webpage or application, which is available on both Apple and Android. Fig. 17
    illustrates some of the platform features. FIGURE 17. (a) End user platform for
    trees monitoring; (b) Temperature history plot for the mobile application. Show
    All After successful communication tests, a purpose specific application has been
    implemented. The developed application is divided into two main services, monitor
    and guide, as shown in Fig. 18. The monitor part is dedicated in the first place
    to gardeners and campus staff for data analysis and decision making. To contribute
    directly to sustainability in green campuses and water saving. By selecting the
    desired tree type, user can select the exact tree number for sensors information
    display. For each tree, user can read the following sensor data: Air temperature
    and humidity, sun light, leaf wetness, soil temperature and moisture. FIGURE 18.
    The developed UPNA Botanical Garden application, compatible with desktop, Tablet
    and mobile platforms. Bottom right, a picture of real time tree data monitoring
    within the UPNA campus. Show All Moreover, the application guides new students
    and visitors through the gardens of the campus through the guide section. By selecting
    the desired park, visitors can see a schema of the park, containing the names
    of all the existing trees and species with its location at the park. Also, a walking
    path for assuring a valuable experience for visitors. For an easy use, the application
    is compatible with mobile, Tablet and desktop, as it is shown in Fig. 18. In addition
    to the Cayenne environment, a specific platform called InGaM (Interactive Garden
    Monitor) has been developed for monitoring the campus garden of the Public University
    of Navarre. This platform, whose architecture is depicted in Fig. 19, is based
    on Apache and Elasticsearch’s components. Data collected by the WSN network can
    be injected directly into the platform, or it can be imported as often as desired
    from the Cayenne platform. In addition, the platform allows importing meteorological
    information from the national and regional meteorological networks [48], [49],
    in addition to municipal [50] and regional geographical open-data [51]. FIGURE
    19. Platform architecture and network hardware employed for the UPNA Botanical
    Garden application integration. Show All Data harvesting may be heterogeneous
    in terms of data model, so Apache Nifi allows data transformation and provides
    ETL functionalities (extract, transform and load) to ensure the arrival of quality,
    consistent and standardized data in the NGSI-LD data format to the platform. According
    to the data source, the data is distributed into message queues managed by the
    Apache Kafka component, which allows the use of the publish/subscribe paradigm.
    Data recovery, previously structured by Nifi and arranged by Kafka, is stored
    by means of the Elasticsearch component. Finally, visualization is provided by
    the Kibana component. All the components (Nifi, Kafka, Kibana and elasticsearch)
    are well-known and widely used software components. As a parallel learning mechanism,
    there is a data analysis module based on Python, Keras and TensorFlow, which enables
    fast experimentation with deep neural networks. Currently, InGaM has just accomplished
    its implementation and validation phase, and as enough data is harvested, data
    analysis will begin. SECTION V. Conclusion In this work, an interactive and distributed
    botanical university campus garden end to end system is proposed. Deterministic
    wireless channel analysis has been performed, considering a full set of communication
    links that includes underground, near ground and over ground communications. Precise
    coverage estimations for the complete volume of a very large and complex scenario,
    such as UPNA campus have been obtained, for communication links at 868MHz and
    2.4GHz frequency bands. The results have allowed the deployment of the sensor
    nodes, employing ZigBee protocol and data communication links, based in LoRaWAN.
    Simulation along with measurement results indicate the differences and limitations
    within the different communication links under analysis, establishing the maximum
    link distance for each one of underground, near ground and over ground link types.
    System level validation has been performed, initially on a Cayenne platform and
    afterwards a purpose specific dual application and in-house implemented cloud-based
    architecture. Measurement results show the viability of the system in terms of
    communication link availability as well on the successful reception of both telemonitoring
    data (for asset management) as well as those related with visitor interaction.
    Future work is foreseen in higher levels of sensor integration, as well as in
    interoperability of the data management system at operational level with the Pamplona
    Smart City platform. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More

    \ more industrialized and intensive due to the rising demand for food in quality\
    \ and quantity. Agricultural\nmodernization will be made possible by the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT), a technology with a great promise for revolutionizing the\n\
    industry. Agricultural products will be in high demand by 2050 due to a 30% increase\
    \ in the global population, so there is a\nneed to devise new mechanisms for agriculture,\
    \ and smart agriculture is one of those mechanisms; however, smart agriculture\n\
    needs to be explored further to realize its potential fully. So, to explore the\
    \ potential of this ﬁeld, the researchers have used a\ncorpus that is extracted\
    \ from the Scopus database from the year 2008 to the year 2022 and applied the\
    \ LDA technique. A\ncorpus of 4309 articles was selected from the Scopus database\
    \ to apply the latent Dirichlet analysis (LDA) model to predict\nresearch areas\
    \ for smart agriculture. Using IoT technology, farmers and producers may better\
    \ manage their resources, such as\nfertilizer consumption and the number of trips\

    including water, electricity, and other inputs. This data-driven experimental\

    \ research\nthemes in smart agriculture based on the LDA topic modeling. This\
    \ analysis suggests that the indicated areas are in the growth\nphase and require\
    \ further research and exploration.\n1. Introduction\nDigital technologies like\
    \ the Internet of Things (IoT) are\nreshaping agriculture. When it comes to farming,\
    \ what is\nIoT? The IoT connects “dumb” devices. IoT is all about data\n[1]. Data\
    \ is becoming a valuable resource for our world.\nFarmers may become more intelligent\
    \ and safe by using data\nfrom gadgets to adapt to changing conditions more readily\n\
    and farm more eﬃciently [2]. To free up resources, farmers\ncan use the ability\
    \ to monitor agricultural conditions and\ninfrastructure from afar [3]. Many sectors\
    \ and industries\nhave adopted IoT to reduce errors and improve performance\n\
    in manufacturing, energy, health care, and communication\n[1]. Farm devices can\
    \ collect and deliver data remotely to\ntheir owners using IoT.\nFarmers can save\
    \ time and money using IoT to keep tabs\non-farm operations and eﬃciency, make\
    \ more informed deci-\nsions about boosting productivity, and respond more quickly\n\
    to changing conditions. In this case, it is putting data ahead\nof the farmer’s\
    \ intuition [2]. A trough’s water supply, the\namount of fertilizer to use on\
    \ a crop, and which ewe to check\nwhen lambing are all things a farmer could know\
    \ about.\nSmart agriculture is necessary since 70% of the farming\ntime is spent\
    \ monitoring and analyzing crop status rather\nthan performing actual ﬁeld labor\
    \ [3]. Given the industry’s\nsize, it needs various technology and precise solutions\
    \ to\nensure sustainability while reducing environmental damage.\nSensors and\
    \ communication technologies have provided\nfarmers with a remote sight of their\
    \ ﬁelds, allowing them\nto watch what is happening without leaving home. Wireless\n\
    sensors make monitoring crops in real-time with greater\nprecision and, more importantly,\
    \ detecting the early stages\nof undesirable conditions easier [4]. This is why\
    \ “smart agri-\nculture uses innovative equipment and kits from seeding to\nHindawi\n\

    crop harvesting, storage, and transportation. The operation is\nsmart and cost-eﬀective\
    \ due to its accurate monitoring capa-\nbilities and prompts reporting using a\
    \ variety of sensors. Var-\nious autonomous tractors, harvesters, robotic weeders,\
    \ drones,\nand satellites supplement agriculture equipment [5]. Sensors\ncan be\
    \ instantly deployed, started collecting data, and made\navailable for further\
    \ online study. By enabling precise data col-\nlection at each area, sensor technology\
    \ allows crop and site-\nspeciﬁc agriculture”. IoT and its apps are only scratching\
    \ the\nsurface of what they can do and have yet to impact people’s\nlives signiﬁcantly,\
    \ and everyone can see this. However, given\nthe recent rise in IoT technology\
    \ in agricultural applications,\nwe can expect it to play a signiﬁcant role. Figure\
    \ 1 summarizes\nthe key factors driving agricultural technology.\nThere are reasonable\
    \ eﬀorts to emphasize the importance\nof IoT in agriculture; most published work\
    \ [6] focuses solely\non applications. However, in light of the most recent facts\n\
    and data, most current publications either give little insight\nor place a limited\
    \ emphasis on diverse IoT-based designs, pro-\ntotypes, advanced approaches, IoT\
    \ for food quality, and other\nfuture issues. The current state of IoT-based agriculture\n\
    research is examined in this paper. Farmers are either delaying\nor refusing to\
    \ change their traditional techniques, which might\nfurther depress India’s GDP.\
    \ Recently skilled migrants from\nall across India who returned to their homelands\

    \ [9]. As part of the MIT Media\nLab Open Agriculture Initiative, Google has shared\
    \ its vision\nfor a more sustainable food system [10]. For eﬃcient seed\nplanting,\
    \ “sensors and vision-based technology” help deter-\nmine the distance and depth.\
    \ An autonomous robot named\nAgribot is being developed to sow seeds using sensors\
    \ and\na vision-based [11]. Technology and economic sustainability\ngo hand in\
    \ hand. A study was conducted in Pakistan to\ndetermine the commercial viability\
    \ of a proposed crop\ninsurance plan and assess the demand for crop insurance\n\
    in various ﬂood-prone rural districts of Khyber Pakh-\ntunkhwa Province [12].\
    \ Additional research revealed that\nfarm households in the study area faced several\
    \ barriers\nto adapting to climate variability, including a lack of labor,\nan\
    \ insecure land tenure system, a lack of market access,\npoverty, a lack of governmental\
    \ support, a lack of access\nto assets, a lack of water sources, a lack of credit\
    \ sources,\nand a lack of knowledge and information [13]. One study\nfound a link\
    \ between poverty reduction and natural and\nsocial capital for sustainable livelihood.\
    \ The research\nprovides empirical and quantitative evidence on poverty\nalleviation,\
    \ and the conclusions will improve agricultural\nhouseholds’ sustainability [14].\
    \ A study also uses natural\nand agricultural resources in Northwestern Pakistan\
    \ to\ncreate a livelihood vulnerability index (LVI), LVI-IPCC,\nand livelihood\
    \ eﬀect index [15].\nFurther, several noncontact sensing methods for deter-\n\
    mining the seed ﬂow rate are proposed in [16], “where the\nsensors were equipped\
    \ with LEDs, infrared, visible light,\nlaser-LED, and a radiation reception element”.\
    \ The output\nvoltage ﬂuctuates depending on how the seeds move through\nthe sensor\
    \ and band of light rays and how the shades fall on\nthe reception parts [17].\
    \ Therefore, the seed ﬂow rate is cal-\nculated based on the signal information\
    \ about the passing\nseeds. Researchers oﬀer an expert system for evaluating the\n\
    viability of agricultural land in a 2019 study by combining\nsensor networks with\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence systems such as\nneural networks and multilayer perceptron\
    \ [18]. The pro-\nposed method is intended to assist farmers in categorizing\n\
    agricultural land for cultivation into the most suitable, suit-\nable, somewhat\
    \ suitable, and unsuitable categories. In a\nrecent study, researchers used citrus\
    \ fruits data labeled by a\ndomain expert with four severity levels (high, medium,\n\
    low, and healthy) to train a deep neural network (DNN)\nmodel to detect disease\
    \ by severity [19]. The model has a\n98% likelihood of predicting low severity\
    \ and a 98% chance\nof predicting high seriousness. In a subsequent study, the\n\
    author takes advantage of blockchain’s potential beneﬁts,\ncombines it with SDN,\
    \ and provides justiﬁcation for worries\nabout energy consumption and security\
    \ [20]. In the most\nrecent survey, authors applied the same blockchain technology\n\
    integration technology to diﬀerent platforms. LDA was used\nto anticipate blockchain\
    \ research trends. The researchers have\npredicted 17 scientiﬁc trends that deserve\
    \ more attention.\nAccording to the literature, LDA approaches anticipate smart\n\
    agriculture research trends [21]. The researcher created a\nnovel routing protocol\
    \ for IoT networks with a cluster topol-\nogy using a blockchain-based architecture\
    \ for the SDN con-\ntroller. The research concepts of the existing state of the\
    \ art\nand its diﬀerentiation from the current state are represented\nin Table\
    \ 2.\n3. Topic Modeling\nData mining is an emerging ﬁeld to extract data from\n\
    unstructured formats. Topic modeling is a powerful tech-\nnique in text mining\
    \ in natural language processing to\nexplore the relationship between the data\
    \ and collected doc-\numents [22]. This technique is used by various researchers\
    \ in\ntheir native ﬁelds, like medical, semantic analysis [23], and\nengineering\
    \ [24], to conclude the relationship between the\ndocuments and topics. Techniques\
    \ like latent Dirichlet allo-\ncation (LDA), nonnegative matrix factorization\
    \ (NMF),\nlatent semantic analysis (LSA), parallel latent Dirichlet allo-\ncation\
    \ (PLDA), and Pachinko allocation model (PAM) were\nused in the topic modeling;\
    \ among all, LDA is intensively\nused by researchers. The topic modeling technique\
    \ is similar\nto the dimensionality reduction technique used for numeri-\ncal\
    \ data. A bag of words (BOW) is created from the dictio-\nnary of words, and topic\
    \ modeling extracts the required\nfeatures from this BOW. The words contained\
    \ in the corpus\nare viewed as a signiﬁcant feature in NLP.\nNLP considers each\
    \ word as a feature to train the model.\nThis technique helps us ﬁnd the right\
    \ content instead of ana-\nlyzing the accurate data. LDA is used to attain a relationship\n\
    among the documents in the collected dataset, and results\nTable 1: Continued.\n\

    \ graphically. To develop\nLDA, variational exception maximization (VEM) algorithm\n\
    [25] is used to estimate the similarities from the corpus.\nUsually, the top few\
    \ words are picked up from the BOW\nas this approach lacks semantics in the sentence.\
    \ LDA fol-\nlows the concept of probabilistic distribution, so each docu-\nment\
    \ in the corpus portrays the probabilistic distribution of\ntopics, and each extracted\
    \ topic depicts the probabilistic dis-\ntribution of words. It led to concluding\
    \ a clear vision of the\ntopic connection. LDA is applied to retrieve critical\
    \ informa-\ntion or analysis from unstructured data. For example,\nresearch on\
    \ social media makes users understandable reac-\ntions and conversations among\
    \ the people connected in\nsocial media to conclude the patterns [26].\n4. Methodology\n\
    The stepwise procedure of whatever tasks have been com-\npleted is aﬀectingly\

    5\nJournal of Sensors\nFurther processing required inclusion and exclusion cri-\n\
    teria to ﬁnalize the corpus, so, for inclusion criteria, we con-\nsidered the\
    \ research papers published in English only. Then,\nthe studies concerning IoT\
    \ agriculture were only considered.\nUnder the exclusion procedure, we excluded\
    \ and removed\nthose studies published in diﬀerent native languages. In\naddition,\
    \ studies having missing information like author,\nabstract, title, and year were\
    \ excluded from the corpus. After\napplying the requirements, 4309 studies were\
    \ considered for\nthe current research. Figure 3 represents the year-wise\ngrowth\
    \ in article publication in IoT agriculture. It is clear\nfrom Figure 3 that after\
    \ 2015 there has been tremendous\ngrowth in publications. The leading publication\
    \ is in 2021,\n26.43% of the total corpus; in 2020, 21.95% of an article\nwas\
    \ published. In 2022 as per data, there is 0.07% publica-\ntion, which can be\
    \ increased by the end of the year.\nThis area of research is published in various\
    \ reputed\njournals. Some top-rated journals or dominating journals\nin IoT agriculture\
    \ are shown in Figure 4. Dominating jour-\nnal\nanalysis\nshows\nmaximum\nparticipation\n\
    from\nthe\nAdvances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, which has\n134 articles\
    \ having 0.031%, and this journal belongs to\nSpringer, having H-Index 48 and\
    \ 0.66 as its impact factor.\n4.2. Preprocessing. It is a preliminary step that\
    \ processes the\ndataset or the information collected. The objective of pre-\n\
    processing is to discard the extraneous information inside\nthe information. Preprocessing\
    \ removes unwanted words\nand characters from the accumulated or collected corpus\n\
    and improves the dataset’s quality. As a result, the proﬁle\nof further processing\
    \ becomes more accurate and acceptable.\nIn the collected corpus, the author used\
    \ four types of data for\nLDA modeling: title of the paper, year of publication,\
    \ journal\nof published article, abstract, and keywords of the docu-\nments. Further,\
    \ abstract and keywords are combined under\nthe same column. A sample of the loading\
    \ corpus is shown\nin Table 3.\nThe ﬁrst step to performing on the uploaded corpus\
    \ is to\ntoken the words so that all the abstracts per title are toke-\nnized\
    \ into tokens. The generated tokens are then trans-\nformed into lowercase letters\
    \ for each document. In\ntokenization, the focus is on removing the punctuation\n\
    marks, single characters, and other special characters like\n“;”, “,”, “.”, “/”,\
    \ “\\”, “brackets”, “!”. Further, any equation or\nformula used in the abstract\
    \ was removed. Also, the numer-\nical values were eradicated to get a full-ﬂedge\
    \ textual token\n[28]. Finally, after tokenization, the words which have no\n\
    meaning are removed. The stop words are the commonly\nused words such as “the”,\
    \ “if”, “but”, “a”, or “an”. These\nwords take up space in our corpus and consume\
    \ valuable\nprocessing time. Thus, it becomes crucial to remove these\nstop removals,\
    \ and here in our experimentation, we have\nused Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).\
    \ This toolkit has\nstop words stored in more than sixteen languages. Here,\n\
    the English-language stop words in the NLTK library and\nother phrases used to\
    \ build the corpus were removed from\nthe corpus [29].\nFurther, stemming is reducing\
    \ a word to its word stem.\nStemming is essential in natural language understanding\n\
    and natural language processing, endeavoring to extract\nthe root or core word\
    \ that is usually appended with the\nEnglish suﬃxes and preﬁxes. It erases all\
    \ the extraneous\nparts in the word and sources out the accurate, meaningful\n\
    word. For example, use is the core word that can be\nextracted by stemming the\
    \ word useless, useful, and uses.\nTo prepare an adequate corpus, words stem from\
    \ their orig-\ninal form using the Snowball stemmer algorithm [30], and\nthe resulting\
    \ base keywords are stored in the cleansed cor-\npus. Finally, the words which\
    \ were previously stemmed need\nto be lemmatized. Lemmatization is when the context\
    \ is con-\nsidered, and stemmed words are converted into more mean-\ningful base\
    \ words or lemmas. This phase targets removing\ninﬂected words and outputs the\
    \ dictionary form of a\nword [31].\n5. Latent Dirichlet Allocation\nLatent Dirichlet\
    \ allocation (LDA) is the most popular tech-\nnique in NLP, so data is fed to\
    \ the LDA model after prepro-\ncessing. Before sending data, bigrams and trigrams\
    \ are\nremoved from the corpus. Two words that occur together\nare named bigrams,\
    \ like human resources, and the three\nwords frequently occurring together in\
    \ the document are\ntermed trigrams, like human resource management. The\nLDA\
    \ model is implemented in python language, where the\ngenism library has been\
    \ used to remove such phrases. Gen-\nism’s phrases model can build and identify\
    \ these bigrams,\ntrigrams, quadgrams, or even n-grams [32]; thus, we can\nremove\
    \ and improve the data cleansing process. It is also\npart of preprocessing, so\
    \ after completing this stage, data is\nsent to the LDA model for further analysis\
    \ [49, 67]. LDA\ntopic modeling is based on three input parameters, one of\nwhich\
    \ is a list of topics, and the other is hyperparameters.\nBefore the distribution\
    \ of a document’s topic content is the\nmagnitude of the Dirichlet. This parameter\
    \ is regarded as\nseveral “pseudowords” equally distributed across the docu-\n\
    ment’s topics, regardless of how the document’s other words\nare assigned to topics.\
    \ β is per-word-weight of Dirichlet\nprior over topic-word distributions. The\
    \ α value for this\nexperiment is taken as 1/T, where T is the desired number\n\
    of topics [33], and the β has been ﬁxed as 0.01 for all topic\nsolutions. For\
    \ identifying two, ﬁve, and ten topic solutions,\nas suggested by [26], the number\
    \ of iterations considered is\n1000. Thus, initializing these parameters becomes\
    \ a concern\nas the values can deﬁne the distribution of high-quality topic\n\
    results. The bag of words (BOW) extracted is initially proc-\nessed in LDA topic\
    \ modeling, where the most frequently and\nleast frequently occurring are removed\
    \ so the corpus can\nbecome absolute. This study removes a word frequency of\n\
    more than 5000 from BOW. The top 20 frequently occurring\nwords from the corpus\
    \ with their frequency are shown in\nFigure 5, as it is clear from the graph that\
    \ the most occurring\nkeyword is the system, use, sensors, internet, agriculture,\
    \ and\nmany more.\nHyperparameters are optimized using Python’s mallet\nlibrary,\
    \ a JAVA-based NLP package. Then, the mallet pack-\nage extracts the desired topics\
    \ by training the model using\nBOW. Unfortunately, no oﬃcial or proven measure\

    \ Still, some\nobservational parameters are given by Cao and Arun, which\nhelps\
    \ the researcher decide the optimal number of keys [55,\n68]. Furthermore, the\
    \ choice of the topic solution has been\ninﬂuenced by the heuristics and ﬁndings\
    \ of the studies [55,\n61, 68, 69]. Finally, K-mean clustering algorithms are\
    \ used\nto ﬁnd the optimal number of topics from the BOW.\n6. Topic Labeling\n\
    Once the topics have been extracted with the help of the\nLDA model, each topic\
    \ is labeled manually based on the\nkey terms of each topic. As a result, there\
    \ are 4309 articles\nin the corpus, and out of all documents, the top ﬁve high-\n\
    loading papers and their contribution to the topic are men-\ntioned in Table 1.\n\
    7. Result Analysis\n7.1. Parameters of Topic Solutions. The loadings for two,\

    \ ITS (intelligent transport systems).\n7\nJournal of Sensors\ncoherence score\
    \ plays an essential role in ﬁnding the seman-\ntic similarity between the key\
    \ terms in the topic, and ideally,\na 0.3 to 0.6 coherence value is considered\
    \ a good score [81].\nIn this study, coherence values achieved are good; for two\n\
    topic solutions, 0.62; for ﬁve topics, 0.58; and for ten topic\nsolutions, 0.52\
    \ coherence value is reached. Therefore, ﬁve\ntopic solutions are considered optimal\
    \ based on coherence\nvalue. The dominance of each topic solution is also sup-\n\
    ported by the corresponding count of articles it covers.\nTable 4 summarizes the\
    \ count of year-wise publications cor-\nresponding to each topic solution.\nThe\
    \ initial choice of two topics will broadly depict the\ncore research areas that\
    \ have been widely covered by the\nresearchers in the compiled research literature.\
    \ Further, in\nﬁve topic solutions, the researchers have explored the\nresearch\
    \ areas. Therefore, we have depicted in detail the\nresearch areas studied in\
    \ ﬁve topic solutions. Further in the\nhierarchy, the ﬁve topic solutions have\
    \ widened into ten\ntopic solutions, with new areas emerging as the research\n\
    trends in GHRM.\n7.2. Topic Labeling. The core research zones explored and\ndiscovered\
    \ based on the two topic solutions are depicted in\ntopics T-2.1 and T-2.2. Let\
    \ us discuss how this labeling has\nbeen performed. While implementing LDA on\
    \ two topic\nsolutions, the keywords and their loading has been extracted.\nThe\
    \ extraction results of LDA depict the high-loading arti-\ncles per topic and\
    \ the high-loading terms or keywords per\ntopic. The labeling process is based\
    \ on the high-loading key-\nwords that have been collected. Thus, in the table,\
    \ the label-\ning per topic solution corresponds to the terms extracted\nunder\
    \ the heads T-2.1, T-2.2, and so on; it goes for ﬁve\nand ten topic solutions.\n\
    7.2.1. Core Research Area. The two topic solutions present an\nabstract view of\
    \ the literature dataset and divides it into\n“Security and Privacy in Smart Agriculture”\
    \ (T-2.1) and\n“Monitoring and Control System in Agriculture” (T-2.2).\nThese\
    \ two signiﬁcant labels depict the research areas the\nresearchers have extensively\
    \ explored.\n(1) T-2.1: Security and Privacy in Smart Agriculture. Agricul-\n\
    ture has shaped human civilizations since ancient times.\nRapid information and\
    \ communication growth aﬀects agri-\nculture’s structure and operation (ICT) [82].\
    \ Despite\nadvances, hazards may be signiﬁcant, so smart farming must\ngrasp security\
    \ and privacy challenges before contemplating\ncyber attacks. Smart farming uses\
    \ devices, protocols, and\ncomputer ideas to modernize agriculture. Digital farming\n\
    changes everything and creates eﬀective, eﬃcient, sustain-\nable, and open systems\
    \ [83]. Mobile devices, precision\nagronomy, remote sensing, big data, cloud analytics,\
    \ cyber\nsecurity,\nand\nintelligent\nsystems\nsimplify\nagricultural\ntechnology\n\
    integration.\nIncompatibility,\nheterogeneity,\nequipment constraints, processing,\
    \ and data security may\nthreaten smart farming, but recent years have increased\n\
    usage of ICTs in agriculture [84]. Physical risks and con-\ncerns may impede agriculture’s\
    \ deployment, but agriculture\n4.0 will be the new agriculture standard [85].\
    \ Simultaneous\nresearch is also going on in the area to secure smart agricul-\n\
    ture. Technology has added to environmental problems—list\nagriculture’s\nphysical\n\
    threats\nby\ncategory.\nPopulation\nincrease, urbanization, aging, and technical\
    \ developments\nin food production all aﬀect agriculture and farmers. Agri-\n\
    culture’s most signiﬁcant physical hazard is weather [86].\nExternal factors continually\
    \ threaten agriculture. In recent\ndecades, technology has reduced its inﬂuence.\
    \ Agriculture\napps need stable connections, IoT networks, and cloud\ncomputing\n\
    [87].\nExternal\nfactors\ncontinually\nthreaten\nagriculture. In recent decades,\
    \ technology has reduced its\ninﬂuence. Agriculture apps need stable connections,\
    \ IoT net-\nworks, and cloud computing. The sensors can malfunction,\ncausing\
    \ erroneous readings and instructions that could cause\na manufacturing failure.\
    \ Temperature, humidity, obstruc-\ntions, and human presence can impact Lora WAN,\
    \ Zigbee,\nand other agri-wireless networks, causing data loss. Sensors\nand networking\
    \ equipment are usually exposed [88].\n(2) T-2.2 Monitoring and Control System\
    \ in Agriculture. New\ntechniques, technology, and approaches have also helped\
    \ in\nagriculture. 35% of the world’s workforce works in this pro-\nfession. Agriculture\
    \ helps many economies to grow [89]. It\nboosts industrialized nations’ economies.\
    \ India is the second\nlargest country that deals in this profession. Every country\n\
    has practiced agriculture since ancient times. Businesses\nand other areas must\
    \ support agriculture’s tech transforma-\ntion. The future population rise is\
    \ frightening. Mid-20th cen-\ntury population may have surpassed nine billion\
    \ counts, so\nagriculture needs to be strengthened to meet the ﬂooding\nneeds.\
    \ Agricultural engineering challenges include drainage,\nirrigation, crop scheduling,\
    \ and bio-system optimization.\nThe lack of agricultural technology to monitor\

    \ [90].\nIoT helps in the process of modernizing the agriculture\nsegment by gathering\
    \ farming data. IoT-based agricultural\nmonitoring system wirelessly communicates\
    \ and dissemi-\nnates the sensor data. Global agriculture uses 70% of avail-\n\
    able fresh water each year to irrigate 17% of the land [91].\nGrowing food requirements\
    \ and global warming reduce irri-\ngated land, a challenge in plague agriculture.\
    \ FAO predicts\nglobal food production must rise by 70% to meet population\nand\
    \ urbanization needs. Modern agriculture uses robotics,\nautomation, and computer\
    \ systems to replace challenging\nhuman jobs, so expanding agriculture needs new\
    \ technolo-\ngies to be included [92]. Future agricultural technology\nincludes\
    \ robotics and machine vision. In addition, popula-\ntion growth will increase\
    \ the demand for resources and\nproducts. “Sustainability” is blended into social,\
    \ economic,\nand technological problems to address environmental con-\nservation\
    \ and economic development, and information and\ncontrol systems will be crucial\
    \ [93].\n7.2.2. Five Topic Solutions: Research Areas\n(1) T-5.1: Intelligent Disease\
    \ Detection Models. India’s econ-\nomy is mainly based on agriculture. Agriculture\
    \ accounts for\n16% of India’s GDP and exports. More than 75% of India’s\npopulation\
    \ depends on agriculture. Healthy, high-quality\nagriculture is essential for\
    \ economic prosperity [94]. Detec-\ntion of plant disease is critical at an early\
    \ stage. Plants can\nbecome ill while growing. Early illness diagnosis is a chal-\n\
    lenge\nin\nagriculture.\nResearchers\nﬁrst\ndemonstrated\ncutting-edge machine\
    \ learning methods for identifying plant\nillnesses [95]. Training parameters\
    \ are used in modern sys-\ntems but require powerful computers or lengthy training\n\
    and prediction durations to work. Convolutional auto\nencoder (CAE) network prediction\
    \ features have been\nreduced while preserving accuracy in this research. Thanks\n\
    to technological advancements, the world’s population of 7\nbillion people can\
    \ be fed [96].\nChanging climates, declining pollinators, and plant dis-\neases\
    \ threaten the ability to produce enough food. Plant dis-\neases endanger the\
    \ livelihoods of smallholder farmers who\ndepend on healthy crops [97]. Despite\
    \ declining yields,\nsmallholder farmers in developing economies provide more\n\
    than 80% agricultural output. Methods for preventing dis-\nease already exist\
    \ [98]. Pesticides have been replaced with\nintegrated pest management (IPM).\
    \ Early diagnosis is essen-\ntial for successful therapy. Agricultural extension\
    \ organiza-\ntions and local plant clinics have long supported disease\ndetection\
    \ thanks to their computer power, high-resolution\ndisplays, and broad accessory\
    \ sets, such as HD cameras.\nSmartphone diagnostics are a ﬁrst-of-its-kind technology.\n\
    5-6 billion mobile phones will be in use by 2020. More than\ntwo-thirds of the\
    \ world’s people now have access to mobile\nbroadband, a 12-fold increase since\
    \ 2007 [99].\n(2) T-5.2: Data Security Challenges in Smart Agriculture.\nTechnology,\
    \ equipment, protocols, and computer paradigms\nare all used to enhance agricultural\
    \ operations in smart agri-\nculture. Big data, artiﬁcial intelligence, the cloud,\
    \ and edge\ncomputing all store and analyze the data in various forms\nof storage\
    \ and archiving. As a relatively new ﬁeld, smart\nagriculture lacks adequate data\
    \ security measures [84].\nFarming’s future relies heavily on the availability\
    \ and quality\nof data, which necessitates the need for security. To maintain\n\
    security in smart agriculture, managing data compatibility,\nresource constraints,\
    \ and massive data processing [100].\nTable 4: Year-wise publication analysis\

    \ increase and food production.\nThe success of agriculture depends on productivity,\
    \ era-\nspeciﬁc restrictions, and the advancement of science and\ntechnology.\
    \ A lot may go wrong regarding smart agriculture,\nwhich is still in its infancy.\
    \ In the future, farmers will rely\nheavily on the availability and quality of\
    \ data to help them;\nthus, developing secure and stable systems is critical [101].\n\
    The growth of the agriculture generation is depicted in\nFigure 6, in which agriculture\
    \ 1.0 started in 1784. In the\n20th century, agriculture 2.0 came into existence.\
    \ In 1992\nagriculture 3.0 was started, and in 2018 agriculture 4.0\nif followed.\n\
    Smart agriculture uses IT to increase information per-\nception, quantitative\
    \ decision-making, intelligent control,\nsuitable investment, and personal service\
    \ [102]. In addition,\ncurrent technology boosts agricultural yield and improves\n\
    security and privacy [103]. There are both advantages and\ndisadvantages to using\
    \ automation in smart agriculture.\nComputer-aided farming uses contemporary technology\n\
    and procedures, so in the future, “digital agriculture” will\nbe more productive,\
    \ eﬃcient, sustainable, inclusive, trans-\nparent, and resilient agriculture.\
    \ Many diﬀerent types of\nagricultural technology may be used in conjunction with\n\
    one another to increase eﬃciency and productivity [104].\n(3) T-5.3: Smart Monitoring\
    \ System in Agriculture. Rainfall\nand\ntemperature\nﬂuctuations\nare\nvery\n\
    unpredictable.\nClimate-smart farming is becoming increasingly popular\namong\
    \ Indian farmers. IoT enables smart agriculture. It\nsaves water, fertilizer,\
    \ and agricultural yields. IoT-enabled\nautomated systems and wireless networks\
    \ are expanding\nindustries. Thus, research into integrated sensor technology\n\
    and the usage of IoT networks in agriculture is reaching\nthe level [105].\n(4)\
    \ T-5.4: Production and Supply Chain Management in\nAgriculture. The growth of\
    \ the supply chain and the move-\nment of information are driven by the gathering\
    \ of materials,\nthe transformation of products, and the delivery to end-\nusers.\
    \ Information-driven, “connected supply chains” enable\norganizations to reduce\
    \ inventory and expenditures; increase\nproduct value; extend resources; expedite\
    \ time to market;\nand retain consumers, among other beneﬁts [106]. Supply\nchain\
    \ performance determines how healthy activities are\nlinked to maximizing customer\
    \ value and proﬁtability at\neach process stage—the end-user beneﬁts from an eﬃcient\n\
    supply chain. Several agricultural supply chains in India\nare problematic owing\
    \ to issues in the agriculture industry\n[107]. Many factors aﬀect the agri-food\
    \ supply chain, includ-\ning small and marginal farmers, disjointed supply chains,\
    \ a\nlack of economies of scale, subpar processing, value addition,\nand fewer\
    \ marketing options. Supply chain management is\nexpanding into logistics by creating\
    \ new divisions integrat-\ning manufacturing, procurement, transportation, and\
    \ distri-\nbution [108]. Information ﬂow visibility has increased\nbecause of\
    \ advancements in telecommunications, electronic\ndata interfaces, and other technologies.\
    \ Animals and plants\nare used in agriculture to produce products that beneﬁt\n\
    human health. For example, agribusiness produces textiles\nand paper. Throughout\
    \ the supply chain, the needs of cus-\ntomers are met. Organizations in the agricultural\
    \ supply\nchain, such as cooperatives, distribute produce, fruits, grains,\npulses,\
    \ and products derived from animals [109]—a network\nof businesses that make goods\
    \ and services for the end-user.\nThere are several beneﬁts to establishing a\
    \ supply chain net-\nwork, such as shifting risk and proﬁt from one company to\n\
    another. Quality is ensured by openness and accountability\nin the process. Quality\
    \ is dependent on transparent pro-\ncesses and responsibilities at each stage\
    \ of the process. The\nprice and performance of transfer payments are crucial\
    \ to\nthe success of process chains.\n(5) T-5.5: Cost-Eﬀective Communication System\
    \ in Smart\nAgriculture. Low-cost solutions like crop rotation, green\nmanuring,\
    \ and mulching have cut cultivation expenses while\nsaving soil and water. Legumes,\
    \ weed control, and increased\nagricultural diversity are nonmonetary inputs [101].\
    \ Climate\nchange, global warming, saltwater intrusion, desertiﬁcation,\nand a\
    \ lack of arable land have increased worldwide worries\nabout food safety and\
    \ security. Connectivity-of-Things\napplications require steady internet [110].\
    \ In the Mekong\nDelta and HCMC, climate change threatens food security.\nDrought\
    \ and saltwater intrusion in the South and Central\nHighlands in early 2016 demonstrate\
    \ the vulnerability and\nsusceptibility of unsustainable agriculture. Agriculture\
    \ may\nbe more eﬃcient and safer thanks to a new Farming system.\nVietnam may\
    \ become a smart and sustainable farm by mod-\nernizing, boosting productivity,\
    \ and ensuring quality. Busi-\nnesses in Vietnam have shared their know-how with\n\
    companies in other countries. Another important factor to\nconsider is the safety\
    \ of the food being prepared. When\ndeciding which meals are good for you and\
    \ the environment,\nmost people have no idea where to begin. Concerns about\n\
    food safety have given rise to new ideas like “city farms”\nand “growing your\
    \ veggies at home” [111]. However, the\neconomic sustainability of these models\
    \ must be thoroughly\nexplored. Researchers are currently focusing on developing\n\
    an IoT-enabled agriculture system. Increased productivity,\nquality, and safety\
    \ may be achieved via this method [82].\n7.2.3. Ten Topic Solutions: Research\
    \ Trends\n(1) T-10.1: Greenhouse Monitoring System. Most Indians\nwork in agriculture,\
    \ contributing to the country’s econo-\nmy—agriculture beneﬁts from technological\
    \ advancements.\nHowever, pesticides are used to grow most fruits and vegeta-\n\
    bles since contemporary farming methods cannot keep up\nwith demand. As a result,\
    \ conventional farming practices\ncontend with weather and disease. Although crop\
    \ yields\nmay be increased by altering agricultural practices [112]\nbecause of\
    \ urbanization and land scarcity, farming must be\ndone in greenhouses. Temperature,\
    \ humidity, light, water\ncontent, pH, and wetness are all shown via LEDs in the\n\
    greenhouse. The goal is to create an intelligent greenhouse.\n10\nJournal of Sensors\n\
    Greenhouse temperature and humidity may be adjusted\nautomatically using programmable\
    \ modules and low-cost\nand high-eﬃciency options [113].\nSoil water content,\
    \ light intensity, temperature, and\nhumidity may be adjusted. In greenhouse crop\
    \ production,\nthe appropriate growth conditions must be changed to\nachieve high\
    \ yields, low costs, improved quality, and the\nlowest environmental impact. To\
    \ attain these goals, proper\nheating and ventilation must be maintained. Using\
    \ a green-\nhouse is more dependable, but it is also more diﬃcult [114].\nTemperature\
    \ and timing controls had previously improved\ncrop quality. Many control devices\
    \ and systems lack auto-\nmation and eﬃciency in today’s dynamic and competitive\n\
    environment. A variety of complicated models depict the\ngreenhouse eﬀect. Costs\
    \ increased, plans became more com-\nplex, and more control was required. The\
    \ usage of com-\nputers in greenhouses has increased during the last decade.\n\
    These components are necessary for a control system.\nSophisticated microelectronic\
    \ hybrid circuits boost sensor\nmanufacturing. Advances in product quality and\
    \ depend-\nability enable commercial competitiveness. Each sensor’s\nperformance\
    \ is determined by its calibration and sensing\nprocesses. It will be impossible\
    \ to automate some jobs even\nin the far future. Several American businesses have\
    \ yet to\nautomate fully, maybe due to cost concerns [115].\n(2) T-10.2: Service-Based\
    \ Industry for Smart Agriculture.\nTechnical advancement has been driven by the\
    \ widespread\nuse of IT and its adaptability in satisfying various require-\n\
    ments. Service-based agriculture (SBA) is widely utilized in\nmultiple industries.\
    \ Farming systems that make it easier for\nfarmers to do their work. A large-scale\
    \ service smart agricul-\nture systems link buses to a hotel, hospital, logistics\
    \ center,\nrestaurant, grocery store, or traditional market. With SBA,\nmaterial\
    \ sales partners may easily share information about\ntheir products with one other\
    \ fast. As a result of SBA,\nIndonesia will see an increase in its economy, as\
    \ quoted in\none study. Over time, the importance of information tech-\nnology\
    \ has grown. The production of farms has increased\nthanks to the adoption of\
    \ contemporary technology [116].\nMany\npeople\nare\nfamiliar\nwith\nthe\npredicament\n\
    of\nIndonesian farmers. The signiﬁcance of variables cannot be\noverstated. Farmers\
    \ have a fear of technology. Farmers in\nIndonesia may be able to increase their\

    Brokers are often used to resell the produce of Indone-\nsian farmers. Small-scale\
    \ farmers in Indonesia were hurt by\nbrokers who gambled on the price of agricultural\
    \ goods\n[117]. Prices for components are rising. Broker fraud\ninﬂated market\
    \ values. Brokers save agricultural products,\ngiving the impression that the\
    \ market is oversupplied and\ndriving up the price of food. When chili prices\
    \ climb and\nthere is a shortage, many brokers refuse to buy from\ngrowers. The\
    \ growing cost of food in Indonesia might harm\nthe country’s economy. Farmers\
    \ must be able to sell their\nproducts directly to consumers. The direct distribution\n\
    oﬀers farmers an easy way to market their products. Whole-\nsalers buy agricultural\
    \ goods from farmers at inexpensive\nrates [118]. To get their goods to market,\
    \ farmers must rent\na vehicle. Commodities no longer impact farmers’ earnings\n\
    with a long processing time. Indonesians rely heavily on\ntheir smartphones to\
    \ get information. Technology can help\nfarmers become food wholesalers. Local\
    \ markets and restau-\nrants might be fed using this method by farmers. The\n\
    Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing support agri-\nculture’s food supply\
    \ and distribution systems [119]. Nowa-\ndays, nanotechnology is also used in\
    \ agriculture to improve\nyields and reduce waste.\n(3) T-10.3: Cloud-Based Smart\
    \ Applications in Agriculture.\nSmart farming uses technology to increase production\
    \ and\nimprove product quality. For example, the Internet of\nThings-based smart\
    \ agriculture automates crop inspections\nand watering. Database traﬃc and data\
    \ cannot be handled\nAgriculrure 1.0\nAgriculrure 2.0\nAgriculrure 3.0\nAgriculrure\

    agricultural period, and inefficiency was a\nfundamental issue.\nDuring the industrialized\
    \ agricultural period\nof the 20th century, resource insfficiency\nwas a severe\
    \ concern.\nA lack of intelligence was a significant worry\nthroughout agriculture,s\
    \ rapid, automated\ngrowth.\nThe era of smart agriculture is defined by\napplying\
    \ current information technologies to\nservice and intelligently grow agriculture.\n\

    \ is less\nlag, the battery lasts longer, and the money and information\nare better\
    \ managed [120].\nIn many cases, the edge for IoT may provide signiﬁcant\nadvantages,\
    \ such as removing the need for interval and geo-\nmetric communications eﬃciency.\
    \ High interface automa-\ntion in IoT activities may achieve reduced latency and\n\
    faster processing. This simulator replicates the sting, edge,\nand fog of IoT.\
    \ IoT-based edge computing is more immedi-\nate, cost-eﬀective, and eﬃcient than\
    \ traditional computer\nsystems [121]. In cities, these strategies are ineﬀective.\
    \ Rural\nlocations are where they are most commonly used. Robots\nshould be used\
    \ in agriculture. The ﬁeld is navigated using\nthe GPS on the tractor. Agribusiness\
    \ in the 21st century is\nanything but digital or computerized. Monitoring crops\n\
    and animals with sensors, GPS-enabled tractors, image pro-\ncessing, and machine\
    \ learning is possible. Edge computing\nreduces the amount of noise in the raw\
    \ data it analyses\nwhich can be cleaned using data mining techniques [122].\n\
    On the other hand, Broadband networks are more cum-\nbersome and diﬃcult to standardize.\
    \ After sensors are\ninstalled, data is automatically collected. We can identify\
    \ if\nanimals or birds are active, inactive, unwell, healthy, submis-\nsive, or\
    \ dominant. We may alter their treatment, living cir-\ncumstances, medicine, and\
    \ food to suit their needs [123].\n(4) T-10.4: Energy-Eﬃcient Smart Transmission\
    \ System. An\nintelligent electrical infrastructure that satisﬁes society’s sus-\n\
    tainability and energy eﬃciency demands is called “smart\ninfrastructure” Customers\
    \ and utility providers will beneﬁt\nfrom the smart grid’s ability to monitor\
    \ their energy use bet-\nter and link the power grid with micro-networks. As a\
    \ result,\nthere is a danger to data security and privacy. Economic\ngrowth depends\
    \ on the availability of electricity, which\nboosts productivity and sustains\
    \ quality of life. Global eco-\nnomic development and electricity usage are depleting\
    \ the\nworld’s energy resources [124]. The smart grid’s core\nassumption is to\
    \ minimize resource depletion and promote\neconomic growth through energy eﬃciency\
    \ and manage-\nment technologies. Demand management lowers transmis-\nsion and\
    \ distribution system stress and high-demand\noverhead lines. Several countries\
    \ have used industrial and\ncommercial demand response strategies to boost their\
    \ econ-\nomies. Direct load limiting often reduces peak demand\n[125]. Direct\
    \ load management may result in a decrease in\ncustomer satisfaction—direct load\
    \ management. Consumers\nand utility companies beneﬁt from reduced peak demand\n\
    when loads are shifted. However, the electrical system’s sta-\nbility and dependability\
    \ are compromised during periods of\nhigh energy demand. The smart grid and load\
    \ modeling\nneed to limit peak energy use.\nTrouble ensues when demand exceeds\
    \ supply. From\n2019 to 2030, India’s population and development demands\nare\
    \ expected to grow by 50 percent [126]. A transmission\nsystem that can endure\
    \ interruptions and blackouts must\nmeet these criteria. Grid operators must regularly\
    \ monitor\nsupply and demand to avoid power outages. To ﬁx this prob-\nlem, load\
    \ shedding disconnects speciﬁc customers’ electric-\nity. Generators must be turned\
    \ down to prevent blackouts\nif supply and demand are out of sync. Smart grids\
    \ can iden-\ntify problems early on and immediately resolve them. Sen-\nsors monitor\
    \ the grid and manage the ﬂow of current.\nThese are computerized to increase\
    \ productivity [127].\n(5) T-10.5: Smart Solutions for Modern Farming. Sustainable\n\
    food production is in high demand as the world’s population\nexpands and weather\
    \ patterns shift. Agriculture and devel-\nopment go forward as time goes by. Agricultural\
    \ technology\nis advancing rapidly. These new technologies are pretty\neﬀective,\
    \ but they must be constantly improved. Using infor-\nmation and communications\
    \ technology, planting, watering,\nand harvesting are all enhanced. Many ﬁelds,\
    \ including agri-\nculture, beneﬁt from technological advancements. The Inter-\n\
    net of Things (IoT) in agriculture is referred to as “smart\nfarming” [128]. Produce\
    \ and livestock will be healthier\nthanks to IoT-enabled smart farming. Real-time\
    \ information\nis provided through wearables and sensors in the ﬁeld.\nShelter,\
    \ clothing, and food have been top priorities for\nhumanity since the dawn of\
    \ civilization. There is a lot of\nmodernity in the house and clothing. According\
    \ to the UN\nFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO), humanity’s food\nrequirements\
    \ will rise by 70% by 2050, according to the UN\nFood and Agriculture Organization\
    \ (FAO) [129]. IoT can be\nused to solve problems in business and technology.\
    \ Tractors\nare used to plant seeds and gather crops. You can use it for\nbusiness\
    \ or yourself. Farming is done with the help of trac-\ntors. Farmers can do other\
    \ things when they use tractors that\ndrive themselves. A Polish company called\
    \ Agribot makes\ntractors that can work independently. When they pull weeds,\n\
    their tractors have sensors that reduce the number of chemi-\ncals and pesticides\
    \ exposed. Agro-IoT devices can meet the\nneeds of farming in the future. Traditional\
    \ agriculture must\nbecome more productive and less risky for the global econ-\n\
    omy to grow. IoT helps growth. Farmers can keep an eye\non their land with the\
    \ help of the Internet of Things. IoT\napplications include keeping an eye on\
    \ climate change, man-\naging water, keeping an eye on land, improving productivity,\n\
    keeping an eye on farming, and keeping track of pesticides\nand herbicides [130].\n\
    (6) T-10.6: Smart Irrigation System for Agriculture. The most\ndiﬃcult chore in\
    \ agriculture is watering ﬁelds. Water sys-\ntems consist of drips, nozzles, tubes,\
    \ and sprinklers, among\nother things. As a whole, agriculture has a positive\
    \ impact\non economic activity. Watering by hand is required. Gar-\ndening and\
    \ soil deterioration are both covered in rainfall.\nAgriculture’s key objectives\
    \ are the production of food and\nlivestock. IoT is a network of interconnected\
    \ devices that\ncan exchange data [131]. When water supplies are limited,\nautomatic\
    \ irrigation may be necessary.\nAccording on the weather, irrigation might be\
    \ done con-\ntinuously or intermittently. As a result, there is less spillage.\n\
    Almost all of the water comes from drip irrigation or sprin-\nklers. With a wireless\
    \ gadget, soil moisture and humidity\n12\nJournal of Sensors\nmay be monitored.\
    \ In agriculture, controllers manage every-\nthing from power to intruder detection\
    \ to pump switching\n[69]. A pump is used to deliver water to the ground. Water\
    \ is\nconserved when drippers are used. Drip irrigation and ﬂood\nirrigation are\
    \ both standard irrigation methods. Both all of\nthe sensors, pumps, and controls\
    \ work as expected. Manual\nwatering may hurt or deplete crops and the environment.\n\
    Automated irrigation systems can be used to address the diﬃ-\nculties. Farming\
    \ may beneﬁt from drip irrigation, which saves\non water. Automatic irrigation\
    \ systems for crop management\nhave become widespread during rainstorms, landscaping,\
    \ and\nsoil erosion. Wi-ﬁ sensors are used to gauge the humidity and\nmoisture\
    \ content of the soil. In agriculture, controllers keep\nan eye on the electricity,\
    \ keep an eye out for intruders, and\nmanage the pumps. Saturating the soil is\
    \ accomplished with\nthe use of pumps. Using drippers saves water, therefore reduc-\n\
    ing the amount of water used. Floatation irrigation commonly\nutilizes electricity,\
    \ sensors, pumps, and controls [132].\n(7) T-10.7: Blockchain-Based Security System\
    \ for Agriculture.\nThere are nodes in a blockchain, and each node has its own\n\
    distributed ledger, allowing several nodes to read and amend\na single ledger\
    \ while preserving shared control. Each block-\nchain node contains a distributed\
    \ ledger that is safe and acces-\nsible to all participants. There are no middlemen\
    \ to\nauthenticate, track, store or synchronize transactions using\nblockchain\
    \ technology. According to several research studies,\nblockchain has altered technology\
    \ from centralized to decen-\ntralized and distributed networks, a shift that\
    \ has been well\ndocumented. The blockchain helps business networks [133].\nBusiness\
    \ networks are composed of companies or individuals\nthat trade assets. Products,\
    \ materials, and equipment are\nexamples of physical assets. A distributed ledger\
    \ may be used\nto move assets across the network by anybody who is a mem-\nber.\
    \ The most recent ledger is available to all members.\nConsensus-based distributed\
    \ ledgers and smart contracts fos-\nter network conﬁdence. Assets and transactions\
    \ are recorded\nin the distributed ledger. Transactions are possible with a dis-\n\
    tributed ledger. You cannot remove a transaction after it has\nbeen added. An\
    \ encrypted ledger prevents tampering with\ntransactions. With blockchain, the\
    \ distributed ledger is trans-\nformed into a reliable data source for the network\
    \ [134]. A dis-\ntributed ledger of digital commerce is known as a blockchain.\n\
    Each node of the network modiﬁes distributed ledgers\nthrough cryptography. Components\
    \ of a blockchain include\nits block header, timestamp, nonce, and Merkle root\
    \ hash.\nSmart apps are being developed for rural agriculture. Agri-\ncultural\
    \ modernization relies on ICT to automate processes\nand protect personal data.\
    \ Data from many IoT devices\nmay be sent to a central hub to analyze and manage\
    \ auton-\nomous farm activities. However, centralized intermediates\nare inherent\
    \ in a single point of failure, data loss risk, and\nman-in-the-middle attacks.\
    \ Thanks to smart contracts on\nthe blockchain, decentralized and safe agricultural\
    \ automa-\ntions are now possible [135].\n(8) T-10.8: Production-Based Smart System\
    \ for Agriculture. It\nis possible to increase productivity and quality by using\
    \ IoT-\nbased agricultural convergence technologies. Predicting\ndemand, managing\
    \ supply, and ensuring quality are beneﬁts\nof precision agriculture. The expansion\
    \ of the economy is\nmainly fueled by agriculture. The government is responsible\n\
    for protecting the land [136]. Nothing has changed despite\nadvances in science\
    \ and technology. There is no shortage\nof green technologies. Farmers need to\
    \ reduce the time they\nspend working and increase the precision they use their\n\
    resources. Complex statistical methodologies are used by\nagriculturalists when\
    \ analyzing historical data and making\neconomic predictions. Farm yields are\
    \ improved via GPS,\nsensors, and big data. Real-time data from ICT-based deci-\n\
    sion support systems can take the role of farmers’ knowledge\nand intuition [137].\
    \ Improved decision-making reduces the\namount of waste and increases eﬃciency.\
    \ Images, GPS,\nscience-based solutions, climate forecasts, technology, and\n\
    environmental controls play a role in agriculture. As with\nthe terms “smart meters”\
    \ and “smart cities,” “smart farming”\nrefers to any M2M application. Technology\
    \ advances to aid\nin harvest forecasting. However, predictions based on statis-\n\
    tics are not always accurate. Harvest data and the agricul-\ntural environment\
    \ should be correlated. IoT will provide\nagricultural data. Complex statistical\
    \ methodologies are used\nby agriculturalists when analyzing historical data and\
    \ mak-\ning economic predictions. Predicting crop yields is aided\nby the use\
    \ of smart systems. In the end, statistical forecasts\nare not perfect; they are\
    \ only a starting point. Make a con-\nnection between the agricultural environment\
    \ and harvest\ndata. Crop pattern data will be provided through IoT-\nbased decision\
    \ support. On IoT, agribusiness utilizes data\nmining, statistical forecasting,\
    \ and IoT services [138].\n(9) T-10.9: Industry 4.0 in Agriculture. Global agriculture\n\
    must undergo a paradigm shift in light of evolving environ-\nmental conditions,\
    \ dietary preferences, and a scarcity of crit-\nical inputs. It is all about the\
    \ latest advancements in\nagriculture. As a result of the adoption of Industry\
    \ 4.0, busi-\nnesses may expect to see advances in output, eﬃciency, and\ncreativity.\
    \ First, agriculture provides food for the world’s\npopulation. Second, agriculture\
    \ 4.0 decreases labor and envi-\nronmental eﬀects to increase agricultural proﬁtability\
    \ by\nreducing greenhouse gas emissions and water use. Third,\nagriculture is\
    \ the primary source of income for half of India’s\npopulation, India’s veins\
    \ and arteries [139]. The fourth stage\nof industrial development is large-scale\
    \ agriculture. Among\nthe essential ICTs is the IoT. Flexibility is improved in\n\
    “smart factories.” People, equipment, and software work\ntogether to satisfy production\
    \ demands, which are met\nthrough cutting-edge technology such as CPS/IoT/iOS\
    \ and\nreal-time interaction. The industry beneﬁts from consolida-\ntion. However,\
    \ future manufacturing and commerce will be\nharmed. This shift is made possible\
    \ due to the Internet and\ninformation technology [140]. Quality control encompasses\n\
    all aspects of engineering, management, manufacturing,\noperations, and logistics.\
    \ Costs, availability, use of resources,\nand market demand may all be automated.\
    \ ‘The implemen-\ntation of Industry 4.0 will profoundly impact the agriculture\n\
    and industrial sectors. All technologies like Big Data, AI, and\nIoT are part\
    \ of Industry 4.0. IoT allows agricultural systems\n13\nJournal of Sensors\nand\
    \ equipment to connect with one another, making Indus-\ntry 4.0 a game changer\
    \ in agriculture [141]. The fourth\nindustrial revolution created networked tractors,\
    \ farms,\nand manufacturing equipment [142]. “Industry Revolutions\n4.0” refers\
    \ to three factors:\n(1) Digitalization and its integration into simple eco-\n\
    nomical and technical networks\n(2) Digitalization of services and products\n\
    (3) Market models that have been updated\nAs economic, economic and business models\
    \ develop,\nhumans become more distant from the center of production\nand surveillance\
    \ of crops. Industry 4.0 is being used by both\ndeveloped and developing countries.\
    \ India has a lot of\nuntapped potential for agricultural growth. Robotics, IoT,\n\
    and e-business are the three pillars of this revolution, aiming\nto deliver technology\
    \ to every corner of the globe.\n(10) T-10.10: Image-Based Classiﬁcation Techniques\
    \ in Intel-\nligent Agriculture. Agriculture originated thirteen thousand\nyears\
    \ ago between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers north of\nIraq. Gathered vegetation\
    \ included wild wheat and others.\nFew people needed food. UN estimates that the\
    \ world’s pop-\nulation will reach 10 billion by 2050, impacting farmers.\nDesertiﬁcation\
    \ and urbanization wreak havoc on farmland.\nCOVID-19 is a threat to food security\
    \ and the nation’s econ-\nomy. To solve this problem, we need to use fewer people\
    \ to\ngenerate more food [143]. In certain parts of India, rainfall is\nthe only\
    \ irrigation water supply. However, crop destruction\ncan occur in some places\
    \ due to unpredictability in rainfall,\nwhich is a problem. Management of watersheds\
    \ is critical.\nMany-variable hydrological modeling is required to predict\nrainfall\
    \ and runoﬀ in diﬀerent basins accurately. Estimates\nof imperviousness necessitate\
    \ a terrain categorization, which\nultimately categorizes land use and cover [144].\
    \ The image\nclassiﬁcation curve number is used in modeling. Satellite pic-\n\
    tures are diﬃcult to classify because of their high resolution\nand wide range\
    \ of applications.\nNevertheless, images are a common practice in agricul-\nture\
    \ and water management. There are a plethora of tools\nand methods for classifying\
    \ images. ANN and SVM are used\nfor image classiﬁcation [145]. Techniques used\
    \ to organize\npictures traditionally are time-consuming and prone to\nhuman error.\
    \ With pattern recognition, alternate ways can\nreduce time and enhance accuracy.\
    \ Unlike Bayes’ discrimi-\nnant criteria, SVM multiclassiﬁcation outperforms.\n\
    8. Threats to Validity\nThis analysis is based on LDA topic modeling and has\n\
    bounded to the limitations of this topic modeling technique.\nA suﬃcient article\
    \ count has been achieved, yet the risk of\nmissing out is a concern. The bibliographic\
    \ material has also\nbeen inferred. The search string insuﬃciency has been erad-\n\
    icated appropriately due to the limitations of selected search\nterms, synonyms,\
    \ string formulation, and search engines’\nvariedness resulting in imperfect retrieval\
    \ of literature cor-\npus. Labeling topics is a signiﬁcant concern due to subjectiv-\n\
    ity and bias. According to the author, a deep discussion has\nbeen conducted to\
    \ determine the label best to overcome this\nlimitation. Then, based on critical\
    \ terms, labels have been\nformulated to draw the best topic labels for researchers\n\
    and practitioners.\n9. Conclusion\nUsing IoT technology, farmers and producers\
    \ may better\nmanage their resources, such as fertilizer consumption and\nthe\
    \ number of trips made by farm vehicles, while minimiz-\ning waste and maximizing\
    \ productivity, including water,\nelectricity, and other inputs. In IoT smart\
    \ farming systems,\nsensors monitor the agricultural ﬁeld and automate the irri-\n\
    gation system. Farmers can monitor their ﬁelds from any-\nwhere. This paper concluded\
    \ the research direction in\nsmart agriculture and farming. Technology has shaped\
    \ agri-\nculture’s history. Historians have identiﬁed several agricul-\ntural\n\
    revolutions\nthat\nchanged\npractice\nand\noutput.\nTechnological advances have\
    \ fueled these revolutions. The\nIndustrial Revolution mechanized agriculture,\
    \ improving\nfarm labor productivity.\nModern mechanized agriculture has replaced\
    \ numerous\nfarm activities by hand or by oxen, horses, and mules.\nWeather forecasting\
    \ and barbed wire were 19thcentury\nadvances. Portable engines and threshing machines\
    \ became\npopular after improvements. In the 20thcentury, synthetic\nfertilizers\
    \ and insecticides, mass-produced tractors, and agri-\ncultural aircraft for aerial\
    \ pesticide application were devel-\noped. Precision farming, disease monitoring,\
    \ agricultural\ndrones, satellite imagery, and sensors are just ways technol-\n\
    ogy makes farming easier for farmers. Intelligent software\nanalysis for pest\
    \ and disease prediction and soil management\nare only a few of the many analytical\
    \ activities that IoT-\nbased sensor networks may do. New issues in smart farming\n\
    include the security of the farming data, technical failures,\nand technical incompetence.\n\
    10. Future Work\nThe LDA model works like a recommender system. The cur-\nrent\
    \ research is based on extracting keywords from the doc-\numents and recommends\
    \ current and trending research\nareas based on the correlation of the keywords\
    \ in the speci-\nﬁed ﬁeld. So, in the real-time scenario, any corpus of any size\n\
    can be passed to the model to get the relevant keywords, and\nbased on these keywords,\
    \ suggestions for topics can be\ndepicted. The authors have used this model on\
    \ smart agri-\nculture in the current research. In contrast, this model can\n\
    also be implemented in other research ﬁelds like smart cities,\nblockchain, and\
    \ Wireless Sensor Networks. In this study, the\nauthors analyzed data retrieved\
    \ from the Scopus database\ninstead of Web of Science, Education Resources Information\n\
    Center, ScienceDirect, or the Directory of Open Access Jour-\nnals. However, the\
    \ authors chose the Scopus database over\nthese other databases because Scopus\
    \ has more excellent\n14\nJournal of Sensors\ncoverage of publications, demonstrating\
    \ that it is a compre-\nhensive and dependable data source and so justifying its\

    \ \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \n            It is important for farmers to explore multiple\
    \ sources of information to gain a  \ncomprehensive understanding of the role\
    \ of technology in small agricultural projects. By \nstaying informed, farmers\
    \ can make informed decisions and leverage technology \neffectively to improve\
    \ their agricultural practices. \nThe role of technology in precision farming\
    \ projects: \n         Technology plays a pivotal role in precision farming projects,\
    \ which aim to optimize \nagricultural practices by precisely managing resources\
    \ and reducing waste. Here are some \nkey roles of technology in precision farming:\
    \ Global Positioning System (GPS): GPS \ntechnology is integral to precision farming.\
    \ GPS allows farmers to accurately determine \nthe geographic location of their\
    \ fields and equipment. By using GPS receivers, farmers \ncan precisely navigate\
    \ their machinery, create digital maps of their fields, and track the \nlocation\
    \ of specific crop areas. This information forms the foundation for various precision\
    \ \nfarming practices. Remote Sensing and Imaging: Remote sensing technologies,\
    \ such as \nsatellite imagery, aerial drones, and sensors, provide valuable data\
    \ for precision farming. \nThese technologies can capture high-resolution images\
    \ and collect data on crop health, \nvegetation indices, soil moisture, and temperature.\
    \ By analyzing this data, farmers can \nidentify variations within their fields\
    \ and make informed decisions regarding irrigation, \nfertilization, and pest\
    \ management. \n            Variable Rate Technology (VRT): VRT enables farmers\
    \ to apply inputs, such as \nfertilizers and pesticides, at variable rates based\
    \ on the specific needs of different areas \nwithin a field. This technology uses\
    \ data from soil sensors, GPS, and remote sensing to \ncreate prescription maps\
    \ that guide machinery to apply the right amount of inputs in each \nlocation.\
    \ VRT minimizes over-application, reduces input costs, and ensures optimal \n\
    resource utilization. Automated Machinery and Equipment: Precision farming relies\
    \ on \nadvanced machinery and equipment that are equipped with sensors, actuators,\
    \ and GPS \ncapabilities. These machines can perform tasks with high accuracy\
    \ and consistency. For \nexample, automated seeders can precisely place seeds\
    \ at the desired depth and spacing, \nwhile sprayers can apply pesticides only\
    \ to the targeted areas, minimizing drift and \nwastage. Internet of Things (IoT):\
    \ IoT technology enables the collection of real-time data \nfrom various devices\
    \ and sensors on the farm. IoT devices, such as soil moisture sensors, \nweather\
    \ stations, and crop health monitors, provide continuous data streams that help\
    \ \nfarmers monitor and manage their crops more effectively. Farmers can access\
    \ this data \nremotely through mobile apps or web-based platforms, allowing for\
    \ timely decision-\nmaking. \nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN AGRICULTURE AND\
    \ \nENVIRONMENT \nPrint ISSN 2974-4407 \nOnline ISSN 2974-4415 \nVOLUME 1, ISSUE\
    \ 1, 2021, 1 – 21 \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \n                   Data Analytics and Farm\
    \ Management Systems: Precision farming generates \nvast amounts of data, and\
    \ technology facilitates the analysis and interpretation of this data. \nAdvanced\
    \ data analytics techniques, such as machine learning and predictive modeling,\
    \ \ncan uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the data. Farm management\
    \ systems \nintegrate data from multiple sources, such as yield monitors, weather\
    \ data, and input \napplication rates, to provide farmers with comprehensive insights\
    \ for decision-making. \nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs): Drones equipped with\
    \ specialized sensors and \ncameras are used in precision farming for crop monitoring,\
    \ mapping, and scouting. UAVs \ncan quickly collect high-resolution imagery of\
    \ crops, detect stress factors, and identify \nareas of concern, such as pest\
    \ infestations or nutrient deficiencies. This information helps \nfarmers take\
    \ targeted actions and optimize their crop management practices. By \nleveraging\
    \ these technologies, precision farming projects can improve resource \nmanagement,\
    \ optimize inputs, reduce environmental impact, and increase overall farm \nefficiency.\
    \ The integration of data, analytics, and automation empowers farmers to make\
    \ \ndata-driven decisions, maximize yields, and ensure sustainable agricultural\
    \ practices. \nUse of technology in farm management systems: \n            Technology\
    \ plays a crucial role in farm management systems by providing farmers \nwith\
    \ tools and platforms to streamline and optimize various aspects of their agricultural\
    \ \noperations: Data Collection and Monitoring: Technology enables farmers to\
    \ collect and \nmonitor a wide range of data related to their farming operations.\
    \ This includes data on \nweather conditions, soil moisture levels, crop growth,\

    from lighting and

    heating to security and entertainment through simple commands or even autonomously.

    The integration of these technologies represents a profound shift from conventional
    housing models,

    merging the realms of digital innovation with everyday domestic life. The implications
    of this

    transformation are far-reaching, touching various aspects of society, economy,
    and culture [3].

    Particularly in countries with rich architectural traditions, such as Italy, the
    integration of smart

    technologies within the housing landscape presents unique challenges and opportunities.
    This

    juxtaposition of the time-honored principles of design with cutting-edge technological
    solutions offers a

    fascinating exploration of how tradition can be reinterpreted and revitalized
    through modern innovation.

    The emergence of smart homes is not just a technological phenomenon; it represents
    a societal shift that

    re§ects changing attitudes towards energy consumption, personal convenience, security,
    and even the

    broader philosophy of living. With global trends leaning towards sustainability
    and technological

    responsiveness, the evolution of smart homes becomes a critical subject of study
    that links technology,

    design, functionality, and human behavior.

    In this paper, we will delve into the multifaceted concept of smart homes with
    a particular focus on Italy''s

    housing landscape. We will explore how this nation, with its rich architectural
    heritage, is navigating the

    path from tradition to transformation, weaving smart home technologies into the
    very fabric of its cultural

    identity. The study will examine the economic, social, and architectural implications
    of this integration,

    providing insights that are not only relevant to Italy but also contribute to
    a broader understanding of how

    smart homes are rede¦ning our contemporary living experience.

    2. Methodology

    This research employs a mixed-methods approach to comprehensively investigate
    the integration of

    smart home technologies within Italy''s housing landscape [4]. Initially, a systematic

    conducted to gather existing knowledge from primary research articles, books,
    conference papers, and

    industry reports. This review enabled the identi¦cation of key technological trends,
    challenges, and

    opportunities related to smart home adoption [5]. Following the literature review,
    quantitative data were

    collected through a nationwide survey targeting homeowners, architects, and technology
    providers. This

    survey was designed to assess attitudes, perceptions, and practical applications
    of smart home

    technologies in various Italian regions [6]. Additionally, qualitative data were
    gathered through in-depth

    interviews with experts and stakeholders, aiming to provide nuanced insights into
    the economic, social,

    and architectural implications of technology integration. The collected data were
    analyzed using

    statistical tools for quantitative information and thematic analysis for qualitative
    insights. A triangulation

    of ¦ndings from different sources ensured a holistic understanding, and Geographic
    Information System

    (GIS) mapping was utilized to spatially represent the distribution of smart home
    technologies across Italy

    [4]. This multi-faceted methodology allowed for a rich exploration of the subject,
    linking technological

    considerations with cultural, historical, and economic contexts within the Italian
    housing landscape.

    3. History and Development of Smart Homes in Italy

    The impact of smart homes on Italian society has been profound, extending beyond
    the realm of mere

    technological advancements [7]. As homes evolved into immersive environments tailored
    to individual

    preferences, people found themselves more deeply connected to their living spaces.
    The integration of

    innovative sensors and intelligent devices brought a new level of convenience
    and ease, transforming

    everyday tasks into seamless experiences. No longer were homes just shelters;
    they became nurturing

    hubs that anticipated and met the needs of their inhabitants [8].

    Moreover, the smart home revolution fostered a culture of sustainability and environmental

    consciousness [9]. The ability to optimize energy consumption and reduce waste
    became a central tenet

    of smart home design. This conscientious approach not only contributed to more
    eco-friendly living but

    also aligned with Italy''s commitment to protecting the natural beauty and heritage
    of the country.

    The journey of smart homes in Italy has been a collaborative effort between visionary
    individuals,

    academia, and industry leaders [10]. The convergence of multidisciplinary expertise
    has driven this ¦eld

    Abstract: Precision agriculture is a breakthrough in digital farming technology,
    which facilitates the appli-

    cation of precise and exact amount of input level of water and fertilizer to the
    crop at the required time for

    increasing the yield. Since agriculture relies on direct rainfall than irrigation
    and the prediction of rainfall

    date is easily available from web source, the integration of rainfall prediction
    with precision agriculture

    helps to regulate the water consumption in farms. In this work, an edge computing
    model is developed for

    predicting soil moisture in real time and managing the water usage in accordance
    with rain prediction. A

    soil moisture prediction hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) has been developed that revolves
    around the decision-

    making techniques with live environmental parameters including weather parameters
    for the prediction of

    soil moisture through the impact of precipitation. Numerous algorithms with the
    combination of regression

    + clustering are estimated, and it is inferred that XGBoost + k-means outperforms
    other algorithmic com-

    binations that is deployed in edge model. This model is used as an intermediary
    between the end IoT

    devices and cloud that results in the saving of computationally intensive processing
    performed on cloud

    servers. The servers located on a local edge network perform the developed algorithmic
    computations.

    Avoiding transmission over the cloud results in signiﬁcant latency, response time,
    and computation power

    savings and therefore increases the eﬃciency of data transfer. The proposed edge
    computing model is

    implemented in Raspberry Pi as an edge, Heroku as cloud, and edge nodes as the
    combination of Pi with

    actuators and sensors. The monitored data from Pi are stored in MongoDB webserver
    that is controlled by

    Web dashboard. Finally, the developed model is implemented in cloud and edge where
    the edge server

    implementation performs better in terms of latency, bandwidth, throughput, response
    time, and CPU

    memory usage.

    1 Introduction

    It is evident that agriculture always has a specialized role in the anthrophonic
    evolution and has been

    serving as an important economic factor for the growth of a country [1]. Around
    58% of the population

    depend on agriculture as the chief source of livelihood in India. The quality
    and productivity of agricultural

    products have declined over these years as several factors have inﬂuenced the
    crop productivity both

    directly and indirectly. Some major factors that aﬀect the crop production are
    climatic changes, global

    warming, and water scarcity [2]. The agricultural land’s productivity is aﬀected
    by the direct and indirect

    changes in climate [3,4]. The crop growth has been already aﬀected by the changes
    in climate incurred by

    global warming. The nutrition quality of soil, ground water level, sea, and ocean
    are aﬀected by the

    modiﬁcations in average temperature, rainfall, and extreme weather conditions
    such as hail storms, dust

    storms, heatwaves, etc. due to global warming [5,6]. Degradation of soil is primarily
    created by various

    methods including 93.7% by water erosion, 9.5% by wind erosion, 5.9% by salinity
    and alkalinity, etc.

    Further changes in climate would inﬂuence adversely the crop production [7]. Since
    water is an indispen-

    sable requirement for plants and cultivation, the high level of soil is eroded
    and thereby the fertility is also

    declined. Due to the ever-changing climate, water scarcity has become a huge problem.
    Drought-like

    conditions is already formed in several areas and thereby the present and conventional
    farming practices

    are not suitable. New and unique environment preserving techniques are the need
    of the hour [8].

    The conventional approaches in agriculture are enhanced by the advent of several
    advancements in

    technology [9]. These new improved methodologies ensure optimized utilization
    of resources, accurate

    forecast of water needs and environmental parameters, reduction of human intervention,
    etc. [10]. Conse-

    quently, the outcomes of crops in terms of yield and quality are higher with cost-eﬀective
    methods. One

    such booming technology is the Internet of things (IoT) [11].

    IoT is the collection of components embedded in the sensor for measuring and transferring
    data via

    network devices as sensed from pumps and tractors to weather stations. Primarily,
    IoT deals with the

    transmission and reception of data related to farms through devices using the
    Internet for prediction

    and providing decisions to the farmers. IoT-based methodologies has brought a
    changeover in agricultural

    patterns and farming approaches [12]. IoT devices can gather information about
    soil moisture, chemical

    properties, dam levels, livestock health, and weather details in real time. The
    information acquired from IoT

    devices facilitates the farmers in tracking farms periodically. Farmers can save
    time and money by

    responding faster to farm conditions. Cloud computing models integrated with on-ﬁeld
    agricultural sensors

    need to be incorporated for tackling the issue of processing huge voluminous data.

    One of the major challenges of IoT is the processing of huge datasets in a sequential
    way. Some of the

    key factors that need to be focused on this process are as follows: information
    about the type and nature of

    data, the way of acquiring the data, etc. The preliminary stage comprises acquiring
    the data and ingesting

    the data to the system. Substantial cognizance of data are achieved as the data
    pass through all the

    gateways where it is cleansed and transformed before entering into the system.
    In the near future, dynamic

    prediction of soil moisture and precipitation techniques are to be developed for
    smart irrigation systems.

    Therefore, a system is developed for eﬃcient and optimal utilization of fresh
    water in irrigation along with

    drip irrigation system. It aids in ﬁnding which one of the plants fails to get
    suﬃcient water. When the water

    supply is provided the next day, this delay should not disturb the system. It
    becomes important for the

    farmers to understand the optimal usage of water and fertilizers to bring out
    sustenance in the agricultural

    industry. Therefore, processing must be done for analyzing the data, so that patterns
    can be analyzed and

    planning can be done for the long term, accordingly. Hence, it gives a broad vision
    in deciding where the

    processing is to be done exactly. Therefore, it is obvious that not all data are
    crucial, and it provides a clear

    view of which data need to be stored, discarded, and retained for both long-term
    and short-term purposes.

    Thus, all these challenging issues require to be addressed and that is where storage
    technologies are

    actually highlighted. The poor quality of Internet access in developing nations
    makes the implementation

    quite challenging. An applicable solution to solve this problem is through edge
    computing where the

    essential data could be oﬄoaded from the cloud over the edge of the cloud, and
    this is the exact point

    where the approach of smart sensing with edge computing gets in.

    With the purpose of broadening the potential of edge computing and using it in
    the agriculture domain,

    a novel approach using machine learning (ML) methods is proposed for analyzing
    the data acquired by the

    IoT devices deployed at the farm. Here, the data acquired from IoT components
    undergo preprocessing and

    ML models on the edge nodes to analyze and assess the appropriate results for
    providing the best instruc-

    tions for controlling the actuators (e.g., light, pumps at diﬀerent locations)
    in the farms.

    This article presents an automated system, as shown in Figure 1, to predict the
    soil moisture using the

    ﬁeld information acquired from the self-designed sensor node deployed at the ﬁeld
    and the forecast

    information of weather via Internet. A unique algorithm has been developed that
    revolves around the

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    633

    machine learning techniques for the prediction of soil moisture. Here, many algorithms
    with the combina-

    tion of regression + clustering was estimated, and it is inferred that XGBoost
    + k-means outperforms other

    algorithmic combinations, and therefore, it is deployed for the prediction of
    soil moisture in the proposed

    work. The proposed algorithm makes eﬀective irrigation decisions with optimized
    usage of water in a more

    accurate and reliable manner. The eﬀective decision-making refers to the process
    of predicting the rainfall,

    thereby reducing the water usage in advance by the proposed algorithm in accordance
    with the predicted

    rainy days. Through this automatic decision-making, over watering is avoided by
    saving the soil. The

    server-side software is developed with node-side connectivity using the information
    for visualization and

    decision support features. This proposed algorithm is implemented in edge to prove
    the eﬃciency of the

    edge server handling the automated system better than the cloud control. The performance
    of the decen-

    tralized edge-based architecture has been evaluated for downloading the hybrid
    algorithm from cloud in

    real time execution. The performance can be enhanced by adopting edge computing
    architecture and

    measured with the help of network parameters like latency, bandwidth, and response
    time. Edge computing

    capacity is also estimated using the CPU processor and memory consumption while
    executing the proposed

    algorithm with irrigation scheduling.

    2 Related work

    In ref. [13], a smart irrigation system not aﬀected by communication disconnection
    and delay is developed

    using edge nodes deployed at the farms. Environmental parameters have an intricate
    impact on the plant

    growth. It becomes necessary for evaluating multiple AI models simultaneously
    in an actual cultivation

    environment for comparing AI models under the same conditions. Due to the working
    of existing irrigation

    systems on the cloud, communication is instable in the concurrent evaluation of
    AI models. However, the

    instability does not induce an edge node in its performance.

    The factors such as type of plant, soil, climate, humidity, temperature, and soil
    moisture need to be

    considered for the irrigation system packed with potential smart decisions. The
    nature and type of plant,

    soil, and climate are queried by ontology (branch of metaphysics dealing with
    the nature of being), whereas

    other factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture are sensed by the
    sensor network. The

    trained ML model predicts the watering decisions based on ontology and other factors
    as mentioned earlier.

    Smart irrigation has three modules: (i) sensor network modules that sense the
    parameters impacting the water

    requirement by using sensors DHT22, light sensor BH1750, and HL-69 hygrometer
    for sensing the temperature,

    soil moisture, light, and humidity in air. (ii) Edge and IoT server’s module to
    send and receive data through

    HTTP requests. (iii) Training module in which KNN is applied on the sample dataset
    for training and decision-

    making regarding the water needs. Based on the input values, the trained model
    categorizes the input into ﬁve

    possible classes: highly not needed, not needed, average, needed, and highly needed
    [14].

    A decentralized smart irrigation approach is proposed for strawberry greenhouses
    in contrast to con-

    ventional cloud-based solutions for keeping the agricultural data at the edge
    of the network. A full-scale

    smart irrigation system in an actual strawberry greenhouse environment is developed
    after a small-scale

    smart irrigation networking prototype system and a reference architecture targeting
    edge data distribution

    for strawberry greenhouse applications are framed. A three-step industrial approach
    is formed for

    designing, implementing, and validating a solution for smart strawberry irrigation
    in greenhouses and

    keeping the corresponding data at the edge of the network at the same time: (i)
    A small-scale smart

    irrigation prototype solution with oﬀ-the-shelf hardware and software equipment
    is tested and evaluated

    on various types of plants for gaining useful insights for deployments on a large
    scale. (ii) A reference

    network architecture is designed for targeting smart irrigation and edge data
    distribution speciﬁcally for

    strawberry greenhouses. (iii) A large-scale system in an actual strawberry greenhouse
    environment is

    developed in Greece, incorporating the proposed reference architecture [15].

    Edge computing is proposed for addressing the issues by taking advantage of computing
    resources in

    the edge of the network. The issues such as an edge mobile device make it easier
    to achieve low end-to-end

    latency, high bandwidth, and low jitter to services located on the edge network.
    An edge can enforce the

    privacy policies of its owner prior to the release of the data to the cloud through
    edge analytics. If a cloud

    service becomes unavailable due to network failure, cloud failure, or a denial-of-service
    attack, a fallback

    service on a nearby edge can temporarily mask the failure. Cloud services, partial
    analysis, and control

    functions are extended to the edge nodes from the cloud data center. Edge nodes
    facilitate the timely

    monitoring of sensors in smart farming by the reduced latency and enhanced data
    transmission. Due to

    these factors, edge computing is applied through farming [16,17]. A three-tier
    open-source software plat-

    form we proposed by authors, and the platform enhanced the precision agriculture
    by introducing edge

    computing and fog computing. An network functions virtualization (NFV)-based approach
    is deployed for

    performing the local operational decisions at the edge level for mitigating the
    inﬂuence of network failures

    while using cloud data centers [18]. For control processing in smart farming,
    a platform enabling cost-

    eﬀective sensor/actuator network based on IoT, utilizes edge computing [19,20].

    The authors in ref. [21] predicted the soil moisture using a mathematical model
    that measures the

    values given by a sensor matrix on the ground. Due to the huge interval in measurements
    (10 minutes), the

    model presented estimated error by more than 10%. This methodology has incorporated
    the online

    approach by making the sensors to send data every minute to edge devices without
    time-based interruption.

    The authors of ref. [22] applied a combinative approach of using ﬁeld sensor network’s
    data along with

    weather forecast station’s data for the management of optimality in water conditions
    for the enhanced

    growth of grapes. The generated data are forwarded to a web server, which displays
    graphics without

    statistical analysis of such data. The analysis must be performed a posteriori
    by the user.

    The watering mechanism for a plant via IoT methodology is devised by the proposed
    smart irrigation

    model without acquiring any pre-processed data. A prototype application is developed,
    which gets adapted

    to the parameters needed in irrigation after a couple of human-made irrigations.
    With the usage of various

    ML algorithms, several tests are devised for manual and automated irrigations
    for the performance evalua-

    tion. After the evaluation using four diﬀerent ML algorithms such as logistic
    regression (LR), K-nearest

    neighbors (KNN), Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), and gradient boosting regression
    trees (GBRT), it is found

    that GBRT outperforms other algorithms. To analyze the overall performance, a
    test bed for the sensor edge,

    mobile client, and the decision service on the cloud is established. Two diﬀerent
    indoor species are selected

    as test items for the prototype, namely, Peace lily and Sardinia. The outcomes
    were quite good, and it is

    inferred that the prototype has learned the patterns of irrigation and making
    decisions automatically with a

    high rate of accuracy [23].

    The authors from ref. [24] adopted the deep learning methodology for detecting
    the type and the

    category of the plant using an automated plant irrigation system. The water necessity
    of the plant is

    determined using the recognition of predeﬁned set of plant images and data set
    acquired from farm. It

    utilizes the database for fetching the irrigation information after the recognition
    process is completed.

    Modeling the training processes are time consuming as voluminous set of images
    needs to be stored.

    The authors in refs [25,26] incorporated ML methods in the irrigation decision
    support model using a

    pre-processed irrigation data set. A model is developed for learning the irrigation
    needs of any plants

    progressively rather than using a readily available dataset. Several ML algorithms
    are evaluated with their

    precision for concluding the irrigation decisions. Manual irrigations are performed
    two times before making

    precise decisions. Due to the dynamicity in model, data processing is done progressively,
    and it can be

    applied to several plants having varying irrigation conditions. There is a need
    for the learning model that

    can be trained by itself using a comparatively lighter learning process using
    environmental parameters that

    do not need larger storage in the system but need higher computation. From the
    aforementioned survey for

    making a precise decision with instant computation locally, edge computing needs
    to be integrated into the

    irrigation system. This article is directed towards presenting a platform that
    implies IoTs and edge com-

    puting in monitoring soil moisture via sensors, data communication between sensors
    and edge devices, and

    an Analytics-as-a-Service cloud. It analyzes the collected data in the form of
    a density map of soil moisture

    for denoting the areas in need of greater or lesser frequency of irrigation. Here,
    density map does not refer to

    the geographical point data by satellite mapping, and it actually denotes the
    point of dry area and watery

    area through soil moisture detection point. This point is averaged among areas
    of irrigation to be done and

    the irrigation process is controlled with prediction of rainfall using the proposed
    system.

    3 The proposed system

    The proposed learning model for irrigation is implemented in a prototype IoT system
    that has four compo-

    nents: (i) Edge node layer – This layer consists of sensors, actuator, and two
    microcontrollers. In this layer,

    edge node acquires the sensor data from the surroundings and controls the actuator
    for actuating water

    pumps to start irrigation. (ii) Edge server layer – This layer consists of Raspberry
    Pi that act as edge server

    and capable of multitask processing. Here, edge server controls the edge nodes
    for sending signal and

    receiving data at regular interval of time. It is also connected to the cloud
    server for receiving developed and

    trained machine learning model to be deployed and make irrigation decision for
    controlling edge nodes.

    (iii) Edge service layer – This layer is deployed in the edge server and it is
    responsible for controlling the

    whole system through a developed web dashboard. The dashboard has live feed data,
    control of edge

    nodes, and cloud services access. This service layer also has the control access
    of the proposed machine

    learning model. (iv) Cloud server layer – This layer composed of cloud services
    and cloud storage where its

    role is to train the machine learning model and store the data in database. It
    sends the trained proposed

    model to the edge server for decision-making regarding irrigation scheduling.
    The comprehensive inter-

    connections in the system are shown in Figure 2. The proposed IoT-based smart
    irrigation system includes

    ﬁve major components: ﬁeld deployed module, Web-based interface, Web API weather
    input, soil moisture

    prediction mechanism, and edge communication model.

    3.1 Field deployed module

    In the ﬁeld requirements, a wireless sensor network of the sensor nodes needs
    to be deployed as shown in

    Figure 3. Here, ﬁeld data collection device accommodates four diﬀerent sensors:
    Capacitive Soil Moisture

    Sensor V2.0, DS18B20 Water Proof Temperature Sensor Probe for soil temperature,
    ultraviolet (UV) Light

    Radiation, DHT11 – Temperature and Humidity Sensor Module, and GYML8511 Analog
    Output Ultra-Violet

    Light Sensor Module. An Arduino Mega connected to Raspberry Pi 4 Model-B read,
    the output of these

    sensors where the program is developed in Python for the Pi model to fetch the
    hourly data from sensors

    and store the data in MongoDB [27] database. It is then synchronized with the
    server database using the

    developed web service. A Wi-Fi-enabled Arduino controls the water pump connected
    to a relay switch.

    Figure 3: Real-time prototype of the proposed edge model.

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    637

    For the real time monitoring, a trigger is made for controlling the web service
    from the responsive web-

    based interface. The irrigation decisions are checked periodically by the proposed
    model performed in the

    server. The water pump is actuated, and irrigation process is started only if
    the server makes any irrigation

    decision. A wireless sensor network (WSN) [28] scenario with ZigBee [29] technology
    can be implemented

    for a large farming area in which several sensor nodes can be aﬃxed in the speciﬁed
    area and every sensor

    node possesses sensors similar to a standalone device. Then, the Arduino Mega
    reads the sensor output

    connected to ZigBee for transferring data to Gateway Node for aggregating the
    received data and storing it

    in MongoDB locally and also for transferring the data via web service to the edge
    server.

    3.2 Web-based interface

    The proposed framework consists of a web-based application to allow farmers visualize
    the growing data

    and interacting with the garden in real time. In addition, users can also be able
    to examine and analyze the

    historical growing data, if needed, through functionalities such as irrigation
    control, motor control predic-

    tion model deployment, and manual data entry implemented in this web application.
    Here, Node.js was

    chosen for developing the web application [30,31], while MongoDB [27] was utilized
    as the database system.

    Data stored in the database, which is deployed in the cloud, will be used for
    further data analysis in the

    future. The web application’s functions are designed following a software design
    pattern called model-

    view-controller (MVC) as shown in Figure 4. In the frontend, ChartJS is used to
    represent data through

    dynamic charts. The web application is also used as an interface to manage all
    the physical devices/

    actuators in the garden. To deploy the web-server to the cloud, a cloud platform
    as a service (PaaS), namely,

    Heroku, had been utilized. Heroku is a cloud platform that provides platform as
    a service (PaaS), facilitates

    the creation of applications and deploying these online rapidly [32,33]. It also
    enhances scalability and

    functionality by integrating several add-on services. The ﬁeld data are sent to
    the server by Raspberry Pi

    using this web service. This web service manages the network outage/ﬂuctuation
    during data synchroniza-

    tion from the ﬁeld device to the server by taking the help of ﬂag settings at
    the database level. The interface

    facilitates the scheduling of irrigation along with visualizing real time sensors
    and predicted soil moisture

    for upcoming days and precipitation information. By using the denoted threshold
    value of soil moisture

    suggested by agronomists, the irrigation can be scheduled by the user. The system
    maintains the threshold

    value depending on the predicted pattern of soil moisture and precipitation information.
    The process of

    irrigation is initiated automatically and stopped after the speciﬁed threshold
    value generated from the

    proposed algorithm of soil moisture when it is reached.

    3.3 Web API weather input

    The weather prediction data are collected by a web service developed in Python.
    The forecast data such as

    humidity, temperature, ultra violet index, precipitation, and cloudiness of web
    forecasting portals like

    Open Weather API are aggregated by the developed web service [34]. These portals
    provide the forecasted

    information in HTML, XML, or JSON format. The predicted data with JSON format
    are read by the developed

    web and stored in database at the edge server, which is concerned in the prediction
    algorithm. Also, these

    data are utilized as testing dataset in the ML model for predicting the soil moisture.

    3.4 Soil moisture prediction mechanism

    An algorithm for predicting the soil moisture based on data derived from ﬁeld
    sensors and weather fore-

    casting using the combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning
    techniques has been

    developed underpinned by regression algorithms and k-means clustering for estimating
    the diﬀerence/

    change in soil moisture owing to weather conditions. Many regression algorithms
    are compared against

    each other and infusing each of them with k-means to check the preciseness in
    mean square error (MSE),

    R2, accuracy and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for prediction of soil
    moisture of upcoming days

    with the help of sensor data and weather forecasting days. The information about
    soil moisture for the

    upcoming days and suggestions for irrigation in accordance with the prescribed
    levels of soil moisture and

    predicted precipitation values, thereby saving energy and water, is presented
    by the algorithm. The infor-

    mation generated from the device and the predicted values from the algorithm soil
    moisture prediction

    hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) are stored in the server.

    3.5 Edge communication model

    The communication protocols in the proposed framework are ﬂexible and transparent
    in nature for

    accepting both wired and wireless methodologies. For the maximum utilization of
    potentiality in edge

    computing components, the communication among various components in the edge-IoT
    system requires

    intense probing by using the versatility among the devices in network edges. For
    transferring the data

    gathered from pivot sensors, a communication technology such as Zigbee [35] is
    needed for the irrigation

    systems. Therefore, the communication component in the proposed work is classiﬁed
    into three main areas

    as shown in Figure 5. The Message Query Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is
    used for the

    Figure 5: Proposed edge communication model.

    communication in the proposed system. The analysis in ref. [36] presented seven
    IoT messaging protocols

    (MQTT, CoAP, XMPP, AMQP, DDS, REST-HTTP, and WebSocket) as communication protocols
    that play a

    major role in smart farming. The authors have concluded that MQTT proved to be
    the most secure protocol

    after probing all the protocols with respect to latency, energy and bandwidth
    requirements, throughput,

    reliability, and security. Moreover, MQTT is secure in both end-to-end architecture
    and gateway server

    architecture. In an MQTT setup, a MQTT server termed as MQTT broker executes on
    the IoT solution [37].

    Under a common identiﬁer, a “publisher” and a “subscriber” link among themselves
    to this broker. In the

    IoT solution, publishers and subscribers are the IoT devices and IoT hubs or control
    devices, respectively.

    When the publishers have new data for recording, the data are published to the
    broker. The broker then

    ﬂags that it has new publisher data, and the corresponding data are read by the
    subscriber. Then, the

    subscriber analyzes the data and reacts accordingly.

    The ﬁrst level accomplishes with connecting the end users to system with the help
    of mobile or web-

    based applications through the Internet. The next level (cloud computing server)
    deals with the connection

    of web server and MQTT broker for directing the user requests and other components
    at the edge landscape

    or from the farms to the right cloud-based services like displaying the real time
    status of the farm for the

    users, triggering a new deployment of the updated ML model to the corresponding
    edge node. The third

    level (farming area) is directed toward the deployment of sensors and IoT devices
    (actuators) for commu-

    nicating with other components in the entire system.

    4 Deployment of soil moisture prediction hybrid algorithm

    The watering mechanism of the plant has diﬀerent approaches in the proposed model.
    Primarily, the system

    is trained with manual irrigations datasets during the process of learning with
    respect to suggestions

    deﬁned by agronomists. The model is trained to learn the needs of irrigation in
    the ﬁrst level of deployment

    in cloud without the inclusion of pre-processed data. After acquiring the required
    data and training, the

    proposed system is initiated to grasp the plant’s watering needs by undergoing
    plenty of manual irrigations.

    Thereafter, manual irrigation is not required and the system makes automated decisions
    in watering using

    the gathered data and the application of ML methods. The proposed model then decides
    the irrigation

    strategies automatically using ML methods without the need including collected
    datasets in the automatic

    irrigation process. The proposed model can be improved through the learning process
    when the number of

    precise irrigation inputs is provided to the model at each stage of training.

    The decision-making procedure is developed with two modules for irrigation strategies
    according to the

    soil moisture prediction for upcoming days. The ﬁrst module deals with training
    the model in cloud with

    manual irrigation datasets through steps such as data collection, data preprocessing,
    training, and model

    development. The system acquires values of air temperature (TH), soil temperature
    (SMT), soil moisture

    (SM), humidity (HU), and ultraviolet rays (UV) periodically from the physical
    environment in the data

    collection stage, which is essentially required for arriving at the watering decisions.
    Also, the time of

    performing the manual irrigation is recorded in the database. These data are timestamped
    and stored in

    as datasets to aid in making decisions for knowing the time of irrigation. In
    the next step of pre-processing,

    inconsistencies are eliminated and outliers caused by sensor errors are detected
    from the irrigation dataset,

    thereby helping in the removal of broken data. The training stage involves the
    application of supervised

    machine learning (ML) algorithms. Here the regression algorithms such as support
    vector regression (SVR),

    multiple linear regression (MLR), lasso regression (LR), decision tree regressor
    (DTR), random forest

    regressor (RF), and XG-boost regressor (XB) techniques are used for the deployment.
    The regression algo-

    rithms are trained using the collected datasets. Finally, through training, regression
    models are created,

    namely, SVR model, MLR model, LR model, DTR model, RF model, and XB model that
    are been combined

    with the second module for decision-making.

    The second module caters to the prediction of irrigation for upcoming days by
    infusing the weather data

    as an input to the regression trained models. The live datasets from the weather
    API for future prediction of

    640

    

    S. Premkumar and AN. Sigappi

    soil moisture variable are used. The dependent variables from weather forecast
    data like temperature (TH),

    humidity (HU), ultraviolet (UV), and precipitation (PC) are tested in the aforementioned
    model for soil

    moisture prediction. Then, the regression trained model is evaluated and deployed
    using the weather

    testing data for the prediction of soil moisture in accordance with the precipitation.
    After the prediction

    of data for the upcoming days, these developed regression models are combined
    with unsupervised ML

    algorithm named k-means clustering for estimating the changes incurred in soil
    moisture prediction due to

    the impact of weather conditions. Further, each regression models with k-means
    algorithm are evaluated

    for performances in terms of irrigation decision-making process as shown in Table
    1. The combined algo-

    rithms are estimated through MAPE, MSE, R2, execution speed, power consumption,
    and accuracy. The

    estimation and computation of these parameters are detailed by the authors in
    ref. [38].

    XGBoost + k-means (XB+k-means) approach provides more accuracy with less MSE comparatively
    and

    also the R2 with 98% in soil moisture prediction using combined approach is given
    in Table 1. It is evident

    that the proposed combination performs better when compared to other regression
    + k-means-based

    approaches. XB + k-means-based hybrid machine learning algorithm is applied in
    irrigation planning

    module on account of aforementioned performance metrices of ML. Although it performs
    moderately in

    terms of execution time and power usage, it is selected for the deployment in
    edge computing as it has

    better performed in terms of accuracy, R2, MSE, and MAPE metrices. It is observed
    that the prediction of soil

    moisture for the upcoming days from the proposed algorithm (XB+k-means) is nearer
    to the actual value as

    shown in Table 2, and hence, XB+k-means is selected for the implementation of
    SMPHA in edge-based

    irrigation scheduling.

    4.1 Hardware setup

    IoT system is crucial to handle, collect, and transfer the data to the computing
    nodes at the edge or in the

    cloud. These devices are connected to the edge nodes through wireless communication
    protocols like

    ZigBee. It is used in reducing the latency and loss of data. An Arduino micro-control
    unit controls the

    combined IoT sensors and actuators at the same part of a ﬁeld into a cluster,
    each connected to a Raspberry

    Pi that acts as an edge node in processing the gathered data and controlling the
    actuators. For example,

    Figure 2 shows an edge architecture with a Raspberry Pi connected to two components:
    Arduino Uno and

    Arduino Mega units via ZigBee connection. The ﬁrst Arduino Mega node is responsible
    for collecting data

    from sensors and the second one is for controlling the actuators in the ﬁeld.
    Depending on the sensor type

    with collecting Arduino unit, the sensors are connected via analog or digital
    PWM pins while controlling

    Arduino uno joins with actuators in the ﬁeld and controls (turn on/oﬀ) them in
    accordance with upper

    layers (from the edge web server). The trained (cloud) and deployed ML model in
    edge nodes provides the

    necessary instructions to the edge nodes.

    4.2 Web layer setup

    The deployment of web server assists the user in planning and managing the irrigation
    system. It visualizes

    the crucial information of factors like temperature of air and soil, UV, humidity,
    and soil moisture in live

    irrigation with real time updates in the form of various charts. In accordance
    with the selected ﬁeld, the web

    application redirects the user to the ﬁeld’s dashboard as shown in Figure 4. The
    dashboard consists of ﬁeld

    parameters as well as control signals for activating all the physical devices/actuators
    at the garden layer.

    These signals are denoted as switch buttons, and each switch controls (turn on/oﬀ)
    a particular kind of

    actuator (for instance, water pump to start and stop the irrigation). The user
    interface facilitates remote

    controlling of the ﬁeld by just clicking on the buttons as shown in Figure 4.

    4.3 Edge layer setup

    The edge node acts as a computing center where incoming data are analyzed and
    fed as the input vector to

    the ML model for processing and to return the control signals for activating or
    deactivating the actuators

    placed at the farm. Edge node processes the physical data (real time) at every
    end device such as the

    collected and processed data via the Raspberry Pi nodes presented in the proposed
    scheme. The prediction

    model is designed using TensorFlow API and trained, tested on Google Colab in
    this work. Amazon Web

    Service (AWS) oﬀers a library named Boto3 having many APIs to upload and download
    objects. After the

    development of model, it is transferred to Amazon S3, a service provided by AWS.
    The edge node utilizes the

    trained model from S3 for analyzing the sensed data acquired from garden’s sensors.
    The decision is

    delivered based on real time data analysis at the edge node and transmitted to
    Arduino nodes in the ﬁelds

    landscape immediately for controlling the actuators. In another ﬂow, the data
    collected from sensors are

    ﬁltered so as to keep only the modiﬁed data at the edge node before being sent
    back for mitigating the

    communication cost to the database in the cloud. These data are used in the updation
    of the ML model to

    enhance its eﬃciency.

    4.4 Analytics setup

    The main goal of this experiment lies in gathering the various physical parameters
    of a farming land via

    sensors and utilizing the fetched data along with weather forecast information
    for developing an algorithm

    using hybrid machine learning approach to infuse higher accuracy in predicting
    the soil moisture for the

    upcoming days. As discussed in Section 4, for the proper planning and provisioning
    of optimal irrigation,

    the algorithm provides a predictable estimate of soil moisture with the assistance
    of various statistical

    measures as shown in Table 1. The measures are adopted for estimating the appropriateness
    and error rate

    of the proposed algorithm. It is inferred from the experiment that, optimal irrigation
    is feasible using a good

    642

    

    S. Premkumar and AN. Sigappi

    estimation (close to the actual value) of the soil moisture (Table 2), with the
    support of ﬁeld data and

    forecast information, thereby utilizing the natural rain eﬃciently.

    The SMPHA ML model is interdependent on dynamic changes in weather environment
    where the

    models deployed on edge nodes need to change the controls accordingly after model
    gets trained con-

    tinuously. For the process of retraining, the trained model needs to be updated.
    The parameters such as TM,

    HU, ST, UV, SM about grown plants are logged for the training purpose, and these
    generated datasets are

    recorded from the already developed manual mode system [39]. The growth of the
    Indian Mundu Chilli [40]

    is taken for the observation from the ﬁrst stage to the last grown stage for 95
    days. While retraining the

    model, the training is carried in cloud without causing eﬀect to the functionalities
    at edge nodes. A signal is

    transferred to the corresponding edge server for triggering the task of updating
    the SMPHA model from the

    web server. At that time, the newly trained model is downloaded to replace the
    existing one at the con-

    sidering edge server. From then, the ML model at the edge server is called to
    be updated with the real-world

    knowledge and is ready for its garden controlling tasks (to apply in the next
    farming season).

    4.5 Work ﬂow

    The ﬂowchart in Figure 6 depicts the working of the proposed system based on the
    decision support system

    that is beneﬁcial for irrigation needed for the growth of vegetables. The chilli
    plant is grown in a growbag

    attached with sensors and Pi as shown in Figure 3 and monitored for 95 days of
    data collection. To bring out

    optimality in the irrigation system, features relating to climate, soil, crop,
    and ﬁeld infrastructure are to be

    considered. To provide several recommendations in the production of vegetables,
    decision support systems

    (DSSs) are designed, which process voluminous information [39]. This proposed
    work is the extension of

    soil moisture diﬀerences (SMD) model [41] developed for soil moisture prediction.
    The threshold values of

    soil moisture are used in the SMD model where the system schedules the irrigation
    date based on the

    predicted soil moisture and weather forecast (precipitation) information automatically
    using SVR+ k-means

    modeling. Therefore, in the extension of the aforementioned work, further more
    number of sensors are used

    to log soil moisture value, which is averaged in the proposed model. This model
    is developed in two

    divisions of ﬂowchart as shown in Figure 7, where both are interconnected. It
    is observed that the prediction

    of XB + k-mean approach provides better results as presented in Table 2.

    The ﬁrst phase of the ﬂowchart describes the hybrid algorithm for the soil moisture
    prediction (SMPHA)

    using the combination of XB + k-means algorithm. During the data collection step,
    the sensor data for the

    parameters, namely, TM, HU, ST, UV, and SM, are collected. During preprocessing,
    null values and outliers

    are removed and the preprocessed data are used to train the XG-Boost model. The
    developed model is then

    trained with variables of live weather features (TM, HU, UV, PC) obtained from
    Weather API for the

    prediction of SM data. These data are given as input to k-means clustering algorithm
    to predict the soil

    moisture, which is deﬁned as SMPHA value to be infused in the next phase of the
    ﬂowchart. The second

    phase of the ﬂowchart deﬁnes the automatic irrigation planning setup. The setup
    starts obtaining the soil

    moisture maximum (SMMax) and soil moisture minimum (SMMin) values in the dashboard
    for setting the

    maximum and minimum level of soil moisture. Then, the current soil moisture (CuSM)
    is sensed and

    compared against the threshold SMMin. If the resulting value is less than SMMin,
    the process proceeds

    with SMPHA. On the contrary, it stops the irrigation process by sending 0 to the
    relay. In SMPHA, the

    nearest precipitation date is selected and it is assigned to the predicted soil
    moisture (PSM). The SMMax is

    decided by ﬁnding the minimum of (PSM + SMMin, SMMax), and the predicted SMMax
    is further checked

    against CuSM with a condition if SMMax is greater the CuSM then it sends 1 to
    the relay as a signal to start

    irrigation. If the condition fails, then it sends 0 to stop irrigation. The process
    of automatic irrigation ends

    by forecasting the irrigation schedule in accordance with the live weather parameters.

    5 Experimental setup and evaluation

    The test bed is developed and deployed, and the data are collected for the analysis
    in irrigation manage-

    ment. Here, Heroku cloud platform is used to deploy the cloud web server. The
    same cloud is also installed

    at a local edge that is at two Raspberry Pi units equipped with Wi-Fi 802.11n
    connections to denote the edge

    nodes. JMeter application is used to get sequential accesses to the web page from
    various users for eval-

    uating the network parameters. The speciﬁcation of these servers is given in Tables
    3 and 4.

    We evaluated the performance of the proposed IoT-based smart farm on two diﬀerent
    platforms,

    namely, in the cloud and on the local computer to show the feasibility and the
    beneﬁt of the edge com-

    puting scheme. Further many parameters are considered for evaluation and discussed
    in the next section to

    show that edge deployment is better than cloud.

    5.1 Evaluation

    A hybrid machine learning methodology is used in evaluating the ﬁrst stage of
    the proposed model. The

    predicted value of the soil moisture is better in terms of their accuracy and
    error rate. From the comparison

    of the other ML algorithms as shown in Table 2, XB + k-means performs better and
    taken further to be

    deployed in edge and cloud to check its eﬃciency with each other. Therefore, for
    analyzing the eﬃciency of

    the edge server in accordance with the proposed hybrid algorithm SMPHA is evaluated
    in terms of the time

    taken to train the ML model in edge and cloud. In this experiment Raspberry Pi
    is used to train the SMPHA

    model with 196,400 rows, that is, input data sample size and takes around 1,710,000
    ms (approximately

    28.5 min). The same model when it is trained in Google Colab cloud environment,
    it takes 204,000 ms

    (approximately 3.4 min) as depicted in Table 5. The main purpose is to run the
    trained model on edge not to

    train the model at edge. So due to the lack of computing capability at the edge,
    it takes more time to train

    the model, but it can be ignored as it does not aﬀect the purpose of the proposed
    model. Here, edge is

    introduced to obtain the task of computing from the cloud (i.e., oﬄoading the
    task) by making the system

    more edge-oriented deployment. It can be accomplished rapidly as it requires only
    14 s to download a

    trained SMPHA model from the cloud to the edge node with a size of 3,101 kb as
    given in Table 5. The time to

    download varies according to the size of the trained model. So, from this process
    it can be inferred that

    downloading the trained model saves time when compared to training the model at
    the edge. Through this

    in real time, deployment of the trained SMPHA model in edge is better compared
    to deployment in cloud

    services. Furthermore, network parameters like latency, throughput, bandwidth,
    and response time are

    adopted to measure the performance improvements in edge computing.

    The performance metrices taken into account are latency, bandwidth, and response
    time [42]. The

    latency of an application is the product of two factors: computing latency and
    transmission latency. The

    time spent on data processing and transmission between end devices to cloud servers
    is termed as com-

    puting latency and transmission latency, respectively. The computational capacity
    of the system decides

    the computing latency as the network servers possess a considerable amount of
    capacity to make the data

    processing faster, whereas the sensors come with limited computing capacity. The
    latency in transmission

    is increased by the end devices and cloud servers. Bandwidth: As large number
    of sensors are deployed in

    IoT, data generated would be huge that consumes an intense range of bandwidth
    and leads to several

    problems such as delay in transmission and loss of packets. It becomes unacceptable
    for the data to be

    transferred directly to cloud servers without applying compression. Therefore,
    data preprocessing and

    aggregation are needed for IoT gateways before redirecting them to remote cloud
    servers. Then, the issue

    to be confronted is to control the traﬃc ﬂow by migrating data processing and
    aggregation tasks optimally

    to decrease the bandwidth needs of the end users while maintaining the data quality.
    Response time: The

    total response time is calculated by adding up transmission and processing time.
    The local deployment of

    the proposed model for controlling IoT-based irrigation are deployed on two modes:
    (i) Cloud mode: The

    developed SMPHA model is implemented in the cloud communicating with IoT sensors
    nodes directly to

    manage the irrigation process. The data are stored and processed at the cloud
    server itself where it uses

    Heroku platform. (ii) Edge mode – Raspberry Pi is deployed as an edge server that
    involves in processing of

    the SMPHA model controlling the IoT sensor nodes. Here, the data are stored and
    processed locally within

    the edge servers. This SMPHA model from both the edge and cloud does the job of
    controlling the actuators

    to initiate and quit the working of water ﬂow motors. Through this deployment
    in both the environments,

    performance of edge server and cloud server can be checked in terms of latency,
    throughput, bandwidth,

    and response time is shown in aforementioned graphs in Figures 6, 8, and 9. This
    performance metrices is

    not feasible to calculate while deploying in real time, so the aforementioned
    scenarios of two modes are

    virtually created by generating many request and response threads between the
    servers. This sampling,

    load test, and distributed testing are conducted through JMeter application [43]
    and also veriﬁed with

    Wireshark [44] in cloud servers. The test scenario is created here by data of
    sending and receiving sampling

    data between cloud to IoT sensors and between Edge to IoT sensors. The sampling
    data considered in this

    work refer to the approximate number of requests generated by Arduino to cloud
    and Arduino to Raspberry

    Pi that are calculated in real time. The test scenario is divided into 10 days
    of sampling data collected for

    each day. The evaluation results are depicted for latency and response times in
    10 days perspective. In

    latency parameter, edge service has decreased by an average of 77.85% time compared
    to the with cloud. In

    the same manner, the response time of edge service is also decreased by 74.09%
    time compared to cloud

    service. In throughput calculation, sampling data are calculated for an hourly
    basis for the 10 hours data in

    a day. From the hourly comparisons of throughput value, edge outperforms with
    67.17% high Mbps usage.

    Through this analysis as shown in Table 6, it is evident that the proposed edge
    computing methodology

    deployed in Raspberry Pi or in local computers outperforms the cloud-oriented
    approach.

    Finally, to illustrate the eﬃciency of resource management in edge computing,
    CPU and memory

    utilization are considered for the analysis as both factors rely on the service
    execution model and the

    computational needs of the services being ﬁred from oﬀ-loaders. Figure 10 depicts
    the utilization of CPU

    and RAM on the Raspberry Pi acting as an edge node in two cases: with and without
    the deployment of

    SMPHA model on it. As shown in Figure 10, the SMPHA model aﬀects the CPU of the
    Raspberry Pi node

    signiﬁcantly as it consumed around 41.2% of the CPU compared to only 3.5% when

    SMPHA model. However, the memory (RAM) utilization in both the cases (with and
    without deployment of

    an SMPHA model) is nearly the same which is around 31%. Comparatively RAM utilization
    does not have

    much diﬀerence in with and without SMPHA. It is worthwhile to note that, the CPU
    utilization is still much

    lower than the 50% of total CPU capacity in Raspberry Pi. Therefore, it becomes
    feasible for adopting edge

    server implementation in the proposed irrigation system.

    6 Conclusion

    This article proposed a novel approach to edge-based irrigation system to facilitate
    decision-making on

    watering the plants on scheduled time. The proposed approach applying IoT with
    an edge computing

    framework enables the farming system to adapt to the changes in environmental
    conditions automatically

    and eﬃciently. The process of automatic irrigation regulates irrigation according
    to the live weather para-

    meters for forecasting the irrigation process. Soil moisture prediction was performed
    using major regression

    algorithms that are again combined with k-means clustering for estimating the
    changes incurred in soil

    moisture prediction. These techniques were compared through metrics such as MAPE,
    MSE, speed, and

    power consumption from which XB + k-means was found to perform better. The XB
    + k-means algorithm

    was further used for the implementation of decision mechanism on the developed
    edge computing model.

    The proposed edge model saves the data communication cost and reduces the response
    time of IoT services.

    It can be deployed on existing devices on the network edges serving as edge nodes,
    thereby reducing the

    overall implementation cost of a large-scale IoT system. The edge-based approach
    was found to perform

    better than the cloud-based approach in terms of response time, latency, throughput,
    and bandwidth

    usage. Finally, the edge model was analyzed through CPU and memory usage while
    running with and

    without the algorithm. In both cases, the memory utilization is almost lower to
    total available resource of

    the edge device. From this, edge device can allocate its remaining resource for
    other computing services,

    which increases the eﬃciency of edge computing device. The number of end edge
    nodes can be increased

    according to the ﬁeld area and then to check the potency of the system.

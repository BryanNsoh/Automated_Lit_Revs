    PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Street and garden trees in urban areas are often exposed
    to advection of strong vapour pressure deficit (VPD) air that can raise the whole-tree
    transpiration rate (ET), known as the oasis effect. However, urban trees tend
    to have small soil volume compared with natural conditions, and so they are believed
    to strongly regulate stomata. ET characteristics of such urban trees have not
    been well understood because of a lack of reliable measurement methods. Therefore,
    we propose a novel weighing lysimeter method and investigate the whole-tree water
    balance of an isolated container-grown Zelkova serrata to examine (a) which biotic
    and abiotic factors determine ET and (b) which spatial and temporal information
    is needed to predict ET under urban conditions. Whole-tree water balance and environmental
    conditions were measured from 2010 to 2012. Although leaf area substantially increased
    in the study period, daily ET did not vary much. ET increased with VPD almost
    linearly in 2010 but showed saturation in 2011 and 2012. Root water uptake lagged
    ET by 40 min in 2012. These results suggest that the small planter box interfered
    with root growth and that hydraulic supply capacities did not increase sufficiently
    to support leaf area increase. From analysis of water balance, we believe that
    neglecting soil drought effects on street trees without irrigation in Japan will
    overestimate ET over 4–5 sunny days at the longest. This is unlike previous studies
    of forest. 1 INTRODUCTION Transpiration is an essential factor for water and energy
    balance between soil, plant, and atmosphere. Regarding urban trees, the environmental
    benefits of tree microclimate effects on human thermal comfort and health constitute
    a sustainable means for mitigating the urban thermal environment (Architectural
    Institute of Japan, 2007; Oke, 1987; Olgyay, 1963). To realize individual-specific
    irrigation management and design of more effective green space, quantitative knowledge
    of the whole-tree transpiration rate ET under characteristic urban conditions
    is necessary. Isolated trees such as street and garden trees are often exposed
    to advection of strong vapour pressure deficit (VPD) air compared with those in
    the forest. Such increase of evapotranspiration is the so-called oasis or leading-edge
    effect (Kanda, 2007; Oke, 1987; see also Mackay, Ewers, Loranty, & Kruger, 2010
    and its references to studies in the forest). Several urban meteorologists have
    claimed that trees in an urban environment may have higher transpiration rates
    than in the forest because of the oasis effect (Hagishima, Narinta, & Tanimoto,
    2007; Moriwaki & Kanda, 2004; Spronken-Smith, Oke, & Lowry, 2000). Moreover, an
    isolated tree is readily impacted by radiation and wind, which affects its photosynthesis
    rate, leaf temperature, and boundary layer thickness. These effects may increase
    ET. On the contrary, several plant ecophysiologists have reported that urban trees
    tend to vigorously regulate stomata because of drought stress from strong VPD,
    limited water supply and rooting space, and strong soil compaction (e.g., Cregg,
    1995; Kagotani et al., 2015; Kjelgren & Clark, 1993; McCarthy & Pataki, 2010;
    Osone et al., 2014). Clearly, there is some discrepancy of findings. Thus, to
    address the relative importance and interactions between biotic and abiotic effects
    on ET, long-term measurement under a range of conditions is required. Quantitative
    characteristics of urban tree ET have not been sufficiently clarified because
    of a lack of reliable measurement methods. Porometer, sap flow, and lysimeter
    methods have mainly been used for estimating ET in studies. The porometer method
    essentially targets the measurement of single-leaf transpiration. Scaling up from
    leaf transpiration to ET can cause errors because of errors in leaf area estimation,
    differences in leaf characteristics, and microclimate in the crown. This method,
    therefore, must be validated using other accurate methods (Leverenz et al., 1982;
    Mcdermitt, 1990). The sap flow methods are frequently used for studying whole-tree
    and stand-scale water use (Granier, 1987; Swanson & Whitfield, 1981). However,
    sap flow velocity measured at breast height can be delayed from actual ET by a
    few hours (e.g., Saugier, Granier, Pontailler, Dufrene, & Baldocchi, 1997). In
    addition, such methods tend to underestimate ET when using long-term measurements,
    owing to the change of xylem thermal properties caused by wounds of sensor installation
    (Moore, Bond, Jones, & Meinzer, 2010; Swanson & Whitfield, 1981; Wullschleger,
    Childs, King, & Hanson, 2011). Furthermore, the very widely used Granier''s thermal
    dissipation sensor (Granier, 1987) is known to be sensitive to environmental radiation
    and temperature (Lu, Urban, & Zhao, 2004; Oren, Phillips, et al, 1999); this can
    be problematic in measurement of isolated (i.e., urban) trees under hot summer
    conditions. The lysimeter method quantifies ET using weighing or drainage lysimeters.
    This is considered the most reliable method for small plants but has limits for
    tall trees because of large errors from wind when measuring in outdoor environments
    with high temporal resolution (Edwards, 1986; Lorite, Santos, Teti, & Fereres,
    2012). Asawa et al. (2012, in Japanese) and Asawa, Hoyano, Shimizu, et al. (2014,
    in Japanese) developed a novel weighing lysimeter that gives a sufficiently accurate
    estimate of hourly ET for a tall tree; they reported results from summer 2010.
    In the present study, we show that this lysimeter approach is capable of measuring
    over years and examines quantitative and process information of interseasonal/interannual
    changes of ET and whole-tree water balance under characteristic urban conditions.
    Although sap flow measurement studies in urban areas have gradually increased
    (Chen, Zhang, & Ewers, 2012; Chen, Zhang, et al., 2011; Litvak, McCarthy, & Pataki,
    2011, 2012; McCarthy & Pataki, 2010; McCarthy, Pataki, & Jenerette, 2011; Pataki,
    McCarthy, Litvak, & Pincetl, 2011; Peters, McFadden, & Montgomery, 2010), whole-tree
    water balance and quantitative interaction between ET and soil moisture have rarely
    been reported. This is because it is not easy to measure rooting space or amounts
    of infiltration and leakage, owing to artificial obstacles such as pavement. Therefore,
    we studied urban tree transpiration using an isolated container-grown tree exposed
    to advection of high-VPD air and grown in shallow soil. The questions addressed
    in the present study are as follows: (a) Which biotic and abiotic factors determine
    ET under characteristic urban conditions and, in particular, how does VPD affect
    ET in relation to other factors? (Buckley, 2005; Oren, Phillips, et al., 1999;
    Sperry & Love, 2015) (b) What spatial and temporal information is needed to predict
    ET? These questions are especially important to the recent development of numerical
    simulations of urban microclimates (e.g., Asawa, Hoyano, & Nakaohkubo, 2008; Chen,
    Kusaka, et al., 2011; Vico, Revelli, & Porporato, 2014) for determining which
    factors should be treated precisely and which can be simplified. To overcome the
    limitation of the lysimeter method and address the effects of biotic and abiotic
    factors on ET, we propose a data quality control protocol for continuous long-term
    measurement to remove noise from wind and other factors. Such a protocol for the
    lysimeter method is not well established relative to other methods based on eddy
    covariance or sap flow (e.g., Oishi, Hawthorne, & Oren, 2016; Vickers & Mahrt,
    1997). Many lysimeter studies used a simple moving average or Savitzky–Golay filter,
    but such smoothing filters are mere graphical techniques and not justified in
    quantitative analysis (Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling, & Flannery, 1996) because
    the reliability of filtered values is never evaluated. Alternatively, we used
    time-series statistics to quantify uncertainty of estimated ET. 2 MATERIALS AND
    METHODS 2.1 Study site and plant material The study site was an experimental field
    with an open area of 8,800 m2 in the city of Miyoshi, Aichi Prefecture, Japan
    (35°8′N, 137°6′E). There were no obstacles within 40 m of the sample tree, except
    for several container-grown trees of ~5-m height. Distances between these trees
    were >4 m, so they could easily receive solar radiation and airflow. This may
    be regarded as an isolated condition. The sample tree used for measurement was
    a 13 year-old Zelkova serrata (Figure 1). Z. serrata is the third most popular
    species of street tree (National Institute for Land and Infrastructure Management,
    2014), and there are three prefectures and 79 cities in Japan that have established
    it as the “city''s symbol tree.” The height and trunk diameter in 2010 were 6.4
    m and 11 cm, respectively. We did not measure leaf area routinely but measured
    using a terrestrial-laser scanning system (LiDAR; VZ-400, RIEGL, Horn, Austria)
    in the summers of 2010 and 2012. Total leaf area and the leaf area index (LAI)
    on September 3, 2010, were 13.2 m2 and 2.1 m2/m2, respectively (Asawa, Hoyano,
    Oshio, et al., 2014), which were estimated using the voxel-based canopy profiling
    method (Hosoi & Omasa, 2006; Oshio, Asawa, Hoyano, & Miyasaka, 2015). The Z. serrata
    tree was planted in a large planter box of area 1 m2 and depth 0.6 m; box volume
    was determined on the basis of the size of a general street tree (Ministry of
    Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of Japan, 2005). Leaf pruning was
    done to reduce transpiration and compensate for lost root systems in advance of
    transplanting to the planter box. Root-zone depth was 50 cm, and the soil was
    composed of Kanto loam (70%), perlite (20%), and leaf mould (10%). Kanto loam
    is widely used for arboriculture in Japan because of its strong permeability and
    large water-holding capacity. In general, it has aggregated structures, strong
    porosity, and high saturated hydraulic conductivity (Chang, Kato, & Okazaki, 1994;
    Kaihotsu, Tanaka, & Okahashi, 1981). We took photos of the Z. serrata once every
    few months to check the tree and apparatus conditions, finding that the leaf area
    slightly decreased in 2011 but strongly increased in 2012 (Figure 1). No breakages
    or diseases were found in the Z. serrata during the measurement period. Figure

    (right) August 30, 2012. Ultrasonic anemometer was set on the right side of the
    tree; distance from the tree was 4.3 m 2.2 Meteorological measurement Meteorological
    conditions were measured in the northern part of the experimental field, using
    a solar radiometer (MS-402, Eko Instruments, Tokyo, Japan), air temperature sensor
    (4 wires Pt100Ω, Taiyo Keki, Tokyo, Japan) with ventilation (Model 43502, R.M.
    Young Co., Traverse, MI, USA), relative humidity sensor (CS215, Campbell Scientific,
    Logan, UT, USA), tipping bucket gauge (TE525MM, Campbell Scientific), 3-D ultrasonic
    anemometer (Model 81000, R.M. Young Co.), and photosynthetically active radiation
    (PAR) sensor (LI-190, Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). To analyse the effects of
    wind on lysimeter measurement, the anemometer was located 4.3 m from the Z. serrata
    (Figure 1). This location was determined to be as close as possible to the tree
    while minimizing its effect on the wind measurement. The height of the anemometer
    was 4 m, nearly the same as the centre of the tree crown. The measurement was
    done from August 2010 to September 2012. In the summer seasons, short-term and
    intensive measurements of transpiration, leaf area, and heat balance were conducted.
    In those periods, irrigation was stopped for two to four successive days to ascertain
    the effects of drought stress and so as not to damage on tree growth. All measurement
    data were checked every month for any missing data, spike noises, or physically
    unrealistic values. 2.3 Design of weighing lysimeter The measurement was done
    to obtain ET datasets under various meteorological and leaf-on (or leaf-off) conditions
    over the years. The weighing lysimeter, therefore, was designed and set up to
    be adaptable to long-term measurement. The total weight of the tree, planter box,
    and soil was ~1,000 kg, so a platform weighing machine using load cells (CAPS4-1500LL-I,
    Sartorius AG, Göttingen, Germany) was used. Site calibration was performed on
    the weighing machine. In advance of the measurement, we believed that the weighing
    accuracy should be ±100 g/hr, because the assumed ET was ~1 kg/hr. Although nominal
    accuracy of the weighing machine was 250 g (maximum weight 1,500 kg; accuracy
    1/6,000), we confirmed that relative sensitivity to weight change measured by
    the weighing machine was <100 g. Figure 2 shows in detail the weighing lysimeter
    apparatus and its dimensions. When designing the lysimeter with the required accuracy,
    the following characteristics were considered and introduced. (a) The tree and
    planter box should not contact the measurement apparatus, irrigation, and drainage
    systems, all of which were placed near the tree. Only a few cables for measurement
    sensors were connected between the planter box and measurement apparatus. (b)
    These cables were set to slacken for removing tension that might affect weight
    values. (c) To prevent the tree from falling down under strong wind, two steel
    support arms were placed around the trunk but had no contact with the trunk. These
    arms did not touch the trunk even with wind speeds ~10 m/s. (d) The weighing machine
    and planter box were both covered by a shed to protect them from wind, rainfall,
    and solar radiation. Air temperature inside the shed was continuously monitored,
    and its side door was frequently opened for air ventilation. Figure 2 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Section of weighing lysimeter. Asterisk indicates noncontact
    setting 2.4 Irrigation regime and water balance measurement All water balances
    were controlled by an automated irrigation system, because quantitative measurement
    of rainfall on the planter box was very difficult, and the study focused on the
    relationship between ET and water balance under irrigated conditions. Water was
    automatically irrigated on the upper surface of the soil at midnight, from 0:00
    to 1:00 each day. Irrigation water was stored once in a tank in a predetermined
    amount and supplied from the tank to the surface by gravity. Drainage occurred
    immediately after irrigation and nearly ceased within about four hours before
    morning, when transpiration began. The planter box was made of stainless steel
    of 2-mm thickness, and its bottom had a slope of 1/100. Pumice was laid on the
    bottom 10 cm of the box for smooth drainage. Volumetric soil water content θ was
    measured at depths of 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 cm by amplitude-domain reflectometry
    sensors (Thetaprobe ML2x, Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK). Matric potential Ψ
    was calculated from measured θ and soil water retention (θ–Ψ) curves. Undisturbed
    soil samples of 100 cc were collected from all layers near the amplitude-domain
    reflectometry sensors and used to measure water retention curves in the laboratory
    via centrifuge and pressure-plate methods. Amounts of irrigation and drainage
    were measured by flowmeter (ND10-NATAAA, Aichitokei, Nagoya, Japan) and tipping
    bucket-type rain gauges (TE525-L25, Campbell Scientific), respectively. Stemflow
    was trapped at the middle of the trunk and measured by rain gauge (UIZ-TB500,
    UIZIN, Tokyo, Japan), so the water did not flow into the soil. Soil evaporation
    ES was restricted by a cover sheet on the planter box, but air was continuously
    supplied to the soil surface in order not to interfere with soil respiration.
    Ventilation rate, temperature, and relative humidity of both inflow and outflow
    air at the surface were measured so that ES was estimated by absolute humidity
    change. We confirmed that ES was <150 g/day in summer 2010. Meteorological, sample
    tree weight, and water balance data were recorded on a data logger (C-CR10000,
    Campbell Scientific). The weighing machine and anemometer were synchronized, and
    data recorded at 1 Hz. Other meteorological conditions and water balance were
    recorded every 1 and 10 min, respectively. 2.5 Calculation of water balance To
    estimate ET, measured weight data was resolved into each origin of weight change.
    That change and whole-tree water balance can be expressed by (1) (2) where W is
    sample weight (sum of tree, soil, and planter box) and W* its measured value.
    εw is wind load, εo represents other error terms such as dew and litterfall, ET
    is whole-tree transpiration, ES is soil evaporation, Irr is irrigation, D is drainage,
    Int is crown interception, and EWC is wet-crown evaporation and throughfall. ES,
    Irr, and D were directly identified by the measurements. In estimating ET, larger
    parts of the noise are from εw and measurement errors of Irr and D on sunny days,
    and εw, Int, and EWC on rainy days. The effects of Irr and Int can be easily removed
    by discarding data during irrigation or rain, but εw, D, and EWC need special
    treatments, which are addressed later. Dew was not problematic because it was
    small except during winter, and Z. serrata is a deciduous species. We did not
    quantify litterfall from W,* but it was confirmed independently. In August 2012,
    we clipped all leaves from Z. serrata, which was nearly the same size as a lysimeter-grown
    one, finding a wet weight ~5.8 kg/tree. We believe it is reasonable to ignore
    the effects of litterfall in estimating daily ET in the predefoliation period.
    Soil water balance was considered to address the root water uptake rate. When
    soil water movement is expressed in integral form and ES is negligible, it becomes
    similar to Equation 2: (3) where ρ is water density, v is soil volume, and ET′
    is whole-tree root water uptake. ET′ nearly equals ET at daily scale but is delayed
    at diurnal scale. When Irr and D are negligible, soil water change (−ρvdθ/dt)
    = ET′. Such a condition is feasible when irrigation is stopped and θ drops below
    field capacity. 2.6 Statistical analysis for ET estimation All statistical analyses
    were performed using R 3.2.4 software (R Development Core Team, 2016). Raw data
    of W* in 2010 recorded at 1 Hz are shown in Figure 3. On ordinary days, W* increased
    at night from Irr and decreased during daytime from ET. The inset of Figure 3
    illustrates W* and its linear trend (regression line) around noon on August 17.
    The negative trend indicates the effect of ET, and there is clearly a strong time-series
    autocorrelation between the residuals, which can be attributed to swaying of the
    tree from εw. The lack of independence of observations often causes fatal error
    in estimating standard error (SE) and statistical hypothesis testing (von Storch
    & Zwiers, 1999). Therefore, we estimated the time between effectively independent
    observations T0 to correct SE of W. Effective sample size Neff and T0 can be calculated
    according to Trenberth (1984): (4) (5) where N is the number of observations and
    rL is the autocorrelation coefficient at lag L. We estimated Neff, ET, and higher
    moments of W* every 20 min and calculated daily ET as their sum. Details of the
    calculation are presented in the Appendix. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Example of observed sample weight (W*) data, from August 10 to 21, 2010, recorded
    at 1 Hz. Irrigation was stopped after August 18. Inset shows data around noon
    on August 17. Autocorrelation is clear around 12:35 3 RESULTS First, we show results
    regarding measurement accuracy of the lysimeter method and then review daily ET
    and monthly water balance throughout the study period to understand how ET changed
    seasonally and annually. Finally, to reveal reasons for changes of ET characteristics,
    we show interannual variations of diurnal ET and root water uptake. 3.1 Performances
    of ET estimation and quality control Table 1 shows Neff and descriptive statistics
    of W* for growing seasons (May–October of the 3 years). Neff, standard deviation,
    and kurtosis increased, and the absolute value of skewness decreased together
    with wind speed. No clear interannual trend was found, which supports that our
    lysimeter performed well throughout the measurement period. Figure 4 shows the
    diurnal pattern of characteristic days to confirm the performance of ET estimation.
    The error bars show 2 SE (~95% confidence interval); and black circles, deviation
    from a Gaussian distribution. Neff roughly correlated with wind speed and was
    <200 (1/6 of N), which means that SE increased about twofold to threefold with
    consideration of Neff. Figure 4a,d shows the result on a sunny irrigation day;
    there was strong fluctuation of weight change (−ΔW/Δt), but the error bars were
    small, which indicate that considering these data as ET is relatively reliable.
    This –ΔW/Δt correlated well with solar radiation Rs. On a windy day (Figure 4b,e),
    there was also large fluctuation, but this could easily be distinguished from
    ET by large error bars, which were corrected by Neff. From a physical perspective,
    there was no correspondence between –ΔW/Δt and evaporation drivers (radiation
    and wind). From a biological perspective, we could not find any reason for large
    –ΔW/Δt fluctuation, especially after sunset. Therefore, the judgement that these
    data are suspicious from data quality criteria appears reasonable. Furthermore,
    on a rainy day (Figure 4c,f), the higher moment test and error bars revealed a
    suspicious –ΔW/Δt before and after the rain. This large –ΔW/Δt can be attributed
    to EWC. Moreover, it is well known that tipping bucket rain gauges have errors
    and a time lag because of their measurement mechanism. Therefore, the negative
    value of –ΔW/Δt (i.e., increase of W*) before the time of rain observation is
    considered Int. The higher moment test provided quantitative criteria to assess
    how many records should be discarded as EWC or Int. In this case, we discarded
    two records before and after the rain. Table 1. Effective sample size (Neff) and

    19, 2011 3.2 Environmental conditions Daily environmental data from August 2010
    through September 2012 are shown in Figure 5. Although the summer solstice is
    in late June, Rs and VPD in that month were small because of the normal rainy
    season in Japan (according to Japan Meteorological Agency [JMA], 2008, mean precipitation
    in June and July was 300 mm, accounting for 1/5 the yearly total). Summer 2010
    was extremely hot and dry all over the country, and mean air temperature Ta was
    the highest in the past 113 years (JMA, 2010). Our study site was on the Pacific
    side of Japan (as is Tokyo), and the duration of sunny days in Tokyo in summer
    2010 was the second longest since 1968 (JMA, 2012). Furthermore, at the study
    site, late August and early September 2010 were the hottest and driest of the
    study period. Maximum Ta was 38°C, and the maximum VPD was 4.5 kPa. The longest
    stretch of sunny days in 2010 was 18, from August 21 through September 7. We irrigated
    about 30–50 kg/m2 (soil) daily, determined using ET of preceding days, which was
    sufficient to compensate daily transpiration loss. We believe that ample irrigation
    was not problematic, because the excess of water over field capacity was soon
    discharged. We irrigated almost every day during the growing season but ran a
    dry-down experiment several times. According to Rodriguez-Iturbe and Porporato
    (2007), plants typically begin to close stomata when soil Ψ declines by 0.03 MPa
    and almost completely close with a decrease of ~3 MPa. Over our measurement period,
    mean θ from 5- to 45-cm depths remained >36.6% vol. (Ψ = −0.03 MPa), except for
    dry-down periods. On August 26, 2010, we found that mean soil Ψ was less than
    −2.5 MPa, but ET remained 14.4 kg/day. On this day, Ψ at 35- and 45-cm depths
    was −1.92 and −0.72 MPa, respectively (data not shown). Figure 5 Open in figure

    changes of ET and whole-tree water balance Daily ET is shown at the bottom of
    Figure 5. ET reached 35 kg/day in mid-August 2010, but in 2011 and 2012, yearly
    maximum ET was 28.4 and 27.1 kg/day, respectively. Seasonal patterns of ET were
    evident, but the times of ET stopping and starting (foliation and defoliation)
    varied between the years. ET approached zero in mid-November 2010 and early October
    2011. Atmospheric conditions after September were not very different between the
    2 years (Figure 5). ET became positive and gradually increased in April 2011,
    but in 2012, it suddenly increased between late April and early May. For example,
    ET = 12.5 kg/day and Rs = 24.5 MJ/m2 day on May 2, 2011, whereas ET = 23.3 kg/day
    and Rs = 18.4 MJ/m2 day on May 1, 2012. The monthly water balance components of
    the Z. serrata and availability of ET are summarized in Figure 6. We halted measurements
    once in September 2011 because of a typhoon (Roke; the typhoon no. 15 in Japan)
    and did not interpolate discarded or missing records, so a large imbalance was
    found in this period. The mean ratio of available ET to Irr in the growing season
    was 69%, with a range of 32–123%. Because large portions of Irr were discharged
    as D in October 2010 and May 2012 and θ was nearly constant at ~60% vol. (Figure
    5). we consider this value the field capacity of the soil. Figure 6 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Monthly water balances and available ET. Components are irrigation
    (Irr), drainage (D), whole-tree transpiration (ET), and change of soil water storage
    (ΔS). Available ET represents ratio of nonmissing or discarded days 3.4 Biotic
    and abiotic control on ET The data obtained for Ta < 20°C roughly corresponded
    to no-leaf periods when ET was near zero (Figure 5). We visibly confirmed this
    by photos of the Z. serrata. Because we did not measure leaf area routinely and
    generally the times of foliation and defoliation are controlled by temperature
    (Jones, 2014), we used Ta as an index of leaf area condition. The major results
    of the following analyses did not differ from this 20°C criterion when we varied
    it from 15°C to 25°C. In general, VPD and Rs are the primary drivers of transpiration,
    but their relative importance depends on the magnitude of canopy coupling with
    the atmosphere (Jarvis & McNaughton, 1986). Thus, daily ET responses to atmospheric
    drivers (daily total Rs, mean daytime VPD, and wind speed) were analysed (Figure
    7). There was the strongest correlation between ET and VPD throughout the study
    period (R = .80), but after filtering out days on which daily mean Ta was <20°C,
    VPD and Rs showed almost the same correlations with ET (R = .63 in both cases).
    Wind speed had no clear effect on ET (R = .21). Because ET appeared to respond
    to VPD nonlinearly in 2011 and 2012, we used various regression models to test
    the significance of interannual differences in the slopes of VPD and Rs (differences
    of βi in ET = βi VPD or ET = βi Rs) and nonlinearity of VPD (ET = α + β lnVPD),
    as summarized in Table 2. A minimum Akaike''s information criterion value was
    found in the log-transformed VPD model with interannual difference (ET = αi +
    βi lnVPD). The regression lines and their 95% confidence intervals of that model
    are shown in Figure 8. The intercepts (α; mean ET at VPD = 1 kPa) increased with
    the year (Table 2). Although the SE of slope (β) of log-transformed VPD was large,
    β2010 was clearly larger than other years and SE ranges did not overlap (Table
    2). Modelled mean ET in 2011 and 2012 was nearly identical when VPD was >1.3 kPa.

    an interannual comparison of diurnal ET. To address the effect of root water uptake
    ET′, August 18, 2010 (Figure 9a,c) and July 4, 2012 (Figure 9b,d) were selected
    because they were during dry-down periods and mean θ was less than field capacity.
    That is, Irr and D were negligible and changes of soil water content (−dθ/dt)
    may be regarded as ET′ in Equation 3 (daily mean soil Ψ = −0.09 MPa on both days).
    Daily total Rs values were nearly equal (24.3 and 23.6 MJ/day), but maximum VPD
    and ET were substantially different between the 2 days. Times of maxima of all
    variables (ET, −Δθ/Δt Rs and VPD) were around 12:00–15:00 on both days, and only
    diurnal ET in 2012 displayed a bimodal pattern (Figure 9b). Cross-correlations
    of Rs, VPD, and –Δθ/Δt with ET on these days are shown in Figure 10. On August
    18, 2010, ET peaked 20 min earlier than VPD and had no time lag with Rs or –Δθ/Δt
    (Figure 10a). However, on July 4, 2012, ET preceded –Δθ/Δt by 40 min, peaked at
    the same time as VPD, and lagged Rs by 80 min (Figure 10b). The cross-correlation
    coefficients of VPD and Rs with ET were smaller in 2012 than in 2010. Figure 9

    4.1 ET responses to atmospheric drivers and leaf area change It is well known
    that wind has little effect on ET for coniferous trees, but this tendency is not
    always valid for broadleaf trees (see the review of Komatsu, 2003). Z. serrata
    is a broadleaf species, but the effect of wind speed was not clear (Figure 7c).
    This result suggests that leaves of the Z. serrata were strongly coupled to the
    atmosphere; that is, boundary layer resistance was weak, leaf temperature was
    close to Ta, and ET was mainly controlled by stomata (Jarvis & McNaughton, 1986).
    This is probably because the sample Z. serrata was in an isolated condition. Daily
    ET of the Z. serrata on sunny days in the growing season was about 25–30 kg/day
    (Figure 5). This is comparable to previous reports of ground-planted orchards
    (Green, 1993; Green, Clothier, Caspari, & Neal, 2002) that have similar tree size
    and environments (isolated condition, daily Rs ~ 20 MJ/m2 and moist soil). Green
    (1993) reported an isolated walnut tree (3.5 m in height, 26.4 m2 in leaf area)
    transpired 40 kg/day on a sunny day, and Green et al. (2002) reported that olives
    (4 m in height, 13.5 m2 in leaf area) planted at 4 × 6 m intervals transpired
    175 kg/week. However, this does not necessarily mean that the Z. serrata was free
    from drought stress. As shown in Figure 1, its leaf area substantially increased
    from 2010 to 2012, but ET did not increase (Figure 5). There are three possible
    reasons for this. First, VPD maximized in summer 2010; second, mutual shading
    of increased leaves dampened ET increase; third, the small planter box interfered
    with root growth, and hydraulic supply capacities did not increase sufficiently
    to support the leaf area increase. The nonlinear response of ET to VPD and its
    interannual difference (Figures 7a and 8) are believed to correspond to Oren,
    Sperry, et al. (1999), who showed that the sensitivity of stomatal conductance
    to VPD is general over a wide range of plants. According to Oren et al., a plant
    with large stomatal conductance (thus large ET) at small VPD must strongly regulate
    stomata when VPD becomes large, because of hydraulic limits. This was true of
    the Z. serrata during the study period (Figure 8). Litvak et al. (2012) analysed
    ET characteristics of 121 urban trees using the same log-transformed VPD model
    as our study (ET = α + β lnVPD) and sap flow velocity data from their series of
    studies of the urban landscape of Los Angeles (Litvak et al., 2011; McCarthy &
    Pataki, 2010; McCarthy et al., 2011; Pataki et al., 2011). They reported that
    the ratio of β to α was constant among tree sizes and sites, corresponding to
    Oren, Sperry, et al. (1999), but it could differ by xylem vulnerability (unsaturated
    hydraulic conductance); the ratio range was 0.3–0.6. The β/α values of our Z.
    serrata were within this range during 2011 and 2012, but not in 2010 (Table 2;
    β/α ~ .8 in 2010). This means that the Z. serrata in 2010 was relatively insensitive
    to drought stress, possibly because the low ratio of leaf to root area from pruning-enhanced
    hydraulic conductance. The implications of the findings shown in Figures 9 and
    10 are that the Z. serrata became more conservative regarding ET during the 2
    years, not only at daily scale but also at the diurnal one. The 40-min delay of
    water transport from soil to leaves in 2012 supports the hypothesis that the hydraulic
    capacities did not increase sufficiently, because if this were so, the increase
    of leaf area would reduce hydraulic conductance per leaf area. Increase of evaporative
    demand (by increase of the ratio of leaf to root area) leads to more negative
    water potential in plant tissues. Large negative water potential generates cavitation
    and embolism and decreases the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in apoplastic
    pathways (Sperry & Love, 2015; Tyree & Zimmermann, 2002). This is the likely reason
    for the delay of water transport in 2012. Some researchers reported that a too
    great VPD decreases ET, a so-called apparent feed-forward response of stomata
    to humidity (e.g., Monteith, 1995). The bimodal diurnal ET pattern (Figure 9b)
    and 80-min lag between ET and Rs found in 2012 (Figure 10b) indicate this phenomenon.
    The leaf-to-atmosphere VPD of the Z. serrata might have maximized around midday
    in 2012 because of the peak in Rs (Figure 9b and 9d). According to Duursma et
    al. (2014), the apparent feed-forward response can be explained by increased cuticle
    transpiration, generation of cavitation, or peak response of photosynthesis to
    temperature. Because we did not measure physiological conditions of the Z. serrata
    precisely, we cannot examine the influences of the above factors, but the increase
    of leaf area could be attributed to all three. 4.2 Phenological aspects Figure
    5 shows obvious interannual differences of ET in spring. This result is probably
    because of interannual differences in the times of foliation, but the reason for
    this phenological change is unclear. In general, the foliation time is believed
    to be mainly controlled by temperature (Jones, 2014). However, in our results,
    Ta of preceding periods were not very different between years (mean Ta in April
    was 12.2°C in 2011 and 13.1°C in 2012). Recently, through chamber experiments
    using cuttings of some woody species, Laube, Sparks, Estrella, and Menzel (2014)
    showed that drought stress can delay bud development. Thus, one of the possible
    reasons for the interannual phenological difference of the Z. serrata is change
    of leaf area and hypothetical hydraulic limits. Throughout the study period, the
    discrepancy between the strong correlation of ET with VPD (Figure 7a) and weak
    correlation of ET with Rs (Figure 7b) might be explained by the time of foliation/defoliation.
    The data obtained for Ta < 20°C roughly correspond to no-leaf periods. Rs can
    be large even at Ta < 20°C, because its seasonal change precedes Ta by a few months
    (Figure 5). However, atmospheric VPD must be small at low Ta, because VPD is directly
    determined by temperature. This means that there are VPD–Ta–leaf area–ET correlations
    at seasonal scale. The strong correlation of ET with VPD throughout the seasons
    (Figure 7a) was believed to be not only the result of the direct relationship
    between vapour diffusion and its driver but also the effect of leaf area as a
    confounding factor. 4.3 Spatial and temporal implications for predicting ET In
    warm periods (Ta > 20°C), the linear response of daily ET to Rs measured on a
    horizontal plane (Figure 7b) is interesting. In general, stomatal conductance
    saturates with strong PAR, as described elsewhere (e.g., Jarvis, 1976). It is
    also common that transpiration rates of a dense vegetation canopy increase almost
    linearly with radiation (Rs or net radiation Rn). This is because dense canopy
    transpiration can be well approximated by the equilibrium evaporation rate, that
    is, the evaporation rate under no advection (Jarvis & McNaughton, 1986). However,
    the Z. serrata measured herein was isolated and was thus believed to be far from
    equilibrium. A similar finding was reported in Pereira, Green, and Nova (2007),
    who showed that ET of irrigated orchards and an isolated walnut tree, including
    various ranges of LAI, could be effectively expressed by the equation of Priestley
    and Taylor (1972) pertaining to Rn measured above grass. This linear response
    might be explained by the interactive effect between mutual shading of leaves
    and saturation of stomatal conductance with PAR, as described in Sellers (1985).
    This linearization is especially effective for plants that have a large LAI, such
    as conifers. The LAI of the Z. serrata in our study was small (2.1 in September
    2010), and it appears that the linear tendency in Pereira et al. (2007) did not
    depend strongly on LAI. One hypothesis is that 3-D radiation transfer in the crown
    affected the results; we will examine this in future studies. If one wants to
    keep ET maximum to obtain environmental benefits of Z. serrata, given that field
    capacity of the soil is 60% vol. and Z. serrata begins to close stomata around
    Ψ = −0.03 MPa (θ = 36.6% vol.), the Z. serrata can use at most 500 kg/container
    * (60.0–36.6)% = 117 kg water. Because daily ET on sunny days in the growing season
    was about 25–30 kg/day (Figure 5). it follows that the Z. serrata used the threshold
    amount in about 4–5 days at the longest, if there was no irrigation. Because the
    soil type and planter box volume of the Z. serrata were determined according to
    the general street tree in Japan as mentioned above, this estimation suggests
    that street trees without irrigation may experience frequent drought stress as
    reported in plant ecophysiology studies. It is often assumed in the study of forest
    transpiration in Japan that soil drought in the shallow layer is negligible (e.g.,
    Komatsu, Kang, Kume, Yoshifuji, & Hotta, 2006; Kosugi et al., 2007; Kumagai, Tateishi,
    Shimizu, & Otsuki, 2008), because deep roots and water supply from the water table
    facilitate a large available water capacity (Zhang, Dawes, & Walker, 2001). From
    our estimates, neglect of soil drought effects may be valid for street trees during
    the few days during and after rain, but it probably overestimates ET after four
    to five sunny days at the longest. The importance of the vertical root distribution
    for climatology and hydrology study is well known (Feddes et al., 2001), but,
    in general, the roots of street trees and container-grown trees grow uniformly
    compared with natural conditions (e.g., Gilman & Masters, 2010). On August 26,
    2010, we found that mean soil Ψ was below the wilting point (−2.5 MPa), but ET
    maintained ~50% of the amount on irrigated days (Figure 5; see also Fig. 6 of
    Asawa, Hoyano, Shimizu, et al., 2014, for diurnal change). This result indicates
    that to predict ET under soil drought conditions, the root distribution should
    be considered, even for the small and shallow soil used in the present study (0.5-m3
    and 50-cm depths). The time of water transport from soil to leaves is important
    when parameterizing stomatal conductance, because it causes strong bias, not only
    in the responses to atmospheric drivers but also in maximum conductance. This
    was discussed for 10- to 20-m-tall trees in other studies (Kumagai, Aoki, Otsuki,
    & Utsumi, 2009; Rayment, Loustau, & Jarvis, 2002; Ward, Bell, Clark, & Oren, 2012).
    Although the Z. serrata in our study was relatively small (6.4 m) and it is a
    ring-porous species with large conduits, root water uptake lagged ET by 40 min
    in 2012 (Figure 10). Using a steady-state hydraulic model (e.g., Buckley, 2005;
    Tuzet, Perrier, & Leuning, 2003) may be problematic in treating ET at less than
    hourly time scale. 5 CONCLUSIONS We propose a quality control protocol for continuous
    long-term lysimeter measurement and investigated whole-tree water balance of an
    isolated container-grown Z. serrata from 2010 to 2012, to acquire quantitative
    and process information of urban tree transpiration. We found time-series autocorrelation
    very important in observed weight data upon quantifying ET and its uncertainty,
    showing that our lysimeter method performed well throughout the 2-year study period.
    In response to the questions put in Section 1, (a) VPD was the most important
    factor among atmospheric drivers, and wind speed showed no clear correlation with
    daily ET. From an interannual comparison of diurnal ET and leaf area between 2010
    and 2012, we conclude that among biotic factors, leaf area is not the sole or
    primary factor that determines ET. These results suggest that we must consider
    the balance of leaf and root area for trees grown in small and shallow soil, such
    as street trees. (b) In warm periods, daily ET showed a linear response to daily
    Rs measured on a horizontal plane, suggesting the contribution of 3-D radiation
    transfer. For water balance, from our estimates, neglecting soil drought effects
    under no irrigation can overestimate ET after four to five sunny days at the longest,
    unlike prior studies of forest in Japan. When predicting soil drought effects,
    root area distribution should be considered, even for the small and shallow soil
    investigated herein (0.5-m3 and 50-cm depths). The delay of root water uptake
    with ET found in 2012 suggests that temporal resolution of the steady-state hydraulic
    model should be longer than 1 hr for studying trees of heights >6–7 m. Our findings
    depend somewhat on the growing conditions and species of the sample tree, so additional
    data are required to address general ET characteristics of urban trees. However,
    to our knowledge, this is the first report of interseasonal/interannual whole-tree
    water balance with urban, isolated, and small soil volume conditions. For measuring
    ET and parameterizing a stomatal conductance model of urban trees, the present
    findings will be valuable to determine which factors should be treated precisely
    and which can be simplified. One of the greatest differences between our experimental
    conditions and an actual urban area is the radiation environment. Urban trees
    are often shaded by surrounding buildings and receive long-wave radiation from
    them. Therefore, 3-D radiation environments should be considered when predicting
    ET in numerical simulations of urban microclimates (e.g., Asawa et al., 2008;
    Chen, Kusaka, et al., 2011), and when parameterizing stomatal conductance models
    using crown absorbed radiation. To this end, combining whole-tree transpiration
    and leaf area density measurements from laser scanning systems (LiDAR) is considered
    a promising approach. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Mr. Katsuya Shimizu (Toyota Biotechnology
    and Afforestation Laboratory) for arranging the measurements. This work was supported
    in part by a research grant from the Organization for Landscape and Urban Green
    Infrastructure. APPENDIX A ET estimation proceeded in the following manner. Divide
    the time-series data of W* into sufficiently short-duration records to address
    stomatal response, typically less than a half hour based on Vico, Manzoni, Palmroth,
    and Katul (2011). There is some arbitrariness associated with the purpose and
    accuracy of the apparatus. We believe the relative error of ET estimation should
    be less than ~20% to compare previous measurements based on other methods. Both
    the typical energy imbalance rate of eddy covariance and the coefficient of variation
    of stand-scale transpiration estimated from enough sample size sap flow sensors
    are considered to be ~20% (Kume et al., 2010; Wilson et al., 2002). Thus, we adopted
    20 min, N = 1200, to satisfy these criteria. Discard the records when Irr or precipitation
    was observed. For every record, fit linear regression lines using the least squares
    method to detrend and then estimate Neff from Equations 4 and 5, using the Yule–Walker
    method assuming Gaussian noise. Afterward, determine the centre values of W (here,
    Δt = 601 s) from regression lines and calculate SE of W from Neff and the residual
    sum of squares. Quantify ranges of diurnal patterns of ΔW for every month. Records
    that deviate by more than three interquartiles from the 75th or 25th percentile
    of the diurnal sequence are discarded as outliers. This three-interquartile rule
    is the same as Tukey''s box–whisker plot. Calculate higher moments, skewness,
    and kurtosis for every record from the residuals of regressions. Records for which
    residuals are markedly different from the Gaussian distribution are “flagged”
    (again, there is some arbitrariness; here, records for which the absolute value
    of skewness >1 or kurtosis >8 were flagged). The SE calculated in (c) can detect
    only noise for which lengths are less than one record, which is mainly from εw.
    In contrast, the higher moment test (e) tests the assumption of linearity (steady-state
    condition in a record) and the effect of low-frequency noise, which is mainly
    from D and EWC. The steady-state assumption is violated not only by noise but
    also by rapid change of stomatal aperture in a record. Therefore, we discarded
    continuous flagged records before and after rain or irrigation, and only flagged
    records under normal conditions. Calculate daily ET as the sum of ΔW of each record
    over a day. When discarded records constituted >20% of the day, daily ET was discarded.
    We did not interpolate discarded or missing records. REFERENCES Citing Literature
